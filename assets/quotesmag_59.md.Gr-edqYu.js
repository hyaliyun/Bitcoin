(in Latin) Birth and family Niccol√≤ Bonafede was born at (Monte) San Giusto in the diocese of Fermo in the March of Ancona c. 1464.Leopardi, p. 9 with note 1. He was fifty-six years old in 1520, from which the date of birth is calculated. The family of Niccol√≤ Bonafede was established in San Giusto by the late 14th century. His great-grandfather had been Podest√† of the town several times. Niccol√≤ was the son of Tommaso Bonafede and Giacoma de' Rasci. He had a brother, Pier Matteo Bonafede, and a son, Camillo.Matthew, pp. 185-186. Leopardi, p. 9. On Camillo, Niccol√≤ Bonafede's son: Matthew, p. 197. Because of a criminal prosecution laid against Tommaso by a malicious monk Gregory, Tommaso was able to form a relationshop with his judge, Cardinal Filippo Calandrini, the brother of Pope Nicholas V and papal Legate of the Marches (1449‚Äì1452). Through Calandrini he also enjoyed the patronage of the two Capranica cardinals, Domenico and Angelo.Leopardi, pp. 4-9. Education At the age of eighteen, young Niccol√≤ went to Rome, and enrolled at the Collegio Capranica, which had been founded by Cardinal Domenico Capranica, with free tuition for seven years for thirty-six students of philosophy, theology, and Canon Law. The students elected their own student rector, and Niccol√≤ was soon chosen for that post. He conducted a suit on behalf of the students against the Guardians of the Ospedale di San Giovanni, who were protectors of the Capranica, but engaged in maladministration and tyranny. During the proceedings he was introduced to Girolamo Calgrano, a Privy Chamberlain of Pope Innocent VIII (1484‚Äì1492), who brought him to the Pope where he was allowed to plead his case. Innocent was so impressed that he appointed Calgrano to hear the case officially and give summary judgment. An appeal was made by the Guardians, which was heard by Cardinal Piccolomini, and decided in favor of the Capranica.Leopardi, p. 10-12. Doctorate and early employment Due to the diseases prevalent in Rome, collectively called the mal aerea, Niccol√≤ transferred to the University of Perugia. A consideration in his decision might have been the vendetta murder carried out recently by his brother Pier Matteo. He obtained the degree of Doctor in utroque iure, and joined the college of consistorial advocates in the Roman Curia. In 1492, he obtained a post as Auditor of Pope Alexander VI's nephew, Juan Castellar, who was a Protonotary Apostolic. When Castellar became Archbishop of Trani in August 1493, Bonafede was sent to Trani as the Archbishop's Vicar General. He conducted his business with considerable severity, arousing the distaste of King Ferdinand. Niccol√≤ had to make the trip to Naples, seek an audience, and make his explanations. Ferdinand died on 24 January 1494, and Bonafede thought it best to leave the kingdom and take counsel with Castellar, who was also governor of PerugiaLeopardi, p. 14-24. Castellar was made a cardinal in 1503. In Perugia, Castellar was involved in a dispute with the Baglione family, and when they appealed to Rome, Castellar sent Niccol√≤ Bonafede to represent him before the Pope. Niccol√≤ was successful, and Pope Alexander was so taken with him that he decided to retain him in papal service, and appointed him a papal chamberlain (cubicularius) (1494). A few months later, Niccol√≤ submitted a petition, asking to be named to the papal chapel; instead, Pope Alexander named him a Protonotary Apostolic, and dispensed him from having to pay the usual fees.Leopardi, p. 25. At the beginning of 1496, Bonafede was appointed governor of the city of Tivoli. He entered Tivoli on 10 February, and remained there for around two years. His tenure was plagued by foreign soldiers, as well as troops of the Orsini and of the Colonna. The Orsini made war against the Pope, and in January 1497 captured Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino and captain general of the papal army. Bonafede led a troop of fifty cavalry against the Orsini properties around Vicovaro in punishment. Pope Alexander was so delighted that he appointed Niccol√≤ his ambassador to Venice.Leopardi, pp. 27-28. Matthew, p. 186. Bonafede arrived in Venice on 3 January 1498, and remained there for twelve months, to the satisfaction of both the Signoria of the Serene Republic and Pope Alexander VI, no easy task. After a short rest and recuperation in his native land, he returned to Rome, where he was immediately assigned, on 15 January 1499, to be governor of Benevento, which was being attacked and subverted by agents of King Ferdinando of Naples. He arrived there on 11 February 1499, and held the position until mid-1501. Leopardi, pp. 28-32. He was not actually in Benevento for long. In the late summer of 1499, Pope Alexander decided to take advantage of the troubles in Lombardy brought about by the expulsion of Ludovico Sforza from Milan, and the invasion of King Louis XII of France to aid the Milanese against him, but also because Louis intended to pursue his family's claims to the crown of Naples. To assist Cesare Borgia in the Pope's plan to reclaim the Duchy of Urbino and the lordship of Camerino, Bonafede was summoned to become Commissary General of the papal forces. After the surrender of Camerino in July 1502, Cesare, with a papal mandate, appointed Bonafede governor of Forl√¨ (1502‚Äì1503).Leopardi, pp. 32-37. In a meeting with the Pope and Cesare in July 1503, the Pope decided to name Niccol√≤ governor of Siena and Commissary General of all papal troops in Italy, and, when the Bishop of Pesaro died, the Pope proposed giving Bonafede the bishopric. Unfortunately, Pope Alexander died on 18 August 1503, nullifying all these arrangements.Leopardi, pp. 43-44. New pope, new patron Cesare Borgia was left to defend the interests of the family and his own position, as well as to produce a new pope who would be friendly to the Spanish cause. He was, however, stricken by the same malady, said to have been poison (by Guicciardini and others) but more likely to have been malaria, and was prostrate, rather that abroad and active. Bonafede counselled withdrawal from Rome, to avoid being trapped by the troops of both the Orsini and the Colonna; but Cesare was unwilling, and Bonafede became a negotiator with the Spanish cardinals and other potential supporters.Leopardi, pp. 47-54. John Paul Adams, \\"Sede Vacante 1503, I\\"; retrieved: 23 December 2019. In the Conclave which followed, Bonafede participated as a conclavist of Cardinal Francesco de Loris, the Archbishop of Constantinople.Leopardi, pp. 54-56. He is said to have worked to assemble the votes which eventually elected Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini.Matthew, p. 188, note 20. The new Pope, Pius III, elected on 22 September 1503, was quite familiar with Niccol√≤. Eight days after his election, he summoned Bonafede, and praised him highly for his conduct in his various appointments.Leopardi, p. 56: \\"il Papa fece chiamare messer Niccol√≤ ricevendolo con larghe dimostrazioni di benevolenza , e dettogli ricordarsi le diligenze e cure adoperate da lui , e li partiti inventati per alzarlo al papato , aggiunse non ignorare come a tempi di papa Alessandro avesse governato integerrimamente citt√† , provincie e genti d' armi della Sedia Apostolica, senza darsi a fazioni, lordarsi con le simon√¨e , o farsi tacciare per gli altri vizii diffusi e pregiati in quel tempo. He then announced that he intended to appoint him Governor of Rome. Unfortunately, Pius III died on 18 October 1503, after only twenty-six days in office, and all appointments lapsed. During the Conclave of October 1503, the Governor of the City was Johannes de Sacchis, Bishop of Ragusa (1490-1505). High offices In the second conclave, on 1 November 1503, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere was elected Pope Julius II by acclamation. On 19 November Cesare Borgia left Rome permanently, heading for France. Three weeks after his election, on 21 November, Pope Julius named Niccol√≤ Bonafede Vice-Chamberlain and Governor of Rome. =Governor of Rome= He was Vice-Chamberlain of the Apostolic Camera (Treasury) and governor of the city of Rome from 21 November 1503 to April 1505. His first large project was to disarm the violent part of the population of the city. Pope Julius predicted that he would fail, if only because of the lack of cooperation of the cardinals and nobles, many of whom kept small armies of retainers. Bonafede persisted, sending more than 200 offenders to prison, and 300 to the galleys, but his project came to nothing.Leopardi, pp. 61-64. =Bishop of Chiusi= On 20 June 1504, Niccol√≤ Bonafede was appointed Bishop of Chiusi by Pope Julius II.Even his biography by Leopardi, based apparently on autobiographical material, fails to mention his ordination as a priest or consecration as a bishop. The office was greatly desired by Cardinal Pietro Isvalies, Archbishop of Reggio Calabria, for one of his familiars, and he offered the exchange of one of his benefices in the Roman Curia. But Pope Julius paid no attention.Leopardi, p. 78. Eubel III, p. 171. Eubel remarks in note 3 that 20 June was the date on which Bonafede paid his fees for his bulls. Bishop Bonifacio had died on 17 June. At the same time, Julius granted Bonafede full possession of the parish church of S. Maria in Telusiano in Niccol√≤'s home town of San Giusto.Matthew, p. 188. He continued to work in Rome however. The strain of the heavy work load of a conscious man began to undermine Niccol√≤'s health. His constant fatigue led to sciatica, and he developed \\"podagra\\" (gout) in his knees. For four months he was unable to carry out the duties of his office, as the principal administrator and civil judge of the city, as the second highest official of the Apostolic Treasury, after the Cardinal Camerlengo, and as a regular attendant and advisor at papal consistories. His doctors predicted he would live only six months if he stayed in Rome. With papal consent, and by his own agreement, he retired from Rome to Chiusi, where it took him eight months to recover his health.Leopardi, p. 86. When Pope Julius heard of his recovery, he summoned him to Rome, and in 1506 appointed him governor of Forl√¨. Bonafede resisted going, but Julius eventually compelled him. He was paid 100 ducats in gold per month for his salary, and, before departing, obtained permission from the Pope to read all his papers concerning Forl√¨ so that he could understand the Pope's wishes and goals. On arrival in Forl√¨, his first action was to give armed men four days to leave the city. He also recalled exiles. He then began dealing with political troublemakers, followers as well as opponents of the Pope. Julius was incensed, and the Cardinal of Pavia, Francesco Alidosi, quickly wrote Niccol√≤ a folio-length letter in his own hand advising Bonafede to capitulate to the Pope's wishes and try to placate him. Julius was persuaded to appoint him Commissary General for his Bolognese campaign, and replace him in Forl√¨ with the Bishop of Amelia, Giustiniano de' Moriconi. Bonafede returned to RomeLeopardi, p. 86-90. =Bologna= During the Bolognese campaign Bonafede accompanied the Pope to Orvieto, then to Perugia, and then into the Romagna to Imola. As one Bolognese fortress after another fell to papal troops, led by the Duke of Urbino, the Bentivogli evacuated Bologna and the Pope and Bonafede entered the city on 11 November 1506.Leopardi, p. 95. Matthew, p. 193. In February 1507, Pope Julius went off to Imola to inspect its fortifications; he arrived there on 22 February. Niccol√≤ followed along, and in an interview managed to persuade the Pope (who wanted him to serve as Vice-Legate of Bologna) to allow him to return home to San Giusto. He spent a year there working on the building of his family palace, and then returned to his diocese of Chiusi.Leopardi, pp. 96-97. In September 1510, Pope Julius decided to deal with the Duke of Ferrara, an ally of the French, who was in occupation of territory in the Romagna which the Pope considered as belonging to the Roman Church. In addition, Duke Alfonso was attempting to seize territory from Bologna. Pope Julius sent word to Bonafede to meet him in Bologna, where he arrived on 22 September. Julius immediately appointed Niccol√≤ governor of Modena, where he was challenged by the forces of Marc'Antonio Colonna, who was in the service of Milan. The Pope sent the Duke of Urbino and papal forces to repel the incursion. The commissaries of the papal army, however, were little better than robbers, and managed to alienate the angry population from the papal cause. Bonafede had the Pope replace the papal officials. He himself caught one of the debilitating fevers that infected most armies of the time. Bonafede held the governorship for six months.Leopardi, pp. 97-102. Since the Cardinal of Pavia, who was Legate of Bologna, was politically unreliable and a notable simoniac, Pope Julius intended to take him with him back to Rome, leaving Niccol√≤ Bonafede as governor of Bologna and Governor General of the entire Romagna. When Julius moved to Ravenna, on 23 May 1511,When Julius went to Ravenna, Alidosi, with the help of supporters of the Bentivogli, escaped from the surveillance of Bonafede and left Bologna on 20 May 1511. He went to Ravenna, to try to talk his way out of his predicament, but was assassinated on 24 May. the French commander Giacomo Trivulzio entered Bologna. An intense debate immediately ensued among the Bolognese, as to whether to turn over the Governor, Niccol√¥ Bonafede. After two days, the French withdrew from Bologna without any resolution of the situation, and two days after that Bonafede was restored to his governorship by the Bolognese. When King Louis XII arrived in the neighborhood of Bologna, several of Bonafede's friends among the cardinals advised him to flee the city, but he refused, pointing out that the Bolognese had taken great risks to save him from Trivulzio, and stealing away would be a serious mistake; only if he were promoted to a high office in Rome could he depart, something Julius was not prepared to do; Bonafede then demanded instead to be reconfirmed as governor.Leopardi, pp. 102-113. The Pope then wrote to Bonafede, ordering him to leave Bologna under threat of suspension from his benefices. After some recriminations between Bonafede, the papal Legate, and the government of Bologna, Bonafede obeyed. He returned to his home in San Giusto.Leopardi, pp. 113-115. Pope Julius II died on 21 February 1513. =San Giusto= In 1513, Niccol√≤ completed a palace which he had been building since before 1504 in San Giusto. The principal fa√ßade has an inscription, \\"Nicol√≤ Bonafede, Distinguished and Experienced Man, Bishop of Chiusi, having discharged with great distinction military missions for the Apostolic See, most recently against the French, and the governorship of a great many provinces [including] Bologna and Rome, has erected this house for his own repose and for the advantage of [his] descendants, and having demolished the little dwellings, he decorated [the palace] with attractive brickwork in the distinguished piazza, 23 October 1513.Matthew, p. 192, with note 31. In 1519, Bonafede was recalled by Pope Leo X from his retirement in San Giusto, on the advice of Cardinal Giuliano de'Medici, Cardinal Francesco Armellino the Legate of the Marches, and others, and again named Commissary General of the papal army in the Marches.Leopardi, pp. 115-120. On 20 March 1520, his forces killed Ludovico Euffreducci (Freduccio), the tyrant of Fermo.Leopardi, pp. 123-163. Matthew, p. 193. During his administration he reformed the governments of Fermo, Loreto, Osimo, and Ascoli. His actions, however, were looked on jealously by the Orsini faction, who had been supporters of Ludovico Euffreducci, and with the assistance of the Pope's sister, they determined to end Bonafede's tenure, and replace him with the bishop of Rimini, Fabio Cerri. Bonafede was summoned to Rome for \\"consultations' with the Pope, and the Bishop of Rimini, Vice-Legate of the March took over his functions. After a welcoming interview, Niccol√≤ heard nothing from the Pope for the next ten days. A second interview brought complements, but also a narration of the complaints of the Orsini faction. Three days later, Bonafede left Rome for Florence, to consult with Cardinal de'Medici. Bonafede was finally offered the commission of reforming Perugia. When this was completed, he visited the shrine of Loreto and then returned home.Leopardi, pp. 176-184. In 1523‚Äì1524,Guicciardini, who was Bonafede's successor in the posts, makes the dates from September 1523 to April 1524. Bishop Bonafede was employed by Pope Adrian VI as Vice-Legate of the Marches and the Romandiola, in recovering territory in the Marches from the aggressive Pandolfo Malatesta, whom he defeated in battle. He proudly commemorated the achievement in an inscription on his palace in San Giusto.Matthew, p. 192 (who makes the dates 1522‚Äì1523), with note 32: \\"Nicol√¥ Bonafede, Bishop of Chiusi, Vice Legate of the Marches and the Romagna, [while] discharging the post of Captain General drove the tyrants from Rimini and restored [it] to the Apostolic See, erected the 13th day of August 1524.\\" Niccol√≤ Bonafede died in San Giusto on 6 January 1534 (which was still the year 1533 in calendars that counted March 25 as New Year's Day.) He was buried in his church of S. Maria della Piet√† in San Giusto, in a tomb which he himself had erected.Leopardi, p. 193, quoting from Pietro Bongiovanni. In the \\"Crucifixion\\" of Lorenzo Lotto (1531), which was commissioned by Bishop Bonafede and which hangs in the church of S. Maria in Monte San Giusto, the bishop is depicted kneeling at the lower left.  References  Books and articles Matthew, Louisa C.

The boats were built by Corsair Marine in the United States but are now out of production. The F-31 is the production development of the Farrier F-9, which were built by custom shops in small numbers and by amateur builders from plans. The first F-9 prototype was launched on 29 September 1991. Design F-31 F-31 Corsair F31 with its outriggers folded The F-31 is a small recreational trimaran, built predominantly of fiberglass. The hull is constructed with a rigid PVC foam core, vacuum bagged to the skins, while the structural beams are reinforced with carbon fiber. It has a fractional sloop rig, a plumb stem, a reverse transom, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable daggerboard, mounted at 18¬∞, with the daggerboard trunk stepping the mast. The outrigger floats are folding for storage or ground transportation on a trailer, with a maximum width of under eight feet for highway transport. The outrigger floats fold into cutouts in the lower hull to reduce trailering width. When deployed the outriggers are set at a fixed 8¬∞ to the hull, so that they are upright and thus symmetrical, when each is in the water. Due to the employment of a daggerboard, the design can easily be beached. The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor of typically for docking and maneuvering. Operational history In 1992 the F-31 was named the Australian Sailboat of the Year. In April 1992 Fred Gan's F-31 Ostac Triumph won the bi-annual Australian Offshore Multihull Championships. In the associated Brisbane to Gladstone Ocean Race, Bobsled, a 67-foot, million dollar, racing monohull boat, sponsored by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, made headlines in breaking the monohull record by an impressive hour and a half. The trailerable F-31 caught and passed Bobsled, finishing an hour and fifteen minutes ahead. In a 2000 review, writer Bob Perry of Sailing Magazine wrote of the F-31, \\"In looking at the accommodations, it would be better not to compare this design to a monohull with a similar LOA but, instead, to compare displacements. There is no question that the 31-foot Farrier tri has less interior volume than a standard 31-foot monohull, but you cannot trail[er] most 31-foot monohulls. The F-31 has comfortable accommodations for two couples, and boat speed that will blow the doors off a 31-foot monohull...Ian designs handsome boats. The F-31 is no exception... Just be aware that this 31-footer is capable of sailing with some big monohulls.\\" Variants ;F-9A :The initial F-9, designed for amateur construction from plans. More than 300 completed. ;F-9AX :A version of the F-9A with expanded interior space, with a 15% wider center hull for more room and a 16% higher load capacity.

Theatre Ventures was a musical adaptation of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles entitled Lestat which entered development in 2003 and opened in 2006. History Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures was founded in May 2003 by Gregg Maday, to focus on making stage adaptations of the Warner Bros. film library. Warner Bros. had considered creating a division to produce live stage shows after witnessing Disney's success with bringing Beauty and the Beast to Broadway. Maday brought in Broadway producer Emanuel Azenberg as a consultant, and the first production they started working on was one about Batman. The music was written by Jim Steinman, with a book by David Ives, originally Tim Burton expressed interest in directing the Broadway show. But after Dance of the Vampires by Steinman and Ives flopped on Broadway, Warner Bros. pulled the plug on the Batman musical. Warner Bros. received an offer from Linda Woolverton and Robert Jess Roth, the writer and director of Beauty and the Beast musical. The two of them wanted to work with songwriters Elton John, and Bernie Taupin on a new musical based Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. ‚ÄúWhen you are starting something, and you get offered the two people who had worked on Beauty and the Beast, Elton John and Bernie Taupin on their first Broadway partnership, and Anne Rice, who has extraordinary success as a novelist, as package, it was really difficult to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to that, even if I wanted to,‚Äù Maday explained.

The regiment was formed in Delaware in late 1862 with a 90-day term of enlistment. According to the regiment's service terms, the men of the regiment would continue their civilian occupations, drilling twice a week, until called upon for active duty; they would not be paid until they entered active service. The regiment completed formation on December 18, 1862, but would not be called into active service until June 27, 1863 under the command of Colonel Edwin Wilmer. While on active service, the regiment guarded a railroad in Maryland and also guarded prisoners of war at Fort Delaware. By August 23, all but one of the regiment's companies had been mustered out of service; the final one, Company I, ended its service on September 5.  History  Fort Delaware, where the regiment was stationed in mid-1863 During the middle of 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued a request for 300,000 men to join the Union Army as 90-day volunteers. Later that year, the 5th Delaware Infantry Regiment and the 6th Delaware Infantry Regiment began forming in answer to this call. As allowed by the terms of service for the regiments, the men would remain in their civilian occupations until they were needed for active service; the men drilled twice a week, although they would only be paid while they were mobilized for active duty. On October 25, the 6th's Company A was formed, with Edwin Wilmer as the company's captain. Much of the regimental organization was done by lawyer Jacob Moore, although Wilmer also participated. Organization was completed on December 18 the date that Company I completed formation. Initially, the ten companies of the 6th Delaware, designated with the letters AI and K, were attached to the 5th Delaware, but were split off to form a separate regiment by order of William Cannon, Governor of Delaware, on June 27, 1863. Wilmer was appointed the new regiment's colonel, Moore the lieutenant colonel, and Thomas P. Thurlow was major. The 877 men and 42 officers of the regiment entered active service that same day. After mobilizing, the regiment was sent to Havre de Grace, Maryland, where it guarded the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad near the Susquehanna River. While at Havre de Grace, the regiment was part of the 8th Corps within the Middle Department. The regiment had been mobilized in part due to a perceived threat to the region, and also to guard an influx of prisoners of war that had arrived at Fort Delaware. The 5th Delaware had also been activated to perform the same duties; between the two regiments, 1,500 men guarded the railroad and 400 were sent to Fort Delaware. Besides Havre de Grace, the 6th Delaware also guarded the railroad at the Bush and Back Rivers and the Maryland towns of Gunpowder and Perrymansville.

The first Hard Rock Casino game, developed by MumboJumbo and published by Jamdat Mobile for Microsoft Windows, was released in the United States in 2003. The game was subsequently published by MacPlay for Macintosh in the United States, in January 2004. Later in 2004, Jamdat Mobile developed and published a version for mobile phones in the United States. In July 2005, Crave Entertainment announced an agreement with Hard Rock International to create Hard Rock Casino video games. FarSight Studios developed Hard Rock Casino for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), and Crave Entertainment published the game in the United States on November 28, 2006. FarSight Studios also developed a version for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), which Crave Entertainment released in April 2007, in North America. In Europe, the PlayStation versions were published by Oxygen Games during the same month. The PlayStation versions of Hard Rock Casino received generally negative reviews, according to Metacritic. Gameplay The computer versions of Hard Rock Casino include blackjack, craps, keno, and poker. The mobile version starts the player off with $5,000, and includes three casino games: blackjack, poker, and a slot machine. The PlayStation versions feature four casinos and 22 casino games, including slot machines, poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, pai gow, Let It Ride and Casino War. The player is given body type and clothing options to create a customized player character. The game includes a story mode in which the player tries to win enough money to gamble at high roller casinos. To progress through the story mode, the player must play and win the various gambling games to advance from one casino to the next casino. The PSP version includes a wireless multiplayer option. Reception The PlayStation versions of Hard Rock Casino received generally unfavorable reviews, according to Metacritic. Reviewers criticized the PlayStation versions for their simple gambling games and repetitive gameplay, with Rob Fahey of Eurogamer stating that none of the games were \\"particularly fun to play.\\" Reviewers noted that some of the games were played by pushing a single button. Reviewers also criticized the gambling games' graphical user interface, with some comparing it to a flash game. IGN's Chris Roper, reviewing the PlayStation versions, called the game a \\"poor attempt at a decent idea.\\" Roper stated that the \\"biggest problem\\" with the game was the lack of instructions in the manual and the in-game career mode; instructions are instead accessed from the game's main menu. Mark Walbank of Pocket Gamer, reviewing the PSP version, stated that the game could not match the feeling of a real casino and \\"as a consequence it all feels rather flat and functional.\\" Louis Bedigian of GameZone praised the graphics of the PSP version and wrote that it \\"is presented and implemented more efficiently than any other casino game collection,\\" while noting that the casino games were \\"simple, random fun\\" and \\"the replay value is higher than any standalone poker game.\\" Levi Buchanan of IGN praised the graphics of the mobile version, but stated that there were better versions of each gambling game available elsewhere. Carrie Venetia of GameSpot reviewed the mobile version and was disappointed by the minimal casino sound effects, and wrote that the game \\"is a wonderful value, but it's also very straightforward,\\" stating that it \\"won't surprise or impress in any way.\\" References External links * Hard Rock Casino (computer versions) at MobyGames * Hard Rock Casino (PlayStation versions) at MobyGames Category:Casino video games Category:Crave Entertainment games Category:FarSight Studios games Category:MumboJumbo games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Mac OS games Category:2003 video games Category:2004 video games Category:2006 video games ","title":"Hard Rock Casino (video game)"},{"id":"57995949","text":"In biology, carbon source refers to the molecules used by an organism as the source of carbon for building its biomass.

Global Gaming operates under the License No. 1668/JAZ issued to its subsidiary ELEC GAMES N.V. by Cura√ßao eGaming, Authorized and Regulated by the Government of Cura√ßao. In 2016, Global Gaming introduced its proprietary PayNPlay system for its Ninja Casino brand. PayNPlay allows players to deposit and play on the site's casino platform without the need to register for an account or provide any personal information. PayNPlay has since been made available for the group's SpelLandet brand, becoming the first Global Gaming Group brand featuring this technology to be licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).

The site remains without a license. 12 November 2019, Global Gaming's appeal against the revocation of the license has been rejected by the Swedish Administrative Court.

The Bethel- Christian Avenue-Laurel Hill District on Long Island's north shore has roots back to the 1600s, when displaced African-American slaves and Native Americans from the Setalcott tribe settled in the area. The historical district includes Bethel AME Church and the Laurel Hill Cemetery. Early History leftthumb Colonists from New England purchased land in 1655 from the Setalcott Indians and began peaceably living there at what was then a 'tract of land extending from Stony Brook to and including Port Jefferson'. During the revolutionary war the Setalket harbor was across Long Island Sound from Fairfield, Conn. The British had consolidated their hold on New York City and Long Island during the winter months of early 1777, while the Continental Army established a land blockade around the city in New Jersey, southern New York, and southwestern Connecticut. On the night of August 21, Colonel Samuel Blachley Webb and his regiment set out across Long Island Sound in whaleboats, taking a few small brass cannons. Early the next morning they landed at Crane's Neck (in present- day Old Field, just west of Setauket), and marched to Setauket. The resulting battle ended when the Minutemen could not breach the breastworks around the Presbyterian meeting house and they retreated across the sound with a few dozen trophy horses and some quilts.Hall, Charles S (1905). Letters and Life of Samuel Holden Parsons. Binghamton, NY: Otseningo Publishing Co. OCLC 2603857. An 1853 document states that in the year 1815, slave owners Isaac Satterly and Benjamin F. Thompson took legal action to designate land along Christian Avenue, in Setauket, as a cemetery for people of color. This site is still known as Laurel Hill Cemetery, which has been under the trusteeship of Bethel AME Church since 1871. In 1848 A tract of land was deeded to the Bethel AME, for the site of the original church, which was destroyed by fire in 1871. Old Bethel Cemetery on Christian Avenue in Stony Brook was the location of the first Bethel AME Church in the area. This deed provided 1/8th acre of land to the church board for a church. A line of stones laying on the ground behind the front of a line of gravestones marks the building's original foundation. The church moved to the current location in 1871 and the new church was built in 1874. It was also in 1871 that the trustees took control of the Laurel Hill Cemetery. The new church was destroyed by fire in 1909 but was quickly rebuilt. Setalcott Indians Preservations acknowledged the area is one of the last remaining intact communities that represents the African-American and Native American population on Long Island. MAP ‚Äì BCALH The indigenous Setalcott Native American tribe were in Setalket when Europeans first landed. The sachems Warawakmy and Mahue gave permission for land use to the whites, who subsequently brought African slaves to the Town of Brookhaven about the year 1670. Subsequent generations of Setalcotts and Africans intermarried, the Harts and the Sells, Eato, Lewis, Edwards, Phillips, Scott, Green, Seaman, Young, and Tobias families forming a blend of natives and blacks. Most found work as servants and laborers, the population was organized, economically stable, and has persisted into the present. They were prohibited at the time from living elsewhere in the district and the pastoral guidance of the church created a community separate from the whites. LongislandThe BCALH historic district was designated in 2005 and is an attempt at preserving the history and culture of the people still living in that area. The Christian Avenue community is a 'distinct and indigenous way of life that has survived in Setauket for centuries'. Threatened in 2007 a community group was formed to get further recognition for the area, aided by preservationists and archeologists at Stony Brook University the documentation needed for its survival was archived and catalogued. The districts predominantly Native and African American homes were not included in any of the Three Village historic districts and was not protected by any preservation laws.http://www.3villagecsd.k12.ny.us/Elementary/minnesauke/3villagehist/projinfo.htm Setauket gentrified in the late 20th century, and some homes have been sold and demolished. They are removed from historical memory and subsequently excluded from the historic preservation measures that protect other sites in Old Setauket, the presence of the minority community gets smaller with each decade.http://www.saa.org/CurrentResearch/pdf/saa_cro_277_A_CounterMap_of_Setauket,.pdf The active efforts by community members, local school groups and college students culminated in the historical preservation project called- 'A Long Time Coming'. The goals were to help BCALH resist a common trend of historic minority community displacements across the United States by tax increases and gentrification which caused them to be pushed out from where they have been for generations. During the period from 1867 to 1960 there were three 'eras' to the community which was then known as Chicken Hill, a one square mile patch of Christian Ave with the A.M.E. Church as the hub. At one point the multi- ethnic blend of Native Americans, African-Americans, Eastern and Western European immigrants made it one of the most diverse communities on Long Island. The presence of the Piano factory which later became the rubber factory led to the employment of the largest labor force in Suffolk county at Brookhaven Rubber Company, consisting mainly of Irish and other European immigrant transplants from the lower east side.https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6a2f82_5cab53072cf04f6a81160fb2db9eccfe.pdf?index=true Developments include the Christian Avenue School ‚Äì Original buildings dating back from earlier part of the century which were used for Kindergarten and 1st grade before closing in late 1970s. They were demolished and redeveloped as residential homes in the 1990s. The BCALH historic district stood out from other sites in Long Island because it recognized both the historic and the cultural significance of the blended Native and African American community. The district includes the Laurel Hill cemetery, the church, an American Legion building and 30 homes.http://wshu.org/post/setauket-s-mixed-heritage- community-seeks-national-recognition The Setalcott tribe is not recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) due to the size of the remaining tribe members and their self-identification.

The Rev David Eato's House is located in BCALH's District and is currently owned by the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church and was proposed to be restored by the society. Eato, one of the church's first pastors, and his wife Mary Baker, a freed slave from the south lived there until the 1930s. Bethel AME historian, Carlton \\"Hub\\" Edwards, said when Mary moved to the North after being freed from slavery she settled in Port Washington where she was an organist at a church. It was there that she met Eato and, after marrying, the couple moved to Setauket and the reverend became one of the first ministers of Setauket's Bethel AME in the early 1900s. Mary took on the role of superintendent of the Sunday school and held the position until the late 1930s.

It has been held annually during the last weekend of July since 1972. Each year between 15,000 and 20,000 people attend the event over the course of the three days that it is held. The event's sponsoring organization is Carbondale Arts, a non-profit organization supporting the arts in Carbondale.  History  Mountain Fair was started by Laurie Loeb as part of Colorado's state Chautauqua in 1972. Booth displays included Native American weavings and local Boy Scouts sold seed and corn necklaces. Thomas Lawley, considered the earliest director of the fair, held the position for 17 years. The current director of the fair is Amy Kimberly, who has had the position since 2004. She is also the executive director of Carbondale Arts. Over the years, the event has grown in size and popularity.  Events  Mountain Fair has many contests and competitions, such as the Wood Splitting Competition, Limbo Contest and Fly-Casting Competition which are held each year. There are also two contests for Pie and Cake Baking. For many years the Dance of the Sacred Fire was held at night annually. In 2018 however, due to stage 2 fire restrictions in the area, there was no fire involved in the dance and aerialists performed instead. Since then it has no longer been held.The gazebo where live music and some entertainment happens at Mountain Fair One of the first events held at Mountain Fair each year is the Rhythm of the Heart Community Drum Circle. It has been led by Laurie Loeb for more than ten years and has more than 400 participants each year. The event also features many musicians and musical groups, many of which are local to the area around Carbondale. Some local acts include Kan'Nal who performed in 2005 and Elephant Revival who performed in 2011 which are both Colorado based bands.

Raised in response to the Confederate cavalry raid into Maryland in mid-1864, the regiment guarded railroad bridges and garrisoned the Baltimore defenses during its month of service.  History  The 7th Delaware Infantry Regiment was organized at Wilmington, Delaware for 30 days emergency service on 12 July 1864, in response to Confederate cavalry commander Jubal Early's raid into Maryland and the Union defeat at the Battle of Monocacy, to guard the approaches to Wilmington. Recruiting for the regiment began on 11 July, when Delaware Governor William Cannon issued a proclamation calling for a thirty day regiment to protect the railroads at the request of Wallace. 300 volunteers were recruited from southern Delaware by Provost Marshal Edwin Wilmer who made impassioned speeches from a special train, urging able-bodied men to leave their work and return to Wilmington aboard the train. The 7th Delaware was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later Colonel) Edgar Hounsfield, and numbered 33 officers and 945 men. The regimental major, Hugh Sterling, received his position due to his leadership in a skirmish at Gunpowder Ridge, and later formed Sterling's Infantry Company. It was attached to the 3rd Separate Brigade of VIII Corps in the Middle Department, guarding the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad at Havre de Grace and Oconowingo Bridge until 16 July, when it moved to Baltimore and took positions in the defenses of that city. Three men of the regiment died of disease before it returned to Wilmington on 11 August, where it mustered out at the end of its term on the next day. As it marched through the streets of Wilmington to Camp Smithers, the regiment was eagerly welcomed by the populace and the bell of the city hall was rung.

In 2018, having previously been an actor, she became the first black British female playwright to have a play staged in the West End.  Life  Natasha Gordon was born in North London in 1976, to parents who were both migrants from Jamaica. Her grandparents had arrived in London from Jamaica by boat as part of the so-called Windrush generation in the late 1950s. Her mother joined them in 1963, finding work, a Jamaican-born husband and a reassuringly familiar West Indian community there. Gordon's debut play Nine Night premiered at London's National Theatre in April 2018 to critical acclaim transferring seven months later to London's Trafalgar Studios on 1 December. The transfer marks a pivotal moment in history as Gordon will become the first black British female playwright to have a play in the West End. In a Guardian newspaper profile on her, Gordon explains that the \\"nine night\\" ritual of gathering to eat, drink and swap stories helped her to connect with her family‚Äôs past and inspired her first play. She also cites the recent deportation threats experienced by many of the Windrush generation as fuel for her to learn more about the difficulties her grandparents faced. The play resulted in Gordon winning the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards Charles Wintour Award for Most Promising Playwright in 2018. As an actor, her stage credits include Red Velvet (Tricycle Theatre), The Low Road and Clubland (Royal Court Theatre), Mules (Young Vic) and As You Like It (Royal Shakespeare Company). Her film and TV credits include Dough, Line of Duty, Class and Danny and the Human Zoo.

The original wooden fort was built on a hill looking over the mouth of the Cayenne River in 1643. Over the years that followed the French temporarily lost the site to the Dutch, English and Portuguese. The fort was torn down and rebuilt several times. Between 1689 and 1693 the whole town of Cayenne, including the fort, was surrounded by a classic line of fortifications by Vauban. The town was occupied by the Portuguese during the Napoleonic wars between 1809 to 1817 and Vauban's fortifications were destroyed, as were the bastions of the fort. Little remains of the fort today. Location The remains of Fort C√©p√©rou are at the western edge of the present city of Cayenne, French Guiana. A map from 1769 shows the fort and town in the north west of the Island of Cayenne, which lies on the Atlantic coast of Guiana between the mouths of the Cayenne and Mahury rivers, with a channel connecting the two rivers and separating the island from the coast. The fort is located on Mont C√©p√©rou, with a panoramic view over the land, the sea and the entrance to the Cayenne River. The fort was first named Fort C√©p√©rou, then Fort Saint Michel and then Fort Saint Louis before returning to its original name. The town of Cayenne grew around the protective walls of the fort. History =Background (1604‚Äì34)= In 1604 Captain Daniel de La Touche, seigneur de la Ravardi√®re, was the first Frenchman to make a serious reconnaissance of what would become French Guiana, originally called Equinoctial France (France √©quinoxiale). The Spanish and Portuguese had not settled this section of the coast, although it was thought to lead to the land of El Dorado. Between 1616 and 1626 Dutch colonies were founded on the estuaries of the Essequibo, Berbice and Demerara rivers. In 1630 the English settled at the mouth of the Suriname River. In 1626 Cardinal Richelieu authorized colonization of Guiana. In 1630 Constant d'Aubign√© ordered a colony to be installed on the shores of the Sinnamary. Captain Bontemps was tasked with colonizing the new territories with 1,200 French people. =First settlement (1634‚Äì45)= An official government memoir written after 1765 says that \\"establishments were made at Cayenne itself in 1634 and 1636 where a fort was built near the western extremity of the island, at the mouth where the river formed the port, and above the fort, a town which has remained the capital of the colony.\\" Another source says that in 1638 merchants from Rouen built the first fort on the northwestern shore of the island of Cayenne. In 1643 Charles Poncet de Br√©tigny of the Compagnie du Cap du Nord, or Compagnie de Rouen(fr), arrived with 400 settlers. He bought the hill at the mouth of the Cayenne River from the local Kalina people (Caribs) and named it \\"Morne C√©p√©rou\\" after the Kalina chief who sold it. The first wooden Fort C√©p√©rou was built on the hill, and a village was built below it. Bretigny was ruthless and despotic, and terrorized both the colonists and the indigenous people. He persecuted and enslaved the Kalinas, who responded by revolting and slaughtering many of the colonists. In 1644 a Carib killed Bretigny with an axe to the head. Twenty-five Frenchmen survived, but none left Guiana alive. =Fresh settlement attempts (1652‚Äì76)= 1769 map of Cayenne Island and the fort (inset) In September 1652 the twelve seigneurs of the Compagnie de la France √©quinoxiale landed 800 men at the tip of the Pointe du Mahury, where they found the 25 survivors of the Compagnie de Rouen. Jean de Laon, a king' engineer, replaced the wooden walls of the fort with a stone bastion called Fort Saint Michel. The purpose was to guard against attacks from the Caribs across the river, and attacks by the English and Dutch. All of the settlers had soon been killed by the Caribs or had escaped to Barbados. Guerin Spranger obtained a grant from the States General of the Netherlands and established a Dutch colony on Cayenne Island around 1656. By 1660 there were no Frenchmen left in Guiana. In 1664 Jean-Baptiste Colbert sent a force of 1,200 to recapture Cayenne from the Dutch. The town was rebuilt with 200 huts, and had 350 French settlers and 50 slaves. In 1666 the English commanded by Captain Peter Wroth visited the colony of Cayenne but did not harm the governor Cyprien Lefebvre de L√©zy. Cayenne was looted by the British under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman in August 1667. The English destroyed the fort and the town of Cayenne. After they left, from December 1667 the Jesuit father Jean Morellet was the de facto governor until the new governor Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre arrived. The Dutch vice admiral Jacob Binckes arrived at Cayenne on 4 May 1676 and landed 900 troops near Fort Saint Louis (Fort C√©p√©rou) the next day. Lefebvre soon surrendered. Binckes left shortly after for Marie-Galante and Tobago, leaving a small force to hold Cayenne. On 18 December 1676 French troops under vice-admiral Jean II d'Estr√©es took the city back from the Dutch. After this the colony was French until the time of Napoleon, but it failed to prosper. In 1685 the total population of colonists and slaves was just 1,682. =Zenith and decline= Renovated pagoda in 2017 A 1677 map, still using the Dutch name of Bourg Louis, shows a watchtower, some small batteries and a miniature star-shaped fort on Morne C√©p√©rou. A report that year says the small (peu spacieux) fort had walls that were so thin they were disintegrating. In 1689 new fortifications for the town were laid out by S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the king's engineer. Vauban's fortifications were built between 1689 and 1693. The original Fort C√©p√©rou remained, surrounded by the much more extensive ramparts of Vauban. In 1701 the structures in the fort were destroyed by a fire that spread to the palm- thatched huts of the city. The Portuguese occupied Guiana from 1809 to 1817 and destroyed all the defenses of Cayenne Island. The remains of the town's walls were torn down, the fort's bastions were destroyed, and only three dilapidated buildings remained of the fort. In 1862 governor Louis-Marie- Fran√ßois Tardy de Montravel had a lighthouse built on Mount C√©p√©rou. By 1864 the fort was almost abandoned. A great fire destroyed the southeast part of Cayenne in August 1888. The bell on the fort's pagoda rang for eight days during the fire until it split on 12 August 1888. A public clock was installed on the site in the first half of the 20th century. Some walls and a bell tower are all that remain. The pagoda holding the bell is classified as a monument historique. In 2016 work was done to rehabilitate the pagoda, which was in danger of collapse. The site was transferred from the armed forces to the city of Cayenne in February 2009.

It was opened on 22 July 2018. Vijzelgracht is an underground station situated in the Weteringschans neighbourhood of the Amsterdam-Centrum borough. The station, designed by Benthem Crouwel Architects, is situated beneath the Vijzelstraat between Prinsengracht and Weteringschans in the former Vijzelgracht canal that was dammed in 1933. The station has a 125-metre-long island platform, approximately 9 metres wide. There are two entrances, the north entrance near the Maison Descartes and the south entrance near Weteringplantsoen. The south entrance also serves the tram lines 1, 7, 19 (east‚Äìwest) and 24 (north‚Äìsouth). The station lies 26 metres below street level and is expected to handle a number of 22,000 passengers and passengers per day. The platform is accessible by both lift and escalator. The station is future-proofed for a possible parking structure which would be located at the south entrance. It is also future-proofed for a long-proposed East‚ÄìWest metro line that would be built 11 metres below street level under either the Singelgracht or Weteringschans, with the line running over the North‚ÄìSouth tunnel and under the south ticket hall. History =Construction problems= Vijzelgracht station was beset with construction issues affecting nearby structures. On 19 June 2008, four historic buildings on the Vijzelstraat subsided 15 cm and its residents evacuated due to a breach in a tunnel wall, causing water to enter the tunnel, eroding the pilings that supported the buildings, with work stopped on 23 June. Work resumed on 9 September 2008, with the municipal government and the project bureau doing testing and assuring local residents that issues had been mitigated. However, on 10 September, additional buildings began subsiding again, this time 23 centimetres, again caused by water leaks in the tunnel. In January 2009 a whistleblower, a concrete delivery driver, spoke to the press about the use of old concrete that resulted in cast walls that were brittle and of poor quality. Testing was ordered by the municipal government and conducted by the research firm Deltares, which found 114 weak points and a hole in the concrete sheet pilings used in the Vijzelgracht project. According to the firm, these weak spots were mostly caused by the \\"use of bad and contaminated concrete and poor reinforcement\\". =Ramses Shaffy naming proposal= In 2011, a proposal was made to name the station after Dutch actor and singer Ramses Shaffy, a longtime resident of the Vijzelgracht neighbourhood. The municipal government decided to retain the Vijzelgracht name under the policy of naming stations after their locations. However, the city invited artists to create a work of art dedicated to Shaffy in the metro station. On 23 February 2013, Liesbeth List announced on the Dutch television programme \\"Opium\\" that an portrait of Ramses Shaffy, interwoven with map lines of the Metro, was designed at the metro station, designed by Dutch artist Marjan Laaper.

She was a professor in the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. She coordinated the Spanish government's commission to protect against the 1981 toxic oil syndrome. Her life and scientific career was partially chronicled in the short film, Gertrudis (la mujer que no enterr√≥ sus talentos), which was released in 2016.  Early life and education  Gertrudis de la Fuente S√°nchez was born in Madrid, Spain on 21 August 1921, the daughter of a train driver. She moved to Arroyo de Malpartida, C√°ceres aged six for her father's work. She grew up in a rural area, where girls were not usually educated beyond primary school, and did not start high school until her father retired. In 1935 she moved to Madrid, where she began to study for her baccalaureate, but was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. She studied geometry, eventually graduating in 1942. She completed a bachelor's degree in chemistry at the Complutense University of Madrid in 1948. At university she also attended physics classes.

In 1970 the Institute of Enzymology relocated to the Faculty of Medicine at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid. In 1981 she was commissioned the Spanish government to coordinate an investigation into toxic oil syndrome. = Toxic Oil Syndrome = During the 1981 toxic oil syndrome there was a mass poisoning in Spain. Researchers identified that the poisoning was due to industrial rapeseed oil ending up in the market for humans. The syndrome lasted forty days and affected more than 20,000 people, leaving more than 1,100 dead. She was part of the Advisory Commission for Scientific and Technical Research (Comisi√≥n Asesora de Investigaci√≥n Cient√≠fica y T√©cnica).  Death and legacy  She carried on teaching and supervising PhD students until her retirement. In 2015, a film was made about her life, education and work.

It controls and inspects all processes in the food industry \\"from farm to fork\\", meaning all food production, food processing, food distribution and food service. With food safety in mind, the agency is also responsible for combating animal and plant diseases.  Organisation  The agency is an 'organism of public interest' (parastatal body) type A according to Belgian public law. It was founded after the dioxin affair rocked Belgium in 1999, which was caused by the use of animal feed contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls. Through the food chain, the toxic contamination made its way to supermarkets and consumers, inciting a nationwide scandal when it was discovered. At its foundation, the agency inherited all inspection tasks related to food safety from the relevant services of the federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Public Health and Environment, and of the federal Ministry of Agriculture. Anno 2018, the agency operates under the authority of the Belgian federal minister of Agriculture. As of 2017, the agency has a budget of 166 million euros and is served by 1,260 employees.

Sugita is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and an incumbent member of the House of Representatives for the Proportional Chugoku Block.  Early life and education  Sugita graduated from the Faculty of Agriculture, Tottori University in 1990. She worked as a Nishinomiya government employee and member of the Japan Restoration Party and the Next Generation Party before becoming a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan. After unsuccessfully running in the 2014 election for the Hyogo Prefectural 6th District (garnering the fewest votes of any candidate) as a member of The Party for Japanese Kokoro, Sugita changed parties, joining the Liberal Democratic Party. She next ran for the Proportional Chugoku Block as an LDP member, and was made a representative of that Block by the LDP, without having to rely directly on a direct election. Sugita married at age 26. Her husband is an engineer. They have one child, a daughter.  Political career  = Women using maiden names = A debate has been continuing in Japan on whether or not married couples should be allowed to retain their own names after marriage and thus have different surnames. At present, married people must share the same surname, whether the husband's name or the wife's maiden name. During a Diet session on January 23, 2020 when this issue was being debated, a female Diet member shouted out of turn (called a \\"yaji\\" in Japanese), \\"if you don‚Äôt want your husband‚Äôs name, you shouldn‚Äôt get married!\\" The Diet member was reported to have been Sugita. = Nurseries = In July 2016, Sugita wrote an article in the Sankei Shimbun opposing increases in the number of nurseries. = Comfort women = In 2013 Sugita joined fellow Japan Restoration Party members and at the Study Group for Japan's Rebirth based in Los Angeles to request removal of a statue in Glendale, Los Angeles County, California. The statue commemorates as many as 200,000 \\"comfort women\\" from Korea and other countries \\"forced into sex slavery by Japanese soldiers during World War II\\". Statue opponents, including Sugita, said, \\"the women acted willingly\\" and that the numbers of them reported are inflated. The three politicians also stated that they wanted the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to retract an apology made in the 1990s to comfort women. = Shiori It≈ç rape case = Sugita appeared in a 2018 BBC documentary \\"Japan's Secret Shame\\" which detailed the alleged rape of Shiori It≈ç. In the interview, Sugita was quoted as saying, \\"With this case, there were clear errors on her part as a woman; drinking that much in front of a man and losing her memory. With things like this I think men are the ones who suffer significant damage.‚Äù Sugita also laughed at an illustration with a woman apparently made to look like It≈ç and the words \\"failure at sleeping around for business\\". The video has subsequently drawn criticism on social media. Sugita was criticized by Lully Miura, an instructor at the Policy Alternatives Research Institute at the University of Tokyo who wrote, \\"Behavior as if questioning the actions of the victim instead of the perpetrator will spread the misunderstanding that it cannot be helped if something happens to a woman when she gets drunk in front of a man. There seems to be a sense of dislike against women strongly speaking up to men that is embedded in Sugita's attitude.\\" When approached for comment about the documentary by the Mainichi Shimbun, Sugita stated the video had been edited in a way that misrepresented her intentions and she was considering releasing her own footage of the interview. = LGBT issues = In 2015, Sugita made an appearance on the Japanese Culture Channel Sakura television program Hi Izuru Kuni Yori alongside music composer Koichi Sugiyama and fellow politician Kyoko Nakayama in which she claimed that there was no need for LGBT education in schools, dismissing concerns about high suicide rates among the community. In July 2018, Sugita wrote a magazine article that described LGBT couples as \\"unproductive\\" as they can not bear children and thus were not worth taxpayer investment. Her comments were denounced by various prominent Japanese politicians, including former Japanese prime minister Yukio Hatoyama, with thousands of protesters gathering outside the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party on July 27, 2018 to demand her resignation from the party. Two months later, a group of LGBT politicians and civil rights leaders demanded that she account for the comments. = Victims of Sexual Violence = In September 2020, in response to a briefing about caring for the victims of violence and sexual violence against women, NHK reported that Sugita remarked during the briefing, \\"Women will lie to any lengths\\". Sugita later denied having made these remarks.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. Delancy Ridge is situated east of The Needles on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. Delancy Ridge can be seen from Washington Pass and from the North Cascades Highway which follows the length of its southern base. Precipitation runoff from the north side of the ridge drains into the Methow River, whereas the south side drains into Early Winters Creek which is a tributary of the Methow River. Climate Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

His work combines painterly abstraction with the iconography of digital media. Mayton‚Äôs visual strategies of appropriation and d√©tournement have been compared to the appropriation art of the Pictures Generation.  Early life and career  Mayton was born in 1974 in Florida. He studied at the Ringling College of Art and Design, and received his Masters of Fine Arts from Milton Avery School of the Arts at Bard College in 2007.

She attended Sarah Lawrence College but dropped out after experiencing severe pain that was eventually diagnosed as endometriosis. Norman wrote about her experience of endometriosis, including her efforts to get doctors to take her pain seriously, for Seventeen magazine, and started curating online essays on reproductive system health into a website called Ask Me About My Uterus.

The book connects Norman's personal experience to a longer history of medical practitioners dismissing women's pain, for example by treating their experience of pain as \\"hysteria\\". Ask Me About My Uterus also critically examines the popular understanding of endometriosis as a \\"white woman's disease\\". Writing for The New York Times, Randi Epstein called Norman \\"a terrific storyteller with a gift for weaving memorable anecdotes\\" and noted that the book \\"tells a story that will resonate with anyone (man or woman) who has ever experienced pain\\".

A diplomatic life Coulondre was born in N√Æmes, the son of the politician Gaston Coulondre. As the Coulondres were a Protestant family, they were very loyal to the republic with its principles of Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√© for all people. After obtaining a university degree in Chinese, he joined the Quai d'Orsay in 1909. Coulondre was stationed in London in May 1909, was appointed attach√© at the Foreign Minister's office in March 1912, became assistant consul in Beirut in 1912, and in May 1919 was sent to Morocco. In October 1918, Coulondre protested on behalf of France against the actions of the Emir Faisal in attempting to occupy all of Lebanon while asking Paris to dispatch the French Navy to land marines in the coastal cities of Lebanon \\"before it was too late\\". Coulondre also delivered a protest to the Emir Faisal, pointing out the Sykes-Picot Agreement had assigned Lebanon to France, leading Faisal to claim his reasons for sending the Arab Northern Army into Lebanon were \\"purely military\\". A British attempt to persuade Coulondre to accept the authority of Shurki al-Ayubi, Faisal's governor in Lebanon, as a civil governor under French military authority, was unsuccessful while Coulondre insisting that mostly Christian Lebanon was in the French sphere of influence and he would not have Faisal's representatives from the Muslim Hejaz playing any role in Lebanon. Coulondre met with Field Marshal Sir Edmund Allenby, who apologised to him, insisting it was all a \\"misunderstanding\\", and ordered Ayubli out of Beirut on the night of 10 October 1918. The next day, the flag of the Hejaz was lowered while the French tricolor was raised over Beirut. On 16 October 1918, Coulondre told Gilbert Clayton that France wanted to occupy the Beqaa Valley in accordance with the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which was rejected by the British who assigned the valley to Faisal's agents. For the next two years, an uneasy truce prevailed with Faisal insisting that the Lebanese were Arabs and belonged in his state while the French argued that the Maronite Christians did not want to join a Muslim-dominated state. Signing of the first Franco-Soviet trade agreement 1 November 1934. Coulondre is the man marked 5 in the photograph, fourth from the right. In January 1926 he was a delegate to Franco-Soviet economic negotiations. From 1927 to 28 February 1933, he headed the Commercial Relations Department of the Political and Commercial Directorate and subsequently Deputy Director of the Political and Commercial Directorate at the Quai d'Orsay working under the Political Director Ren√© Massigli. Coulondre was a member of the \\"Protestant clan\\" that dominated the Quai d'Orsay in the first part of the 20th century. From 1920 to 1936, Coulondre had closely studied the German economy and in 1931 when the premier, Pierre Laval, visited Berlin to discuss the crisis caused by the collapse of the banks in Central Europe, Coulondre had accompanied him as an adviser. The leading members of the \\"Protestant clan\\" were Coulondre, Ren√© Massigli, Victor de Lacroix, Albert Kamerer, Jacques Seydoux de Clausonne and his son Fran√ßois Seydoux de Clausonne, all of whom knew each other and worked closely together. Since French Protestants were persecuted under the ancien- regime when the state religion was Roman Catholicism, French Protestants tended to be very supportive of the legacy of the French Revolution with its call for Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√©. The \\"Protestant clan\\" in the Quai d'Orsay were all supporters of the republic and its values of Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√© in domestic affairs while favoring a rule-based international order, support for the League of Nations, opposition to appeasement, and an abhorrence of Nazi Germany as the antithesis of everything they believed in. Ambassador in Moscow =Mission to the Kremlin= In 1936, he was appointed the French ambassador to the Soviet Union. The Quai d'Orsay was one of the most prestigious branches of the French state, and ambassadors were an elite group within the Quai d'Orsay, having the right to be addressed as \\"your excellency\\", to wear a ceremonial embodied uniform that was meant to impress and since ambassadors represented the president of the republic, in theory ambassadors outranked the foreign minister in protocol. Between 1932-39, only 30 diplomats were promoted up to the rank of ambassador, making Coulondre part of a very select group. Coulondre went to Moscow with two guiding principles with the first being that Nazi Germany was a menace that had to be stopped and the second being that the best way to do that was an alliance with the Soviet Union. Coulondre was chosen as the ambassador to Moscow by the Popular Front government of L√©on Blum, who felt that an experienced diplomat well known for calling for closer ties to Moscow was the ideal man to represent France to the Kremlin. Coulondre later wrote that the Quai d'Orsay's information about the Soviet Union was almost non-existent as discovered looking through the files \\"that relations with the USSR, established in 1924, had been neither very close nor very well cultivated since then, notwithstanding the pacts\\". Coulondre described his superior, the Foreign Minister, Yvon Delbos, as being paranoid about the Soviets and fearful that the alliance that France had signed with the Soviets in 1935 was merely a device which Joseph Stalin might use to \\"push\\" France into a war with Germany. Delbos in giving his instructions to Coluondre openly wondered aloud \\"...whether they [the Soviets] were not looking to push us into a conflict with Germany\\". Delbos further stated that if war with came with Germany, France was destined to lose because: \\"If defeated it [France] would be Nazified. If victorious, it must, due to the destruction of German power, submit, with the rest of Europe, to the overwhelming weight of the Slavic world, armed with the communist flamethrower\\". Coulondre recalled in his 1950 memoirs De Staline √† Hitler Souvenirs de deux ambassades, 1936-1939 that \\"the presentation of his [Delbos's] statement was made completely in a negative sense\\". Coulondre was told in his instructions that there was no question of a \\"preventive war\\" to put an end to the Nazi regime while its rearmament had just started, and he would was to refuse any Soviet offer about a \\"preventive war\\"; that he must end Soviet involvement in French internal affairs; and should a war come, he was to discuss \\"possible military aid\\" to the Soviet Union. Another part of Coulondre's mission in Moscow was to present Stalin with a choice between promoting the French Communist Party or building an anti-German alliance. When Coulondre presented his credentials as an ambassador for the republic to the Soviet Chairman Mikhail Kalinin, he received a blast when Kalinin told him that the French were not treating their alliance seriously with Kalinin chiding him for the unwillingness of the French general staff to open up staff talks with their Soviet counterparts. Kalinin criticized France for refusing to sell the Soviet Union weapons and complained that even Germany offered up better trade terms than France as the Reich, unlike France, was willing to deal with the Soviet Union on credit. Coulondre often told his hosts that many of the French right were willing to accept an alliance with the Soviets to stop Germany, but the militant ultra- leftwing line pursued by the French communists terrified them. At his first meeting with the Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov in October 1936, Coulondre stated: \\"I have come here without prejudice for or against the Russia of the Soviets. I am, however, a convinced partisan of the assistance pact because I believe it to be one of the elements necessary for the safeguarding of the peace to which both nations are equally attached...Well then, I have to tell you if things continue as they're now going, there will be no more assistance pact. French public opinion is sick and tired of Comintern meddling in the domestic affairs of France-meddling, which we know-is inspired if not directly operated by the Soviet government itself...Either it shall cease or the pact will become a dead letter\\". Litvinov gave the usual spurious statement that the Soviet Union had nothing to do with the operations of the Comintern, which did not get relations going well for the new French ambassador in Moscow. Coulondre frankly told Litvinov that there was much \\"uneasiness\\" in France about the Franco-Soviet alliance. For his part, Coulondre soon had the impression that the Soviets were unhappy with the Blum government's stated desire to preserve the peace, and would had much preferred that if a more traditional \\"tough guy\\" French conservative leader like Louis Barthou or Raymond Poincar√© were leading France. Shortly after his arrival in Moscow, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1936. Through the Anti-Comintern Pact was officially directed against the Comintern, not the Soviet Union, this distinction was in practice meaningless, and the Anti- Comintern Pact was understood to be an anti-Soviet alliance. The Anti- Comintern Pact only committed Germany and Japan to share intelligence and to co-operate in police matters, but the mere fact that Berlin and Tokyo had reached an alliance against the Soviet Union caused much fear in Moscow of facing a two-front war with Japan attacking in Asia and Germany attacking in Europe. Coulondre reported to Paris that the Soviets wanted to strengthen the Franco-Soviet alliance as a way to counterbalance the German-Japanese bloc that had emerged. Coulondre was told that a \\"state of virtual war\\" existed on the border between Mongolia and the sham state of Manchukuo with the Soviets saying that the Japanese Kwantung Army was violating the border on an almost daily basis, leading to constant skirmishes along the frontier and it was believed that a full scale Soviet-Japanese war could break out at any moment. =A Troubled Alliance= As Stalin was only the First Secretary of the Communist Party, having no position in the Soviet state, Coulondre rarely saw him, which made understanding the Soviet Union very difficult. Most of the time Coulondre talked with Litvinov, whom Coulondre noted was a very intelligent man, but not a member of Stalin's inner circle and moreover was a Jew, making him an outsider. Coulondre described Litvinov to Paris as a man who seemed sincere in his belief in collective security and as someone who wanted better relations with the western powers to contain Nazi Germany, but he was not certain how much influence, if any, that Litvinov had with Stalin. From November 1936 onward, Coulondre grew increasingly frustrated with what he regarded as foot-dragging on the part of Delbos, who seemed to be looking for any excuse to terminate the alliance with the Soviet Union. In a dispatch to Delbos, Coulondre wrote \\"Russia's feet are not of clay, as it is currently said, but rest solidly on the Russian land which serves to nourish its steel muscles which I see growing stronger month by month\\". By the spring of 1937, Coulondre was predicating that it was quite possible for the Soviet Union to ally itself with Germany as he described Stalin as an opportunist who would ally himself with whatever power presented him with the best terms, and that a German-Soviet combination would be a disaster from the French viewpoint. For this reason, Coulondre was quietly critical of Delbos's efforts to \\"devalue\\" the Franco-Soviet alliance, as he warned it was dangerous to assume that a German-Soviet rapprochement was impossible. Coulondre was frightened by the Yezhovshchina (the \\"Yezhov times\\"), seeing it as evidence of turn towards isolationism and increased xenophobia in the Soviet Union. Coulondre called the Yezhovshchina a \\"crisis of growth\\" towards what Coulondre called \\"counterrevolutionary absolutism\\", Russian nationalism, and military and economic might. In a dispatch to Paris, Coulondre wrote the most important question facing French diplomacy was not \\"will Russia be with us or not?\\", but rather \\"with whom will Russia go?\\" As the Soviet Union had signed an alliance with France's ally Czechoslovakia in 1935, one of Coulondre's main duties in Moscow was see if it was possible for the Soviets to obtain transit rights with Poland and/or Romania to allow the Red Army to reach Czechoslovakia if Germany should attack the latter. In April 1937, Coulondre returned to Paris to take part in the discussions held by French decision-makers about what would be the place of the Soviet Union in French strategy in the event of a war with Germany. To Coulondre's disappointment, Marshal Maurice Gamelin of the French general staff, reached the conclusion that it was not possible to make such plans as it was clear that neither Poland nor Romania would permit the Red Army transit rights. When Coulondre told Litvinov in 1937 that King Carol II of Romania was prepared to allow the Soviets overflight rights to send aid to Czechoslovakia in the event of a German invasion, Litvinov insisted on land transit rights as well, which the Romanians refused, leading to Coulondre to the conclusion that the Soviets were not serious about helping Czechoslovakia. In June 1937, the Yezhovshchina turned on the Red Army leadership, which led Coulondre to report to Paris on 13 June 1937 that through a \\"more docile new generation of Bolshevists\\" could be assumed, the Soviet Union \\"risks remaining weakened and limited in its means of action...The Red Army itself cannot escape the effects of this sort of rage\\". Coulondre's statements that the Red Army had been weakened by the execution of much of its leadership, was used by opponents of the Franco-Soviet pact in Paris to argue that the Soviet Union was not a major power, and hence not worth cultivating. The execution of Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky together with seven other senior Red Army generals on charges of espionage on behalf of Germany and Japan together with plotting to overthrow Stalin on 11 June 1937 caused considerable distrust of the Red Army within the French Army, and Marshal Maurice Gamelin ended all Franco-Soviet staff talks. Gamelin argued since that according to Pravda Marshal Tukhachevsky was a spy for Germany and Japan, then logically any information he had shared with Tukachevsky must had reached Berlin and Tokyo, and he would share no more information until the \\"appearance of a certain internal pacification within the USSR\\". Coulondre continued to press for Franco-Soviet staff talks to resume for the rest of his ambassadorship, but Gamelin remained opposed and the talks were never resumed. The Soviets attached much importance to staff talks as proof that the French were committed to the alliance, and the break-off in staff talks caused much bitterness in Moscow. In December 1937, Delbos visited all of France's allies in Eastern Europe except for the Soviet Union, Coulondre in a dispatch wrote: \\"that in spite of all the excuses which will be forthcoming, this will not ameliorate Franco-Soviet relations and restore confidence\\". The same month, Litvinov was interviewed by the Moscow correspondent for Les Temps where he expressed himself with what Couoondre called much \\"avec sev√©rit√©\\" about Franco-Soviet relations, saying that the French were not taking the alliance very seriously. Litvinov warned that the Soviet Union would reach a rapprochement with Germany if the French continued with their present course, saying his government was very dissatisfied that the French were refusing to resume Franco-Soviet staff talks. Litvinov added that France was committed to the defense of the international system created by the Treaty of Versailles while Germany was committed to the destruction of the Versailles system. He concluded his interview by saying the Soviet Union had been excluded from the Paris peace conference of 1919 and only chose to defend the Versailles system because it wanted to, not because it had to. In response, Coulondre warned Paris that the Soviet regime \\"could be led eventually to envision a rapprochement with Germany. Presuming to consider an entente with the Reich as easy from the moment the USSR ceased to defend the maintenance of the status quo in Europe, he [Litvinov] added that such a thing could be arranged without the formalities of treaties...It is improbable, given the seriousness of the subject, even while speaking unofficially to a journalist, that M. Litvinov would had dared upon such a point without have been authorised in advance from on high, and his declaration appears to me as a sort of warning that the Soviet government wanted to give in a roundabout way\\". =From the Sudetenland crisis to the Munich Agreement= After the Anschluss, Coulondre predicted to Paris that Germany's next target would be Czechoslovakia rather than Poland. Coulondre always stated his opinion that if France had to choose between the Soviet Union and Poland as an ally, it should pick the former rather than the latter as the Soviet Union had much greater military and industrial power. Like many other French diplomats in the 1930s, Coulondre often expressed dissatisfaction with the policy of the Polish foreign minister Colonel Jozef Beck, charging that Beck was an opportunist whose plans to make Poland into a great power made him a lukewarm friend of France and that Beck was far too willing to flirt with Germany to achieve his ambitions. Coulondre stated if France had to go to war with Germany in the defense of the cordon sanitaire, it was far better to go to war for the sake of Czechoslovakia as Prague unlike Warsaw was fully committed to upholding the international order created in 1918-19 and Czechoslovakia was \\"the only country on which the action of the three great peaceful powers could be conjoined.\\" The French Foreign Minister Joseph Paul-Boncour had already told Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German ambassador in Paris, that France would honor its alliance with Czechoslovakia and that a German attack on Czechoslovakia \\"meant war\\" with France. Paul- Boncour told Coulondre that the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, disapproved of France's willingness to stand by Czechoslovakia, but also stated he believed that if France went to war with Germany, then Britain would have to follow as the British could never risk the possibility of Germany defeating France. Paul-Boncour concluded that London wanted Prague to make concessions, but he was believed that if it came to war, London would choose Paris over Berlin. On 5 April 1938, Coulondre took part in a conference of the French ambassadors in Eastern Europe in Paris called by Paul-Boncour, in which it was agreed it was necessary to end the conflicts between France's allies in Eastern Europe. The principle conflicts were the disputes between Poland vs. Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union vs. Romania, and Poland vs. the Soviet Union. Attending the conference besides for Paul-Boncour and Coulondre were Alexis St.L√©ger-St.L√©ger, the Secretary-General of the Quai d'Orsay; L√©on No√´l, the ambassador to Poland; Victor de Lacroix, the minister to Czechoslovakia; Raymond Brug√®re, the minister to Yugoslavia; and Adrien Thierry, the minister to Romania. It was agreed that as long as France's allies in Eastern Europe continued to feud with one another that the only nation that gained was Germany. Coulondre was assigned to end the vexatious question of transit rights for the Red Army, which both Poland and Romania were adamant in refusing to grant. Thierry suggested that there was some hope that King Carol II of Romania might be induced to grant transit rights for the Red Army while No√´l stated there was no hope of the Poles doing likewise, which led Coulondre to state that he would try to mediate an end to the long-running Romanian- Soviet dispute over Bessarabia. Working closely with the Czechoslovak minister in Moscow, Zdenƒõk Fierlinger, Coulondre worked out a deal in which the Soviet Union would recognize Bessarabia as part of Romania in exchange for Romania giving the Soviets transit rights to Czechoslovakia. In the spring of 1938, Coulondre reported in the \\"vague and intuitive manner one senses such things in Soviet Russia\\" that for the first time that Moscow might actually be serious about coming to the aid of Czechoslovakia, mentioning that Litvinov had abandoned his normal sarcastic tone to the \\"seriousness and moderation of one who has sensed a new responsibilities, who knew the Kremlin would play its part in the European conflict\\". Coulondre credited the charge to the Sino- Japanese war, writing that the Soviets were intensely paranoid that Japan might attack them at any moment, making them reluctant to become involved in a European war. Coulondre stated that the fact that China had not collapsed in 1937 in the face of the Japanese invasion together with the evidence that stiffening Chinese resistance had led Japan to become bogged down in China meant the Soviets could \\"make a corresponding greater effort in the West\\". Coulondre added that the main Japanese offensive in China intended to end the war, launched in June 1938, was in the Yangtze river valley in central China was a source of great relief to Moscow since it indicated that Japan would not be invading the Soviet Union that year. Just when Coulondre believed it might finally be possible to open staff talks between the French and Soviet armies, he was recalled to Paris by the new foreign minister Georges Bonnet whom he learned had very different ideas about French policy in Eastern Europe, favoring a deal that would let Germany have Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence in exchange for leaving France alone. On the day he left for Paris, 16 May 1938, Coulondre visited the British Embassy in Moscow to share information about the Red Army and to argue that the executions of much the Red Army's leadership in the Yezhovshchina had not fatally weakened the Red Army as many had believed. The British charg√© de affairs, Gordon Vereker reported to London that he was \\"slightly mystified as to the motives of M. Coulondre's invitation, for I have always understood that he is usually reserved and uncommunicative\\". Vereker told Colondre that his view was that the \\"Russians were Asiatics...and that with present Byzantine regime in the Kremlin anything might happen\\", concluding that the Red Army would be no match for the Wehrmacht and there was no point in trying to have the Soviet Union as an counterweight to Germany for that reason. Upon arriving in Paris, Coulondre was caught up in the May crisis. It was during the May crisis that Coulondre first learned of Bonnet's views about letting Germany have \\"a free hand in the East\\" in exchange for leaving France alone. Couldondre recalled that during the May crisis that the more he talked about France going to war with Germany, the more Bonnet insisted that it would not possible to do so unless Britain agreed to come in, which Couldonre noted did not seem very likely. Bonnet vetoed Coulondre's plans for joint Franco-Czechoslovak-Soviet staff talks, saying it might \\"incite certain French elements to appear bellicose\\". After hearing various excuses from Bonnet, which the combative Coulondre proceed to dismiss, he finally learned of what Bonnet was really seeking, namely to end all of France's alliances in eastern Europe. During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Bonnet insisted that France would only risk war with Germany in defense of Czechoslovakia if Britain and Poland both agreed to come in, and disparaged Coulondre's dispatches from Moscow suggesting the Soviet Union was willing to come in. On 5 July 1938, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, the German ambassador in Moscow, reported to Berlin that Coulondre had told him that he received word from Litvinov that the Soviets had only intervened in the Spanish Civil War in 1936 because Stalin did not want to \\"lose face\\" with the foreign communists, especially the French Communist Party, and the Soviets were willing to pull out of Spain if Germany did likewise. Schulenburg concluded that Litvinov had used Coulondre to convey this message rather than telling him directly as this was the Soviet way of delivering a message in a way that could be denied. Coulondre himself reported to Paris that the Soviets were not keen to be involved in the Spanish Civil War where no Soviet interests were at stake and especially with Germany and Italy intervening on the other side, concluding that Moscow was looking for a dignified way out of Spain without loss of face now that war was threatening to break out in Central Europe. Coulondre stated that his sources in Moscow had told him that the decision to intervene in Spain had been undertaken because of Stalin's feud with Trotsky in order to maintain Stalin's revolutionary and anti-fascist credentials against Trotsky among communists worldwide and the Soviets had no real interest in ensuring the victory of the Republicans over the Nationalists, stating the war in Spain was an expensive distraction for the Soviet Union. On 12 July 1938, Coulondre reported that the a Czechoslovak military mission together with M. Hromadko, the president of the Skoda works had arrived in Moscow for talks. Afterwards, Litvinov summoned Coulondre for talks, asking him a series of intense, probing questions about what France would do if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia. Coulondre reported to Paris that based on what Litvinov was asking that he believed that Stalin was willing to come to the aid of Czechoslovakia. However, on 29 July 1938, the Battle of Lake Khasan began as the Japanese Kwantung Army attempted to seize the area around Lake Khasan in the Soviet Far East and regular skirmishes broke out on the border between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo. With the Soviet-Japanese border war, the attention of the Kremlin shifted from Europe to Asia. On 21 September 1938, Coulondre reported that the previous day the Soviet Union had promised Czechoslovakia \\"unconditional air support\\" in the event of a German invasion, through the ambassador added that he had seen no practical effort to put this promise into effect. On 24 September 1938, Coulondre reported to Bonnet that the Soviets were still willing to stand by their alliance with Czechoslovakia and were criticizing President Benes for agreeing to the Anglo- French plan to transfer the Sudetenland to Germany. At the same time, Coulondre reported that Litvinov had told him that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's defense only if the Council of the League of Nations voted for military sanctions against Germany, which he noted was tantamount to doing nothing. Despite Coulondre's best efforts to play up the possibility of the Soviet Union coming in to aid Czechoslovakia, the evidence to the contrary that crept in to his dispatches allowed Bonnet to argue to the French cabinet that the Moscow would do nothing to aid Prague if the crisis should come to war. On 4 October 1938, Coulondre handed over to the Soviet Vice Foreign Commissar, Vladimir Potemkin, the text of the Munich Agreement. Coulondre reported to Paris an odd conversation where Potemkin first in a formal and cold tone of voice said \\"I simply wish to state that the Western Powers have deliberately kept the USSR out of the negotiations\\". Then suddenly Potemkin grew more emotional as he put his hand on Coulondre's shoulder and said in an anguished tone: \\"My poor fellow, what have you done? For us, I see no other consequence, but a fourth partition of Poland\\". Coulondre in one his last dispatches from Moscow reported his belief that the Soviet Union was no longer interested in collective security and that Moscow would try \\"to return to the policy of understanding with Germany which she had abandoned in 1931\\". Coulondre predicated there was a real possibility of the Soviet Union of trying to achieve an alliance with Germany against the western powers and of another partition of Poland. Ambassador in Berlin =Arrival on the Wilhelmstrasse= In October 1938, Coulondre was appointed the French ambassador to Germany as the French Premier √âdouard Daladier was determined to wrestle control of foreign policy from his appeasement-minded foreign minister Georges Bonnet and felt that replacing Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet as ambassador to Berlin with Coulondre, a diplomat known for anti-Nazi views, was a way of weakening Bonnet. Furthermore, Daladier felt that Fran√ßois-Poncet was too closely associated with appeasement as he had been the French ambassador in Berlin since 1931, and appointing an anti-appeasement diplomat as ambassador would signal to Berlin that there would no more treaties like the Munich Agreement. Like Coulondre, Daladier was from the south of France, and the two men were old friends who often talked to each other in Proven√ßal when they did not want other French people to understand what they were saying. Coulondre saw himself as more serving Daladier rather than his nominal superior Bonnet, and throughout his time in Berlin he had much influence on Daladier. On 22 November 1938, Coulondre arrived in Berlin and presented his credentials as an ambassador for the republic to Adolf Hitler at the Reich Chancellery on the Wilhelmstrasse on the same day. The French Embassy was located on the Wilhelmstrasse, just a few blocks down from the Reich Chancellory. The instructions given to him by Bonnet ordered the new ambassador to create a d√©tente with Germany. Coulondre wrote in his memoirs: \\"After having gone to Moscow to work for an entente against Hitler, I was now to go to Berlin to work for an entente with Hitler\\". At his first meeting with the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, the latter recorded: \\"M. Coulondre told me upon that upon taking the appointment, he intended to do all he could to improve Franco-German relations...He personally was not biased in any particular direction and was open to all suggestions\\". However, upon greeting the senior staff of the French embassy, Coulondre told them: \\"Munich is our point of departure. Each of us is free to judge as he sees it the policy which led there. The fact remains that to safeguard the peace, the Western Powers went there. The question, the only question now before us, is whetever peace can actually be found by this route\\". Writing about the intensified antisemitism in Germany following the Kristallnacht pogrom of 9 November 1938 Coulondre stated: \\"the treatment inflicted in Germany upon the Jews whom the Nazis intend to extirpate completely like malevolent beasts illuminates the entire distance which separates the Hitlerian conception of the world from the spiritual patrimony of the democratic nations\\". In 1938, an informal group of four consisting of Fran√ßois-Poncet, Weizs√§cker, the British ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson, and the Italian ambassador Baron Bernardo Attolico had come together to work to \\"manage\\" Germany's rise to great power status and prevent a war. Unlike Fran√ßois-Poncet, Coulondre chose not to join the group of four. Captain Paul Stehlin, the French air attache to Germany wrote: \\"Robert Coulondre was very different from his predecessor in physical appearance and seemed friendlier when you first met him. He looked shy with pleasant smiling eyes in a square face and a high, willful forehead. His moral, intellectual qualities and his compassion were of the same stuff as his predecessor.\\" The younger French diplomats tended to view Coulondre as inferior as an ambassador compared to Fran√ßois-Poncet partly because of his dispatches to Paris lacked the same literacy quality that Fran√ßois-Poncet's dispatches had and partly because Fran√ßois-Poncet described every possible outcome to a situation whereas Coulondre would limit himself to the one he viewed as the most likely outcome. The French historian Jean-Baptiste Duroselle wrote that Coulondre's mistakes in his dispatches came mostly from using General Henri Antoine Didelet, the French military attache to Germany, as a source for Didelet was often misinformed, but Coulondre was highly prescient in his dispatches, for example predicating the fourth partition of Poland in October 1938. As an specialist in economic affairs who closely studied the German economy when he worked as a deputy to Ren√© Massigli, Coulondre was unusually well informed about the state of Nazi economy. Duroselle described Coulondre as a man with \\"much common sense and a healthy understanding of his German counterparts\\". Coulondre described the Nazi leaders as he met them in hostile tones. Coulondre wrote that Hermann G√∂ring was \\"at once ridiculous and formidable\\", Joachim von Ribbentrop was \\"contemptible\\", Rudolf Hess was as boring as he was stupid, Alfred Rosenberg was eccentric and weird, and Joseph Goebbels was \\"ce petit diable boiteux\\" (\\"this lame little devil\\"), adding that Goebbels's various mistresses were more interesting than he was. Coulondre wrote he had the impression that Baron Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, did not want a war with France, but his relations with Weizs√§cker were cold and distant as Coulondre never trusted him. The American historians Carl Schorske and Franklin Ford wrote that everything has emerged since 1945 showed Coulondre was right to distrust Weizs√§cker, a thoroughly duplicitous and dishonest man. About Hitler, Coulondre wrote he enjoyed \\"une puissance diabolique\\" (\\"a diabolical power\\") over the German people, a power which he exercised with\\"une habilet√© satanique\\" (\\"a satanic skill\\"). The Canadian historian Robert J. Young wrote that Coulondre in his dispatches to Paris usually employed imagery that linked Hitler with the devil. Coulondre saw little evidence of a German interest in detente with France, and instead noted the recurring theme of Hitler's speeches was the \\"harshness\\" of the Treaty of Versailles, which justified everything his government did to end the international system established in 1919. Initially, he believed that Hitler wanted an alliance with Poland to take over the Soviet Ukraine, and that if the Poles refused to go along, then Hitler would just attack Poland. Coulondre in Berlin on 27 January 1939. In the foreground from left to right Heinrich Himmler, Berlin police chief Count Wolf von Helldorff, and the Agriculture Minister Richard Walther Darr√©. Coulondre is the man on the right with the glasses, the grey gloves and the top hat in his hands. =The End of Czecho- Slovakia= On 13 December 1938, Coulondre reported to Paris that he learned much about the \\"National Union of the Ukraine\\" terrorist group, whose headquarters were on 79 Mecklenburg Street in Berlin, and which had been financed and armed by the SS. Coulondre further noted that the \\"National Union of the Ukraine\\" group was not just trying to send its agents not only into the Soviet Ukraine as expected, but also into the Polish region of Galicia, which had a Ukrainian majority, which led him to conclude that the Reich was becoming hostile to Poland. On 15 December 1938, Coulondre reported that he believed the majority of the German people did not want war and found that a surprising large number had favorable views of France. However, he believed that Germany was oriented towards expansionism in Eastern Europe, especially towards the Ukraine, concluding: \\"The integration of Deutschtum into the Reich has been carried out more or less completely. Now the hour of Lebensraum has come\\". Under the terms of the Munich Agreement, in exchange for the Sudetenland \\"going home to the Reich\\" over a ten-day period in October 1938, Britain, France, Germany and Italy were committed to making a \\"guarantee\\" of the rest of Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed) from aggression. When Coulondre asked Ribbentrop about negotiating the \\"guarantee\\" of Czecho-Slovakia, he found that Ribbentrop kept giving him various excuses as why that was not possible right now, leading Coulondre to suspect that Germany was not content with the Sudetenland and wanted all of Czecho- Slovakia. On 21 December 1938, Weizs√§cker told Coulondre that he rejected the idea of an Anglo-French \\"guarantee\\" of Czecho-Slovakia promised by the Munich Agreement, saying that the fate of Czecho-Slovakia was entirely in German hands. On 8 February 1939, Coulondre together with Sir George Ogilvie-Forbes who was temporarily in charge of the British Embassy presented a joint note saying that their two governments' \\"would now be glad to learn the views of the German government as to the best way of giving effect to the understanding reached at Munich in regard to the guarantee of Czecho-Slovakia\\". The Reich government did not answer the note until 28 February, saying in a note written by Hitler himself that it was not possible to \\"guarantee\\" Czecho-Slovakia at present as Germany had to \\"await first a clarification of the internal development of Czecho-Slovakia\\". At least five weeks before the Germany moved against Czecho-Slovakia, Coulondre had been predicating that such a move was imminent. Coulondre noted that in late February-early March 1939 a sharp anti- Czech tone to the stories appearing in the German newspapers that resembled the stories that had appeared in 1938 right down to the accusations of a \\"blutbad\\" (bloodbath) of ethnic Germans in Bohemia, which led him to guess that something was planned against Czecho-Slovakia. About the visit of the Czecho-Slovak president Emil H√°cha and Foreign Minister Franti≈°ek Chvalkovsk√Ω to Berlin on the night of 14‚Äì15 March 1939, Coulondre reported to Paris based on what he described as a reliable source within the Ausw√§rtiges Amt that: \\"The German ministers [G√∂ring and Ribbetrop] were pitiless. They literally hunted Dr. H√°cha and M. Chvalkovsky round the table on which the documents were lying, thrusting them continually before them, pushing pens into their hands, incessantly repeating that if they continued in their refusal, half of Prague would lie in ruins from bombing within two hours, and that this would be only the beginning. Hundreds of bombers were waiting the order to take off, and they would receive that order at six in the morning if the signatures were not forthcoming\\". At that point, H√°cha suffered a mild heart attack and had to be revived by \\"energy\\" injections by Hitler's doctor, the sinister quack Dr. Theodor Morell. At that point, H√°cha phoned Prague to tell his cabinet that resistance was futile and at about 4 am on 15 March 1939 signed away his country's independence, with tears in his eyes. On 15 March 1939, Germany violated the Munich Agreement by occupying the Czech part of the Czecho- Slovakia, which now become the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. Coulondre reported to Paris that \\"the Munich Agreement no longer exists\\", and stated that he believed that Hitler was still preoccupied with Eastern Europe, he would be willing to turn west if he thought that Germany was losing the arms race with Britain and France. Coulondre advised Paris must rearm \\"to the limit of our capacity\\", but as discreetly as possible. To Weizs√§cker, Coulondre spoke in an angry tone of the \\"contravention of the Munich Agreement, in contradiction to the relationship of confidence, which he had expected to find here\\". Weizs√§cker, who despite his post-war claims to have been an anti-Nazi, was in an arrogant and belligerent mood, and accordingly to his own account of his meeting with Coulondre: > \\"I spoke rather sharply to the Ambassador and told him not to mention the > Munich Agreement, which he alleged had been violated, and not to give us any > lectures...I told him that in view of the agreement reached last night with > the Czech government I could see no reason for any d√©marche by the French > ambassador...and that I was sure he would find fresh instructions when he > returned to his embassy, and these would set his mind at rest\\". When Coulondre presented Weizs√§cker on 18 March 1939 with a French note protesting against the German occupation of the Czech lands, the latter accordingly to his own account: > \\"I immediately replaced the Note in its envelope and thrust it back at the > Ambassador with the remark that I categorically refused to accept from him > any protest regarding the Czecho-Slovak affair. Nor would I take note of the > communication and I would advise M. Coulondre to urge his government to > revise the draft\\". Coulondre, a diplomat known for his toughness, refused to accept Weizs√§cker's insolent behavior, telling him that the French note had been written after \\"due consideration\\" and he would not take it back to be revised. When Weizs√§cker continued to rudely refuse to accept the note, Coulondre sharply accused him of being a very poor diplomat, saying the French government had every right to make known its views to the German government, and that Weizs√§cker was failing in the most elementary duties of the diplomat by seeking to conceal the views of France from his own government. Coulondre threw the note down at Weizs√§cker's desk and the latter reluctantly agreed he \\"would regard it as transmitted to us through the post\\". The Coulondre- Weizs√§cker meetings later came up at Weizs√§cker's trial for crimes against humanity for his role in arranging for French Jews to be deported to Auschwitz, and at that point, Weizs√§cker conveniently \\"remembered\\" that he had been a \\"resistance fighter\\" against the Nazi regime, only pretending to serve the Nazis in order to sabotage the regime within. Weizs√§cker testified that he exaggerated his belligerence and arrogance in his accounts of his meetings to make it appear that he was loyal Nazi as a cover for his supposed work as a \\"resistance fighter\\"; he and his defense lawyers had forgotten that Coulondre's account of his meetings with him had appeared in the French Yellow Book, a collection of diplomatic documents relating to the Danzig crisis published in late 1939. The American prosecutor had not, and then produced the Yellow Book in court to show that Coulondre's account did support Weizs√§cker's accounts of his arrogant and abusive behavior. Coulondre reported to Paris that the creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia proved that Hitler wanted to dominate Europe, and the best that France could do was rearm to the maximum in order to deter Hitler from choosing war. In March 1939, Coulondre reported to Paris that Captain Stehlin had a long chat with General Karl Bodenschatz, who served as the Luftwaffe liaison officer to Hitler. Bodenschatz mentioned to Stehlin that his belief that \\"Etwas im Osten im Gange ist\\" (\\"something is brewing in the east\\"), mentioning that Soviet military attache in Berlin had met with senior Wehrmacht officers and Ribbentrop had dinner with the Soviet ambassador Alexsei Merekalov. On the basis of this, Coulondre reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union and Germany were negotiating against Poland. During a meeting with the Polish ambassador to Germany, Jozef Lipski, Coulondre warned in an \\"off-the-record\\" conversation that he was convinced that the Luftwaffe had such an overwhelming superiority over the air forces of the East European states that Poland did not stand a chance if Germany should invade, an assessment that left Lipski very depressed. =The Danzig crisis= On 31 March 1939, Britain made the famous \\"guarantee\\" of Poland, followed up on 13 April by \\"guarantees\\" of Romania and Greece. Coulondre subsequently believed that these British diplomatic moves helped make possible the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact as he wrote in De Staline √† Hitler: > \\"The Reich could not attack Russia by land without using Polish or Romanian > territory, that is to say, since 13 April, without bringing into play the > guarantee of the Western powers and consequently triggering war with them. > Stalin had obtained, indirectly and without having to commit himself, the > shield in the West which he had been seeking for ten years...he could safely > watch developments and carry on a double game in a way dear to the Russians. > One should not tempt saints; still less those who are not saints.\\" Coulondre's relations with the British Ambassador in Berlin, Sir Nevile Henderson were very poor as Coulondre in his dispatches described Henderson as a convinced appeaser who had a barely veiled admiration for the Nazi regime. On 29 April 1939, Coulondre reported to Paris that when Germany occupied the Czech part of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March 1939, that Henderson, \\"always an admirer of the National Socialist regime, careful to protect Mr. Hitler's prestige, was convinced that Great Britain and Germany could divide the world between them\\" was very angry when he learned that the Reich had just violated the Munich Agreement as it \\"wounded him in his pride\\". Coulondre went on to write: \\"Yesterday, I found him exactly as I knew him in February.\\" Coulondre added that Henderson had told him that the German demand that the Free City of Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany was justified in his opinion and the introduction of conscription in Britain did not mean that British policies towards Germany were changing. Coulondre concluded \\"it appears that events barely touched Sir Nevile Henderson, like water over a mirror...It would seem that he forgot everything and failed to learn anything\\". At the same time, Coulondre reported that the driving force behind a German rapprochement with the Soviet Union was not Hitler-whom Coulondre argued wanted to dominate Europe without precisely knowing how he wanted to do it-but rather Ribbentrop, whom Coulondre wrote was largely determining the course of German foreign policy in 1939 due to Hitler's indecision. Writing about the Danzig crisis on 30 April 1939, Coulondre sent a dispatch to Bonnet saying Hitler sought: > \\"....a mortgage on Polish foreign policy, while itself retaining complete > liberty of action allowing the conclusion of political agreements with other > countries. In these circumstances, the new settlement proposed by Germany, > which would link the questions of Danzig and of the passage across the > Corridor with counterbalancing questions of a political nature, would only > serve to aggravate this mortgage and practically subordinate Poland to the > Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc. Warsaw refused this in order to retain its > independence...Polish acceptance of Germany's demands would have rendered > the application of any braking machinery in the East impossible. The Germans > are not wrong then, when they claim that Danzig is in itself only a > secondary question. It is not only the fate of the Free City, it is the > enslavement or liberty of Europe which is at stake in the issue now joined.\\" On 7 May 1939, Coulondre reported to Paris that the dismissal of Litvinov as Soviet Foreign Commissar had caused much comment in official circles in Berlin, and that accordingly to his sources Germany was planning to invade Poland that year and was willing to sign a pact with the Soviet Union to achieve that goal. On 9 May 1939, Coulondre reported he kept hearing rumors in the circles that he socialized with \\"...that Germany had made, or was going to make to Russia proposals aimed at a partition of Poland\\". On 1 June 1939, Coulondre in a dispatch to Bonnet stated: \\"Hitler will risk war if he does not have to fight Russia. On the other hand, if he knows he has to fight her too he will draw back rather than expose his country, his party and himself to ruin\\". In June 1939, as the Danzig crisis deepened, Coulondre wrote that \\"Hitler has never up till now undertaken any move which he was not certain of success\\", and stated his belief that a forceful French stand in favor of Poland would deter Germany from choosing war to resolve the Danzig crisis. At the very end of June 1939, the Deuxi√®me Bureau had tapped the telephone of Otto Abetz, Ribbentrop's agent in Paris, overheard a possibly intoxicated Abetz saying that the Free City of Danzig would rejoining Germany that weekend as Hitler was coming to Danzig. At a meeting with Weizs√§cker, Coulondre was informed that all talk of der F√ºhrer going to Danzig that weekend to proclaim the Free City's return to Germany were nonsense as Hitler would never put himself into danger, an assessment that Coulondre agreed with. The nature of the Danzig crisis with Germany demanding that the Free City of Danzig, a city that was 90% German \\"go home to the Reich\\" and already under the control of the Nazi Party posed major difficulties for France and Britain. Coulondre noted in a dispatch to Paris on 21 June 1939: > \\"The majority of the accredited diplomats in Berlin try to see what could be > a compromise solution and are alarmed that they do not. Thus, they are > trapped in a sort of contradiction, for the moment one admits, and they > admit it, the unlimited nature of German National Socialist demands, then > there is no hope of ending them by settling the crisis of Danzig, and > consequently there is no advantage of compromising oneself on the subject. > On the contrary there are major disadvantages\\". As part of the effort to deter Germany from attacking Poland in the summer of 1939, Coulondre was very much in favor of having the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\". Coulondre reported to Paris that he had heard rumors that Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the chief of the OKW, and Field Marshal Walter von Brauchitsch, the Army's commander, had warned Hitler that Germany could not defeat Britain, France, and the Soviet Union all at once, which for him was further evidence of the need to have the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\". In August 1939, Coulondre noted that for the first time the German newspapers were accusing the Poles of insulting \\"German honour\\", an allegation which he noted had last been made in September 1938 when Czechoslovakia had been accused of insulting \\"German honour\\", leading him to conclude: \\"The Hiterian plan continues to develop according to a well-known procedure\\". Coulondre further noted that Danzig crisis was now escalating as the Reich had made the status of the German minority in Poland into an issue instead of just the Free City of Danzig, the city-state which was not part of Poland and was thus potentially easier to resolve than the question of the volksdeutsche minority in Poland. During the Danzig crisis, Coulondre consistently advocated as a solution a compulsory population exchange along the lines of the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923 under which all of the ethnic Germans living in Poland would be expelled into Germany and all the ethnic Poles living in Germany would be expelled into Poland, saying that the Poles and Germans needed to be separated by force if necessary for their own good as the two peoples simply could not get along. =The Last Days of Peace= At the height of the Danzig crisis, Coulondre was summoned to a meeting with Hitler at about 7:00 pm on 25 August 1939. Hitler had scheduled the invasion of Poland for the next day and wanted his peace offer to France to appear before the French cabinet at more or less the same time as the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. Just a few hours before Coulondre had been summoned to the Reich Chancellery, the news had arrived that Britain had reacted to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact by signing a military alliance with Poland, while Italy had announced it would dishonor the Pact of Steel if war should break out, which was contrary to what Hitler had expected, putting him in an aggressive and angry mood, making for an unpleasant interview with Coulondre. Hitler told Coulondre that the dispute with Poland over the Free City of Danzig had reached such a point that war was now inevitable, saying the \\"Polish provocation of the Reich could not be endured any longer\\" but that he did not want a war with France. Hitler told Coulondre that it was France's choice about whatever she fought Germany or not, advising the ambassador that the French should renounce their alliance with Poland. Finally, Hitler taunted Coulondre that the \\"peace front\\" that was meant to \\"contain\\" Germany was in ruins with the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and claimed that Britain would soon be signing a non-aggression pact with the Reich, leaving the French to face Germany alone if they chose to stand up for Poland. Hitler further taunted Coulondre by noting that all of the nations that were supposed to join the \\"peace front\\" like Turkey, Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia had dropped out, saying that nobody would \\"die for Danzig\\". Coulondre told Hitler that he would pass on his message to the French cabinet, but also warned him that France would keep its word and stand by Poland if Germany did indeed choose war. Coulondre assured Hitler as a former soldier for the republic that France would indeed fight for Poland if it came to war, only to be interrupted by Hitler who said: \\"Why, then, give a blank cheque to Poland?\\" Coulondre replied that he as a former poilu he did not want to see another war, but as it was a matter of \\"French honor\\" that Hitler should have no doubts \\"that if Poland is attacked France will be at the side of Poland with all its forces\\". Hitler who had been expecting Coulondre to be like Henderson was taken aback by the French ambassador's assertiveness, replied: \\"It is painful to me to think of having to fight your country, but that does not depend on me. Please say that to Monsieur Daladier\\". At the end of the meeting, Coulondre told Hitler that if it came to war, the only winner would be Leon Trotsky and asked him to reconsider; at the mention of Trotsky, he reported that Hitler looked \\"...as if I had hit him in the stomach\\". The British historian D.C. Watt wrote that Coulondre was \\"a tougher man than Henderson. He gave as good as he got-even mentioning the alleged victim of Polish assassination who had actually died a month earlier in a domestic crime of passion. Hitler listened, shouted and repeated himself. Coulondre took his leave, the victor of that little encounter\\". The next day, 26 August, Coulondre passed on to Hitler a letter from Daladier, saying that as one veteran of World War I to another begging him not to plunge the world into the \\"madness of war\\" again, but that France would fight if Germany did invade Poland. Coulondre told Hitler \\"in the name of humanity, for the repose of his own conscience not to let pass this last chance of a peaceful solution\\". At another point, Coulondre spoke of all of millions of women and children that would die if the Danzig crisis came to war. Coulondre reported to Paris that the meeting with Hitler did not go well, with Hitler saying he promised to renounce any claim on Alsace-Lorraine as a sign of his goodwill towards France and the Danzig crisis had now reached such a point that he had no other choice but to attack Poland. Coulondre replied that the war could be stopped and it was only the attitude of Hitler that was making war inevitable. Coulondre reported to Paris his \\"sadness\\" that Daladier's letter had not moved Hitler at all, saying \\"he stands pat\\". In saying that war was now inevitable, Hitler was attempting to intimidate France into abandoning the alliance she signed with Poland in 1921; as this statement contradicted the later German claim that Poland had attacked Germany on 1 September 1939, the text of the Hitler- Coulondre meetings on 25‚Äì26 August 1939 were excluded from The White Book, a collection of documents from the Ausw√§rtiges Amt published in December 1939. However, The Yellow Book, a collection of documents from the Quai d'Orsay published the same month included full transcripts of the Hitler-Coulondre meetings. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the text of the Hitler-Coulondre meetings on 25‚Äì26 August 1939 must had been regarded as embarrassing with Hitler saying he had to invade Poland because of \\"intolerable\\" Polish provocations as Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke who was in charge of editing The White Book not only excluded the text of these meetings from The White Book, but also from the records of Ausw√§rtiges Amt as the transcripts of the meetings survived only in the records of the Quai d'Orsay. After 1 September 1939, the official German line was always that Poland had attacked Germany, which made Hitler's statements to Coulondre that he had to attack Poland problematic. The fact that France did not sever the alliance with Poland as Hitler had hoped, the signing of the Anglo-Polish alliance, Japan breaking off the talks for a military alliance with Germany and the message from Rome that Italy would be neutral all caused Hitler to halt the invasion of Poland and pushed the invasion date back to 1 September to give Ribbentrop more time to sever Britain and France from Poland. The news that Fall Weiss (\\"Case White\\") as the invasion of Poland had been code-named had been delayed for another week did not reach all of the Wehrmacht forces on time. On the morning of 26 August 1939 a number of Wehrmacht units crossed into Poland, engaging in much bloody fighting before retiring back to Germany later the same morning when they received word of Fall Weiss postponement. Coulondre took the reports he heard of fighting along the German-Polish border together with the pull-back of the Wehrmacht forces as meaning that the French deterrence diplomacy was indeed working. For Coulondre, the sudden entry of the Wehrmacht into Poland together with their equally abrupt withdrawal proved that Hitler was bluffing and if France held firm, making it clear that a German invasion of Poland meant war with the republic, then Hitler would back down. After meeting Henderson on 27 August, Coulundre observed that he was dressed in his usual dapper style with the red carnation he always wore on his suit, which Coulondre took as a hopeful sign that Henderson was still keeping his spirits up, which was important for him as he felt that one must never show weakness to the Nazis. On the evening of 27 August 1939, Coulondre wrote a letter to Daladier declaring: \\"One must hold firm, Hitler faced with force is a man who will climb down\\". In support of this thesis, Coulondre mentioned that earlier that day, he had met the German \\"specialist on France\\", the \\"shady writer\\" Friedrich Sieburg, who had told him: \\"the situation was worsening quickly in Germany. Hitler was hesitating, the Party was adrift, the population was grumbling. Germany was supposed to attack Poland on the morning of the 26th. The Fuhrer had decided against it at the last moment\\". Coulondre concluded that Hitler was bluffing and that provided that France and Britain remained resolute, then he would back down rather than chose war. Colondre concluded his dispatch: \\"Hold Fast!\\". On 29 August, Coulondre reported to Paris he felt it was still possible to save the peace. Later the same day, when Coulondre saw the notes that Henderson had made of his meeting with Hitler to discuss the peace plan proposed by the Swedish businessman and amateur diplomat Birger Dahlerus, he noted that Hitler's stalemates were \\"more like a diktat imposed on a conquered country than an agreement to negotiate with a sovereign state\\". Coulondre however reluctantly accepted the Dahlerus plan as it committed Germany to negotiate with Poland to resolve the Danzig crisis, which Hitler had been refusing to do until then, which led to hopes that here was a possible means of preventing a war. After talking to Baron Bernardo Attolico, the Italian ambassador to Germany, about the Dahlerus plan, Coulondre reported to Paris that there was a euphoric air at the Italian embassy in Berlin as Attolico and the rest of Italian diplomats did not want Italy to have to declare neutrality and break the Pact of Steel if the Danzig crisis were to end in war. On the night of 30‚Äì31 August, Coulondre learned of the \\"final offer\\" that Ribbentrop had made to Henderson demanding that a Polish envoy arrived in Berlin that night to discuss resolving the Danzig crisis. Coulondre felt the \\"final offer\\" was just an alibi for aggression, but very reluctantly supported Henderson's contention that an effort should be made to take up the \\"final offer\\" if only to prove Britain and France did everything within their power to save the peace. After visiting the British Embassy to learn about the 15 points of the \\"final offer\\", Coulondre went over to the Polish embassy to see J√≥zef Lipski, the Polish ambassador, to argue that if Poland tried to respond to the \\"final offer\\" despite its absurdly short timeline and the demand that an envoy should fly in to Berlin from Warsaw that night, it would give the Poles the moral high ground. On the evening of 31 August 1939, at a meeting of the French cabinet, Daladier deliberately turned his back on Bonnet and refused to speak to his foreign minister as a way of showing he no longer supported the munichois faction in the cabinet headed by Bonnet. Daladier read out to the cabinet a letter he had received from Coulondre six days before saying: \\"The trial of strength turns to our advantage. It is only necessary to hold, hold, hold!\\" In the last days of August 1939, Coulondre consistently argued that Hitler could be deterred from attacking Poland, and regarded Henderson who still believed that if only Britain would just apply enough pressure on Poland to allow the Free City of Danzig to rejoin Germany, then war could be avoided, as a coward. On the morning of 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Coulondre was in the garden on the French embassy early in the morning of 1 September supervising the building of air raid trenches when he heard word that Germany had attacked Poland earlier that morning. Coulondre went to the Reichstag to listen to Hitler's speech claiming that Poland had just attacked Germany, and at about 10: 00 am he met with Ribbentrop to give him a d√©marche warning that France would fulfill the terms of an alliance with Poland unless Germany ceased the invasion of Poland at once. At about 10: 00pm on 1 September, Coulondre met with Ribbentrop to hand him a note saying that unless Germany stopped its war against Poland at once, France would have to declare war. Coulondre spent 2 September anxious and impatient as he expected to have deliver a declaration of war, but none came from Paris. Mussolini on the evening of 1 September had called for a peace conference to end the German-Polish war, and 2 September Attolico arrived at the French embassy to ask if the French note was an ultimatum, saying if it was not then Mussolini believed he could set up his peace conference. Much to Coulondre's frustration, Bonnet decided to take up Mussolini's peace offer, and instructed him to say the note was not an ultimatum. Attolico told Ribbentrop that based on his talks with Henderson and Coulondre that the Anglo-French notes of 1 September were not ultimatums, and that Germany should attend the peace conference to be hosted by Mussolini. The proposed peace conference collapsed when the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, phoned the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, at about 2 pm to say that Britain would only take part if the Wehrmacht withdrew from Poland at once, saying that a mere ceasefire was insufficient. On the evening of 2 September 1939, Bonnet who was against declaring war on Germany, reluctantly sent a telegram to Coulondre to say that he was expected to deliver an ultimatum to Germany the next day demanding that Germany withdraw its forces from Poland at once. At 8:28pm the same evening, Henderson telephoned Coulondre to say he had received a cable from London telling him that he was to deliver a very important message to Ribbentrop the next day, which he guessed would be an ultimatum and Britain would be at war with Germany tomorrow. As the Forschungsamt (\\"research office\\") as G√∂ring called his private intelligence network was listening in, the contents of Henderson's call were passed on to G√∂ring. Knowing that France was on the brink of war, Coulondre went out for a walk that night, observing the Berliners were all sober and serious, with none of the jingoism of the summer of 1914. During his nocturnal walk down the streets of Berlin, Coulondre noted that nobody he saw was laughing or smiling, leading him to conclude that through the regime wanted war, the German people did not. At 10:30 am on 3 September, Bonnet sent Coulondre a message saying he was to deliver an ultimatum that would expire at 5 pm on 4 September saying France would \\"fulfill...the commitments that France has contracted towards Poland\\" as Bonnet could not bring himself to use the word guerre (war). When Coulondre called Paris on the morning of 3 September to ask what would constitute rejection of the ultimatum, he was informed instead to change the deadline of its acceptance to 5: 00 pm on 3 September. Bonnet had wanted an extra day out of the hope that somehow a deal might be reached to stop the war, but Daladier had decided firmly on war. Colondre complained that the ultimatum that he had written on Bonnet's instructions was too weaselly and convoluted, never using the word war once, and would have preferred something stronger. On 11 am on 3 September 1939, it was announced that a British ultimatum demanding an end to the war against Poland had been rejected and King George VI had gone on the BBC to say his nation was now at war with Germany. Before leaving the French embassy, Coulondre ordered that the embassy staff burn any sensitive documents and as he got into his car to take him to the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, he noticed a small crowd had gathered outside of the embassy. One German teenager stepped up to him and asked in somewhat broken French for his autograph, which struck Coulondre as rather incongruous given that France was going to be at war with Germany later that day. At noon on 3 September 1939, Coulondre went to the Ausw√§rtiges Amt main office on the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin, to be greeted by Weizs√§cker. Coulondre arrived at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, wearing the full ceremonial uniform as an ambassadeur de France, bringing with him the ultimatum in a sealed briefcase and as everyone at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt could guess what was in the briefcase, Coulondre recalled the atmosphere was electric with tension. When Coulondre presented the ultimatum to Weizs√§cker, the latter replied that he was not in a position to know if Germany could withdraw its forces from Poland, which led Coulondre to insist on seeing Ribbentrop. After much stalling on the part of Weizs√§cker who claimed that Ribbentrop was too busy to see the French ambassador, Coulondre finally saw Ribbentrop at about 12:30 pm. After Coulondre read out the ultimatum demanding a German withdrawal from Poland, an angry scene ensured with Ribbentrop accusing France of seeking an \\"aggressive war\\" with Germany, but Coulondre was finally able to get Ribbentrop to say that Germany would not stop its war against Poland, which led him to say in that case, France would be at war as of 5:00 pm that day. Coulondre turned his back on Ribbentrop and Weizs√§cker, leaving the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, never to return. Later life In April 1940, Coulondre was sent on a diplomatic mission to Stockholm that aimed to persuade the Swedes to stop selling Germany iron (most of the German steel was made with Swedish iron). Coulondre served as the French ambassador to Switzerland between 30 May-30 October 1940. On 2 May 1941, as part of the investigation that led to the Riom trial of 1942, Coulondre was questioned by a magistrate about his responsibility and that of Daladier for the French declaration of war against Germany in 1939. The magistrate was looking for information that Daladier had acted criminally in declaring war on Germany, and the answers that Coulondre gave him were such that he did not appear as a witness at the Riom trial. After World War II, Coulondre published his memoirs De Staline √† Hitler : souvenirs de deux ambassades : 1936-1939 in 1950.

Due to silting, etc. it has become part of the southern, Renfrewshire side, of the river bank and is used for grazing cattle and as a nature reserve. The Scots word 'shot' or its spelling variants was an ancient unit for a division of land or alternatively a projecting area of land, a peninsula. A 'Shot' also has the meaning of a place where fishing-nets were generally used and, in salmon fishing terminology, a part of the river from which nets were cast. Islands in the River Clyde Islands of the River Clyde, rather than sand or mud banks only exposed at low water, once included in order, working upstream towards Glasgow :- Milton, Bodinbo, Newshot, Ron, Sand Inch, Kings Inch, Buck Inch, White Inch and Water Inch. A Colin's Isle once sat in the waters of the Cart near its confluence with the River Clyde. The name 'Inch' is Scots deriving from the Gaelic 'Innis', an island. The name 'Ron' in Scots refers to a thicket of hawthorns or rose briers, an area of stunted and crowded woodland. Newshot Island Newshot Island from Park Quay The Palace or Castle of Inchinnan was built circa 1506 by the Darnley family. Largely still standing in 1710, it had been completely demolished by the end of the 18th century and some of its stones used in the construction of a wall built on Newshot Island. In 1745 the lands of Inchinnan, its mill and the Newshots Isles 'within the Floodmark' were granted to James Campbell of Blythswood. Reed beds at Newshot Island. The farm of Garnieland, now demolished, stood near the old Palace of Inchinnan and included the lands and isles of Newshot. Timothy Pont's early 17th century map clearly shows a single 'Neushot' island and by the mid-17th century 'New-Shot' is recorded close to Ron island and opposite Inchinnen Castle. In 1800 the island is recorded as 'Nushet'. The name is 'Newshot' is used by 1832. Newshot Island and Erskine Bridge fields beside Newshot Island Erskine sewage works and Newshot Island Some maps show an islet lying on the south-western side of the main island. By 1896 this islet had joined with the south bank. A beacon or marker indicating the southernmost limit of the Clyde's deep-water channel existed in 1846 chart of the river but was absent by 1864. The OS Name Book of 1856-1857 records Newshot Island as \\"An extensive and very remarkable tract of land following the course of the River Clyde about 1¬Ω miles. On the south side, it is bounded by the \\"Old Channel\\", or former course of the above, tapering at both extremeties. The surface is quite flat, and, excepting the part covered at \\"High Water,\\" may be regarded as very good pasture land.\\" A number of maps from 1800 show a small building on the island and at one time apparent cultivation and hedgerows or dykes. A small raised area on the isle may represent the location of the building. The first direct connection to the Garnieland Farm was a causeway or bridge built towards the upstream end of the isle in 1800 and later in the 19th century a second causeway was built, centred at (NS481702). These causeways may have interfered with the water flow to the extent that silt deposits built up and eventually by 1896 the upstream section of the island became physically land linked to the southern bank. The old river channel thus became silted up whilst the new channel became deep enough for large ships to reach Glasgow. The old river channel also appears to have been used as a site for the mud punts to dispose of the dredgings from the docks at Glasgow. The island has a possible fishing weir remnant built across the inner lagoon. A WWII barrage balloon mooring anchor was located on the island. Ship graveyard The Newshot Island site is a scheduled monument that includes wrecks of mud punts and a diving support vessel. Twenty-eight punts are located here and a circa 1852 iron hulled dive support vessel. Immediately adjacent to the diving support vessel is a square structure. The surrounding dredged material may contain objects dredged from the River Clyde associated with the maintenance linked to the deepening of the River Clyde's navigation channels.

She has published articles in the New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, and Refinery29. Walker is a fat positive activist and her writings reflect an attempt to reclaim the word fat as a mere bodily description‚Äîlike tall or short.  Life and education  Walker grew up in California and Utah, and is now based in New Mexico. Walker received her M.F.A. in creative writing from Bennington College, and her Ph.D. in English from the University of London (2005). Walker started out writing at teen and women's magazines, and later wrote for Our Bodies, Ourselves.  Fat Acceptance Movement and activism  Walker is an adamant supporter of rights and dignity for fat people. As such, she frequently speaks on the assumptions others make about her life because of her body. Ranging from assuming the types of exercises, or lack thereof, to the type of diet she eats, Walker is adamant that people can be healthy at any size and that the mistreatment of her body is a political issue. Walker also believes that literature has not adequately written about fat women. Her first encounters of fat characters in film always embodied somewhat of a tragedy. If it was murder out of jealousy, being the selfless friend to the beautiful leading character by helping him/her ‚Äúgrow‚Äù as a person, or embarking on a desperate journey of losing weight out of self-hatred. Fat people in film usually carried sadness and pity within themselves. Dietland was thus an attempt to cover some of the missing elements in American literature that pertain to fat women. Plum, the main character in Dietland, is a 300 pound woman. Walker also specifically wanted to emphasize that fatness is not always a sign that a person has had trauma, stripping the definition of fatness from its common connotations, and specifically attempting to remove the fundamental stereotype that fat is synonymous with unhealthy. Naming the phenomenon of those who refuse to think fat people can be healthy, Fat Derangement Syndrome, Walker proposes that individuals often do not look at actual scientific studies in regards to the health of fat people, but are more so operating on societal de-valuing of fat people. Walker has publicly stated that London (where she lived for seven years for grad school) was the most fat shaming city she has ever lived in. In addition to her participation in the Fat Acceptance Movement, Walker is also a feminist and frequently criticizes the objectification of women, and violence against women. She is also clear that she does not write characters that are \\"perfect women.\\" As an act of feminism, in fact, she purposefully does not concern herself with likeability issues for her characters, and focuses instead on making characters that are accurately flawed. As such, she creates characters that do not fit into the conventions of likeable womanhood (i.e. skinny and kind), and instead writers characters that do not fit neatly into any category.

Military career =World War II= Yancey was assigned to the Marine Raiders in World War II and became the body guard to Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson, the commander of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion. In November 1942, during the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Solomon Islands, Yancey's leadership in a strategic battle earned him the Navy Cross and a battlefield commission to lieutenant. He also served in the Battle of Iwo Jima. After World War II, he served in the Marine Corps Reserve unit in Little Rock (at the time Company C of the 15th Infantry Battalion) until it was called to active service in the summer of 1950.Marine Corps History Department.

With 2/7, he fought in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, where he earned his second Navy Cross and a Silver Star. On 4 November 1950, Lieutenant Yancey led 2nd Platoon, Company E, 2/7 in the assault on Hill 698, a key position in the Chinese defenses near Sudong, North Korea. After close combat with grenades and small arms, his platoon took the hill, and held it after a fierce counterattack.Story of Marines, pp. 7-13. On 27‚Äì28 November 1950, Lieutenant Yancey led his platoon in the defense of Hill 1282, which resulted in fierce hand-to-hand combat.Story of Marines, pp. 169-175. During the Battle of Hill 1282, Yancey continued to lead his Marines, despite being severely wounded.Story of Marines, pp. 174-175. Lt Yancey found himself as an infantry platoon leader at the Chosin Reservoir. Chinese forces sought to overwhelm his unit on critical high ground at Yudam-ni. Yancey led his platoon in hand-to- hand combat through the sub-zero night. A grenade exploded near him, lodging a piece of shrapnel in the roof of his mouth. A bullet tore through his nose. A second bullet pierced his right cheek, knocking out his teeth, popping his eye out of socket, and lodging in the back of his neck. Yancey remained in the fight until he lost so much blood he couldn't move and could no longer see. For his awe-inspiring determination and fighting spirit, Yancey was nominated for the Medal of Honor. All his senior officers were killed at Chosin Reservoir, and no one could write an official report of his actions that night. He eventually wound up receiving his second Navy Cross. = Post-Korean War = After having received severe wounds in Korea, then-First Lieutenant Yancey was treated at US Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Japan. His story was re-told by a fellow officer there and the recording is held at the national archives.

She was the first woman in Sweden to have been a formally trained and licensed elementary school teacher, when given special dispensation to study and graduate from the teachers' seminary in Gothenburg (Folkskoleseminariet i G√∂teborg) in 1846. Esbj√∂rn Larsson. Helena Larsdotter Westerlund (Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon, CC BY 4.0, h√§mtad 2018-03-08) Biography She was from Svenljunga parish in V√§stra G√∂taland, Sweden. Originally a teacher of a village school, she was one of many women school teachers to be inducted in the new compulsory elementary school system when it was introduced in Sweden in 1842. The previous village schools, which was not subjected to government regulation, was dominated by women teachers, but when the compulsory education system was introduced by the state, the new regulation demanded formally educated teachers, which was not possible for women as no state schools where open to them. As there was a lack of educated male school teachers because of the great female domination in this field, the former women teachers where often allowed to stay on, officially only as temporary stand in-teachers. Westerlund was the first woman to be granted dispensation to study and graduate from a state teacher's college; she was granted her teacher's licence after only one months' study period (1846), which appears to have been but a formality, and continued to be the first woman formally employed as a teacher in the state education system as well as the first one granted a teacher's pension from the state when she retired in 1861. She was active in Kalv parish in V√§sterg√∂tland. In 1859, women where formally allowed to teach in the compulsory education system. When she retired, she was the first woman granted a state pension as a teacher. She retired to the home of her niece at H√•ckvik parish in Svenljunga.

It was built from 1908. It is also known as the Kendall Community Centre and known locally as Kendall Hall. The property is owned by Kendall Community Centre. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site was proposed to be set apart as a site for a School of Arts in 1892. The land was excised from Camping Reserve No. 132, which had been notified on 1 August 1881. The Camping Reserve was used to rest horses and bullock teams after logs were brought from the forests to the Kendall timber mills. In 1908 the existing timber building was erected. It was officially opened in 1910. The name Kendall School of Arts remained in official use until 1984. The traditional role of Schools of Arts was to provide venues for lectures, classes and libraries for the useful knowledge and mental and moral improvement of the working class. In the early 20th century Schools of Arts had become important social and political meeting places as well as places of entertainment: social evenings, debutante balls and later the showing of moving pictures. Kendall School of Arts is one of at least seven surviving Schools of Arts within an 80 kilometre radius that were built between Federation and World War I. Following the loss of the supper room roof during a storm in 1983, the residents of Kendall met to determine the future of the building. Five options were given ranging from sale, total demolition for a part, demolition and replacement with a new building and essential repairs only to complete restoration. The vote was in favour of restoration. In 1984 the name School of Arts was changed to Community Centre. However, it is generally called Kendall Hall. Both the Commonwealth Office and the Heritage Office provided funding for the restoration. The building continues to fulfill all the traditional functions of a School of Arts. The Camden Haven Learning Exchange was established there in 1982, to move in 1991 to Laurieton as Camden Haven Adult and Community Education. Kendall Community Pre-School was established in 1988 and operated in the Hall for several years. Currently the side rooms are occupied by the Community Technology Centre which was established in 2003. Kendall School of Arts is in full time use. Many different community activities and meetings are held there and its superb acoustics are widely admired. It is the home of several major events and festivals and remains the social and cultural hub of the district.  Description  The symmetrical Kendall School of Arts is built of timber and has a corrugated galvanised iron roof. It occupies a commanding site at the top of the village shopping centre. It is well sited on a sloping triangular piece of land which addresses the Y intersection of Comboyne and Albert Streets. The apex of the triangle is truncated by an unofficial road on the eastern side.Van Kempen, Elaine (2004) Heritage Impact Statement The adjacent 1919 Kendall War memorial and surrounding open space complements the hall site, even though it intersects the view from the shopping centre. the hall is dug into the ground on the northern (Comboyne Road) side and is high off the ground on the southern (Albert Street) side. A supper room is attached on the southern elevation. The rear of the building has lesser additions of stage and dressing rooms. In 1973 the former one-roomed Batar Creek State School was moved to the rear of the site, for the use of youth of the district. It occupies the site of a former nineteenth century cottage. The vista from the front of the Hall encompasses the mix of residential, commercial and industrial buildings that is the centre of the village of Kendall. Similarly, the hall dominates the view from the shopping centre. The dwellings on Comboyne and Albert Streets opposite the Hall are predominately turn of the century timber cottages, some with Victorian detailing. A mature, double trunked Camphor laurel dominates the Comboyne Street boundary and is flanked by two small silky oak trees, which were planted in 1988 to commemorate the bicentenary of European occupation of Australia. Only one other listed building, an outstanding Federation house, is adjacent to the School of Arts. It is situated approximately a hundred metres away just over the nearby Comboyne Street hill but neither building is visible from the other.  Heritage listing  The Kendall School of Arts is significant as, along with the Kendall Railway Station, it is an important indicator of Kendall's major period of commercial and social activity, which began in 1900. It has been in continuous use as a community venue for almost 100 years, a continuing tradition. It is well built of local timber and therefore indicative of the timber industry, which was the major local industry for approximately 100 years. It has outstanding and widely recognised acoustic properties. Kendall School of Arts was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The existing Kendall Hall has been maintained as a community facility since its construction. It is a significant focal point for the community. Its function, for which it was built, has remained constant. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

It was designed by James Barnet and built in 1869 by Butler and Bourne. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The land for the present Courthouse was allotted in the 1830s, during which time Port Macquarie was gazetted for a Court of Petty Sessions. In September 1836 the newly appointed Police Magistrate, William Nairn Gray, recommended that a brick building in Hay Street (occupied by Stephen Partridge) be used as court as the present Police Office was too small and not fit for court. On 14 August 1838, Port Macquarie was gazetted as a place for trial by jury. During the 1840s complaints were lodged about the dilapidated state of the courthouse. In 1852 repairs to the building were authorised. In 1865 a letter from Charles Sinclair, Police Magistrate, was sent to the Colonial Architect regarding the poor state of the building. On 14 September 1867 a notice was placed in the Government Gazette calling for tenders for the erection of a courthouse and lockup at Macquarie. Tenders closed at noon on 8 October 1867. The building was designed by James Barnet and the builder chosen for the task was Butler and Bourne of Port Macquarie who bid 875 pounds. The acceptance of the tender was announced in the Government Gazette on 25 October 1867. A journalist who travelled with Sir John Robertson and Mr Forster when they visited Port Macquarie on 12 November 1868, clearly explained the need for a new courthouse in the town by describing the state of the existing building. 'This is a very dilapidated place indeed and looks both externally and internally, as though it was in the very last stages of decay. The verandahs were choked up with piles of bricks, plaster and other debris and the inner walls were as dingy and damp as neglect could make them. This is the place where the \\"nomination\\", was to \\"come off\\" on the following Monday and I should fancy that it would be the closing scene of this seedy old ruin's career as a courthouse. It is to be degraded into a stable for the police horses and the very magisterial dais itself is to become the depository of cattle fodder.' The journalist remarked upon the construction underway on the current historic courthouse which was 'within a stone's throw' of the old building. The journalist also noted the omission of jury rooms, an omission that would have a bearing on the ultimate decision to build another courthouse in 1986. 'It is a very neat building built of brick and nearly completed. the walls are all but finished and part of the edifice is roofed. A rather awkward mistake, however, has been made in the plan of the courthouse. No provision has been made for the jury rooms and, as these apartments are indispensably necessary they will have to be added to the new building.' The courthouse's construction cost more than anticipated - a total of 109 pounds plus 10 pounds for furniture. The additional cost of 205 pounds was made necessary to overcome dampness. The building opened its doors as a courthouse in 1869. The first additions were made to the building in 1890 when 303 pounds was spent on extensions on the western wing which was carried out under the control of James Barnet. 1900 photographs reveal the changes to the courthouse with verandahs, the walls in face brick, the roof in slate with galvanised metal cappings and timber floors internally and to the verandahs. The external ground line appears to have been lower. In 1974 a concrete floor was laid in the court, magistrate's and judge's rooms. In 1986 the Justice Department vacated the building. A community campaign led to the granting of trusteeship of the building to Hastings Municipal Council. Recognising the significance of the building to the status of Port Macquarie as an important historic town, Council engaged a conservation specialist to prepare a report on its condition and the likely cost of conservation work. Evidence of original finishes was found in early photographs and 100 year old measured drawings, and by researching similar court houses of the period.Pennay, 1996, 9 Through a grant from the Heritage Properties Restoration Programme and community fundraising the restoration costs were met. Work on the restoration began on 12 February 1993. Concrete floors were removed and replaced by new timber, shingles were reinstated on the roof and second-hand bricks laid under the verandah awning. All joinery was repainted, except for the cedar doors leading into the court room, which were stripped and clear-finished.Pennay, 1996 The works were completed on 8 October 1993.Hastings Council 1994Architectural Projects 1992:17-20 Following its reopening by the Premier of New South Wales the building is now used as a justice museum with interpretive displays depicting the town's early days as a penal settlement.  Description  The block is on the corner of Clarence and Hay Streets. The site has two large mature Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) on the eastern side of the courthouse (which enhance the building's setting).National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1982 Much of the rest of the surrounds of the building is grassed. The former court house is a symmetrically planned single storey Victorian Georgian painted brick building of unpretentious form with a central gabled portion (the courtroom) and smaller hipped roofed wings on either side. Roofs are of premium grade bloodwood shingles, with chimneys retaining their metal pots. Doors are four-panelled and windows are large paned. There is a simple verandah with iron roofs to three sides on squared timber posts. The interior is made up one major room, the Courtroom and originally four, since modified to three, secondary rooms. These rooms contained the Clerk of Petty Sessions on the West Wing and the Magistrates and Judges room on the East wing.Architectural Projects, 1992: 31-32 The physical condition of the building was reported as good at 16 October 1997. The archaeological potential was reported as medium, with evidence of convict drains occurring in the eastern part of the site. The volume and massing of the courthouse have sustained little external change since its initial conception.Architectural Projects 1992:36  Heritage listing  The courthouse reflects the role of Port Macquarie in the late 19th century as a centre of public administration. It is an early example of James Barnet's phase with the Colonial Architect's office and typical of the Victorian Georgian style. It is one of the last 19th century buildings remaining in Port Macquarie. It makes an important contribution to the historic centre of the town and has important relationships with the adjacent Museum, Garrison Centre and Police Lock up buildings. Courthouse and Norfolk Island pines was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The courthouse reflects the role of Port Macquarie in the late 19th century as a centre of Public administration. The courthouse is an early work of James Barnet's phase of the Colonial Architect office typical of the Victorian Georgian style. Its date of design in 1867-1869 locates it amongst the earlier examples of Country Court Houses when Barnet had more direct contact with the projects. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The courthouse contributes to the historic centre of the town including the adjacent museum, Garrison Centre and police lock up buildings.

It was built from 1835 to 1840 by William Stokes. It is also known as Port Macquarie Historical Society Museum and Port Macquarie Museum. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The museum building was used as a store until well into the twentieth century. The block of land on which the Museum now stands was purchased at auction by Edward McRoberts on 14 February 1834 for 13 pounds 8 shillings, 8 pence. The titles were issued to him on 22 December 1834. The older western portion of this building was probably erected between 1835 and 1840. It was owned by Mr W. Stokes sometime after 1834 but little is known until 17 January 1853 when Samuel H. and Elizabeth Cohen, storekeepers, sold out to William Killion, another storekeeper, for 75 pounds. He in turn sold out to another storekeeper, James H. Young on 25 January 1868 for 60 pounds. Young sold to Francis Marchment on 6 September 1881 for 120 pounds and it was about this time that the eastern section was added. The property remained in the marchment family until sold to A. P. Hayward on 14 January 1925.(Port Macquarie Historical Society) Francis Marchment (1843-1923) occupied this building from 1881 to 1925. He immigrated from Gloucestershire in 1862 and arrived in Port Macquarie in 1869 with his partner George Day. They procured a 3 tonne cutter and traded extensively on the Hastings River particularly to Rawdon Island and Beechwood. Day sold out after a short time. Trade was chiefly by barter, the settlers providing cedar logs, hides, poultry and corn in return for sugar, flour, tea, salt and clothes. The cedar logs were towed in rafts behind the cutter. His traders horn was a welcome sound to the settlers along the river, as his cutter was the only contact with the outside world and for fresh supplies. He met his wife Christina Newberry 1855-1911 at Rawdon Island. There was a family of seven sons and two daughters most of whom were born in this building. It was taken over by the Hastings Historical Society in 1959 and progressively reconstructed with major additions in 1968 and 1977. During the initial renovations and restoration evidence of alterations during its earlier existence were found together with foundation bricks bearing arrows and other convict marks. Later extensions have been made to accommodate additional research, storage and display areas and office space. In 2013 the Society commissioned a Cultural Tourism Plan from Kevin Williams of Sydney Scenes, with a grant from the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. A copy was lodged with the Heritage Council in 2014 and it made recommendations to improve the museum's sustainability.Sommers, 2016, 2  Description  The architectural style is Old Colonial Georgian. It is a simple two-story building of painted brick construction (hand-made bricks) with hipped iron roof over the original shingles and two chimneys. The roof was formerly gable, but changed when a 13 ft extension was made to the eastern end of the building in the late nineteenth century. This extension involved the removal of an internal staircase attached to the eastern wall. A skillion kitchen formerly extended along the southern wall of the building. Ceilings and upstairs internal walls are boarded. The building was derelict when leased by the Hastings District Historical Society in 1959. Restoration included new flooring to the ground floor, new staircase, paintwork and guttering, replacement of fireplace surrounds, and erection of an annexe. Major extensions were made on the south side in 1968 and in 1977. There were further extensions to the rear of the building in 1988.Suters Architects Snell, 1991 The physical condition of the building was reported as excellent as at 11 October 2004. The archaeological potential is medium. Underfloor deposits of convict built bricks have been found during renovation and evidence of earlier building alterations. = Modifications and dates = * 1834 - store built * 1880s - extension to eastern end of building * 1959 - renovated * 1968 - extension on the south side * 1977 - extension on the south side * 1988 - further extensions to the rear of the building  Heritage listing  The museum building demonstrates the form scale and style of development which took place when free settlement was permitted in Port Macquarie. One of the only surviving early commercial and residential buildings in Port Macquarie. Located near other historic buildings such as the Courthouse and The Garrison. As a museum it continues to provide a focus for historical research and heritage within the community.

The site was chosen by Captain Allman, and it was in use from 1822 to 1824. It is also known as Allman Hill Burying Ground, Port Macquarie Burying Ground and Old Port Macquarie Cemetery. The property is owned by Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 July 2005.  History  In the early days of the Penal Settlement at Port Macquarie it was appreciated that there would be a need for a burial ground. The absence of wheeled vehicles and the wooded nature of the surrounding countryside probably dictated the chosen site, on a convenient hillside, with good drainage, easy tilling and relative remoteness from the centre of the then settlement. The first burial of convict James McMahon took place on 22 July 1822, and the last of a total of 28 interments was that of convict John Abrahams, on 14 November 1824. By this time there was a need for a new burial ground, further from the settled area, and the Second Burying Ground was established, on a peninsula to the south of the Settlement.  Description  Allman Hill Burying Ground is located on an exposed grassy site with a northerly aspect at the top of a slope overlooking the breakwater at the mouth of the Hastings River. The site drops away sharply to the north to the foreshore parkland and a caravan park. It is bounded on the west by multi-storey residential development, on the south by Clarence Street and on the east by public parklands, with tourist parking and picnic facilities. The majority of the 28 burial sites are unmarked. The four remaining monuments on Allman Hill are within a four-metre square fenced enclosure, two stelae having been relocated from their original positions nearby. There are no ornamental plantings at the Allman Hill Burying Ground although cement urns at two corners of the concrete slabs were apparently once planted with pelargoniums.Betteridge 2001 The landscape was modified on several occasions in conversion to public parkland. The First Burying Ground is generally in good condition. It is managed as an historic site and public parkland, with four surviving monuments set in a concrete slab within an iron palisade fence. The burial area is likely to have extended a considerable distance beyond the present area occupied by monuments i.e., on the slopes of the hill. The original cemetery area was reduced when Clarence Street extended, thereby separating the extant cemetery site from the land now occupied by East Port Macquarie Primary School. The site has considerable archaeological potential. The cemetery has lost much of its original fabric, however, it retains four very early monuments, from the convict era at Port Macquarie.  Heritage listing  The cultural landscape of the Allman Hill Burying Ground at Port Macquarie is of State Heritage Significance as a place of historical, social, architectural, cultural, archaeological and aesthetic significance for the Hastings region and the State of New South Wales. The Allman Hill Burying Ground is important in the course and pattern of the cultural history of New South Wales because of its historical associations and significant documentary and physical evidence of the evolution of the place, being the burial place for at least 28 persons, whose lives contributed to and enriched the history and development of a significant settlement in New South Wales. The Allman Hill Burying Ground is historically significant at a State level for its strong associations with a number of individuals and families important in the development of Port Macquarie and New South Wales. The Allman Hill Burying Ground is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics in New South Wales. The cemetery exhibits two monumental styles reflecting contemporary approaches to the commemoration of the dead. The setting for the burying ground, on a hillside overlooking the mouth of the Hastings River produces a dramatic cultural landscape with high visual appeal. The Allman Hill Burying Ground has strong associations for social and cultural reasons with the past and contemporary community of Port Macquarie, an area settled early in the development of the colony of New South Wales. The high esteem in which the place is held by a significant group within the community is reflected in the fact that its conservation is widely supported by the local community of Port Macquarie, the site is visited by many tourists to the area and the place is listed on several registers of heritage items. The Allman Hill Burying Ground has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW's cultural history. The cemetery has considerable educational and interpretative potential as a resource for the study of subjects such as architecture, design, social history and genealogy for present and future generations of Australians. By virtue of its early date of commencement (1821, prior to the commencement of civil registration of births, deaths and marriages in NSW), historical associations and surviving monuments, the Allman Hill Burying Ground possesses rare aspects of NSW's cultural history.

It was in use from 1824 to 1886. The property is owned by Port Macquarie-Hastings Council (Local Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 July 2005.  History  The dramatic rise in the population of Port Macquarie and consequent increase in deaths, required authorities to select a new burying ground to replace the first one on Allman Hill, overlooking the mouth of the Hastings River. The site chosen was a peninsula of ground south of the settlement, at the confluence of the present Wrights and Kooloonbung Creeks. The four acre site selected had been described by John Oxley in 1818 as being bushy, and hence must have been cleared for the purposes of a cemetery. The first burial, that of an infant, Elizabeth Murphy, took place towards the south end of the peninsula on 15 November 1824. The Second Burying Ground was dedicated as a Reserve for the Preservation of Graves on 2 July 1863. Between 1824 and 1886, when the cemetery was closed to burials, some 1,400 individuals were interred there, many of them convicts from the early penal settlement. On 21 December 1910, the Second Burying Ground was formally dedicated for the Preservation of Graves. The conditions of the cemetery deteriorated for several decades, and it was not until the 1960s that efforts were made to restore and recognise the significance of the cemetery as the last resting place of many of those who had contributed to the establishment and development of Port Macquarie and the Hastings district. Unfortunately by this time many of the burial sites had become obscured and most monuments had fallen into disrepair. Today only 92 funerary monuments or parts thereof remain on site. A memorial plaque to those interred was erected in April 1963. In the 1980s, the site was converted to a Nature Park with planting of ornamental trees and shrubs, the construction of a brick pathway, erection of directional signage and some interpretative signs. A pavilion, interpretative shelter and toilet block were erected 1990s. Some significant monuments were restored in the early 1990s.  Description  The Second Burying Ground occupies a hilly peninsula at the southern edge of the commercial area of Port Macquarie, north of the confluence of the present day Wrights and Kooloonbung Creeks. The northern edge of the cemetery is defined by Gordon Street, a major east-west thoroughfare in the town and the other three sides of the cemetery adjoin the Kooloonbung nature Park, an area of conserved wetland, arboretum and parkland. The cemetery was reported to generally be in good condition as at 23 February 2010. It is managed as an historic site and public parkland, with surviving monuments scattered through the landscape. A perimeter brick path provides access around the cemetery and through the town centre to the nature Park. Many of the monuments have been set in concrete slabs. While this may have protected some of them from damage as a result of vandalism, it has exacerbated rising damp problems in susceptible sandstone and has a negative visual impact on the cultural landscape. None of the original path network is visible and most of the approximately 1,400 burials are unmarked. The burial area is likely to have extended a considerable distance beyond the present area occupied by monuments i.e. on the slopes of the hill. The site has considerable archaeological potential.Betteridge 2002 Whilst the cemetery has lost much of its original fabric, it retains many early monuments including those from the convict era at Port Macquarie.

She was a star actor and alongside Andreas Widerberg one of the theater's main attractions. Not just an actress but also a singer, it was reportedly she and Andreas Widerberg which made it possible for the director Johan von Blanc to stage opera at the theater, otherwise at that point only possible in Stockholm. In 1783, she and Andreas Widerberg starred in the French operetta Annette et Lubin by Jean-Fran√ßois Marmontel, which introduced opera at the Gothenburg stage with great success, and the same season, Anna Catharina and Andreas Widerberg announced their engagement in the press to the audience with a poem, in which it was stated that the income from the performance had been granted them as a wedding gift. In 1790, Anna Catharina Widerberg accompanied her spouse to Stockholm after he had been engaged there at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, but does not seem to have been active as an actor herself after this.

It was built from 1823 to 1827 by convict labour under military supervision. The property is owned by the Anglican Diocese of Grafton. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 October 2002.  History  The location of what is now Port Macquarie was first discovered by Europeans when it was found by the Surveyor General of New South Wales, John Oxley in 1818. Lachlan Macquarie, then Governor of New South Wales, was impressed by reports of the area noting its valuable timber reserves, its suitable farm lands, and its seaboard location for ready passage by ship to and from Sydney, and thus established Port Macquarie as a penal settlement in 1821. It was one of only two places for secondary punishment of convicts in New South Wales outside Sydney. The site for Anglican worship in the newly established penal settlement was reputedly chosen by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, although it seems that Governor Brisbane believed that this would not be a permanent arrangement when he wrote that 'the Church was to be so constructed that it could be used for other purposes when no longer required as a place of worship.' A simple ground plan and elevation of St Thomas' exist and are believed to be \\"progress drawing\\" of the Church. The drawings are signed by the Lieutenant T. H. Owen, Engineer and Inspector of Works in Port Macquarie from January 1825 to September 1827. Little is known about T. H. Owen or if he actually designed the building. The Church foundation stone was laid by Lieutenant G. R. Carmac, Acting Commandant, also Engineer and Inspector of Public Works, on the 8 December 1824, at a service conducted by the Reverend Thomas Hassall who had been appointed as Chaplain to the settlement in August of the same year. The building was constructed by convict labour under military supervision and although was completed in February 1827, the first public service of worship was not held in the building until February 1828 upon the arrival from Windsor of the Reverend John Cross. At the time the population stood at 820 souls of which only 153 were free. This began the long and faithful ministry of \\"Parson Cross\\" as he was familiarly known, not only to the people of Port Macquarie but to all who resided on the Hastings, Wilson, Macleay and Manning Rivers for such was the extent of the parish until new ecclesiastical districts were established in 1858 and 1860 respectively. Just prior to the laying of the foundation stone, the Commandant Captain John Rolland died of sunstroke on 16 November 1824. It has been reported in several old publications \\"that if his body was buried in the local cemetery, they (the convicts) would tear it up, as he was so much detested.\\" Although other reports suggest Captain Rolland was one of the wisest, most competent, kind and enlightened administrator to serve the Colony. The true story appears to be that, as there was no dedicated burial ground in existence at that time (the first burial ground at Allman Hill overlooking the mouth of the Hastings River having been closed prior to Captain Rolland's death and the \\"Historic\\" Cemetery in Gordon Street not opened) the only hallowed ground in the settlement, namely the Church, was considered to be the rightful place in which to lay him to rest. The Commandant was subsequently buried in the precincts of the Church to be, and his grave stone is to be found in the nave under the southeast box pew. Two other buildings stand within the grounds of St Thomas', namely the Military Surgeon's Residence and the Hospital Dispensary which were also erected by convict labour under military supervision between the years 1821 and 1823. By 1847, both buildings were transferred form the Crown to the Church. Under the supervision of the Reverend Thomas Hassall, a Church School was established and by May 1825 it was reported to the Archdeacon of the Colony, Thomas Hobbs Scott, that Gamaliel Farrell was schoolmaster with 56 pupils. When St Thomas' was opened in 1828, the school moved into the nave of the Church and later into the surgeon's dispensary when it ceased to be used by the government medical officer. A storm in 1839 resulted in the partial destruction of the Church. As the Government of New South Wales would not provide funds, reconstruction of the Church was carried out by local labour with gifts from the community. In 1840 a seraphine was purchased and no doubt was used in the conjunction with the orchestral instruments. This organ was moved from the north-east corner of the nave into the Organ Gallery which was constructed at the western end in 1844. In 1854 the shingle roof was destroyed and was reshingled in 1855. In 1856 the existing pipe organ was purchased in London from Walker Brothers in December 1856 and arrived at St Thomas' on 11 June 1857 and placed in the organ gallery. The shingles were replaced with galvanised iron in 1883 which was replaced in 1923 by terra cotta tiles after the roof was re-pitched higher. In 1897 a hurricane severely damaged the eastern wall of the Church and an extensive appeal to raise funds was held. Daughter churches of St Thomas' were built and opened at Kempsey in 1858, Taree in 1860, Beechwood in 1880, Ennis in 1888, Rollands Plains in 1895, Telegraph Point in 1900, Wauchope in 1900, Rawdon Island in 1906, Ellenborough in 1907 and Pembroke in 1923. Church schools were operated in Port Macquarie from 1824, Taree from 1857, Kempsey from 1858 and Rollands Plains from 1862. In 1988 the tower clocks were donated and installed and conservation works to the northeast quadrant of box pews completed, with three other quadrants restored in 1999. In 2002-03, a Federal heritage grant of $69,883 was awarded for works to the site.  Description  =Church= St Thomas' Church is situated on what was known as Church Hill, a large block of land overlooking the city centre of Port Macquarie. The Church presents itself as a simple structure in both form and fabric. The building is of classical orthogonal form with symmetrical facades, rectangular tower with battlemented parapet, and pointed arch windows. The construction is of Flemish bond convict-made bricks, timber windows and doors and a tiled gable roof. The overall form is deviated only by the vestry to the south, itself a simple smaller version of the nave - a rectangular brick structure with tiled gable roof. The scale of the Church is grand yet gentle in its surrounds overlooking a spreading landscape. St Thomas' may be described as Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque. Key style indicators at St Thomas; include the symmetrical facade, tower, battlemented parapet, pointed arch motif and timber tracery. Georgian in style, rectangular in plan with a square tower at the west end. Roof to tower is a flat membrane, with battlemented parapet. Constructed of Flemish Bond face brickwork with lancet windows. Gabled roof form is in terracotta tile. Distinctive convict markings (such as frogs, and tally bricks) can be seen in the brickwork adjacent to entry door. Copper gutters and downpipes. Cedar joinery throughout interior. =Walker Organ= The finger and barrel organ is of one manual, five stops, pedals permanently couples to the manual keys, with mechanical (tracker) action. The organ has a keyboard compass of 54 notes and a pedal board of 20 notes. =Landscape= The immediate landscape of the Church grounds is dominated by several Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla), in various stages of maturity. The site's landmark setting is enhanced by three large Norfolk Island pines planted by the three stepsons of Reverend Kemp, as his memorial. Other trees include several large Norfolk Island hibiscus (Lagunaria patersonae) and many Umbrella trees (Schefflera actinophylla) along western boundary. Several eucalypts and some palms line the boundary to Murray Street and various native shrubs and trees line William Street. Other features include original access paths, convict retaining walls, and rolling lawns. =Colonial Chapel of Christ the Healer (former Dispensary/School Hall)= A single storied rectangular brick building with hipped metal roof and double hung multipaned windows. =The Office (former Surgeon's Residence and Rectory)= A single storied brick house with hipped metal roof with a verandah on three sides. It was substantially altered in 1937 and a new masonry verandah wall and portico added while the second storey was demolished. The physical condition of the church was reported as generally good as at 8 April 2002. Archaeological potential is high. The Church is significant for its remaining original fabric, such as the brickwork, the timber and joinery work, the floor paving, portions of the box pews and cedar wainscotting, and much of the movable heritage housed within the Church.Suters Architects Snell P/L, 1999 = Modifications and dates = * 1818 - Hastings River discovered by Oxley * 1821 - Port Macquarie established as a peal settlement * 1821 - Dispensary (now Colonial Chapel) and Surgeon's Residence (now Parish Office) built * 1824 - Captain Rolland dies and buried in the nave, laying of the foundation stone * 1827 - Church building completed * 1828 - Church opened for public worship, nave used as school * 1830 - Port Macquarie opened to free settlers * 1832 - Tower flooded * 1839 - Church partially destroyed by hurricane * 1844 - Gallery added * - Vestry added * 1846 Original brick floor tiles replaced with paving bricks brought from Woolloomooloo * 1847 - Surgeon's residence and Dispensary transferred from Crown to Church * 1854 - Shingle roof destroyed by hurricane and replaced * 1857 - Lath & plaster ceiling replaced with cedar boarding * 1857 - Walker organ installed * 1858 - Gallery extended across western windows * 1883 - Shingled roof replaced with corrugated iron * 1897 - Church badly damaged by hurricane * - Gale unroofed Church * 1905 - Aisles cemented * 1906 - Leadlight window depicting St Thomas donated * 1923 - Roof pitched higher, fitted with terracotta tiles * 1924 - Chancel floor concreted * 1962 - Wurlitzer organ gifted to Church by Dr R and Mrs Lane * 1970 - Gallery rebuilt to its original design and Walker organ relocated to Gallery. * 1970 - Spiral staircase built in tower.

Built to instructions from Governor Brisbane, the site having been selected by Governor Macquarie and completed during the term of Governor Darling, it is one of the few remaining buildings dating from the convict period - constructed prior to rearrangement of the plan of the township in 1831. It demonstrates the longevity of the Anglican faith in the Port Macquaries area and Hastings Valley region since the area was established as a secondary convict settlement in 1821. The site with the Church, the associated buildings, and the landscape, forms an important focus in the Port Macquarie townscape and is linked with its formation, continued growth and development. The significance of the place is enhanced by its landmark setting, and by its age and the intactness of much of the convict built fabric. The site holds high potential for archaeological research and understanding.Hastings CouncilNational Trust The site's landmark setting is enhanced by three large Norfolk Island pines, (Araucaria heterophylla), planted by the three stepsons of Reverend Kemp, as his memorial.

Usually, the power loss factor refers to extraction steam turbines in thermal power stations, which conduct a part of the steam in a heating condenser for the production of useful heat, instead of the low pressure part of the steam turbine where is could perform mechanical work. Power loss within an extraction steam turbine: CHP plant section (left) and T-s-diagram (right) \\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P_\\\\text{el}}{\\\\dot Q_\\\\text{utile}} The picture on the right shows in the left part the principle of steam extraction. After the intermediate-pressure section of the turbine, i.e. before the low-pressure section, steam is diverted and flows into the heating condenser, where it transfers heat to the heating circuit (temperature level TH about 100 ¬∞C) and liquefies. The remaining steam works in the low-pressure section of the turbine and is then liquefied in the condenser at approx. 30 ¬∞C. Then it is fed via the condensate pump to the feedwater circuit. The partial steam flow, which goes into the heating condenser at high temperature can no longer work in the low-pressure section and is responsible for the loss of power. The right-hand side of the picture shows the associated T-s diagram (see Rankine cycle) for an operating state in which half of the waste heat is used for heating purposes. To the left of the red square, the white area below the red line corresponds to the waste heat (qout), which is released via the condenser to the environment (ambient temperature level TA). The entire red area corresponds to the useful heat (qheat), the upper hatched part of this area corresponds to the power loss in the low pressure stage. Modern cogeneration plants have power loss ratios of about 1/5 to 1/9 when delivering heat in the range of 80 ¬∞C-120 ¬∞C.Danny Harvey: Clean building - contribution from cogeneration, trigeneration and district energy, Cogeneration and On-Site Power Production, september‚Äìoctober 2006, pp. 107-115 (Fig. 1) That means in exchange of one kWh of electrical energy ca. 5 up to 9 kWh of useful heat are obtained. Based on the equivalence of power loss and gain of heat, the power loss method assigns CO2 emissions and primary energy from the fuel to the useful heat and the electrical energy.

It is one of the sixteen Districts of Sierra Leone. Its capital and largest town is Bendugu. Other towns in Falaba District include Falaba, Sikunia, Krubola, Bafolia and Yiffin. Falaba District is divided into thirteen chiefdoms. Falaba District is one of the largest Districts in Sierra Leone in land area, However, it is one of the least most populous districts in the country. Falaba District has a population of 205,353, based on 2018 estimate. In 2016, Falaba District was created out of Koinadugu District, and declared a newly created district by then Sierra Leone\\"s president Ernest Bai Koroma, and was ratified by the Parliament of Sierra Leone to officially become a district in the same year of 2016. Falaba District is one of the two newest districts created by the Government of Sierra Leone, along with Karene District. Falaba District borders Koinadugu District, Bombali District, and the Republic of Guinea. Falaba District is an entirely rural district that is composed of mostly farming, livestock and mining. Many of the towns and villages in Falaba District are in far distance and remote areas within the district. The main ethnic groups in Falaba District are the Kuranko, Yalunka, Fula and Mandingo. Falaba District is home to the largest population of ethnic Yalunka in Sierra Leone. The overwhelming majority of the people of Falaba District at over 90% are Muslims of the Sunni tradition of Islam. Falaba District\\" along with its neighbor Koinadugu District are the traditional home of the highly spiritual Suffi Islamic scholars known as the Karamut, who are view by some Muslims, to have special divine knowledge based on their interpretation of the Qur'an. Falaba District is home, however, to a small but significant Christian minority at about 7%. There are several Catholic and Protestants churches in the District. Government and politics Politically Falaba District is a swing district as it is home to a large percentage of supporters of Sierra Leone's two major political parties: the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) and the All People's Congress (APC). At the local government, Falaba District is governed by a directly elected district council, headed by a directly elected district council charman, in whom local executive power is granted. The current district council chairman of Falaba District is Abdulai Maranda Sajor, of the All People's Congress who was elected district council chairman of Falaba District with 45.8% of the vote, as he narrowly defeated the Sierra Leone People's Party's candidate in the 2018 Falaba District council elections. The chiefdoms' paramount chiefs of Falaba District are very powerful and extremely influential, especially in village within Falaba District. The Paramount chiefs usually resolve family dispute and minor crimes. In the 2018 Sierra Leone Presidential election, Samura Kamara of then ruling All People's Congress received 57% of the votes in Falaba District, and Julius Maada Bio of then major opposition Sierra Leone People's Party received 42% of the votes in Falaba District. After the 2018 Sierra Leone Parliamentary election, Falaba District currently has four elected representatives in the Sierra Leone Parliament, and they are Mohamed Billow Shaw (SLPP), Alusine Marah (APC), Alhasan Jeroh Kamara (APC), and Lahai Marah (APC). Law enforcement and safety The Sierra Leone Police is the primary law enforcement agency and crimes investigation in Falaba District. However, the Paramount chiefs and the traditional council also investigate minor crimes and solve family and community conflict in Falaba District. The Paramount chiefs are very influential within their chiefdoms in Falaba District.

Early life  Yeromenko was born on January 20, 1989 in Kramatorsk. His father Yeromenko Oleg was general director of the Star Kramatorsk machine-building plant, and deputy of Kramatorsk City Council. Yeromenko's father taught him love to music. Yeromenko went to music school to study guitar, but he did not finish his studies. At age 16, he went to England where he studied English. He lived in Brighton where he became interested of electronic music, clubs and nightlife. After returning to Ukraine, he began play electronic music. He became a DJ at the main disco of Kramatorsk. In 2007 Yeromenko went to Kyiv to enter Shevchenko University, as his family advised him, but eventually chose the Kyiv Institute of International Relations. The 17th of April 2007 year, Yeromenko's father died in a car accident. Yeromenko returned to Kramatorsk after his father's death. He transfer to the Donbass Machine-building Academy and to become an engineer, and then worked as a sales manager of the Energomashspetsstal factory.  Arrest  Yeromenko bought a console, controllers and acted at home closed parties in Kramatorsk. He decided to start a business in Svyatogorsk. He worked in marketing communications, especially digital-technology. On 27 April 2014 Yeromenko was stopped by the armed formations of the self-proclaimed DPR at a roadblock on the Kramatorsk- Svyatogorsk road near Sloviansk. In the trunk of his car the guards found a fan scarf of the Ukrainian national football team and photos with the flag of Ukraine in his phone. Yeromenko had never taking an active part in politics. In spite of this, the guards suspected Yeromenko of connections with the Right Sector. He was declared an \\"enemy of the republic\\" and sentenced to immediate execution. However, this decision was later canceled. It was decided to send Yeromenko to Slavyansk for further clarification. He was tortured and beaten and forced to shout \\"Glory to Ukraine\\" and sing the national anthem of Ukraine. \\"Especially, I was tortured because I being a local and do not support the new regime. The blue and yellow scarf found in the trunk was tied round my neck and the warders passing by me periodically choked me to them.\\" In the basement of the SBU building in Slavyansk, Yeromenko was in the same cell with stage-manager Pavel Yurov and artist Denis Grischuk. They were tortured and beaten. Thanks to the efforts of Yeromenko's mother, he managed to free himself from captivity. On 1 May 2014, after spending four days in the basement, he was released. His car was confiscated in favor of the self- proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. After his release, he was taken beyond the roadblack, a bandage was removed from his eyes, and he was ordered to go without turning around. Enterprises belonging to his family were looted. Warehouses that Eremenko rented were cut to scrap metal.  Career  After his release, Yeromenko left Kramatorsk and went to his relatives in Dnipropetrovsk, and from there to Kyiv. After return to Kyiv, he decided to become a professional musician. He stated, \\"All these crazy experiences helped me to realize the value of each day of our short and such a fragile life. Now I really care about every hour I've been given¬ª. ¬´I dreamed of doing music all my life - doubts, the belief that there are ways ¬´right¬ª and \\"wrong\\" before all these events kept me from the employment that I dreamed of doing. A senseless bloody war every day takes the lives of young, talented people who had something to say to this world. I narrowly escaped their fate, and now I have no right to miss my chance to make this world a little better.\\" He uses the techniques of musical groups such as Innervisions, Slowdance, Dixon and AME. In 2014 he organized a series of parties and auto-party on Vozdvizhenka in Kyiv, in the art space Sugar Package. He became acquainted with the producers of The Lab. After these parties, he was invited to the nightclub of The Lab, where they conducted a series of auto-parties, working with Dj Pitchboy. At one of the parties in The Lab where Eremenko worked, a silent Ukrainian film was shown. Yeromenko was offered the change to write music that would accompany the display of old paintings and newsreels. After that, he was invited by the National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre to create soundtracks for silent Ukrainian films of the middle and the end of the twentieth century. Together with Anton Baybakov he worked on the soundtrack to the film Dziga Vertova Eleventh. He graduated from Kyiv Academy of Media Arts, majoring in Digital Film. Together with Pavel Yurov, whom Eremenko had met while in captivity, they worked on a semi-documentary under the working title Je suis Donbass. The scenario included events that occurred during their arrival in the ATO zone in 2014. According to the writers, half of the film describes Yurov and half Yeromenko. Yeromenko worked with producer Sergey Dotsenko and with Kalina Music. Yeromenko is the producer of the \\"JARR\\" projects for Packed Promo Group.

It was built from 1824 to 1826 by convict labour. The property is owned by Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 August 2001.  History  The first Government House in Port Macquarie was an 1821 one-storey weatherboard building built for the commandant, Francis Allman, and his family. In , Government House was shifted to an existing brick building (built 1824) next to the military barracks, which was heavily extended and adapted for its new role. It was used by the Commandant of Port Macquarie until the 1832 when the post ceased to exist following the abolition of the penal settlement. It then housed the Police Magistrate until the office was discontinued on 31 December 1847, at which time it passed to the Clerk of Petty Sessions. It was again occupied by the Police Magistrate when that position was recreated, and again passed to the Clerk of Petty Sessions when it was abolished for a second time in 1869. The building was already reported to be in need of repairs by the mid-1830s, and by the 1850s was in a state of disrepair. Some restoration was carried out in 1861, but it continued to be described as in poor repair thereafter. The last occupant, Clerk of Petty Sessions Robert Perrott, vacated the property in November 1879. It was described as empty and falling apart in 1884, and was demolished in 1886. The remains of the brick Government House were rediscovered in 2001 during excavations for an apartment building, at which time they were to be destroyed for the construction of a motel car park. An interim heritage order was put in place in March 2001, and the remains were formally listed on the State Heritage Register in August that year.  Description  The site is now an archaeological site containing the remains of the Port Macquarie Government House. It includes the brick and sandstone footings of the house, including courtyard and wings, brick barrel drains, square brick drains, brick paving, the cellar and cellar steps, some post holes (verandah, and outbuildings), and animal bones, pottery shards, glass fragments, buttons, coins. It was reported at the time of the interim heritage listing that \\"90% of the original footprint\\" had survived. The remains were reported to be in excellent condition as at 19 July 2001.  Heritage listing  The archaeological remains of Government House, Port Macquarie are a rare example of the official residence of the Commandant of a place of secondary punishment in Eastern Australia and of a local magistrate in a regional centre in 19th century New South Wales. The house was both the symbol of authority and centre of administration at Port Macquarie in its evolution from penal settlement, to convict depot and free settlement, to self-governing local community. The officials who occupied the house played an important role in the administration of the convict system in New South Wales and in the development of law and order on the boundaries of settlement in a period of major expansion. In its first phase of occupation, Port Macquarie was an important component of the convict system as regularised after 1815 and one of a small number of places of secondary punishment, the locations of which were specifically chosen for their remoteness, inaccessibility and exploitable natural resources. In its second convict phase Port Macquarie was unique as a depot reserved for \\"specials\\", invalids, the insane and infirm. The town made an effective transition from convict settlement to local urban centre, playing an important role in the development of its region. Archaeological remains, buildings and historical documents are complementary resources for the compilation of an authentic account of the penal system in New South Wales and Australia and the archaeological remains of Government House, Port Macquarie are an integral component of this research process.Annable, Betteridge, Marks & Morris, 2003: 99 The significance of Port Macquarie and of its Government House should not be considered solely in relation to the present State of New South Wales. In historical terms, the Colony of New South Wales at the time the penal settlement at Port Macquarie was established included parts of the State of Queensland and Norfolk Island. The settlement must also be considered in the context of the operation of the convict system throughout the Australian colonies and of the policies and objectives of successive British governments in relation to law, order and the punishment of offenders.Annable 2001: 1 Port Macquarie Government House Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 August 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. As one of the few remaining sites with strong associations with the convict system, Port Macquarie is important in the history of the early European settlement of Australia. Port Macquarie, established in 1821, was the first designated place of secondary punishment in the Colony of New South Wales. Designed to deal with repeat offenders who could not be accommodated within the existing convict structure, the aim of such settlements was to subject prisoners to isolation, severe discipline and hard work. The establishment of places of secondary punishment represented a significant development in the creation of a comprehensive penal system by the British government. The location of the settlement and the disposition of its original buildings were designed by Governor and Mrs Macquarie. Governor Macquarie was directly involved in the program of building works drawn up for the settlement. Port Macquarie has a close association with Governor Macquarie who was instrumental in the establishment of the place and with his wife Elizabeth, who together determined the choice of siting and design of the penal settlement. As a domestic residence, Government House has a close association with successive Commandants of the penal settlement and their families including Capt Francis Allman, Capt John Rolland and Capt Archibald Innes and with the Resident Police Magistrates of the free settlement and their families. As the centre of government penal administration and of the local magistracy, Government House has close associations with the population of Port Macquarie both bond and free and with many significant local residents.Annable 2001: 1-2 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The penal settlement at Port Macquarie was designed on picturesque principles under the guidance and influence of Governor Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth. It was the only penal settlement to be so designed. Views to and from the water were key elements of the plan. The siting of Government House and of the surviving St Thomas' Church represent, in built form, the close connection perceived in the 19th century between government and the church, and between penal policy and the reform of the offender. Many of the buildings and much of the infrastructure built by convict labour continued in use throughout the 19th century making a substantial contribution to the development of later communities.Annable 2001: 3-4) The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Considerable interest is now being expressed by Australians in the convict system as a part of their history. Much research is being undertaken into the part that the convict heritage has had in shaping Australian identity and the development of its liberal and democratic institutions. Convict labour is now understood as an integral part of the economic history of Australia as an immigrant society. The settlement at Port Macquarie was one of a range of convict establishments, the physical remains and documentary records of which are complementary parts of the history of the convict system throughout Australia.Annable 2001: 2-3 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Government House was an integral part of a planned settlement. The site has the potential to contribute to an understanding of the settlement as a whole and to comparative analyses of its place in relation to other establishments within the convict system. The quality and extent of the archaeological remains of Government House demonstrate a way of life associated with the penal settlement of Port Macquarie and the later development of civilian settlement. The archaeological remains of Government House, together with its associated artifacts have the potential to contribute to an understanding of the working of the settlement at Port Macquarie and the role of the occupants of the house in its administration and general life. Government House is a significant element in the range of buildings constructed for a large-scale penal settlement and has the ability to contribute to an understanding of the totality of the convict system in Australia. As the home of successive Resident Police Magistrates the site has the potential to contribute to an understanding of the development of free settlement at Port Macquarie. Existing structures, archaeological remains and historical documents are complementary sources for the compilation of an authentic account of the penal system in New South Wales and Australia. Archaeological remains are an integral component of this research process.Annable 2001: 3 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Port Macquarie was the only designated place of secondary punishment to be established during the period of the Assignment System in the present State of New South Wales and the first such place to be established in Australia at this period. The archaeological remains of Government House are the only known surviving example in New South Wales of a \\"government house\\" in a distant settlement, built for the use of government officials. The archaeological remains of Government House, Port Macquarie are older than the surviving building fabric at Port Arthur and the Second Settlement at Norfolk Island, also places of secondary punishment. The archaeological evidence at Port Macquarie is not duplicated in the existing range of heritage convict sites at Sydney, Parramatta and Newcastle. The penal settlement of Port Macquarie was designed on picturesque principles, the only penal settlement to be so designed. Government House is one of the two main elements of the picturesque composition of the penal settlement, the other being the existing church of St Thomas. The physical reality of the surviving archaeological remains of Government House allows this relationship to be rediscovered, experienced and interpreted.Annable 2001: 4  See also   References  = Bibliography = = Attribution = External links Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Port Macquarie Category:Official residences in Australia Category:Houses in New South Wales Category:Archaeological sites in New South Wales Category:Government buildings in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register ","title":"Port Macquarie Government House Site"},{"id":"57997629","text":"Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino The first cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino was the government of Romania from 11 April 1899 to 6 July 1900.

Episodes Production =Background= Locke & Key was originally developed as a television series by the Fox broadcast network during the 2010‚Äì11 television season by DreamWorks Television and 20th Century Fox Television with Josh Friedman writing the pilot script adaptation. Alex Kurtzman and Bob Orci served as executive producers for the pilot, which starred Mark Pellegrino, Miranda Otto, Jesse McCartney, Sarah Bolger, Skylar Gaertner, and Nick Stahl. The pilot was not given a series order by Fox, though it was screened at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con. At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, a feature-film trilogy was announced through Universal Pictures with Kurtzman and Orci expected to serve as executive producers. =Development= On May 9, 2016, IDW Entertainment was reported to be developing a television-series adaptation of Locke & Key again. The novel's writer, Joe Hill, was expected to write the production's pilot and serve as an executive producer. The project was being developed in association with Circle of Confusion with the intent of pitching the series to cable networks and streaming services. On April 20, 2017, Hulu gave the production a pilot order. The production was developed by Carlton Cuse with Hill and set to be directed by Scott Derrickson. Cuse was expected to serve as the potential series' showrunner and executive producer alongside Hill, Derrickson, Lindsey Springer, Ted Adams, and David Ozer. Production companies involved with the pilot were slated to include Carlton Cuse Productions and IDW Entertainment. On July 14, 2017, it was reported that Andy Muschietti was replacing Derrickson as the pilot's director, as Derrickson was forced to drop out of the production due to a scheduling conflict. On March 27, 2018, it was reported that Hulu had passed on the pilot and declined to order it to series. On May 29, 2018, the production was reported to be in final negotiations with Netflix for a series order. Netflix was reportedly planning on redeveloping the property and discarding the prior pilot ordered by Hulu. Due to scheduling conflicts, Andy Muschietti was not expected to direct the production's new pilot, but would continue to serve as executive producer alongside Hill, Cuse, Adams, Ozer, and Barbara Muschietti. Production companies involved with the new iteration of the project were set to include Genre Arts and IDW Entertainment. On July 25, 2018, Netflix officially gave the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Aron Eli Coleite, Meredith Averill, and Rick Jacobs were announced as new executive producers. Circle of Confusion was also expected to again act as a production company for the series. The new iteration of the series was created by Hill and developed by Cuse, Coleite, and Averill. The new first episode was written by Hill and Coleite, with Cuse and Averill serving as showrunners. Michael Morris directed the first two episodes and serves as an executive producer. In adapting the comic for the Netflix series, the fictional town where Keyhouse is located was changed from Lovecraft to Matheson, Massachusetts. According to Cuse and Averill, this change had been suggested by Hill; because of the comic's Lovecraftian themes, the setting's name was to honor author H. P. Lovecraft, but Hill wanted to honor author and screenwriter Richard Matheson for the series, instead. Despite the fact the series had yet received an order for a second season, writing for a potential second season began ahead of the series' first-season premiere. Netflix renewed the series for a second season on March 30, 2020. =Casting= In August 2017, Frances O'Connor and Jackson Robert Scott were cast in the pilot's main roles. In September 2017, Megan Charpentier and Nate Corddry were reported to have joined the pilot's main cast. In October 2017, Jack Mulhern, Danny Glover, and Owen Teague had been cast in starring roles in the pilot. Alongside the announcement of the production's move to Netflix, it was revealed all of the series' roles would be recast with the exception of Jackson Robert Scott as Bode Locke. On December 19, 2018, Connor Jessup and Emilia Jones were cast to replace Mulhern and Charpentier, respectively. In January 2019, Sherri Saum, Griffin Gluck, Steven Williams (replacing Glover), Darby Stanchfield (replacing O'Connor), Laysla De Oliveira, and Kevin Alves joined the cast with Gluck, Stanchfield, and De Oliveira in main roles and Williams and Alves set to appear in a recurring capacity. In February 2019, Petrice Jones and Thomas Mitchell Barnet (replacing Teague) joined the main cast; Asha Bromfield and Felix Mallard were cast to appear in recurring roles. Mirroring their appearances as characters in the comic book, creators Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez had cameo appearances in the first-season finale as paramedics. On September 30, 2020, Aaron Ashmore and Hallea Jones were promoted to series regulars while Brendan Hines was cast as a new series regular for the second season. =Filming= Lunenburg, Nova Scotia was used for shots of the fictional Matheson, Massachusetts. Principal photography for the series took place from February 11 to July 5, 2019, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Scenes within the fictional Matheson , as well as some other exterior scenes, such as the outside of the Drowning Cave, were filmed in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Keyhouse itself was a constructed set and shot at Cinespace Film Studios in Toronto along with other internal scenes. The second season began filming on September 21, 2020, and is set to conclude on March 5, 2021. = Music = The score to the show was composed by Torin Borrowdale. When writing the main theme for the series, Borrowdale wanted to ellicit a feeling of magic and whimsey that would come with exploring a house with magical keys for the first time. Borrowdale implemented a solo cello in a low register for Dodge's theme to capture both the beauty and the darkness of Dodge's character. For Bode's theme, he created a simple tune that would be adaptable to the varying situations Bode got himself into, in which the variations on his theme would reflect the current mood of the scene. The soundtrack was released on March 13, 2020. Release In December 2019, Netflix announced that the series would be released on February 7, 2020. On January 8, 2020, Netflix released an official trailer for the series.. Reception The series received generally positive reviews from critics, with the score, set design, and visual effects being singled out as highlights of the series. Critics mainly praised the series' handling of themes relating to loss and trauma, as well as its use of horror genre elements, while criticizing the use of teen drama and romance subplots to drag out the story. The performances of Jackson Robert Scott and Laysla de Oliveira received particular praise. USA Today claimed that the series was \\"nearly as strong a debut as Stranger Things was in 2016, but it [needed] a few tweaks to jump the hurdle between good and great.\\" IGN credited the series for its portrayal of trauma and its visual effects, and praised the performances of Scott and de Oliveira, while criticizing it for not consistently building tension throughout. Polygon gave a more negative review, criticizing the decision to make the television adaptation emphasize the coming-of-age story and fantasy elements of the series, while glossing over the horror elements and haunting visuals of the source material. In particular, its review criticized the uninteresting subplots and inconsistent pacing. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series has a 66% approval rating with 61 reviews, with an average rating of 6.58/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though Locke & Key at times struggles to strike a consistent tone, it captures enough of the essence of its source material to provide a fiendishly fun and sufficiently spooky time.\\" On Metacritic the series has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The glacigene origin of the Carboniferous sediments in the Seaham area was first recognised by Professor Edgeworth David in 1914. Subsequently, Sussmilch reported the occurrence of varved shales in the Seaham Quarry,Sussmich and David, 1920 which rapidly gained famed in Australia and internationally because of the perfection of preservation of the varves and the associated contorted beds exposed in them. David exhibited specimens of the varved shales in Honolulu in 1920 at the First Pan Pacific Science Congress, and three years later led a party of visiting scientists to the quarry on the occasion of the Second Pan Pacific Science Congress. In 1925 a signboard describing the phenomena exposed in the quarry was erected in the site. In 1979 the Geological Society of Australia (New South Wales Division) nominated the site for an Interim Conservation Order. The order was sought as the site was for sale and possible development. On 12 April 1979 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the site to provide time for further investigation. On 14 December 1979 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the site. The site was transferred onto the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Seaham Quarry is a small, disused shale quarry at Seaham, 14 kilometres northwest of Raymond Terrace. The quarry walls are north facing and one to two metres high. In 1925 a signboard was erected by Edgeworth David proclaiming the area is to be \\"preserved in perpetuity\\". The varved sediments in the Seaham Quarry belong to the Upper Carboniferous Seaham Formation,Engel, 1966 equivalent to the Main Glacial Beds of Osborne (1922). In the Seaham area the formation consists of 600mm of tillite, varved shale, aqueo-glacial conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone, and mudstone. Osborne (1925) recognised three tillite and three varved shale horizons, of which that exposed in the quarry is the lower-most and thickest. Crowell and Frakes (1971, p. 137) described the appearance of the strata in the quarry as follows: \\"Laminated clay-shale layers, from 5 mm to 10 cm are separated by thinner fine-sandstone layers, from a few millimetres to a centimetre in thickness. Many thin sandstone units are graded, and locally display starved ripples with shapes and internal cross-laminations indicating the sense of current transport. Scattered through the section are rounded pebbles up to 6 cm in diameter...which occur within thicker mudstone layers as well as on bedding planes demarcated by graded sandstones\\". Occasional pockets of such pebbles were observed by Sussmilch. Glaessner (1957) described and illustrated a new species of arthropod trace fossil, Isododichnus osbornei, from varve shales at Seaham. The exact locality is not stated but the specimens were most likely collected from the quarry where they had previously been recorded as annelid tracks. The probable depositional environment of the quarry strata, as envisaged by Rattigan (1967) and other workers, was a shallow periglacial lake which received sediment influxes via turbidity currents. Low velocity traction currents modified the surface of these lake bed deposits, and ice-rafted pebbles (derived from moraines) were dropped into them at intervals from melting floes and icebergs. Crowell and Frakes (1971) consider that this glaciation was of alpine type and took place at a (late Carboniferous) latitude of 45-50 degree S. Perhaps the most spectacular features exposed in the quarry are localised contorted beds interstratified between apparently undisturbed layers and laterally continuous with undeformed planar strata. The height of the contorted layers ranges from a few centimetres to a metre or more. In Edgeworth David's day, the cause of the deformation was thought to be \\"the dragging force of glacial ice or icebergs\\". However Fairbridge (1947), who reviewed in detail seven possible explanations of the origin of the contortions, concluded that ravitational slumping - probably due to release of water from impounded glacial lakes, or over loading, was the most likely cause. Subsequent investigatorsRattigan, 1967; Crowell and Frakes, 1971 considered that some of the contorted layers could equally well have resulted from grounding of icebergs and floes. Rattigan (1967) described a variety of other deformational phenomena from these strata, including lode and flow structures, intraformational facturing, penecontemporaneous sand intrusions, and non-hydrodynamic ripple forms. He proposed earthquake-activated slumping as a possible mechanism of formation. The other feature of the strata exposed in the quarry which has attracted scientific interest is the significance of the laminations. The explanation on the signboard reflects the view of early workers in the area that the alternation of coarse and fine bands was attributable to seasonal deposition, and that the approximate time taken for accumulation could be established by counting pairs of layers. Sussmilch estimated that all-out 3000 years would have been required to deposit the total thickness of varve shales (some 60 m) in the Seaham district, but the accuracy of this measurement was questioned by Osborne (1925) because it disregarded the effects of contemporaneous erosion, non-annual depositional rhythms, and weathering-induced variability in prominence of laminations. The exceptional preservation of the Seaham varves (considering their age) prompted the Swedish scientist Carl Caldenius to investigate their potential use in geochronology (a section was actually measured for this purpose at Paterson nearby.Caldenius, 1938 However, subsequent workers (e.g. Crowell and Frakes. 1971) have been more cautious about use of the term \\"varves\\" in reference to the Seaham strata, as the rhythmic bedding exhibited has not been proven to follow an annual cycle.(Percival) The quarry itself could be detrimentally affected by indiscriminate and quite unnecessary use of geological hammers.  Heritage listing  Seaham Quarry is significant to the history of Australian geology and its associations with the famous Australian geologist, Professor Edgeworth David who first recognised the glacigene origin of the Carboniferous sediments in the Seaham area in 1914. Seaham Quarry is of international scientific importance because of the perfection of preservation of its varied shales and the associated contorted beds exposed in them. The shale deposits are estimated by scientists to be more than 300 million years old. The quarry contains, in its shale deposits, evidence of the galcial origin of rocks in the Hunter River Valley.Heritage Office file notes 1979 Seaham Quarry was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

However, following a Petition to the Lord Lyon King of Arms, a Family Convention (or Derbhfine) was held at Abbotsford House the home of Sir Walter Scott on 10 September 2016. The Family Conclave selected and recommended Michael Todd McAlpin Senior for the role of Commander. On 19 April 2017 Michael received his Commission as Commander of MacAlpine from Dr. Joseph Morrow the Lord Lyon. This Commission has empowered him to do and perform all acts and functions proper for a period of ten years or until a Chief is named. History Dunadd, site of the hill-fort said to have been held by Kenneth MacAlpine According to tradition the Clan MacAlpine or MacAlpin is the most purely Celtic of the all the Highland Scottish clans. They are believed to be of royal descent from Kenneth MacAlpin who united the Picts and Scots from the year 850 into one kingdom and moved his capital from Perthshire to Dunadd beside Loch Crinan in D√°l Riata. The MacAlpine surname is still common in Scotland today but there is little trace of any clan of the name. The former chiefs apparently had their seat on lands that are now Dunstaffnage Castle in Argyll, which was an early capital of Kenneth MacAlpin, who was King of the Picts and according to myth, the first King of Scots.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and allies as they try to save humanity following the death of director Phil Coulson. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen and directed by series star Clark Gregg. Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and also takes on the new character Sarge. He stars alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. \\"Missing Pieces\\" originally aired on ABC on May 10, 2019, and was watched by 3.63 million viewers within a week of its release. Plot A year after the death of director Phil Coulson, S.H.I.E.L.D. is rebuilding under the leadership of Mack. They investigate a series of energy anomalies formed by hostile strangers emerging from portals, one of whom gets trapped inside a wall and partially turns to concrete. In deep space, Agents Daisy Johnson, Jemma Simmons, Piper, and Davis search for Leo Fitz, who was last seen in a cryofreeze chamber on a spaceship with the Chronicom Enoch; they find the spaceship abandoned and the chamber empty. Simmons learns that the chamber was created on Naro-Atzia, but the others decide to return to Earth. They are attacked by a Confederacy cruiser and, in the rush to escape, Simmons plots a course to Naro-Atzia. Mack and Melinda May recruit Dr. Marcus Benson to help found a S.H.I.E.L.D. academy and provide science support. They find coordinates on the man in concrete, Tinker, which lead them to a museum. The surviving hostiles are there and destroy the building to make way for their leader, Sarge, who looks just like Coulson. Production =Development= The crew of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. believed the series was likely to be cancelled following its fifth season, so they made the fifth-season finale as if it was the series finale. However, ABC renewed the series for a sixth season in May 2018. With the start of filming in July 2018, the sixth season premiere was revealed to be titled \\"Missing Pieces\\", written by showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen. The episode features an onscreen tribute to S.H.I.E.L.D. co-creator Stan Lee, who died in November 2018. =Writing= Because the writers had gone beyond all of their initial plans for the series, they had to create new storylines for the sixth season that did not repeat elements from previous seasons. The episode begins one year after the end of the fifth season, and finds the cast split into two groups: a team in space searching for Leo Fitz following the events of season five; and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. on Earth, investigating a series of energy anomalies while rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. and carrying on Coulson's legacy. =Casting= After the airing of the fifth season's finale, which implied the death of Coulson, actor Clark Gregg said there was \\"some interest\\" in having him be involved in the sixth season, and that he would be meeting with the showrunners to discuss this. He speculated that this could be for flashbacks, and was unsure if he would remain a series regular. At San Diego Comic-Con 2018, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, and Natalia Cordova-Buckley were confirmed to return from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, and Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, respectively. Additionally, Jeff Ward was promoted to series regular for the season, after recurring in the fifth as Deke Shaw. Gregg was set to return to the series as director for the sixth season premiere, but not confirmed to be returning as an actor. In December, Coulson was confirmed to have died between the events of the fifth and sixth seasons. The next month, Gregg was revealed to be portraying a new character in the season, named Sarge. Gregg was confirmed to still be a series regular in March 2019. Briana Venskus and Maximilian Osinski having recurring roles in the sixth season as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Piper and Davis, after appearing in minor roles in previous seasons. Joel Stoffer also returns from the previous season as Enoch. In April 2018, Barry Shabaka Henley was announced as cast as natural science professor Marcus Benson. Osinski, Venskus, Stoffer, and Henley guest star in the episode alongside Lucas Bryant, Winston James Francis, Matt O'Leary, Brooke Williams, Glenn Keogh, and Levi Meaden. =Filming and visual effects= Filming for the episode began on July 16, 2018, in Culver City, California, with Gregg directing. After the emotional fifth-season finale, Wen felt that returning for the sixth season with Gregg directing was \\"wonderful out of the gate, and like we got a new life\\". The opening of the episode was created by visual effects vendor FuseFX. For the space scenes, some of the movements made by Zephyr-One were inspired by the Millennium Falcon. The effect of Sarge's crew appearing through the handball court wall was created by CoSA VFX, and inspired by different videos of objects being pushed through barriers. For the destruction of the building at the end of the episode, visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack took many photographs of the building so a digital model of it could be created by Rhythm and Hues. The production then filmed the same street that the building is on but in the opposite direction so the model could be added to the empty space and then destroyed without revealing the original building behind it. Release \\"Missing Pieces\\" was first screened at WonderCon on March 30. It aired in the United States on ABC on May 10, 2019. The episode began streaming on Netflix in the United States on September 1, 2019, along with the rest of the sixth season. Reception =Ratings= In the United States the episode received a 0.4/3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.4 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was a drop from the previous season's finale and average viewership. However, the total audience of 2.31 million people was the largest for the series since January 2018. Within a week of its release, \\"Missing Pieces\\" had been watched by 3.63 million U.S. viewers.

It is also known as Tomaree Head Battery, Tomaree Battery and Stephens Battery. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 October 2010.  History  = Radar at Tomaree Head = Tomaree Head was one of the first sites selected in an air force project to protect Australia with a ring of radar stations around the continent. The threat of war from Japan was looming, but only three radar sets were available: the project was launched with a special survey to select three sites. Many more radar sets were needed, long range radar, for which the authorities expected a long delay, so it was essential to put the three available radar sets to work in the parts of Australia requiring them most urgently. The available radar sets were \\"on loan\\" from a CSIR facility called the Radiophysics Laboratory, British sets sent for research. The survey was led by two very senior officers: Dr David Martyn, chief of the Laboratory, and Squadron Leader A. G. Pither, the Royal Australian Air Force radar specialist. They flew over the coast from Port Kembla to Forster, selecting sites near Port Kembla, near Terrigal, and at Tomaree Head. The recommendation by the Services was to locate the \\"available\\" radar sets to protect \\"the vital Newcastle-Sydney-Port Kembla industrial region\\", which was accepted by the highest authority. Applying this priority, the survey officers used Newcastle steel works as their point of reference when deciding on Tomaree Head. Japan burst into the war before the radar building was started. The British radar set was hastily placed in a vacant bunker in Newcastle. By the time the radar building was completed on Tomaree Head, an Australian radar known as AW was available from the factory. The British set could now be removed and was sent to the place near Terrigal. The AW radar was made possible by a surprise break-through at the Radiophysics Laboratory. Dr J. H. Piddington adapted the design of a short range radar, a familiar design, producing the range necessary for air warning, no special components needed. A version called LW/AW (light weight/air warning) was acclaimed as the backbone of the RAAF radar network in the island warfare of World War 2, represented by a replica at the Australian War Memorial. The first factory set was ready on 5 April 1942. RAAF radar men took the piano-sized cabinets to Tomaree Head and yanked them up to the summit. The station was on the air by 12 April 1942 and was reporting the positions of aircraft. Tomaree radar was also able to detect ships; the station reported the location of the Japanese submarine that shelled Newcastle on 8 June 1942. = Fortifications and functions = The WWII gun emplacements and related structures on Tomaree Head were established from 1941 as part of a system for the defence of the east coast of Australia. The sites are remnants of a system of defence for the protection of Newcastle and Port Stephens - important enough to warrant its establishment as a separate fire command. It includes sites that were developed for heavy gun emplacements, light weapons and machine gun pits, torpedo tubes, search light stations, No. 20 Radar Station RAAF, barbed wire and stake defence, a command post and barracks and other miscellaneous buildings. Parts of the headland were cleared. Services such as power and water were provided. Many of the sites have become overgrown. In 1989 the doors of the heavy gun emplacements were welded shut. Before 1939 the Fort Tomaree site was virtually in its natural state and the area had no water and no power or major services of any description, until installed by the RAAF, AIF and RAN, for their own, and US Army and US Navy, use. The population expanded to many hundreds in the space of a few years. The entire Fort Tomaree headland has, in the main, been an undisturbed and relatively protected area because of its occupation by the NSW Government Health Department. This Government protection has ensured that only relatively little serious damage has been done to these fortifications since the end of World War 2. The coastal defences comprised: # Australian Army seafront and beach front installation including observation posts, radar installations, command and control areas including plotting room data coordination, machine gun emplacements, anti-aircraft emplacements, mortars emplacements and three-man weapons pits; # RAN seawards defences including minefield observation systems, anti-torpedo nets, hydrophones and torpedo tubes. These were, in general, controlled from the Port War Signal Station situated on Nelson Head(Robertson & Hindmarsh 141) # RAAF radar station at the peak of the Tomaree Headland reported its plots of aircraft to No. 2 Fighter Sector in Newcastle. Any necessary commands would then be given to RAAF Base Williamtown. The Sector was a link in the chain providing early warning of enemy approach. The RAAF provided an 11 kW, 415 V electricity service to the area which was used to power the rotating antenna and this was transformed for the use of the other services. Most listed fortress equipment was sited directly on Tomaree Headland except the head battery and the RAN mine and loop control post which were sited at the western end of Shoal Bay Beach and on Nelson Head. Tomaree Headland itself contains the remains of no less than eighteen fortifications, eighty buildings and many artefacts in various states of preservation. It is estimated that each month 2,000 men, AIF or US servicemen, passed through this Amphibious Training Centre, (20,000 in total), learning embarkation and debarkation with the RAN landing ships infantry, HMAS Westralia, HMAS Manoora, HMAS Kanimbla and USS Henry T Allen. The exercises involved actually landing under simulated invasion conditions on Zenith, Wreck and Box Beaches. The Amphibious Landing Training Establishment was commissioned as HMAS Assault. Later, as the war progressed, similar training establishments were established closer to the fast moving front. It was here that the RAN trained its landing craft and crews involved in amphibious invasions of Dutch New Guinea, Tarakan and Balikpapan, as well as the Leyte and Lingayen invasions in the Philippines. Of the 141 ships and landing craft (thirteen Australian built) based at Port Stephens in October 1943, thirty-six were controlled by HMAS Assault and 105 by the US Navy. The Tomaree seawards and seafront defences were progressively strengthened, as their strategic importance increased, to create Fort Tomaree which protected the first Allied Combined Operations, Landing Training Centre in the south-west Pacific theatre, for the invasion of the Japanese held islands in the Pacific.Robertson & Hindmarsh 142 In March 1943 a Naval Control Observation Bunker (\\"Head Battery\\") was constructed below the Nelson Head Light (Inner Light) for use in detecting submarines and, in conjunction with Fort Tomaree, provide surveillance over Providence Bay. An access road was built to the lighthouse where previously only a rough track existed up a steep climb from Little Beach. Prior to the war, all supplies were taken up on a sled pulled by a horse. The Nelson head Battery was abandoned in August 1943 and dismantled. Only the Control building remains. The exterior of the control observation bunker was inspected but the remains of the gun emplacement(s) were not inspected and so the claim that the emplacements no longer remained could not be verified. With Japan's invasion of South-East Asia and occupation of the Pacific islands to Australia's north in 1942 it became necessary to establish training camps with the object of training personnel from all three armed services (navy, army and air force) in joint operations to retake the captured islands. In June 1942 a Royal Marine officer, Commander, F. N. Cook, and Lieut-Colonel Hope inspected sites on the east coast to establish a School of Combined Operations. Port Stephens was selected because of its defendable port, safe anchorage away from Japanese submarines and sparse population.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1-143 The military installations commenced in September 1942 were Fort Tomaree on Tomaree and Nelson Heads, HMAS Assault I at Fly Point and along the shores of Nelson Bay. Work on the RAAF radar station on the peak of Tomaree had begun in February 1942 . These installations joined the 1941 Gan Gan Army Combined Training Centre located inland from Salamander Bay. In October 1943 the Amphibious Training Centre was closed and only boat crews continued to be trained at HMAS Assault. By August 1944 the base at Port Stephens had been put into care and maintenance. In 1943, along with the closure of the (Nelson) Head Battery and the Amphibious Training Centre at HMAS Assault, the lower camp at Tomaree (the infantry camp) was also closed and turned over to the Volunteer Defence Corps for training. In 1947 the infantry camp at Tomaree was transferred from the Commonwealth Department of Defence to the NSW Department of Public Health. In 1950 the whole of Tomaree headland was transferred for hospital purposes. From 1960 until 1985 the former infantry base at Tomaree was used as a holiday and recuperation camp and from 1985 onwards it was used exclusively for permanent mental patients, associated with Tomaree Lodge. Tomaree Headland comprises about 35,616ha of previously typical natural coastal environment, zoned as Environmental Protection Coastal Lands.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1-144 In 1993 the Royal Australian Air Force removed the radar tower. In 2018, the site is part of Tomaree National Park, in which the Fort Tomaree Walk takes visitors to the remains of the fortifications. There are three precincts related to the operation of Fort Tomaree on the Tomaree Headland: * Batteries and Battery (or Upper) Camp * Infantry (or Lower) Camp * Surf Batteries and torpedo tube * RAAF radar station. A number of buildings as well as site features including fortifications and installations, roads, gun placements, random rubble walled battery and associated features. On the headland's rock platform are random rubble terracing, drains, roadway and sea walls. Tomaree Head was developed as a World War 2 military base by a joint Australian Army-United States Navy defence venture. Used as part of coastal defence system. It was the focus of first Australian-United States combined training operations for the South-West Pacific sector. The Tomaree Hostel occupies buildings of the former infantry camp of Fort Tomaree. The infantry camp was on the landward side of the fortifications of the Fort and provided defence for the landward approaches to the Fort. The hostel is a collection of timber-framed and timber and asbestos cement-clad barracks buildings along the foreshore at the end of Shoal Bay Road. E. Martin states that the buildings were original buildings rebuilt in their current locations. However, examination of the original plans indicates that the remaining timber buildings are located in the same locations as the original buildings of the infantry camp. Some of the buildings away from the waterfront have been demolished and replaced with brick buildings.  Description  Tomaree Head is a 162m high hill at the southern entrance to Port Stephens. It is covered with natural vegetation and includes some steep cliffs and exposed geological formations on the east side facing the ocean. A flat section is on the west side facing Port Stephens but this is now occupied by the Tomaree Lodge, which is itself heritage-listed. Spectacular views are available from various vantage points. Tomaree Head is a popular recreational spot and maintains high aesthetic appeal. In 1940 Port Stephens was seen as a large harbour close to the vulnerable yet essential steelworks in Newcastle. An unguarded Port Stephens could have provided an easy landing place for any hostile force. The guns at Newcastle were too far away to protect Port Stephens. Tomaree was constructed by 1942 with six inch guns, torpedo tubes, mortars, machine guns, rifle pits, search lights, command posts, observation posts, barbed wire entanglements and accommodation (later Tomaree Lodge). The guns were never fired in anger. After 1943 the artillery defences were downgraded. Minor gun positions were closed, artillery crews were changed and gunners were transferred to other areas and replaced with Volunteer Defence Corps. No 20 Radar Station continued operating until 1947. In 1993 the RAAF removed the turning gear that formed the base of the radar antenna for restoration and, later, returned it to the summit, near its original location. Part of the headland was taken over by the Department of Health. (Tomaree Lodge and the rest of the headland was incorporated into the Tomaree National Park).  Heritage listing  Tomaree Head is a prominent landform at the entrance to Port Stephens and one that has been important to Aboriginal people and is included in their stories. The geological formation of the unusual combination of landform aeolian sands and volcanic derived clays is of some interest and research potential. Tomaree Head has been associated with many aspects of Australia's history from initial discovery by Captain Cook, early explorers, seafarers, settlers and industry including fishing, timber and farming. One of the outstanding qualities of Tomaree Head is its aesthetic appeal as a prominent landform with steep cliffs to the ocean and natural landscape in the attractive setting of Port Stephens. These qualities were recognised early in the nineteenth century by explorers' records and visits to the area and continue to be recognised by the extensive recreational and leisure use the area receives today. Tomaree Head, together with places near Sydney and Port Kembla, was chosen for Australia's first radar station. In 1942 it housed the first Australian-made AW (air warning) radar set. The fortifications that were, and remain, on the headland were important parts of the coastal defence network around strategic facilities from Port Stephens to Jervis Bay. It remains one of the few non-urban forts that protected Australia and were important parts of the protection of Newcastle and the RAAF base at Williamtown. The remnant parts provide historical, educational and research potential for all visitors. The extent of facilities that were an integral part of the Tomaree Head Fort is more varied than most of the other coastal defence posts in NSW and elements such as the radar station were the first produced in Australia. Tomaree Head Fortifications was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 October 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Tomaree Head has been an identifiable element in the landscape and as such has been used as a beacon by Aboriginal people as well as early European explorers, seafarers and settlers. It has been associated with the exploration and development of NSW from the European discovery of NSW by Captain James Cook. Fishing, timber and agricultural pursuits have been part of the development around Tomaree as well as recreational pursuits from the early 19th century. Tomaree Head was identified as a Reserve from 1861 and has retained this status since despite some ad hoc use by itinerant farmers, the development of the fortifications during World War 2 and more recently, the hospital. It is one of the remaining non-urban reserves in NSW. The Tomaree fortifications are of historical importance as a component of the World War 2 coastal defence network installed along the coast of NSW to protect strategic places. The location on the head protected Port Stephens and the network of adjacent rivers and watercourses and the hinterland. It also was an important part of the protection of the industrial installations at Newcastle. The complex of fortifications that were located at Tomaree Head is of interest and it remains as one of a few non- urban forts. It is also one of the few fortifications that retain some elements such as rifle pits. The radar was the first air warning radar made in Australia. Designed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the aerial and turning gear were made by the Eveleigh Railway Workshops of New South Wales Railways and the electronics were assembled by the HMV Gramophone Company, all located in Sydney. It was the first to be manned by mechanics wholly trained by the RAAF, first to have a building designed and built for radar and the longest serving RAAF radar in World War 2. The site was also associated with some of the largest troop movements on the Australian mainland with beach training by allied troops. Tomaree Head is representative of the ongoing concern of Australian governments since the 19th century with the defence of Australia's coastline and fear of invasion that existed during World War 2. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The lives of the few European occupants of Tomaree Head pre- World War 2 have passed into local folklore although few people except those of old families know about this. The fact that it had some importance to Aboriginal people is also part of its social significance. For those who spent time at Tomaree during World War 2 Tomaree Head was an important part of their lives and is the place where specific memories and friendships were established. The head has been part of the recreational challenges of the local community and visitors to the area from early in the 19th century and as such has some social value. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Tomaree Head's complement, Yacaaba, on the north side is slightly higher at but is less accessible than Tomaree Head. The prominence of the headland was included in Aboriginal stories and beliefs partly for the aesthetic appeal. One of the greatest attributes of Tomaree Head is the extremely high quality views or the visual catchments to be gained from it., not only from its summit but from some sections of its slopes and from its shores. Its height enabled it to be used as a major lookout, both in peacetime - e.g. by aboriginals to look for shoals of fish - and in wartime. To virtually all points of the compass there are stunning views containing both land and sea scapes, dotted with some cultural elements. The greater part of these views contain varying compositions of the natural elements of mountains, natural vegetation and water, which are rated highly by humans of whatever cultural background. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This helps explain the site's appeal to a wide range of visitors. The internal views of natural woodlands, ancient rock formations and winding tracks give visual pleasure. The plunging cliffs, slopes and rock formations along the eastern flank and waters edge are highly dramatic. The headland has landmark qualities. It is visible from afar, both from at sea as the impressive southern portal to Port Stephens, and from many points on the surrounding land and the waters of the harbour. Some people would suggest that the functional architecture of the wartime defences is in contrast with the natural features and has an aesthetic appeal. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The native vegetation of the Tomaree Peninsula is predominantly the woodland type with a number of identified rare and/or threatened plant species to this local area. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service considers the natural areas have high conservation values. The Tomaree Headland is listed on the State Heritage Register for its ecological significance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Tomaree demonstrates the natural values of geological formation and landscape of the area. It is also illustrative of the fortifications that were installed as part of a complex of NSW coastal defences during World War 2.

The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm, with a Humid Continental climate. It covers .  Location and description  The Sakhalin Island side of the ecoregion faces the Sea of Japan to the west, and the Okhotsk Sea to the east. Being on the southern end of the island, plant life is denser and more varied. The Kurile Islands side of the ecoregion has high levels of biodiversity, reflecting the islands' position along the meeting of warm and cold sea currents (the Pacific Ocean and Okhotsk Sea, respectively). The resulting richness of marine life attracts large colonies of marine birds. The ecoregion in the Kurils is defined as the southern three islands: Kunashir Island, Iturup, and Shikotan. These islands were connected to the Japanese island of Hokkaido during the most recent glacial period, and unlike the northern two thirds of the Kuriles are not icebound in winter.  Climate  The region has a Humid continental climate - Hot summer sub-type (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a hot summer (at least one month averaging over , and mild winters.  Flora and fauna  The area is characterized by high biodiversity because of the relatively mild climate, transition-zone placement, and island location. The flora of the southern Kuriles is closely related to that of Hokkaido, and endemism is low. A dominant floral community in the southern Kuriles is the bamboo thicket. Snow falling on the evergreen bamboo thickets in winter insulate the understory, which is relatively empty but abounding in shrews, mice and other rodents. These animals also thrive in the high-growth thickets, typified by white clover and \\"Sakhalin buckwheat\\" (Reynoutrua sachalinensis). Although plant communities are favorable to rodents, a noteworthy feature of the animal life in the southern Kuriles is the predominance of predator species, such as fox, sable, and bear, which have had to develop broader sources of food, particular marine sources on the coasts. Salmon are abundant in the streams.

It was designed by the NSW Government Architect's Office and built from 1942 by the NSW Department of Public Works for the Commonwealth Government. It was formerly known as the Tomaree Head Army/RAAF Camp. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Tomaree Headland is situated at the southern entrance to Port Stephens. Tomaree Lodge is located in a range of ten predominantly single-storey weatherboard ex-World War Two Australian Army garrison camp buildings on the western foreshore of the headland. Tomaree National Park occupies the remainder of land on Tomaree Head. DADHC land in this vicinity includes the ten buildings used for accommodation (), the Recreation Hall, the Administration Block (s) and staff cottages, as well as 8.8 hectares of terraced and landscaped land on the western side of the headland. DADHC-owned land in the vicinity accommodates a range of structures including a swimming pool, work sheds, a fisheries laboratory, and at least two relics associated with Fort Tomaree (Tomaree Head Fortifications), namely the surf battery and the footings for a torpedo tube. The Port Stephens area, including Tomaree Head, is part of land occupied by the Worimi Aboriginal language group. Captain Cook noted Tomaree Head in 1770 when he was travelling along the NSW coast. Following European settlement to the east coast of NSW from 1788, Port Stephens's rich resources were harvested; fishing and cedar getting were the main industries in the early nineteenth century. Port Stephens was occupied by the Australian Agricultural Company from 1824. Point Stephens lighthouse was erected in 1864 to provide safe entrance to Port Stephens. Under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1861, Tomaree Head was declared a reserve; it was used for recreational purposes and occasional squatting from the 1860s until the 1930s. In 1932, Alfred Ernest Dickenson made an application for a special lease of Tomaree Head to graze goats. Dickenson's lease was withdrawn in 1947, with the site having been used for health purposes since this time. In the interim, however, Tomaree Head played an important role in the defence of Australia during the Second World War. In March 1942, General Douglas MacArthur was appointed the supreme commander of the South West Pacific sector, \\"with authority over all allied naval, land and air forces in the theatre\\". This appointment effectively meant that MacArthur had control of the Australian forces.(ADB, Douglas MacArthur 1880-1964: http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150186b.htm) At this time, Port Stephens, including Tomaree Head, was developed as a World War Two military base by a joint Australian Army-United States Navy defence venture. Port Stephens was a vital part of the Australian coastal defence system during the Second World War, and become the focus of first Australian-United States combined training operations for the South-West Pacific sector. This included Camp Gan Gan (located around 4 km from Nelson Bay), Fort Tomaree (and the associated camps at Tomaree Head) and HMAS Assault on St Nazaire's Road, also known as the Joint Overseas Operational Training School (JOOTS), which became Nelson's Bay Migrant Hostel in the post-war period.NAA, HMAS Assault - Port Stephens 1953, Series number A5799, Control symbol 144/1953 Plans for two camps on Tomaree Head, to service the Fort Tomaree defence installations as part of the military occupation at Port Stephens, were prepared in 1941 by the New South Wales Government Architect / Department of Public Works. It is likely that these buildings were constructed by the New South Wales Department of Public Works on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, which was standard practice at this time due to labour shortages caused by the war. These 1941 plans of Tomaree Head show that most of the buildings dating from this time on the Tomaree Lodge site have been retained in-situ.Department of Commerce Plan Room MISC56/44 & MISC56/53 The surf battery within DADHC-owned land at Tomaree Head, consisting of two Quick Firing 3 pounder Hoskiss Mark 1 guns, was intended for close defence of the entrance to Port Stephens and the approaches to Shoal Bay: \\"After investigation, it was later decided to install land based torpedo tubes on the north west side of Tomaree Head. A special launching platform was constructed on the shoreline some 50m to the west of No. 2 Gun (3 pounder) of Surf Section. Support facilities including accommodation were provided for the naval personnel.\\"(WW2 Fortification Study, part 10, pp 1-3.) Two years after the end of the Second World War, in 1947, the Commonwealth Defence Department transferred the former military camp at Tomaree Head to the Department of Public Health, for use as a convalescent hospital for patients from State hospitals. An undated contour plan of the Tomaree Convalescent Home (-50) shows two groups of buildings on Tomaree Head at this time. The site of Tomaree Lodge is referred to on this plan as Lower Tomaree. At this time, it contained sixteen buildings numbered 34 to 52. It appears that these buildings had been used as the Garrison Camp for the C Company of the 20 Australian Garrison (Army) from 1942 until the close of the Second World War. This plan also shows that Upper Tomaree, located further to the south around Tomaree Head, was the site of the former Battery Camp and RAAF Camp during the war. The buildings at Upper Tomaree were demolished, and the site is now within the Tomaree National Park.Department of Commerce Plan Room MISC56/19 When the former Military Camp had been acquired by the New South Wales Government, it reportedly had been \\"an abandoned army camp, which seemed to be suitable for a convalescent hostel, but which had few amenities and little satisfactory accommodation. The first six patients arrived in June, 1947.\\".Health in New South Wales Vol 6 No 1 February 1965 In 1949, the Annual Report for the Inspector General of Mental Hospitals reported that \\"the establishment of a Convalescent Hostel for mental patients by the adaption of an ex-army camp situated at the southern headland at Port Stephens is more half completed so far as the accommodation required for male patients is concerned. Future development of the Hostel will provide for females as well as male patients, and in the meantime the accommodation for about fifty patients will be put into use.\\".Report of the Inspector-General of Mental Hospitals for the year ended 1949 Works at Tomaree continued into the 1950s, following the initiation of a \\"five-year plan of general development\\" in 1950. This plan involved the demolition of \\"the old army huts high on the hill\\" (presumably this is in reference to the camp at Upper Tomaree), with some 're-built in modernised form on the present site to provide additional accommodation for the increasing number of patients enjoying the hostel's peaceful surroundings. The new recreation hall was built from material salvaged with great ingenuity from the old army installations. Garages, workshops and other outbuildings were also erected\\". By 1952, the number of patients at the Tomaree Holiday Lodge increased to 118, with a staff of eleven. In 1953-55 \\"two tennis courts and a concrete cricket pitch were laid in the lawn area in the entrance to the grounds\\". In 1960 a holiday scheme was introduced whereby patients from other hospitals were given a two-week holiday at Tomaree before returning to their permanent accommodation; by 1962, there were approximately 40 holiday beds available. During this time, there was a permanent population of around forty residents who carried out maintenance works on the buildings and grounds. In 1965, it was reported that Tomaree Holiday Lodge was \\"used by the Health Department to provide holiday accommodation for long-stay patients from metropolitan and country psychiatric hospitals\\", known as Schedule 5 Hospitals. In this year, it was reported that \\"a new fresh water, white tile, swimming pool equipped with dressing and toilet facilities\\" was under construction.' Tomaree National Park, comprising 2266 hectares, was gazetted in 1984. The hospital reserve was divided and the eastern portion of it was added to the park. In 1985, the practice of providing \\"holiday beds\\" was suspended when permanent residents were relocated to Tomaree Lodge from the Stockton and Kanangra Centres. In 1989 the State Government proposed to sell Tomaree Lodge, but the decision was retracted following fierce local opposition. In 1992, Tomaree Lodge was in the ownership of the Department of Health and was included in the Department's s170 Heritage and Conservation Register in this year. By this time, the centre no longer provided respite holiday care for patients at mental hospitals in New South Wales, but was providing long-term accommodation for people with developmental disabilities. Tomaree Lodge has been operated by DADHC as a Large Residential Centre from 2001, providing accommodation for around 45-50 residents. Today, Tomaree Lodge occupies 8.8 hectares of land on the foreshores of Shoal Bay. Site plans dated to 1942 and 1959 show that Tomaree Lodge has changed little since it was erected in 1942; as at 2008, the buildings on the site were in roughly the same location and configuration as they were in these years.Department of Commerce Plan Room MISC56/21 In 2015, the state government announced that Tomaree Lodge would close to allow for the site to be redeveloped, and began privatising services under the National Disability Insurance Scheme and relocating residents to group homes. A local residents group, the Shoal Bay Community Association, raised concerns about the precinct being sold off to the highest bidder, and proposed that it be managed under a trust to preserve permanent public ownership. The facility is expected to close in 2018-19 upon the completion of the privatised group homes.  Description  Tomaree Lodge is situated between Tomaree Head and Shoal Bay, at the southern entrance to Port Stephens. Tomaree Lodge comprises a range of predominantly single-storey weatherboard buildings on the western foreshore of the headland. These buildings are mostly ex-World War Two Australian Army garrison camp buildings. The Tomaree National Park (established in 1984) occupies the remainder of Tomaree Head. DADHC land in the vicinity includes the ten Tomaree Lodge accommodation buildings as well as a number of administrative and amenity buildings, and 8.8 hectares of landscaped (terraced) land on the western side of the headland. Land held by DADHC in this area accommodates a range of structures including a swimming pool, work sheds, a fisheries laboratory, and at least two relics associated with Fort Tomaree, namely the surf battery and the footings for a torpedo tube. The sealed access road to the site terminates in a cul-de-sac with accommodation buildings to the west and administrative buildings to the east. The landscape of the site is terraced, with random rubble retaining walls and features mature Norfolk Island pines. The buildings on the site are mostly single-storey and the clustering of cottages used for accommodation provides a village atmosphere. A stone wall constructed by former residents runs along the foreshore of Shoal Bay. The ten cottages, which collectively make up Tomaree Lodge, are single-storey weatherboard buildings on the western foreshore of the headland. They were designed and built in 1942 by the New South Wales Government Architect's Office / Department of Public Works on behalf of the Commonwealth Government for use as an Australian Army garrison camp during the Second World War. Typically, these buildings are timber framed and are clad with weatherboard; they tend to have corrugated metal gable roofs. Those built on the embankment have un-rendered or painted brick bases, or engaged brick piers. A number of the cottages have fixed awnings and some retain timber framed double-hung sash windows. Ramps to the buildings, often with timber balustrades provide equitable access to the accommodation. Internally the cottages typically have timber floors and internal gyprock lining. Building 8 has caneite ceilings, wood grained panelling and exposed trusses. Previously, most of these buildings had internal lining containing asbestos which has been replaced. Internally Building 4 seems to retain the most intact room layout, although the doors have been extended. Various alterations to the cottages have taken place; the footprint of the cottages extended, alterations made to the roofs or modifications to doors, windows and other fittings. Various modifications have been made to both the site and buildings to allow equitable access, including installation of ramps and widening of doors. Services have been updated and verandahs have sometimes been enclosed and original windows replaced with aluminium-framed glazing. Some of the cottages elevated on brick piers have had brick enclosures built below. The site contains a range of distinctive features relating to its earlier uses including fortifications and installations, roads, gun placements, and a random rubble walled battery. On the headland's rock platform are random rubble terracing, drains, a roadway and sea walls. Tomaree Lodge adjoins the Tomaree National Park. The native vegetation of the Tomaree Peninsula is predominantly woodland with a number of identified rare and/or threatened plant species local to this area. The DECC / National Parks and Wildlife Service considers the natural areas have a high conservation value. = Condition = As at 3 September 2008, Tomaree Lodge comprises a range of buildings dating from its use as an army garrison during the First World War. The buildings are generally in good condition. The DADHC lands surrounding Tomaree Lodge have high archaeological potential, high archaeological research value and high heritage significance. There are likely to be archaeological remains of the Fort Tomaree Battery Camp, established on the headland in WWII. The camp was adjacent to the torpedo tubes and gun emplacement at the end of the headland and the remains would partly extend into the national park. Evidence may include building footings, artifact deposits, underground services and evidence of changes to the landscape including terracing. There may also be concrete bases and fixtures from searchlight towers, gun platforms and other defence works. The slope up behind the former Infantry Camp (now Tomaree Lodge) is also likely to contain archaeological evidence associated with the camp and Tomaree Battery, similar to that described above for the Battery Camp. Although the area has been heavily disturbed by WWII activity, given its location it is possible there may be remnant evidence of Aboriginal occupation of the area. One of the conservation strategies in the endorsed Conservation Management Plan (CMP) prepared for Tomaree Head National Park in 1999 was the systematic site recording and assessment by a qualified Historical Archaeologist for the whole site. A detailed archaeological assessment of this site is recommended in conjunction with the adjoining national park lands. Tomaree Lodge is a functioning Large Residential Centre which means that most of the buildings on the site are in good working order. Even though many buildings have undergone alterations and additions, the original form of the buildings is generally discernible. Tomaree Lodge is one of the few known surviving examples of this type of purpose-built accommodation for the military in the State. There are relatively few intact former World War Two army camps in New South Wales. = Modifications and dates = The original ex-World War Two Australian Army garrison camp at Tomaree Head was modified for use as a hospital in the 1950s.The site has been added to over the second half of the twentieth century to accommodate changing hospital needs, as outlined below. Modifications to the site have included: * 1950-1955 (by staff and DPWS) - army huts on hill demolished, rebuilt in modernised form to provide additional accommodation. New recreation hall built from salvaged material. Garages workshops and other building similarly built. Terracing, gardens, drainage, roads, rock work on original pool, land forming to Zenith Beach. * 1950-55 (DPWS) - major construction work including renovations, conversions of huts to staff cottages, wharf, swimming pools. * 1953-55 - 2 tennis courts, concrete cricket pitch. * 1965 - new swimming pool and facilities. * 1966 - administration building, new kitchens, dining room and balconies. * 1990s - land transferred to NPWS as part of Tomaree Head National Park.  Heritage listing  Tomaree Lodge has heritage significance at a State level. It has historic significance because of its use as an Army Garrison Camp during the Second World War. The site is a physical demonstration of Port Stephens' important contribution to the Second World War, when it was developed as a military base by the joint Australian Army-United States Navy defence ventures in March 1942, following the appointment of General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander of the South West Pacific sector. The site has high archaeological potential and high archaeological research value. There are relatively few intact former World War Two army camps in New South Wales which have such high archaeological potential. Any archaeological relics dating from the World War Two period on the site have the potential to contain information not available from other sources. It also has strong interpretive values and research potential due to its relationship to other World War Two military sites in Port Stephens and Newcastle, including Fort Tomaree (and the associated camps at Tomaree Head), Camp Gan Gan and HMAS Assault, also known as the Joint Overseas Operational Training School (JOOTS). The site is a landmark on the foreshore of Shoal Bay at the entrance to Port Stephens. The site is rare as one of the few surviving, relatively intact Army garrison camps dating from the Second World War in New South Wales. While Tomaree Lodge has some representative value as an example of a health facility in the state for people with mental illness and developmental disability, it is unique in this group due to its earlier use as a World War Two Army Camp.

Her first book, Buzz: The Stimulating History of the Sex Toy (2017) traces the history of sex toys in the USA from the 1950s to the present. Lieberman teaches science and technology journalism at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Life and education  While studying for her Masters in Advertising from the University of Texas, Austin, Lieberman threw home \\"Passion Parties\\" in 2004-2005 wherein she sold sex toys that were, at the time, illegal in Texas. Curious about the history of such legislation, Lieberman enrolled in the University of Wisconsin-Madison‚Äôs Mass Communications Doctoral Program, and studied the history of sex toys for her PhD dissertation (2014).  Significant findings  * Lieberman disputes the theory that Victorian doctors used vibrators to cure women‚Äôs hysteria. Lieberman traced the theory back to Rachel Maines‚Äô The Technology of Orgasm, and while agreeing that sources do back up claims that Victorian doctors used vibrators to treat upwards of 300 different diseases (hysteria being one of them), none of the diseases were cured by vibrators. On this same note, Lieberman also argues that Victorian vibrators were penetrative in purpose, and did not appear to be targeting clitoris stimulation. As such, her findings showed these vibrators were used for men and women. As such, there is documentation of the vibrators being used to treat impotence in men due to documented rectal attachments. Lieberman found that the vibrators were more likely used for relief of menstrual cramps than for anything related to hysteria, and that this myth is primarily rooted in a sexual fantasy. In 2018, with Eric Schatzberg, she published a further article challenging more of Maines' claims, in particular that massage to orgasm was ever a staple of medical practice. *The earliest sex toys were made of bone, ivory, teeth and have been traced back 30,000 years. *Lieberman also researches the double standards of legislation surrounding sex toy legislation. One of her studies highlighted that sex toys (which are mostly marketed to women and gay men) are illegal to sell in Alabama, and until 2008 they were illegal to sell in Texas whereas Viagra is covered by prescription and penis pumps are sold as medical devices. *Lieberman's research also highlights notable inventors in the field. One of whom is Gosnell Duncan, who is paraplegic, and invented the silicone dildo to assist those with disabilities experience pleasure. *Recorded that in the 1800s in China, glass dildos were hollowed out and filled with warm liquids to simulate ejaculation. *Analyzes the narratives around advertisements for sex toys. Lieberman traced that sex toys have symbolized radical gay sex and gay rights and also been marketed to further conservative values.

The team compiled a 5‚Äì1 record and closed its season by upsetting national champion Pittsburgh, 10‚Äì9. The team was coached by Xen C. Scott, assisted by Bob Dawson and former Yale star Ralph Kinney. The team was led by a backfield consisting of former Ohio State quarterback Gaylord Stinchcomb, former Minnesota halfback Walter L. Holmgren, former Georgia Tech fullback Judy Harlan, and former Auburn fullback Moon Ducote. The highlight of Auburn's previous season was its tie with Ohio State. Georgia Tech then dominated Auburn to claim the South's first national title. A game between national champion Georgia Tech and undefeated Pitt could not be scheduled, and was moved to the following season. Georgia Tech having lost several players to the War, Pitt won 32‚Äì0. The Cleveland Naval Reserves managed to upset Pitt with a 10‚Äì9 victory. \\"I intercepted a pass and returned it to midfield in the fourth quarter. I felt I at least had evened up some of the losses we had at Tech\\" said Harlan. Pittsburgh coach Pop Warner refused to acknowledge the loss, but declared Ducote \\"the greatest football player I ever saw\\". Warner, along with some reporters covering the game, insisted Pitt was robbed by the officials who, claiming the official timekeeper's watch was broken, arbitrarily ended the first half before Pitt was able to score and then allowed the Reserves extra time in the fourth quarter to pull ahead. It was Pitt's first loss in four years, since Warner had started coaching there. Ducote had a 41-yard field goal, and Stinchcomb scored a touchdown on a pass from Ducote, and kicked the extra point. Future basketball star Lenny Sachs was also on the team. In an 83‚Äì0 win over Cornell's service team, Stinchcomb ran 100 yards for a touchdown. In a 14‚Äì6 win over Camp Grant, Stinchcomb was the Navy's star, kicking two extra points and returning a punt 65 yards for a touchdown. In a profile of Stinchcomb published in November 1918, one writer observed: > The reason for such optimistic predictions is the showing Stlnchcomb has > made this season in the 'unofficial' football season all grid fans have > enjoyed.

It's located on the western edge of the Cascade Range and is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Mount Garfield is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. The mountain's name honors James A. Garfield, the 20th President of the United States. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate Garfield Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Garfield Mountain The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

It was built from 1838 to 1840. The design has been attributed to Mortimer Lewis. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Richard Windeyer (1806‚Äì1847), journalist, barrister, agriculturist and politician, was born on 10 August 1806 in London, the eldest child of parliamentary reporter for \\"The Times\\", Charles Windeyer and his wife Ann Mary, n√©e Rudd.Jose & Carter, 1926, 62 He remained in England when in 1828 his parents with the rest of their family migrated to New South Wales. He was admitted as a student in the Middle Temple, London in March 1829 and called to the Bar on 23 May 1834. In the meantime, as a journalist and parliamentary reporter like his father, he was connected with The Times, The Morning Chronicle, The Sun and The Mirror, and in 1834 was London correspondent for The Australian, using the initials \\"W.R.\\". He assisted Dodd in compiling the Parliamentary Pocket Companion, and was associated with Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson in the early anti-Corn Law movement.Jose & Carter, 1926, 672 On 26 April 1832 he married Maria, daughter of William Camfield of Groombridge Place and Burswood, Kent. Their only child, William Charles, was born on 29 September 1834. Although he always intended to follow his parents and their family to Sydney, Windeyer's departure from England was hastened by a letter from his father, saying that 'Dr Robert Wardell's death and Wentworth's expected departure and the division of the Bar makes the moment particularly favourable for your debut'. He set out with his wife and infant son arriving at Sydney on 28 November 1835. Windeyer soon gained a considerable legal practice and became a leader of the bar. Even Rev. John Dunmore Lang described him as \\"a barrister of superior abilities\\" In July 1846 Windeyer and Robert Lowe appeared for the defendant in Attorney-General v. Brown, concerning the right of the Crown to grant the Australian Agricultural Company (the AA Co.) the sole right to mine coal near Newcastle. The arguments for the defendants failed, but enabled Windeyer to array much legal and historical learning in support of the political view that the lands of the colony should be in the control of the colonists, not in the grant of the Crown. Windeyer's legal work was a small part of his activities in the colony. In February 1838 he bought his first land at Tomago in the Hunter Valley, not far from his father's farm at Tillegrah on the Williams River. By 1842 he held about . Vast sums of money were spent, especially on draining extensive swamp lands in the vicinity of Graham's Town, building a homestead at Tomago and on other improvements, but with little return. He planted of vines, imported a German vine-dresser from Adelaide, made his first wine in 1845 and received permission to import seven vine-dressers and one wine-cooper from Europe.Windeyer, 1967, edited, Stuart Read, 28 December 2008 The vineyard was established with plantings from James King of Irrawang, who was known to be producing good wines by 1840.https://www.nsw.nationaltrust.org.au/properties/tomago/default.asp Windeyer was one of the first successful vignerons on the Hunter. Windeyer commenced building Tomago house in 1840. Its design is attributed to New South Wales Colonial Architect, Mortimer Lewis.Broadbent, 1997, 221‚Äì6 Lewis' private commissions show a dependence on published sources, identified in recent years by architectural historian James Broadbent. \\"Fernhill\\" and \\"Tomago\\" boast separate entrance and garden fronts at right angles to each other, the garden fronts marked by bay windows. Their plants are probably adapted from the British architect William Wilkins' design for \\"Oxberton House\\", Nottinghamshire, as published by George Richardson in the \\"New Vitruvius Britannicus\\" (1802‚Äì08). The financial crisis of 1842 affected Windeyer severely. In 1842 Windeyer was present at the meeting at Sydney College at which petitions for representative government in the colony were adopted. In 1843 at the first elections for the New South Wales Legislative Council he stood for Durham County successfully. Windeyer at once took a prominent part in the affairs of the council. In 1843 he introduced his monetary confidence bill. Believing that the current depression was aggravated by a decrease of currency in circulation, and a lack of confidence and credit, he proposed a solution based on the Prussian Pfandbrief scheme as outlined by Thomas Holt before a select committee: the government was to give credit in the form of pledge certificates, or Pfandbriefe, on the security of land. The bill passed the council, but Governor Gipps withheld his assent. Windeyer's main interest in economic matters was directed at effective supervision and control by the council of revenue and expenditure. He worked so persistently for retrenchment that Lang described him as \\"the Joseph Hume of the Council\\". As a believer in free trade and the representative of an agricultural county, Windeyer worked to open the Van Diemen's Land market to tobacco from New South Wales and the United Kingdom market to the colony's wheat. In the debate on the tariff bill of 1843, however, he voted for an import duty of 1s. a bushel on foreign wheat but explained that he considered it a revenue not a protective duty. Always interested in education, Windeyer set up a school on his estate, was on the committees of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts and the Australian School Society, and prominent in the education debates. He was a member of the Aborigines Protection Society. His attention had been attracted to their legal disadvantages in the trial of an Aboriginal, Murrell, and the trials arising out of the Myall Creek massacre in which he had appeared. As the law stood, Aboriginals were not allowed to give evidence in the courts because they could not understand the nature of an oath. Windeyer supported proposals, later adopted, that they should be allowed to make unsworn statements. On his motion a select committee was appointed in 1845 to consider Aboriginal welfare, but it ceased work with his death. In his political activities Windeyer was no friend of Governor Gipps. In the disputes arising from Gipps's squatting regulations of 1844 he took a middle line between squatters and the executive. He condemned the squatters as \\"cormorants\\" and \\"robbers\\", but he also opposed the regulations, as he objected to the executive powers on which they were supposedly based. He, with Lang, Lowe and William Bland, led a \\"constitutional\\" party who sought to secure control of the land revenue for the colonial legislature. It was not as an advocate of squatting interests, but rather because of his insistence on what he asserted was correct constitutional doctrine, that he became a member of the committee of the Pastoral Association. In the Legislative Council he worked hard for what he believed were the interests of the colony and after each session he made a point of touring his electorate to give an account of his stewardship. Windeyer at Tomago ran cattle, horses and pigs, tried growing sugar-cane and wheat, and in 1846 with Reynolds, president of the local agricultural society, he imported the colony's first reaping machine from South Australia. Despite all his expensive improvements and mechanized farming the one prize he won was for pumpkins. However, after his death wine from Tomago won a certificate of merit at Paris in 1855. Progress on Tomago House was slow, hampered by the 1840s depression. It seems likely that the house was fit for habitation by 1847.National Trust, 2000, 1 The house formed the nucleus of what was, in the mid-19th century, a vast agricultural estate and the country residence of one of the nation's leading politico-legal figures. The house comprises two distinct buildings to which some modern structures have been added. The first phase was between 1842 and 1847, construction of the main stone house. Clear evidence exists to confirm that the house was originally constructed with a slate roof.National Trust, 1993 Little is known of the early form of the gardens at Tomago, though a sundial pedestal is mentioned in 1848.National Trust, 1987, 17 When in 1843 Windeyer added to his farm management and his immense legal practice the cares of a legislator in the Legislative Council, his health broke down and he was compelled to retire. Ill from overwork, financial worries and some internal disease, Windeyer died on a holiday near Launceston, 2 December 1847, when his role was far from completed. But his private affairs had suffered. His optimism and enterprise had led him to entertain projects that he could not afford and to incur large debts. From this cause and the economic depression of the 1840s, he died impoverished. His widow, a woman of remarkable character and determination, was enabled by money received from her family to retain a part of Tomago, where she lived, devoting herself to the prudent management of the property, the welfare of her infant son and local affairs. Although most of the holding passed out of family ownership his widow Maria was able to retain the house and . The estate included a range of outbuildings comprising a gatehouse, stables and dairy. Maria was left to complete the property, refinance it and maintain viability. This she did, adding to it with a Chapel built in 1860‚Äì1861. Maria Windeyer was determined not to return to Sydney as she had grown to love Tomago.Armstrong, 2008, 81 Her interest in the property is thought to have continued after her death, with inexplicable sightings of an elderly woman rocking in her chair on the verandah, and keeping a watchful eye in the cellars. Little is known of the early form of the gardens at Tomago, though a sundial pedestal is mentioned in 1848. Windeyer's untimely death and his wife's, initially, straightened circumstances have led to the assumption that the house had little or no gardens. Photographic and documentary evidence, and the bones of earlier planting strongly suggest that by the early 20th century there was a well developed landscape at Tomago. This included tree-lined drives, a pleasure garden located in the adjoining wetlands which were drained by a series of canals, a stone weir, an orchard and a kitchen garden. According to the 1846 memoirs of Margaret Traill Bartlett the gardens and orchards were \\"extensive and lovely, there was a lovers\\" walk, great magnolia trees at the side of the house, orchards made up of date palms, love apples, lemon and other citrus trees, mulberries and other fruit. The flower gardens were on one side terraced down to the river.'. The garden retains some venerable trees and other plants, such as stone pines (Pinus pinea), evergreen or Southern magnolia/bull bay (Magnolia grandiflora), giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) etc. Between 1850 and 1880 a second stage of construction occurred ‚Äì of a brick caretaker's cottage. This was originally a two storeyed building. It was reduced to a single storey cottage around 1950 when its brickwork was considered unsafe. Tomago House is noted for its fine verandahs looking over pastoral land; underground cellars were completed in time for the 1868 harvest; remnants of the 19th-century pleasure gardens; interiors which reflect the lives and times of a family of status and a social history which spans three generations of one of Australia's most distinguished families. In 1944 Tomago House was purchased by the British textile firm of Courtaulds. The house was renovated for use as a manager's residence. The modern structures on site date from the 1940s or 1950s and include the enclosure of the south-east verandah, a brick garage and laundry on the west corner of the caretaker's cottage and a timber garage on the north-east side of the caretaker's cottage. In 1970 it was acquired by a Mrs James as her residence and she installed a swimming pool (since filled in).National Trust, 2002, 26 In the 1980s the estate was held by two owners. When the Tomago aluminium smelter was established, the firm acquired Tomago House as part of the buffer zone established around the facility. In 1988 Tomago Aluminium gave with the house to the National Trust of Australia (NSW).Armstrong, 2008, 81‚Äì2 Le Seuer cites the date of this gift as 1986.Le Seuer, 2015, 7 The site of Tomago Aluminium smelter is rich in industrial history. A coal mine was established here in the early 19th century. Later the Courtaulds Textile Factory was here until 1976. In 1981 Tomago Aluminium began construction, In September 1983 aluminium production started. At that time Tomago Aluminium was the first large scale AP18 plant to be built in the world. Annual production capacity was 250,000 tonnes a year. It has since expanded to produce 525,000 tonnes per year ‚Äì the largest aluminium smelter in Australia. In 1986 to celebrate it bicentenary Tomago Aluminium donated five hectares of land which included the house to the national trust. In 1998 the National Trust reconstructed the picket fence of the chapel (on a different boundary line to the original and to a different design) and replanted the avenue linking the chapel and the house but with a different tree species. The National Trust currently uses the property as a function centre. The Friends of Tomago House have managed the estate since 1997. An October 2013 bushfire came within 20m of the house but it was secured thanks to volunteers and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, with no damage. The annual Camellia Festival and All Italian Day have become signature events.Silink & Hayes, 2014 In April 2015 severe storms led to extensive damage to a number of mature trees at Tomago House, involving many collapsing, damaging other trees, structures and in part the house. This devastation closed the property down for about 6 months, while it could be made safe for caretaker and visitor access and use again. Hunter Horticultural Services has assessed the damage and in two stages removed the worst-affected trees that could not be saved, and other damaged trees beyond repair and likely to fail in the future. In addition a condition audit was done on all remaining trees on the site. The National Trust is commissioning a landscape plan for the property including proposed future plantings in accordance with the site's conservation management plan.  Description  = Estate and grounds = The present estate is of parkland. Once it was , and the house was accessed primarily from the Hunter River, walking up to the house which stands on a small knoll with expansive views to and from it. The house was oriented for vistas to Mt. Sugarloaf although these are today blocked by trees. The vineyard was established, with plantings from James King of Irrawang, who was known to be producing good wines by 1840. Tomago House retains the core of a once larger rural estate, with its sweeping entrance carriage drives off Tomago Road approaching the house from the north-west, and another drive towards the chapel to the west. The drive is lined with jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), an evergreen magnolia / bull bay (M.grandiflora) and lemon- scented gums (Corymbia citriodora). The grounds are fairly thickly planted with mature coniferous trees reflecting the fashion for pineta or conifer collections in the 19th century ‚Äì these comprise predominantly exotic pine species including Mediterranean stone pine (Pinus pinea), Monterey pine (California: Pinus radiata), Bunya pine (Queensland: Araucaria bidwillii), Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and hoop pine trees (Northern NSW/ Queensland: Araucaria cunninghamii).Stuart Read, pers.comm., 23 January 2015 Other major trees include a number of large old Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), locally-native turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera), 20th-century plantings of jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Qld. lemon-scented gums (Corymbia citriodora) on both carriage loops and a large 19th-century mature bull bay / evergreen or Southern magnolia (M.grandiflora) south of the house towards the river terrace. Another unusual tree here is the South African Cape chestnut (Cupania capensis), north of the house. Large clumps of Mauritius hemp (Furcraea selloa) remain underneath the trees north of the house. Two large clumps of giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) are on the terrace south of the house and in the ephemeral lagoon area to the south, in the vicinity of the (lost) pleasure garden there. A solitary date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is north-west of the house on the grass terrace and several tall old specimens of locally-native cabbage palms (Livistona australis) remain in the lagoon area south of the house, probably predating it. A number of Qld. silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), Northern-NSW/Qld. brush box (Lophostemon confertus), locally-native red ash (Alphitonia excelsa), American sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) trees are also in the grounds. Near the front door of the house on the northern side a large orchid tree (Bauhinia variegata cv.) is covered with staghorn ferns. Other native species include smooth-barked apple/Sydney red gum (Angophora costata), native peach (Breynia oblongifolia), Qld. lacebark (Brachychiton discolor), Qld. black bean/native chestnut (Castanospermum australe); tuckeroo (Cupaniopsis anacardioides); corkwood (Endiandra sieberi); bangalay (Eucalyptus botryoides); W.A. yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia); flooded gum (E.grandis); tallowood (E.microcorys); blackbutt (E.pilularis); white mahogany (E. spp. (?E.acmenioides)); cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandi); broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia); white cedar (Melia azedarach); tree broom/heath (Monotoca elliptica); Qld./N.NSW firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus); magenta lily pilly (Syzygium paniculatum); red cedar (Toona ciliata) and woody pear (Xylomelum pyriforme); Darling or river lily (Crinum sp.); she oak (Casuarina sp.).Doran, 1999 Other exotic species include Cape chestnut (Calodendrum capense); Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica); camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora); Monterey cypress (Hesperocyparis macrocarpa); cockspur coral tree (Erythrina crista-galli); crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica cv.); Hupeh crab apple (Malus hupehensis); oleander (Nerium oleander cv.); avocado (Persea americana cv.); Mexican weeping pine (Pinus patula); Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), Lombardy poplar (P.nigra 'Italica'); plum (Prunus domestica cv.); peach (P.persica cv.); pear (Pyrus communis cv.); cherry guava (Psidium cattleyanum); tree gardenia (Rothmannia globosa); pepper tree (Schinus molle); Camellia japonica cv. shrubs; autumn camellias (Camellia sasanqua cv.s); oranges (Citrus sinensis cv.); Hibiscus spp.; French lavender (Lavandula dentata); Cocos Island palm (Syagrus romanzoffiana); star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides); laurustinus (Viburnum tinus); London or hybrid plane (Platanus x acerifolia); and Chinese wisteria (Wisteria sinensis). = Other structures = The estate included a range of outbuildings comprising a gatehouse, stables and dairy. A Chapel was added in 1860‚Äì1861 west of the house in paddock surroundings.S. Read, pers.comm., visit of 7/2006 A caretaker's cottage was added between 1850s‚Äì1880s ‚Äì originally two storeys, in brick. This was reduced to a single storey cottage in the 1950s. = House = Built by barrister Richard Windeyer, Tomago House formed the nucleus of what was, in the mid-19th century, a vast agricultural estate and the country residence of one of the nation's leading politico-legal figures.

Apart from the polished cedar joinery and plaster ceilings its present decoration is the result of the 1950s occupation by Courtaulds. The Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) are ailing which could be due to age (this species generally lives to around 100 years although it can survive to 140 years in NSW) or possibly be due to aluminium smelter development nearby and high fluoride issues. Cows in nearby paddocks show fluoride levels are excessive ‚Äì in their teeth. Needle rot (Cyclaneusma and Sphaeropsis fungi spread by windborne spores in spring and warm, humid summers are also a cause of problems. Their decline could also possibly be due to salinity as the site is only between 5 and 2.5 m above sea level.Hunter Heritage Network meeting, 28 July 2006 = Modifications and dates = * : reduced to estate * : mention of a sundial pedestal in the garden * 1861 chapel added. * : cellars in use. * 1850‚Äì1880: a second stage of construction occurred ‚Äì of a brick caretaker's cottage.

The house was the family home for 150 years of one of the most eminent legal families in New South Wales. It was built in a style and to a standard which befitted the social status of the Windeyers in the early years of expansion and development in the colony. It is one of the most important houses of the 1840s to survive largely unaltered in a geographical context which is also intact. Built by Sydney barrister and politician Richard Windeyer, Tomago House formed the nucleus of what was, in the mid-19th century, a vast agricultural estate and the country residence of one of the nation's leading politico-legal figures. Work on the house started in the early 1840s. The vineyard was established, with plantings from James King of Irrawang, who was known to be producing good wines by 1840. Windeyer died in 1847, leaving his widow Maria to complete the property, refinance it and maintain viability. This she did, adding to it with a Chapel built in 1860‚Äì1861. Tomago House is noted for its fine verandahs looking over pastoral land; interiors which reflected the lives and times of a family of status and a social history which spans three generations. Tomago today retains its original form, with its trees, farmland and wetlands. Planting is historically and botanically significant, including species contemporary with the early to late European development of the site from the 1830s to the 1890s, and remnant indigenous species.National Trust, 2001, 16 Tomago House and Chapel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

As happened with other regions, it was divided into Upper Bur and Lower Bur. Its territory covered parts of Agame, the entire Akele Guzay and lands further to the east, including perhaps even the Buri peninsula. The hagiography of Zemikael Aregawi narrates the people of Bur's rebellion against Kaleb. The same rebellion is recalled by the hagiographic tradition of the Sadqan, the \\"Righteous ones\\", who, before going to Metera, Bereknaha, Sorya, etc., together reached the \\"desert of Bur\\". Later, some other hagiographies indicate that from the 14th century Bur fell into the sphere of the Ewostateans' religious movement. In the first half of the 15th century. Bur seems to have been ruled by a shum, whom atse Zera Yaqob put under the supremacy of the baher negash, along with the governors of Shire, Hamasen and Seraye. In the time of atse Labne Dangal, the office of shum was occupied by Zamal, who, being a favorite of the Emperor, fought with him against Ahmad Ibrahim al-Gazi and was killed on 11 March 1529 in the battle at Sembara Kare. After the defeat of baher negash Yashaq in 1578, Bur fell under the rule of the Tigray mekonnen. The Turks, who tried to invade Bur, were beaten back and the head of their commander was sent to atse Gelawdewos. During the reign of atse Susanyos, however, challengers of the central secular and ecclesiastic authorities and \\"pretenders to the throne\\", such as Yaqob, and the false \\"Melkite\\" metropolitan, appear to have found some support among the ethnically and religiously heterogenous population of Bur. As a result, the Emperor sent punitive expeditions against Bur. As a coastal region, Bur was obviously of some economic importance for the emperors. Bur appears in the Chronicle of atse Iyasu II as a part of Tigray, called \\"the land of Bur which brings [the tribute of] 20 shekels of gold\\". In the later periods some smaller territorial units appeared in the area of Bur and the name of Bur fell out of use. Bur appears on indigenous maps of the northern Horn of Africa since the 15th Century. Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

It was designed by Percy Allan and built in 1899 by Morpeth contractor, S. McGill. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  =Timber truss bridges and Allan trusses= Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Allan trusses were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years. Percy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". =Dunmore Bridge= The bridge was built in 1899 by S. McGill at a cost of A¬£12,433, with J. Ferguson as inspector in charge of the work, under principal assistant engineer of bridges Ernest de Burgh. It replaced the 1863 Dunmore Bridge, which had been damaged in a flood in January 1895, and by 1896 was reported to be so suffering from the \\"ravages of cobra, white ant and rot\\" that a new bridge was required. Contractor McGill also built the Morpeth Bridge and the Hinton Bridge nearby. The new bridge was opened on 15 December 1899 by Walter Bennett MP, the Member for Durham. The lifting mechanism for the lift span has since been removed. The timber truss spans were replaced in 2013 with the same design, except replacing the wrought iron vertical tension members with steel and using blackbutt timber instead of grey ironbark.  Description  Dunmore Bridge is an overhead braced Allan type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss spans, each of , , and . It has an internal steel truss lift span of . There is a single approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of . The bridge has a height restriction of because of the overhead bracing between the tops of the trusses. The main spans of the superstructure are supported by twin cast iron cylinder piers. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of and a footpath. An Armco guardrail protects vehicular traffic, and a timber post and rail fence is provided on the footpath. The lifting mechanism is no longer in service following the removal of the lifting ropes and counter weights. The bridge was reported to be in good condition as at 13 September 2005. It has been well maintained by the RTA.  Heritage listing  Completed in 1899, the Dunmore bridge is a representative example of an Allan truss road bridge, and is one of three surviving overhead braced timber truss road bridges in NSW. The bridge also has a lift span to allow river traffic under it, which is a rare feature that also contains much technical significance and information about engineering technology of the late 19th century. Most of its engineering details are intact, and the bridge is in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The people who live in the area around the bridge (Woodville and the Hunter region) value the bridge highly, and as such it has social significance. Dunmore Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Dunmore bridge is a rare and representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. Dunmore Bridge over the Paterson River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Dunmore bridge is valued by the people of the Hunter region. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Highly rare - only combination of overhead Allan truss and lift span The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Highly representative of overhead braced Allan trusses: in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.

Legally, it is registered as a non-profit, non-commercial organization. The ACI was founded in 1927 as the Royal Aero Club of India and Burma Ltd. Prior to India's independence in 1947, the organization had vast regulatory powers including the authority to issue flying licences to pilots and to approve certified flight instructors, and to issue licences for arms and wireless facilities to foreign aviators. However, most of these powers were transferred to government agencies after independence. The ACI lost nearly all of its regulatory powers after the formation of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). History The ACI was founded by businessman and hotelier Victor Sassoon as the Royal Aero Club of India and Burma Ltd. (RACIB) on 19 September 1927. The club's primary objectives were to create awareness of air sports in the country, and to provide training to people seeking employment in commercial aviation. The club was patronized by the British Indian government since its inception with the Viceroy of India and Burma serving as its Patron-in-Chief, the Commander-in- chief of India serving as its President, and the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs serving as the Vice President. RACIB's constitution was very similar to that of the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain. RACIB received affiliation from the Royal Aero Club and the Societe Aviation Internationale. RACIB sought to establish flying clubs across the country in order to achieve its founding objectives. The first such club, the Delhi Flying Club, was formed in May 1928. RACIB subsequently established flying clubs in Karachi (in present-day Pakistan), Allahabad, Calcutta and Bombay. RACIB received financial assistance from the government to acquire two Pussmoth aircraft for each flying club. The government also assisted in the flying club's financial operations. The first flying licence was issued by RACIB to J.R.D. Tata in 1929. Tata would go on to make India's first commercial flight on 15 October 1932. Tata donated the plane used to make the flight to the Aero Club of India in 1985. Today, it is displayed, suspended from the ceiling, at the ACI's headquarters at Safdarjung Airport. RACIB essentially operated as a branch of the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain until India's independence. In the years preceding independence, RACIB had suspended all of its operations due to World War II. Post-independence in 1947, RACIB was re-constituted as the Aero Club of India Ltd. (ACI). India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru served as the organization's first President, and Constituent Assembly member H.N. Kunzru served as its Vice President. The ACI became a full member of F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale in 1950. The organization assumed its current name in 1963 by dropping the word \\"Ltd.\\" from its official name. Rajiv Gandhi became ACI President in 1984 and held the position until becoming Prime Minister of India in October 1984. The Rajiv Gandhi administration later allotted 30 acres of land near the Safdarjung Airport to the ACI for a period of 30 years at a concessional rate of per annum. The ACI moved into its new headquarters at Safdarjung Airport in September 1985. After the licence expired in September 2013, the ACI attempted to renew the licence for another 30 years and sent a cheque worth as a licence fee to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the current owner of the land. However, the renewal was denied by AAI who instead issued an eviction notice to the ACI. The ACI challenged the eviction in the Delhi High Court. The petition was dismissed by the Court which observed that the facility was being used \\"more as a marriage/party venue than a flying club\\", and that \\"no injustice had been meted out\\" by evicting the plaintiff.

With some 2.4 million followers on Instagram, Alqattan was a popular 'social media influencer' in the Arab world and used by a number of beauty brands to promote their products. Although a number of brands were fast to desert her, since media coverage and online attention about the controversy has died down, her popularity has bounced back and she is once again attracting a growing audience - albeit with comments on her accounts disabled. Video on domestic workers In the video, originally posted in Arabic on July 10, 2018, Alqattan questioned the government move to protect workers: \\"The new laws that have been passed are like a pathetic film,\\" CNN quotes her as saying. \\"For her to take a day off every week, that's four days a month. Those are the days that she'll be out. And we don't know what she'll be doing on those days, with her passport on her.\\" The Guardian quoted the post, ‚ÄúHow can you have a servant at home who gets to keep their passport with them? If they ran away and went back to their country, who‚Äôll refund me? I don‚Äôt want a Filipino maid anymore.‚Äù The new regulations, introduced as a result of an agreement signed between the governments of Kuwait and the Philippines, allow maids a weekly day off, the right to retain their passports rather than have the documents held by their employers (their 'sponsors') and the right to transfer their visas to another employer. Kuwaiti law also mandates a maid will work 12 hours a day, with a one-hour break, be provided a personal mobile phone with internet connection and be given an annual holiday of 22 days. Employers pay a $2,000 deposit against the maid's visa, as well as government registration fees of some $2,000. The new agreement was the direct result of an incident in which a Filipina maid working in Kuwait, Joanna Demafelis, was killed and her mutilated body stored in a freezer for a year. The maid's employer, a Lebanese man, was sentenced to death in April 2018 for her murder. The incident prompted Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, to order workers in Kuwait to return to their home country and ban the deployment of new workers to the country. Some 250,000 Filipinos live and work in Kuwait. = Reaction = Alqattan's original video prompted an international outcry and extensive media coverage. In response, Alqattan posted an unapologetic statement to Instagram, which intensified criticism. In further comments made to news agency AFP, she stated that the outcry was \\"unjustified\\" and did not require an apology. Her original video has since been deleted, although copies remain posted on YouTube. She has been quoted as saying the backlash against her is a ‚Äúforeign media campaign‚Äù against her and \\"an attack on Islam, the Hijab and Kuwait\\". Following the backlash, a number of beauty brands disavowed her comments and announced they would no longer work with her, including Max Factor, Shiseido, Phyto, MAC Cosmetics, M. Micallef and Chelsea Beautique. However, it appears she remains an active force in Middle Eastern online media, reputedly with Christian Dior. Repeated calls from media to Dior to enquire about its association with Alqattan have been ignored. In a subsequent statement, Christian Dior clarified that it does not have a business relationship with Al Qattan and stated that she attended their fashion show strictly in a private capacity. https://www.arabianbusiness.com/style/406335-christian-dior-does-not-have-any- business-relationship-kuwaiti-blogger-sondos-al-qattan  See also *2018 Kuwait‚ÄìPhilippine diplomatic crisis, former diplomatic tensions between Kuwait and the Philippines which resulted in new Kuwaiti laws regarding the treatment of Filipino workers. * Ascia AKF  References  Category:Living people Category:People from Kuwait City Category:Internet celebrities Category:Social media influencers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sondos Alqattan"},{"id":"57998463","title":"List of songs about animal rights"},{"id":"57998485","text":"VinaMazda is a Vietnamese joint-venture automotive company jointly operated by Mazda and THACO.

It was designed by Sydney architect James H. Bolster and built from 1911 to 1912 by Taree contractor E. Bacon. The property is owned by Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The current School of Arts is the third to be built in Laurieton. The first was blown down in a gale on 5 May 1898, while the second opened on 7 September 1898 and burned down on 30 August 1910. By 1910 Laurieton had a population of between 700 and 800 people, a school of approximately 160 children, an Anglican church 1899 (still surviving and opposite the School of Arts), a Catholic church 1898, a number of timber mills, a hotel 1900 and a number of stores along Laurie Street. Less than a month after the previous building burnt down the foundation stone for the current School of Arts building was laid on 20 May 1911 by Alec Thomson, secretary of the committee as a small compliment in appreciation of his service, and it was opened five months later on 8 September. The architect was James H. Bolster of Concord, Sydney. The 1911 building remains standing today with little change. Accounts from the time of its opening describe the new building \\"as a palatial structure\\" and one of the finest Schools of Arts north of Newcastle. It is described as having a 72 feet x 32 feet hall with glass skylight in the ceiling with provisions for a library reading room, billiard room and several other rooms. The hardwood timber framing and red mahogany internal lining and weatherboards were provided by Robert Longworth's mill at Laurieton. Longworth was the President of the School of Arts, one of the guarantors for the construction bank loan, and described as a \\"guiding force behind the project\\". In 1916 the memorial trees were planted around the School of Arts. In 1915 the train line was completed to Wauchope, marking a major change of transport method for the region and possibly the growth of Kendall and Wauchope, rather than Laurieton. This slow growth undoubtedly reduced the need for major change in the School of Arts building and allowed its existing rooms to be adapted with little alteration, right up to the present date. Schools of Arts from the 1920s to the 1950s continued to often be the major entertainment and cultural focus and in Laurieton the School of Arts typically played a major role in the life of the community until the 1960s. Pictures were shown in the hall since 1918 and the travelling picture show was replaced in 1947 with a twice a week program. The projection box was placed on top of the entrance. Cinemascope was introduced in 1957 and in 1959 films ceased when the Laurieton Plaza was opened. In August 1944 Bob Hope held a concert in the School of Arts after his Catalina flying boat lost power and crash landed in the Camden Haven Inlet. In 1955 Chips Rafferty visited the School of Arts hall to attend a screening of his latest film. Many of the current members of Camden Haven Historical Society have vivid memories of the wide and varied use of the hall, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. There were balls, juvenile dances for the teenagers, amateur vaudeville shows, tap dancing, Slim Dusty travelling shows, political meetings, bingo and card nights. The use of the hall was such that the flooring had been sanded down to joints and had to be replaced in the 1980s. The pictures were run by Bruce Longworth on behalf of Peter Hatsatouris of Port Macquarie up until the building of the Plaza Cinema in 1959. In 1954 an ex-serviceman, Alfred Baker, started a hairdressing salon in the service verandah and took over as manager of the billiard room. He and his patrons played much billiards, and the hairdresser was also likely to have been a bookie. It is likely the kitchen was modified at this time, including an outside door. In 1956 the billiards stopped and the room was leased to the Country Women's Association (CWA) who occupied the room until 1980. The Laurieton Returned Servicemen's Club was established in the 1950s and by 1960 television had arrived in the town. The society began to change and patronage of the Hall dropped off. In addition, in about 1957 the myriad of small local mills that had previously existed ceased trading, all of them bought out by one mill. In 1965 the exterior of the building was re-painted. The library and reading room continued to be the town's library, run voluntarily, until 1981. In the late 1970s the building transferred from the Department of Education to the Department of Sports and Recreation. In 1996 the entrance partition with ticket office was removed and put understage. Between 1971 and 1980 the main function of the School of Arts building, apart from the CWA and some patronage of the hall, was as a library. Sylvia Longworth was volunteer librarian from 1948 to 1971. In 1975 the library expanded into the reading room, and in 1978 into the supper room and also into the entry hall. By 1980 there were 31,790 books with a membership of 913. The Hastings Council took over the management of the building in 1981 and, in addition, opened a local office in the old billiard room. In 1981 the Hastings Council also took over the library and after this time the librarian was paid. In 1992 the library moved into new premises in Laurieton. Renovation and restoration work carried out in the 1980s included replacing hall doors, replacing of all roofs and gutters, repair of cladding and fascias, repair or replacement of windows.  Description  The School of Arts building has a timber frame with framed with painted timber weatherboard cladding, eaves lining and casement windows, and a galvanised iron roof with dutch gables. The hall has an entry porch off Laurie Street and the rest of the rooms are at a lower level with library and billiard room entry from Bold Street. The building retains its original rooms and layout, including a large hall with stage and two dressing rooms, a supper room with kitchen and servery, a billiard room, a library and separate reading room and central corridor. All rooms were internally connected via the hallway, with the exception of the Billiard Room, and could be used collectively or separately. The building has a high degree of integrity. Both exterior and interior fabric have undergone only minor changes and some of this is capable of being reversed. There have been no additions to the building. It stands remarkably intact and similar to when it was opened in 1911. = Modifications and dates = * 1919: Concrete steps added between billiard room and entry hall. * 1954: Service verandah leased to hairdresser; new external door and window; closed off door and window to servery. * 1956: Billiard room closed down and room leased to CWA until 1980; billiard lights removed. * 1965: External cladding painted; concrete replaced timber decking to verandah. * 1975: Library relocated into reading room and later (1978) into supper room.

It has strong associations with the cultural life of Laurieton in the first half of the twentieth century.Trevor Jamison, Conservation Management Strategy 2003 Laurieton School of Arts was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It represents the optimal development of a School of Arts in New South Wales. The building contains not only the original hall facilities with kitchen and servery but also an integrated library, reading room, and a billiard room. It illustrates the importance associated with Schools of Arts in the early twentieth century in New South Wales. Its intact timber-lined interiors demonstrate typical early 20th century School of Arts taste and customs. It is also one of only a handful of surviving buildings in Laurieton which are associated with the hard wood timber industry on the Camden Haven Inlet. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building has a fleeting but memorable local association with Bob Hope, the American entertainer. It also has a local historical association with many of the early families of Laurieton. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Laurieton School of Arts is a well- designed and representative communal building in the Federation style. It demonstrates the high standards of once common timber building, design and construction in the early twentieth century in New South Wales. The rare intact 1911 interior demonstrates the culmination of traditional timber board lining and detail in New South Wales. The aesthetic significance is enhanced by the presence of original timber stools, a table, and the hall ticket partition. It is a landmark building, located on a prominent corner of the town, with other surviving early timber buildings nearby. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building played the major role in the social and educational life of Laurieton town from 1911 until the 1950s. It served as the town's library until the 1970s, the town's cinema from 1912 until the 1950s, and there is a wealth of evidence relating to the use of the hall for a wide range of community activities until the early 1960s and it has a high community use today. It is held in high regard by the Laurieton community, as a reminder of their past, in its association with a number of local families and as the hub of entertainment until the 1950s. This is demonstrated by the town's celebration of the building's Diamond Jubilee in 1971. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building provides valuable evidence of typical timber construction techniques at the beginning of the 20th century. This includes tenon and mortar joints, typical timber and steel truss roof and typical single span and collar beam roof construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Laurieton School of Arts building is a rare example of a sophisticated School of Arts building in New South Wales. Its intact timber lined interiors are a rare example of the culmination of this traditional style and construction. This includes timber lined kitchen still being used for this use. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building's high standard of timber detail designs and construction is representative of a once common skill in timber towns on the North Coast of New South Wales. The building is a representative Federation style. The Hall stage and Dressing Rooms are typical School of Arts design in New South Wales at the turn of the century.

The word/ concept Langmaiching was changed to Nongmaijing, a meaningless word to destroy the creation theory of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak). Langmaiching = Lang + mai + ching, ‚ÄòLang‚Äô here means a thing like a net catching, attracting things, ‚Äòmai‚Äô means human face, the front part of the Human Head, and ‚Äòching‚Äô means ‚Äòchingsinpa‚Äô attracting. Therefore, Langmaiching means a point in vast Universe where the Universal God Father, attracting all elements composing the Human Body, started creating a man. This point of starting creation of man is the centre of the Human forehead, the ancient Kanglei Meetei call ‚ÄòLaipak‚Äô means ‚ÄòGod is clinging , God sticks permanently‚Äô. After the Universal God Father started the Human creation at the Laipak (forehead) of the Human body, he completely created the Human head, consisting the Head, the Hair, Forehead (Laipak) etc. of the Human Body. This is the first day of the week, Langmaiching (Sunday) of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak. Since the time of fully creating the Human head, the Universal God Father, the Tingpalpa Mapu or Eepung Loinapa Apakpa of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak stays at the Human forehead (Laipak) up to the death of the Human Being. This is why, the Kanglei Meetei Race call the Human body is a Laishang (temple) since the days of deep B.C. =Ningthoukapa, the second day= Ningthoukapa = Ning + thou + kapa, ‚ÄòNing‚Äô here means Ningpa, Khanpa of the Kanglei dialect, in English mind, thinking, ‚Äòthou‚Äô here means thoupa in Kanglei dialect and in = English driving. Therefore, the Kanglei Meetei word/concept ‚ÄòNingthou‚Äô , King in English, means the God, the Universal GodFather. ‚Äòkapa‚Äô here means ascends, comes-up, in English. Therefore, the second day of the Kanglei peoples‚Äô week, Ningthoukapa means the Universal God Father, who is the real Driver of Human mind, Human action, comes up (ascends) to the forehead (Laipak) of the Human body to stay there up to the death of the man. =Leipakpokpa, the third day= Leipakpokpa = Leipak + pokpa ‚ÄòLeipak‚Äô actually means the Earth, but here means the Human body, ‚Äòpokpa‚Äô here means pokpa in the sense of Angang Pokpa, in English ‚Äògiving birth‚Äô as in the sense of child birth. The Kanglei Puya, the scripture of the Meetei Race calls the Human body as ‚ÄòLiving Earth‚Äô. From this 3rd day of Kanglei peoples‚Äô week, Leipakpokpa the Universal God Father who is residing in the Laipak (Forehead of the Human Body) begins to create the main human body part below the Head, from neck to other lower parts containing Heart, lungs, liver, kidney etc. This is the Third day of the Kanglei week, Leipakpokpa. =Yumsakeisa/Imsakeisa, the fourth day= Imsakeisa = Im + sa + keisa, here ‚ÄòIm‚Äô means present word yum, meaning dwelling house, in English; ‚Äòsa‚Äô means sapa, meaning to build, to construct in English; ‚ÄòKeisa‚Äô here means to build, to construct a Barn for storage of energy, elements composing of a human body to compensate the loss of these things in any eventuality of the Human Body. Why the 4th day of the week, Imsakeisa is so named? In the forehead (Laipak), the Universal God Father, Tingpalpla Mapu or Eepung Loinapa Apakpa, the first cause of the Universe resides, whereas in the Human body in the Heart, the Taipang Palpa Mapu (Lord of the Earthly life, Jiba Atma of the Hindus) resides. In the forehead (Laipak), the Universal God Father in the symbol # (ONE), and in the Heart, the Universal God Father in the symbol W resides in the Human body. The human body as created by the God has certain things like Blood, Amino Acid etc. etc. So, the question of constructing a Barn arises in the Imsakeisa, the 4th day of the week. =Sakonsen, the fifth day= Sakonsen = Sa + kon + sen, ‚Äòsa‚Äô here means the animal body, here in the particular circumstances, the Human body; ‚Äòkon‚Äô means in Kanglei dialect ‚ÄòKonba‚Äô, Konbiba and in English to keep under care and protection; ‚Äòsen‚Äô means sennaba in Kanglei dialect and to keep under vigil of the Human body. On the 5th day of the week, Sakonsen the Universal God Father enters in the Heart of the Human Body to protect and to take care of the Human Body up to Death as Taipangpalpa Mapu (Lord of the Earthly life). =Eelai, the sixth day= Eelai = Ee + Lai, ‚ÄòEe‚Äô here means blood, Human blood; ‚ÄòLai‚Äô here means God, the Universal God Father. The Human blood is the Universal God Father, the Eepung Loinapa Himself When the Universal God Father comes to the Earth to create living beings for the first time, He comes in the symbol #(ONE), the dot ([) on the symbol # is called ‚ÄòEelik‚Äô means a drop of blood from His body, this Eelik ([), blood drop is the blood of every living beings on the Earth. This blood of the Universal God Father is put to the heart and to all parts of the human body, on Eelai (Friday). =Thangcha, the seventh day= Thangcha = Thang + cha, the ‚ÄòThang‚Äô here means in Kanglei Dialect Thangtharakpa, Pitharakpa, further means in English to send down, to drop down, etc.; the ‚Äòcha‚Äô here means Chata Nouta (the descendants), macha (the sons and daughters) of the Universal God Father. On this seventh day of the week of the Kangleicha Meetei Race, the Thangcha, the Universal God Father has completed the creation of a man and ready to send down on the Earth for further spread on the surface of the Earth. Constellation Corresponding to those seven days of the week of the Kanglei peoples, there is a constellation of seven stars in the sky, as described by the Puya, Wakoklon Heelel Thilel Salai Ama-ilon Pukok which was written about 3500 years BP by the Kanglei Ancestors in Kangleipak: \\"8 ti Eenunglonna Thouwaimichak Apakpa Oipana Pu Ama Koukhale  Khununglonna Thouwaimichak pee malik sitapa Cheion Talet Haina Haikhale \\" Rough English translation of the above quotation: \\"The 8th , the group of stars forming a constellation (in the space), is known as Thouwaimichak Cheion Talet (Seven Stars which can became Human beings on the Earth.\\" In the above quotation, ‚ÄòPu Ama‚Äô , here ‚ÄòPu‚Äô means Grand Father, the oldest male person in a family is called ‚ÄòPu‚Äô , ‚ÄòAma‚Äô means one. Therefore, the seven stars group is a constellation, the group of the seven stars is known as \\"Thouwaimichak Cheion Talet\\" here Thouwaimichak (star in English) = Thou + wai + mi + chak, here ‚Äòthou‚Äô means to drive, ‚Äòwai‚Äô here means interaction between elements, ‚Äòmi‚Äô here means the God in the Human beings on the Laipak(forehead), and ‚Äòchak‚Äô here means Machak (elements forming the Human body). The concept of a ‚ÄòThouwaimichak‚Äô star is so complex in Kanglei Dialect. In the formation of a ‚ÄòThouwaimichak‚Äô(a star), there are five elements Fire, Water, Air, Leipak (soil), Space. These five elements along with the ‚Äòmi‚Äô the God elements in the Human body. The five elements in the Human body is driven by the ‚Äòmi‚Äô to form a human body with mind and consciousness. This is the soul theory of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak. Soul consists of six elements according to the ancient Kangleipak, that is, Fire, Water, Air, Leipak (soil), Space and ‚Äòmi‚Äô. The Meetei Race of Kangleipak has seven days of the week, since about 20,000 years B.P. as evidence by the Puya, the scripture of the Kanglei Meetei Peoples and Kangla Excavation 2009. The last day of the week is Thangcha‚Äô On ‚ÄòThangcha, the last day of the week, creation of Life ( a prototype of all living Beings) its completed and the God Father sent down to the Earth for further spread on the earth. The day of the week, the last day of the week, Thangcha is the day on which life was sent down by the Universal God Father to the Earth. The first Thangcha of the ‚ÄòLamta Month‚Äô the third month of the year is the first day on which the Life (from the Universal God Father) came to colonize the Malem (the Mother Earth) for the first time in the Life History of the Earth. ‚ÄòCheion‚Äô Cheion = Cha + i + on = here ‚Äòcha‚Äô means Descendants, ‚Äòi‚Äô means blood, ‚Äòon‚Äô means onba further means change into, ‚ÄòTalet‚Äô means seven. Therefore, the seven stars forming the constellation (Pu Ama) consists of Everything, Every elements in them to become living beings (here Human beings). The human creation theory of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak is a theory of Extraterrestrial Origin of Life also. These seven days of the week of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak give birth of the 19 Kanglei Eeyeks including the cheising Eeyek Ama in the symbol # also. These seven days of the week are part and parcel of the Universal God Father, Ting Palpa Mapu Eepung Loinapa Apakpa, the Ancient Kanglei Forefathers said \\"The Kanglei Alphabets is the Universal God Father and Kanglei Meetei Language is the mother.\\" Koubru, the first place for human habitation After Godfather Eepung Loinapa Apakpa created humans under his guidance and makes people's settlement to the place where God's living place in Earth where there was many fruits, eatable can be found for living.

It was also known as Tsuruga Castle. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1934. Background Kanegasaki Castle is located on a small hill 86 meters above sea level, in the northeastern part of the city of Tsuruga. A fortification was first constructed here by Taira no Michimori (1153-1184) while fighting against Kiso Yoshinaka in the Genpei War. All that remains at present are the remnants of stone and earthen enclosures, moats and the foundations of the central building and gate. A Shinto shrine, the Kanegasaki-gu was built near the base of the hill during the Meiji period History During the Siege of Kanegasaki, forces loyal to Nitta Yoshisada was trapped for three months at Kanegasaki Castle by Ashikaga Takauji. Nitta's ally Ury≈´ Tamotsu was forced back to the Somayama Castle in March 1337, and Nitta Yoshisada joined him soon afterwards. A failed counter-attack from Somayama Castle failed to lift the siege against Kanegasaki, whose defenders were reduced to eating horseflesh to survive, and almost resorted to cannibalism before surrendering. Nitta Yoshiaki, (the son of Nitta Yoshisada) Prince Takanaga, and some 300 partisans of the Southern Court were killed or committed suicide when the castle fell. Another battle was the Siege of Kanegasaki (1570) when the Oda Nobunaga led a failed attack against the forces of the Asakura clan. Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then known as ‚ÄúKinoshita Hideyoshi‚Äù fought a celebrated rear-guard action by which Nobunaga was able to escape the defeat.

Description Cox's goby is dark brown to greenish-brown in colour on the back and flanks, this colouration fades to pale brown or cream on the underside. The scales on the lower flanks are mottled with blue, gold and yellow and there is a single black spot above the base of the pectoral fin. The juveniles have series of elongated blotches on their flanks which merge as they nature to create a wide, dusky, mid-lateral stripe. The head is dark brown with the lower jaw and throat often coloured black and with two indistinct, dark stripes radiating from the rear of the orbit across operculum. Its fins vary from colourless to blackish-grey and the dorsal fins have between one and three dark stripes with a yellow or orange background colour. The margins of the fin are frequently fin margins yellow and the caudal fin is marked with many dark spots which are arranged in irregular bands. The body of Gobiomorphus coxii is nearly cylindrical and tapers towards the tail, the head is large with a blunt, round snout and the quite small eyes are positioned high on the head. The mouth is relatively large, oblique and turned upwards with the lips ending lust below the front part of the eyes. They have jaws armed with bands of fine, pointed teeth. The cheek and operculum have lines of papillae which are also found around the preopercular margin and on each side of snout to above the eye. There are 3-5 large pores on the preopercular margin. It has two dorsal fins, the first, anterior dorsal fin, is rounded and has notches between its six spines and the second, posterior dorsal fin, is taller and slightly longer. The anal fin is below the second dorsal fin but it is smaller and rounder. The caudal fin is quite large and is, truncated while the pectoral fins are also large and are rounded and the rather long, pointed pelvic fins are located on the thorax. Males grow toa macimum standard length of but are more commonly , but the females grow larger than the males. Distribution and habitat Gobiomorphis coxii is endemic to eastern Australia from southern Queensland to Gippsland. It also occurs in the Swan River in Western Australia where it is thought to be an Introduced species. This species occurs in coastal and inland freshwaters up to around in altitude where it is normally found in upland streams with reasonable fats currents, even in rapids. Biology The populations of Cox's gudgeon appear to be more abundant in the more southerly rivers in its range, it is especially numerous in flowing areas, even rapids.. The adults do not occur in the lower reaches and they range upstream up to and they are rare near the sea. They have been recorded ascending dam walls and waterfalls using their pectorals even outside of the water flow. The adults feed on aquatic insects and on mosquitofish. The juveniles are generally found in the lower reaches of rivers, closer to their mouths and migrate up stream as they mature. Females lay eggs onto rocky surfaces which are the guarded and fanned by the male for several days until they hatch into free-swimming larvae which are carried downstream.

It is a terrestrial orchid with broad, pleated leaves and up to and twenty pale pink flowers with dark red veins on the labellum. It grows in wetter habitats including swamps. Description Geodorum terrestre is a leafy, terrestrial herb with crowded, often yellowish pseudobulbs long and wide. The leaves are glabrous, pleated and long and wide. Between eight and twenty pale pink flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem long. As the flowers open, the flowering stem droops downwards and as the flowers wilt, the stem becomes upright again. The sepals are long, about wide with boat-shaped lateral sepals. The petals are long, wide. The labellum is pink with dark red veins, long and wide with the sides curved upwards. Flowering occurs between December and February in Australia and between March and May, or October and November in Asia. Taxonomy and naming Pink shepherds' crook was first described in 1759 by Carl Linnaeus who gave it the name Epidendrum terrestre. He published the description in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, based on an illustration in Rumphius's Herbarium amboinense. In 1994, Paul Abel Ormerod changed the name to Phaius terrestris but Leslie Andrew Garay considers that it was a mistake to attempt to reconcile Linnaeus' description with a later description from 1763, and relies on the original illustration in the Herbarium Amboinense. In 1997, Garay changed the name to Geodorum terrestre. The specific epithet (terrestre) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the earth\\", referring to the terrestrial habit of this orchid. Distribution and habitat Geodorum terrestre occurs between Nepal and northern Australia. It grows in moist forest including rainforest, in river gullies and near waterfalls. In Australia it occurs in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, in northern parts of the Northern Territory and in eastern Australia between Cape York and the Macleay River in New South Wales.

He is known in electrochemistry as the inventor of the mixed metal oxides (MMO) coatings onto titanium, and the creator of two patents known as Beer I and Beer II. He was awarded the Vittorio de Nora- Diamond Shamrock award in 1980,H.B. Beer. Journal of Electrochemical Soc. 127, 1980, 303C and an honorary doctorate degree by the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands in 1986.  Titanium-based electrodes  Henri Beer was working from 1957 to 1972 at the company Magneto Chemie (since 2002, Magneto Special Anodes, in The Netherlands),https://www.eip- water.eu/organisations/magneto-special-anodes- bvhttp://www.magneto.nl/en/company/historie where he investigated the possibilities of coating titanium with a precious metal or precious metal oxide; he found this could be used to replace graphite in a chlor-alkali cell. He first experimented with rhodium electroplated onto titanium, and filed a patent on this. Almost simultaneously, but independently, J.B. Cotton's group in the Metals Division of ICI filed a patent on platinum electrodeposited onto titanium. The small-sized Magneto Chemie started collaborating with the much larger ICI on the development of titanium-based electrodes. Beer working at Magneto focussed on coating formulations, whereas others were working on the commercial viability of coatings onto titanium electrodes.P.C.S. Hayfield, Plat. Met. Rev. 42, 1998, 46 The platinum electroplated titanium electrodes had a large overpotential for chlorine evolution. The next step was moving from platinum electroplated titanium to platinum-iridium mixtures applied using the paint-thermal decomposition method. This eventually resulted in a platinum-iridium Pt/Ir 70/30 composition, with a much lower overpotential for chlorine evolution.P.C.S. Hayfield, Plat. Met. Rev. 42, 1998, 27  Patents  In 1965, Beer proposed another change in coating: application of ruthenium oxide onto titanium, and filed his first patent on mixed metal oxide coatings, known as Beer 1. That patent described the co-deposition of titanium and ruthenium oxides. Beer sold his technological concepts to the Italian company De Nora. In 1967, the Beer 2 patent followed, which covered the optimal, stabilized ruthenium-titanium oxide mixture (RuO2/TiO2) for chlorine evolution in the chlor-alkali process.H.B. Beer.

It is the remains of cottages for convict overseers', built from 1823 to 1830 by convict labour. The property is owned by Port Macquarie- Hastings Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 2010.  History  Part of the site underwent archaeological excavation in May and June 2006, in advance of the Glasshouse development. Historical research had indicated the presence of a number of previous structures associated with the 1821-32 penal settlement. The excavation was confined to the area of the basement for the new theatre. The excavation concentrated on the Quarters of the Deputy Superintendent of ConvictsCottage 1and two buildings occupied by the Free Overseers.Cottages 2 and 3 The other two cottagesCottages 4 and 5on the original Henrietta, later Elizabeth Street, frontage were to the west of the excavation area or off site to the west. Only a small portion of the allotment to Cottage 1 was within the excavation area. There is no precise date for the construction of the cottages. They are first shown on a map dated to 1824. Additional historical research indicated that the Deputy Superintendent of Convicts and the Free Overseers were appointed in 1823, so it is highly likely that the cottages were built to receive their new occupants in that year. ;Penal settlement Port Macquarie was one of a number of penal settlements for the secondary punishment of offenders. Convicted criminals were sent to New South Wales from 1788 to the end of transportation in 1840. If they were convicted of additional crimes in New South Wales, they were sent to places of secondary punishment. On the New South Wales coast, Newcastle was the first penal settlement for secondary punishment from 1804 to 1824, followed by Port Macquarie from 1821 to 1832 and Moreton Bay from 1829 to 1838. The purpose of these penal settlements was to remove the convict to a place of isolation from the rest of the free population, to keep them at hard labour, as a deterrent to others. Even with the end of transportation in 1840, Cockatoo Island in Sydney was still planned as a place of secondary punishment in 1839, closing in 1869. Port Macquarie was like most of the other places of secondary punishment, in fact also similar to some of the first penal settlements in New South Wales. They all required a similar suite of buildings and all were divided into Military Department, Civil Administration and Convict Accommodation. The Deputy Superintendent of Convicts and the Free Overseers were part of the Civil Administration and came under the authority of the Superintendent of Convicts. They were responsible for the daily and weekly musters and supervision of the labour of the convicts. ;Archaeological excavation The archaeological excavations of the Glasshouse have made an important contribution to our knowledge of the Penal Settlement at Port Macquarie. While the historical maps showed the cottages on their allotments, divided from kitchen gardens at the rear, they did not reveal the complexity of the sequence of buildings, the extensions and outbuildings to the cottages, showing a period of high activity in the 1820s. The accommodation or floor space of these buildings was doubled or more than doubled by this archaeological evidence. The sequence of changes was particularly well preserved between Cottages 2 and 3, where a roadway to the kitchen gardens was replaced by a fenceline, encroached on by at least two phases of extensions and outbuildings to Cottages 2 and 3 and finally became a metalled yard area in the 1830s. The allotments of the Deputy Superintendent of Convicts and Free Overseers measured 57 3/8 perches or 1,451 square metres, being 70 feet wide and approximately 223 feet deep (21.3 by 68 metres). The frontage to Henrietta, later Elizabeth Street was occupied by the houses, the rear by kitchen gardens. The allotments and cottages were numbered 1-5 from east to west. Cottage 2 was of slab construction and Cottage 3 was built using brick. Both buildings measured 25 by 30 feet (7.62 by 9.14 metres) and comprised a central hallway, flanked by two front and two rear rooms. On Allotments 1, 2 and 3, there is archaeological evidence for both extensions and outbuildings, which doubled, or more than doubled the available floor space. On the basis of room size and also living space, the Deputy Superintendent of Convicts and the Free Overseers were housed to a high standard in buildings constructed by convict labour under the supervision of the military engineer or inspector of public works. In fact they enjoyed a standard of accommodation above that occupied by others in a similar social or economic position. The artifact assemblage reveals that the Free Overseers enjoyed a standard of living consistent with others, who could not afford to purchase property, but lived in rented accommodation. Furthermore the excavations revealed the presence of a previously unsuspected brick barrel drain, running along the rear of the houses towards the east and to the alignment of Allman Street (now approximately Hay Street). The brick barrel drain was obviously part of a network of drains, including another drain previously located on the Henrietta, later Elizabeth Street frontage. This excavation has provided the first opportunity to see how the components of a brick barrel drain functioned and how it related to the buildings it served. In addition the excavation has revealed other features that were unexpected, including two shallow timber- lined wells, taking advantage of the raised water table in this low lying area. The re-used timbers appear to have come from earlier buildings, probably dating from 1821 to 1823, when the Overseers' Cottages were built. The timbers were raised after the completion of the excavation and will be conserved. At the rear of the allotments, the fencelines and divisions of the kitchen gardens were revealed by excavation. There was clear evidence of hoe or spade cultivation using convict labour, as well as uncultivated areas used as central pathways or roads. The powers of the Commandant of the Penal Settlement were formally handed over to the Police Magistrate in 1832, the year following the opening up of the area to free settlement. The penal establishment was not however completely closed and continued to house \\"convict specials\\", invalids and the insane from 1833 until 1847. The residence of the Deputy Superintendent of Convicts and the Free Overseers continued in other uses in the 1830s, but only Cottage 3 survived beyond the end of the penal settlement. Cottage 1 had been occupied by the Deputy Superintendent of Convicts up to 1830. By 1831 it was occupied by the Superintendent of Convicts, his original residence now being used for other purposes. The last known use during the 1830s was as the Survey Office, before demolition, since it lay within the newly laid out grid of streets. Cottages 2 and 3 were Overseer's Cottages, probably built in 1823 to house the newly appointed overseers. Cottage 2 was occupied in 1831 by William Branch, who had been an overseer from 1823 to 1832. During the later 1830s the house was used as the Police Clerk's Quarters, before being demolished, as it too was within the newly laid out street. Cottage 3 was the Post Office by 1831, later also the Police Clerks Quarters and then the residence of the Clerk of the Court, possibly until the 1850s or 1860s. Development commenced in 1821 to 1822. Cottage 2 was demolished in the 1830s. Cottage 3 survived until the 1850s or 1860s. The School of Arts was built in the 1880s. The Town Hall was built in the 1890s. The site was redeveloped in the 1970s as the Civic Centre. Redevelopment as the Glasshouse commenced in 2006 and was completed in 2008. The artifact assemblage from the site reveals the economic stagnation of the town, brought on not only by the economic depression of the 1840s, but also the departure of the penal establishment and military in 1847. The site was redeveloped in the 1880s as the School of Arts and in the 1890s it was joined by the Town Hall. The assemblages recovered from these buildings reveals a total reversal of fortune for the town, as both these institutions indicate a new level of affluence and wealth, not before seen on the property.  Description  It is an archaeological site, comprising the remains of Overseers' Cottages 2 and 3, together with sections of brick barrel drain. The site was subject to archaeological excavation in 2006 and remains of the Overseer's Cottages 2 and 3, together with part of the brick barrel drain will be on display in the completed Glasshouse development. The brick walls, cobble floors and foundation trenches of the Cottages survive intact. Sections of the brick barrel drain have been conserved in situ. The brick walls, cobble floors and foundation trenches of the Cottages survive intact. Sections of the brick barrel drain have been conserved in situ.  Heritage listing  Port Macquarie was established as a penal settlement for secondary punishment in 1821, but wound down to make way for free settlers in 1830. As a penal settlement it may be compared with the first settlements at Sydney, Parramatta and Norfolk Island, all of which were commenced in 1788. Port Macquarie shares many institutions and public buildings in common with these first settlements. In terms of secondary punishment it may be compared with Newcastle (1804 - 1824) in New South Wales, and Moreton Bay in Queensland. A progression can be seen from Newcastle to Port Macquarie and finally Moreton Bay, in order to maintain the isolation of the penal settlements from the expanding free population. The early 19th century development of the town shared many features in common with other similarly dated towns in New South Wales. A more unusual factor is the continuation of some of the institutions of the penal settlement to the mid 1840s The cottages on the subject site are closely related to the function of the penal settlement from 1821 to 1830. With the changeover from penal settlement to town, they were either associated with the continuation of penal institutions in Port Macquarie until the 1840s or the development of the town until the 1860s. The site continued its association with the cultural life and administration of the town with the construction of the School of Arts in 1884 and the Town Hall in 1891. These buildings were demolished in 1973 and 1972 respectively and a new civic centre erected. The site has been associated with the administrators of the penal settlement (1821-1830) and then of the convict establishment for specials (1831-1846) and finally of the town (1831 onwards). The site has a particular association with Captain Francis Allman, Commandant from March 1821-April 1824 (ADB listing), Lieutenant William E. B. Wilson, Engineer and Inspector of Public Works from 1821 - 1824, Stephen Partridge, Superintendent of Convicts from 1821 - November 1830 and William Branch, Overseer from February 1823 - 1832. The site demonstrates aspects of the original plan of the penal settlement, in terms of the original street alignments, which were changed in 1830-1831 for the development of the town. Although the assistant superintendent's quarters and free overseers cottages formed only a small part of this layout, the layout of the penal settlement gave emphasis to the role of the military establishment, the governor, the church and various other institutions by their prominent location and landmark position in this layout. The archaeological remains of Cottages 2-3 retain evidence of traditional and vernacular building techniques, including brick and slab construction, with timbers re-used and surviving in two wells. In addition the brick barrel drain exemplifies the use of traditional brick technology in the construction of drains. The association of the site with the penal settlement has particular significance for groups associated with preserving the history of Port Macquarie, for example the Hastings and District Historical Society. This group would be keen to see the site conserved. On a broader scale, persons and groups, like the National Trust, interested in preserving the heritage of convict institutions and other sites would have concerns for the conservation of this site. The association of the site with the first Town Hall and School of Arts would also be considered an important association for Port Macquarie Hastings Council and the local community as a whole. The archaeological remains of the assistant superintendent's quarters and free overseer's cottages contribute to our understanding of the administration of the penal establishment (1821-1830) and of the later town (1831 onwards). The living space indicated on historical maps has been almost doubled by the complex sequence of buildings revealed by the archaeological evidence. The artifacts have revealed the living standards of the government occupants in the 1820s, followed by a downturn in standards in the 1840s -1870s, reflecting the economic stagnation of the early town. Finally the artifacts reveal the upturn in affluence of the town from the 1880s onwards, associated with the School of Arts, the centre of town social life in the 1880s and then the Town Hall from the 1890s. Port Macquarie is rare for its continuing association with the housing and labour of convict specials until 1847, for which the former overseers cottages still performed an administrative and accommodation role. Timbers from the earliest construction of slab buildings in Port Macquarie, dating from 1821 to 1823, recovered from the timber lined wells, are a very rare and early survival of organic materials and traditional building materials in New South Wales. The historical and archaeological evidence reveals the principal characteristics of building technology used in the Penal Settlement at Port Macquarie. The predominant characteristics used at Port Macquarie may be compared and contrasted with the practices used at other establishments. The evidence also reveals the spacious nature of accommodation for the Free Overseers and other government officials, which again may be compared with other similar institutions, The artifact evidence reveals a modest but comfortable standard of living, which may be compared with evidence from other similar sites. The Overseers' Cottages Remains was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 2010 having satisfied the following criteria.

After 1830, Cottage 4 (only partly on the subject site and not excavated) was used as a hotel, \\"The Settlers Arms\\", run by Charles Farrell, the second hotel license for Port Macquarie in 1830). Cottage 5 lies to the west of the site. The cottages on the subject site are closely related to the function of the penal settlement from 1821 to 1830.

The historical and archaeological evidence has combined to reveal the principal characteristics of building technology used in the Penal Settlement at Port Macquarie, both brick and slab construction. While construction techniques may vary in other penal settlements and places of secondary punishment, nonetheless the evidence has revealed the predominant characteristics used at Port Macquarie, which may be compared and contrasted with the practices used at other establishments. The evidence has also combined to reveal the spacious nature of accommodation for the Free Overseers and other government officials, which again may be compared with other similar institutions, Finally the artifact evidence reveals a modest but comfortable standard of living, which may be compared with other similar sites, as and when the evidence becomes available.

He was a Sanskrit, Vedic and Persian scholar of the early 19th century Maharashtra. He was a native of the Satara district of Maharashtra. Consultant to James Grand Duff Aba was one of the three scholars who were consultants to the British Historian James Grant Duff, specifically in Persian sources of the history of Maharashtra - the other two scholars being Balajipant Natu and Balvantrao Chitnis. Duff would persistently demand more material and would consult and ask them for interpretations of terms and policies and explanations for events in the materials that he had in his possession. His questions were directed to the origin and justification of specific policies and concepts - taxes such as chauth and sardeshmukhi. Duff would be frustrated by what he deemed as \\"inconsistent answers\\" from these knowledgeable people. The scholars such as Parasnis, on their part, resented the \\"insistent cross examination\\" by Duff. Debate on Vedic scriptures and Hindu Shastras Parasnis is most notable for a unique \\"Brahmin varna vs Kshatriya varna\\" debate that took place at Satara. It involved discussions and disputes related to the intricacies of the Hindu Shastras, Vedas and Puranas. The Kshatriya varna was represented by Parasnis and the Brahman varna was represented by Raghvacharya Gajendragadkar. This historic debate took place in the early 19th century Maharashtra. It was attended by hundreds of prominent Brahmins all over Maharashtra. Historians have credited Parasnis for debating effectively and \\"holding his own\\". Literature Two Sanskrit books \\"Karmakalapdruma\\" and \\"Siddhantavijaya\\" were authored by Parasnis and published by Pratapsimha. The \\"Siddhantavijaya\\" is considered important because it gives details of the Maratha clan system. It is written in Sanskrit with some content in marathi. The other Sanskrit scripture authored by him is \\"Karmakalpadruma\\". It is a manual for Hindu rituals and hence called the samskara manual. A translation of Siddhanatavijaya and some commentary was written by Mahadev Ganesh Dongre in the early 20th century. Sanskrit School Pratapsimha realized the importance of the knowledge of Sanskrit and decided to open a \\"pathshala\\" to teach Sanskrit to boys from the Maratha caste. Parasnis was the first head of this school.

Pandemic plagues threatening all human life, such as The Andromeda Strain, are among the many fictional diseases described in literature and film. Real diseases Victor Hugo's character Fantine (in his 1862 novel Les Miserables) with consumption in an 1886 painting by Margaret Bernadine Hall Genuine plagues have formed the central elements of books from Giovanni Boccaccio's c. 1353 The Decameron onwards. Boccaccio tells the tales of ten people of Florence who escape from the Black Death in their city. The book inspired Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century Canterbury Tales, which similarly tells the stories of people on pilgrimage in a time of plague. Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film The Seventh Seal () is set in Denmark during the Black Death, and features a game of chess with Death personified as a monk-like figure. Tuberculosis was a common disease in the 19th century, and it appeared in several major works of Russian literature. Fyodor Dostoevsky used the theme of the consumptive nihilist repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in Crime and Punishment; Kirillov in The Possessed, and both Ippolit and Marie in The Idiot. Turgenev did the same with Bazarov in Father and Sons. In English literature of the Victorian era, major tuberculosis novels include Charles Dickens's 1848 Dombey and Son, Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 North and South, and Mrs. Humphry Ward's 1900 Eleanor. Albert Camus's 1947 The Plague, probably based on cholera in 19th-century France, was seen both as fable about the need for people to help each other in the meaningless world seen by existentialism, and as alluding to the German invasion of France, fresh in Camus's mind. Huntington's disease appears in many novels, such as Ian McEwan's 2005 Saturday. It was criticised as prejudiced in the medical journal The Lancet for its negative portrayal of the protagonist with the disease. Fictional diseases Jack London's 1912 The Scarlet Plague was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries Diseases, especially if infectious, have long been popular themes and plot devices in fiction. Daniel Defoe's pioneering 1722 A Journal of the Plague Year is a fictional diary of a man's life during the plague year of 1665 in England. Mary Shelley's 1826 The Last Man created the genre of \\"post-apocalyptic pandemic thriller\\" with her story of a plague that is spreading across Europe towards her protagonists in Britain. Edgar Allan Poe's 1842 \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" is a gothic tale of a plague, perhaps symbolising the hubris of the wealthy, and their nemesis. More recently, Michael Crichton's 1969 The Andromeda Strain is a science fiction thriller about a world-threatening microbe that a military satellite brings down to Earth and wipes out a town in Arizona. White-coated scientists do their best to contain the outbreak.

A subsidiary of Unilever, Schmidt's Naturals manufactures and sells plant and mineral-based personal care products including natural deodorant, soap, and toothpaste.\\"Schmidt's Naturals Launches A Fall-Inspired Deodorant\\", www.beautypackaging.com,.Lauren Yoshiko, \\"Schmidt‚Äôs Naturals Bar Soap Are Gems in the Bathroom\\", www.wweek.com, November 28, 2017. History In 2010 Jaime Schmidt, of Portland, Oregon, began making personal care products in her kitchen. Schmidt sold her products at farmers‚Äô markets and co-ops around Portland, eventually narrowing her line just to deodorants. By 2014, Schmidt had refined her deodorants down to five scents, all sold in small glass jars with an applicator. Later that year, Schmidt accepted investor Michael Cammarata's offer to invest in her company. In January 2015, Schmidt's Deodorant Company, LLC, which was later sold to Unilever as Schmidt's Naturals, was officially incorporated in South Dakota. Over the next two years, the new company grew rapidly: moving from a facility and then into one almost three times that size. During this time the company introduced new formulations, produced a stick variation, and rebranded. In 2016, Schmidt's launched an exclusive partnership with Target.com and was named Manufacturer of the Year in the small company category by the Portland Business Journal.\\"2016 Manufacturer of the Year Schmidt's Deodorant Company LLC\\", bizjournals.com,. By late 2016, Schmidt's had almost 50 employees and offered 10 stick deodorants and 6 jar formulations. As the naturals segment continued to grow, SDC attracted the attention of large retailers. In June 2017, Schmidt and Cammarata were named Pacific NorthWest Entrepreneurs of the Year by EY (formerly Ernst & Young). In September, they introduced a line of plant and mineral-based soaps, rebranding the company as Schmidt's Naturals (formerly Schmidt's Deodorant); in November, they released toothpastes. By late 2017, the company had scaled to 120 employees with a 30,000 square-foot facility in Portland, Oregon and customer support center in Florida.  Unilever Acquisition  In December 2017, after months of negotiation by Schmidt and Cammarata, Unilever, a global consumer products company with over 400 brands, acquired Schmidt‚Äôs Naturals for an undisclosed sum.https://www.unilever.com/Images/ir-q4-2017-full- announcement_tcm244-515314_en.pdf After the acquisition, Cammarata became CEO of Schmidt‚Äôs through July 2019 and Jaime Schmidt continued on as founder and spokesperson in support of the company's global launches and further brand development.\\"This Natural Toothpaste Comes In Charcoal And Coconut Flavors.

Following the Unilever acquisition, the company broadened its product line with the introduction of body wash, mouthwash, and home care products. Between January and August of 2018 Schmidt‚Äôs Naturals grew by 300% in sales. In August of 2018, Schmidt's Naturals partnered with Jane Goodall to develop the special edition deodorant scent ‚ÄúLily of the Valley‚Äù with 5% of the proceeds going to the Jane Goodall Institute. In May 2019, Schmidt‚Äôs announced a collaboration with pop star Justin Bieber to create a new deodorant called ‚ÄúHere + Now,‚Äù which was designed for sensitive skin. The company also started using an AI platform, Alexander, to handle its customer services and to collect data. In July 2019, Schmidt‚Äôs began selling deodorant products with hemp seed oil, including Rose + Black Pepper and Sage + Vetiver. In July 2019, Michael Cammarata left the company and Unilever executive Ryu Yokoi transitioned to CEO.

The New York Times. 26 July 2018. She developed a fascination with aviation from a young age, as her family home was located near Royal Air Force bases at Bicester Airfield and Port Meadow. At the age of 11 her father paid for her to have a joy ride in a biplane at a flying circus, and she decided she wanted to learn to fly. When she was 16 she started having lessons at a flying club in Witney, successfully gained a private pilot's licence and flew for pleasure until the start of the Second World War in 1939, when all civilian flying was banned.  Second World War  In October 1941, she joined the Air Transport Auxiliary, and was posted to a pool of women flyers based in Hamble in Hampshire. Over the course of the war she flew over 1,000 planes of 76 different types, including Harvards, Hurricanes, Spitfires and Wellington bombers. Some of her flights were to relocate planes from Royal Air Force airfields to the frontline, and others were to ferry new planes from factories to airfields.  Post Second World War  After the war the Air Transport Auxiliary was disbanded. However, Ellis was seconded to the Royal Air Force and continued to ferry aircraft. She was one of the first women to fly the Gloster Meteor, Britain's first jet fighter. She later moved to the Isle of Wight. In 1950, she became the manager of Sandown Airport, and Europe's first female air commandant. Ellis managed Sandown for twenty years, during which time she also founded the Isle of Wight Aero Club.

The type and only known species, Sparodon durbanensis, was first described and named by Fran√ßois Louis Nompar de Caumont de Laporte, comte de Castelnau, in 1861. The fish is edible and is an important food source in southern Africa.  Description  S. durbanensis can grow up to a length of 120 centimeters, and a weight of around 22 kilograms. Its head and body are colored silver or gray. It has darker colored fins and a white belly. It has large teeth and has strongly-developed jaws, allowing it to eat its prey easier.  Behavior  S. durbanensis mostly stays in shallow reefs as a juvenile, in depths no greater than 12 m. Some adult specimens are thought to migrate northeasterly seasonally. The average length of time between two generations, called the generation time, is 13 years for the species. Young typically spawn from August to January. They can live to be around 31 years old. The species reaches 50% maturity when its around 5 1/2 years old. S, durbanensis eats a variety of invertebrates commonly known as shellfish, including sea urchins, crustaceans, gastropods, and bristle worms. In addition to this, it has also been known to eat Eukaryotes in the Chlorophyta division, a group of green algae.  Distribution and conservation  S. durbanensis is found in the South-east Atlantic Ocean. It mostly inhabits Southern Africa, and has not been recorded further north than the KwaZulu-Natal province. It lives in shallow coastal tropical waters, in depths of up to 80 meters. The population of S. durbanensis is currently declining. It is listed as \\"Near Threatened\\" by IUCN. There are currently several conservation actions taking place, most notability one which limits people to two fish per day.

Early Jewish pioneers were largely of German backgrounds and were deeply involved in politics and local affairs, and some were among the most prominent citizens of the time. Beginning in the 1880s, the influx of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe to the U.S. expanded the Denver Jewish community and exposed cultural rifts between Jews from German versus Yiddish speaking backgrounds. As Denver became a center for those seeking tuberculosis treatment, Jews were among those who came seeking healing, and the Jewish community set up two important organizations that aided not only sick Jews, but the sick poor of all backgrounds. In the early 20th century, the Orthodox community in the city's West Side attracted religious new immigrants and built up a number of communal institutions. The community, especially the poor in the West Side, had to deal with anti- Semitism, sometimes violent, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 1970s, the community began to spread out of the West Side to the East Side, and then the suburbs. The community remains vibrant today, and as it has rapidly grown in the past decades so have the number of educational, recreational, and religious organizations and institutions that serve it.  Early history  Tuberculosis patients on the porch at the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society (JCRS) sanatorium in Denver. Frances Wisebart Jacobs By the year after the discovery of gold, 1859, there were about a dozen Jews in Denver, mostly from German or Central European backgrounds. Among them were four men ‚Äì Hyman and Fred Salomon, Leopold Mayer, and Abraham Jacobs ‚Äì who would go on to serve on the Denver City Council. They are also thought to have held the first religious service of any kind in Denver, in September 1859. In 1860, the first Jewish organization, the Hebrew Burial and Prayer Society, was formed. A B'nai B'rith lodge was started in 1872, and Colorado's first synagogue, Temple Emanuel, was established in 1874. In 1889, Wolfe Londoner became the city's first (and thus far, only) Jewish mayor, although his tenure was short as he had to step down over corruption charges. The wave of Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the U.S. that began in the 1880s, largely from Imperial Russia, changed the makeup of the Denver Jewish community. The first Jews to come to Denver and establish the community were largely Reform, of German backgrounds, and with some financial means. The new Jewish immigrants, however, were more traditional and Orthodox, spoke Yiddish, and were poor. At this time, Colorado was also starting to gain notoriety as \\"The World‚Äôs Sanitarium\\", a significant destination for those wanting to cure their tuberculosis, also known then as consumption. A number of Jews, especially recent immigrants, were in this category along with an estimated one third of the state and arrived in hopes that the drier, sunnier climate would help their illness. To meet the needs of this growing segment of Jews and the city's other sick poor, the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives (NJH) (est. 1899), today known as National Jewish Health, and the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society (JCRS) (est. 1905) were formed. A certain rivalry and tension existed between the two organizations, in many ways mirroring the broader conflict and between German and Eastern European Jews in Denver. While both were free, NHS, which was founded by the German Jewish community, had strict admissions criteria. These included that the illness was in an earlier stage, that the patient could prove they had funds to remain in the city or purchase a return home after discharge, and the maximum stay at the facilities was limited to six months. These requirements, combined with a feeling that they were being condescended to or were unwelcome, made National Jewish appear infeasible to some Eastern European Jews, creating a sizable need that the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society was created to fill. Key in the formation of the city's charitable organizations, Jewish and otherwise, was Frances Wisebart Jacobs. She was instrumental in the founding of both the National Jewish Hospital and the community chest, which would later become United Way, and her tireless work on behalf of the needy earned her a tribute in the stained glass of the Colorado capitol rotunda, one of 16 pioneers and the only woman depicted. Following a failed attempt to build a Jewish agriculture-based colony in Cotopaxi by a group of Orthodox families who had immigrated from the Russian Empire and HIAS, Denver's West Colfax neighborhood and West Side became home to a considerable Jewish population. In 1897, the former colonists helped to found the neighborhood's first synagogue, Congregation Zera Abraham, which remains an active Orthodox synagogue today.  20th century  At the turn of the 20th century, the Orthodox community in the West Side was continuously expanding by establishing synagogues, mikva‚Äôot, educational institutions, and Yiddish theater. A number of prominent Yiddish writers and Jewish intellectuals came to Denver to treat their tuberculosis, such as the poet Yehoash. Between 1900 and 1907, many Jewish immigrants moved directly to Denver due to its burgeoning religious community, and Jewish settlement in the city reached its peak just prior to World War I. Bolstered by the number of tuberculosis patients, the Jewish population of the city reached 15,000 in 1912. In 1913, the Intermountain Jewish News was founded, which today is the largest Jewish paper in Colorado. After running away from home as a teenager, future Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir lived in the West Side of Denver from 1913 to 1914 with her sister, who had moved to the city due to her tuberculosis. It was in Denver that Golda met her future husband, Morris Meyerson (Myerson), and in her autobiography, My Life, she wrote \\"to the extent that my own future convictions were shaped and given form, and ideas were discarded or accepted by me while I was growing up, those talk-filled nights in Denver played a considerable role.\\" The home she lived in with her sister is now preserved as the Golda Meir House Museum. Ku Klux Klan members burning a cross in Denver in 1921. The Denver community also faced anti-Semitism on multiple occasions in first half of the 20th century. On Christmas Day in 1905, a Jewish immigrant named Jacob Weisskind was out working as a scrapper when he was brutally beaten by a Christian mob \\"avenging the blood of Christ\\", and later died of his injuries, in what some have called a lynching. Another Jew working with him was also beaten severely, but survived. Less than two years later, in the midst of the city's newspapers reporting on \\"anti-Semitic gangs\\" roaming the West Side, two Jewish immigrants named Tevye (Teve/Tevyah) Bokser and Michael Weissblei (Weisblye/Weisbly) were brutally murdered by two Christian gang members. The perpetrators of these murders received light sentences, and the underlying racial pretext of the killings was discussed in many papers in Denver, and in the Weisskind case, across the country. In the 1920s, the Jewish community also had to contend with the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the state, concentrated largely in Denver, and its incredible success in taking over Colorado's political offices at nearly every level: from Denver mayor Ben Stapleton to Governor Clarence Morley, and at one point, a majority in both houses of the Colorado General Assembly. While there was not a lot of tangible violence as a result of the Ku Klux Klan's control, there was prevailing anti- Semitic, anti-Catholic, and anti-black rhetoric, and organized boycotts of their businesses. West Colfax remained majority Jewish from the 1920s until the 1950s. In the 1940s, after an effective antibiotic to cure tuberculosis was discovered and the number of deaths dropped dramatically, the sanitariums in the city and state slowly shrunk their operations or gradually switched to another medical focus. By the 1950s, the Jewish community of the West Side was beginning to spread out to other areas, most notably the East Side, and later, suburbs. While the Hebrew Educational Alliance school was established in 1920, the 1950s and 1960s saw the opening of the Hillel Academy, Beth Jacob High School for Girls (a Bais Yaakov), and Yeshiva Toras Chaim. In 1975, the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Denver was founded by Dr. Stanley M. Wagner. The Jewish population of Denver was estimated to be between 23,500 and 30,000 in 1968, and roughly 40,000 in the 1970s as more and more of the community moved into the suburbs. From 1978 to 1983, the Denver Jewish community was home to a pioneering program that streamlined conversion for Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox candidates in order to ensure that all conversions would be recognized as valid community-wide. When the program was ended in 1983, largely due to the Reform movement's decision to recognize people of patrilineal Jewish descent as Jews for religious purposes, it caused great controversy in Denver and beyond. In 1984, outspoken and controversial Jewish radio host Alan Berg was killed by white supremacists in Denver.  Modern community  The old Temple Emanuel on Pearl Street, now on the National Register of Historic Places In 2007, the Jewish population of the Denver-Boulder metro area was about 83,900. A 2013 study estimated the state's Jewish population to be 92,000, with over three quarters of the community living in Denver. There is still an active Haredi community in the West Side who follow Litvak/Lithuanian Jewish tradition, as well as a vibrant Modern Orthodox community, and many Reform and Conservative congregations. The area has 25 active synagogues, including BMH-BJ, the largest Modern Orthodox congregation in Denver which was also the last remaining Orthodox Union (OU) affiliated synagogue to have services with no mechitzah, meaning men and women could sit together, until it resigned from the OU at the end of 2015. There are also multiple Jewish days schools across the ideological spectrum. In addition to its Center for Judaic Studies, the University of Denver is also home to the Rocky Mountain Jewish Historical Society, the Beck Archives, and the Holocaust Awareness Institute. Several Jewish sites in Denver have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Isaac Solomon Synagogue, the Samsonite House, the Hill Section of Golden Hill Cemetery, and Temple Emanuel's Old Pearl Street Temple. There are Jewish Community Center branches in Denver and Boulder, and other cultural institutions like the Mizel Museum and the Mizel Arts and Culture Center. Numerous nationwide Jewish organizations have offices in Denver, including the Anti-Defamation League, Hadassah, and the National Council of Jewish Women.

The fa√ßade is completed by the eaves, with a denticular cornice at its basis. Giuseppe Polizzi, referring to the old construction, writes: Casa Di Stefano opposite to Badia Nuova. On the ground floor a door with a circular arch and gothic shape around it, extending as far as the foot. On the first floor two windows with slight lintels, shaped imposts and small corbels at the corners; a third one without shapes. These windows are leaning on a gothic small cornice which runs all over the fa√ßade and that protrudes over small corbels, having the shape of an octagonal overturned pyramid under the settings of the three windows above. The top floor is enlightened by a gallery with small windows and circular arches made with bricks.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan in 2005. History William and Jane Somerville emigrated from Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1849, following Jane's brother John, and settled in Delhi Township. In 1854, they established a farm across what is now College Road from this barn, eventually building a house located about a quarter-mile north of the location of this barn. In 1863, the Somervilles purchased the land that this barn stands on, ocriss College Road from their farmstead. A few years later, Somerville built a barn across from his house on the newly acquired property. In 1875, William Somerville conveyed his son James fifty acres of his property, including the present site of Somerville barn. James married Agnes Fellows in 1878, and the couple settled on their homestead. They built a (now much altered) house on the property. In 1881, James Somerville constructed a barn on his property. In 1887, he purchased additional acreage from his father, including the barn, and moved the barn to his farmstead, attaching it to the 1881 barn. Around 1900, he expanded the barn by adding an ell to one end. James and Agnes Sommerville's son John married Ida Warren Palen in 1907; the couple had a son, Palen James Somerville, in 1912. However, John Somerville died in 1919; Ida remarried and lived with James Somerville until his death in 1930. Palen Somerville inherited the farm, but had moved to the family cottage, and rented the farmstead out. In 1932, he married Millie Scott, and in 1938 they returned to the Somreville farm. They added a concrete silo to the barn, and made other repairs and improvements to the farm and barn in the next decade. By 1959, Palen and Mille retired from farming and began renting out the farm acreage. Their daughter, JoAnn, and her husband, Robert Earl Caltrider operated a sheep breeding and shearing operation in the barn until 1972. Since that time, the barn has been used primarily for storage. Description The Somerville Bam is an L-shaped wood-frame raised barn building. It is constructed from two English barns attached end-to-end, forming a structure ninety feet long. The two barns are made of hewn timber frames, with some logs still having bark on. The basement level is mostly concrete block, which is fully above ground level on three sides. The barn is part of a farmstead also contains a house. The westerly section of the barn measures about forty-six feet in length by about thirty-four feet in width. The easterly section is about forty-four feet in length and thirty-two and one-half in width. The front facades are set to align. The barn also has a rear ell, measuring about forty-four feet in width and about twenty-seven feet in depth, and a small projecting silo room and round concrete stave silo.

Zadeh states that it is a reform in conventional problem solving methods by the consideration of a recursive problem solving approach. Note that this concept should not be mistaken with other similar concepts such as social stratification. CST is not based on social stratification nor related to it. More particularly it is quite different from the previous versions and applications of stratiÔ¨Åcation, such as stratiÔ¨Åed logic, stratified approach, stratified programming, stratified analysis, among other versions of stratification prior to 2016. This version of stratiÔ¨Åcation can handle a range of problems as explained a year after the original proposal by Asadabadi and his colleagues.Asadabadi, M. R., Saberi, M., & Chang, E. (2018). The Concept of Stratification and Future Applications. Applied Soft Computing. The key innovation in CST is that it considers the target states first, and then the target set is gradually enlarged to include the system which is aimed to receive the target.Asadabadi, M.

Manafort served as campaign chair for the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign from June 20 to August 19, 2016. Paul Manafort's mugshot after being booked into the Alexandria Detention Center in 2018 In July 2017, the FBI conducted a raid of Manafort's home, authorized by search warrant under charges of interference in the 2016 election. Manafort and his business assistant Rick Gates were both indicted and arrested in October 2017 for charges of conspiracy against the United States, making false statements, money laundering, and failing to register as foreign agents for Ukraine. Gates entered a plea bargain in February 2018. Manafort's first trial on 18 criminal counts began on July 31, 2018. In that trial, Gates testified that he committed tax evasion and embezzlement crimes with Manafort. Under cross examination, Gates also admitted to an extramarital relationship funded with money embezzled from Manafort. Manafort was found guilty on eight counts (covering filing false tax returns, bank fraud, and failing to disclose a foreign bank account), but a mistrial was declared on the remaining ten counts due to a single juror harboring reasonable doubts. Weeks later, before a second trial on seven separate criminal counts could begin, Manafort reached a plea bargain on two of those counts (conspiracy to defraud the United States and witness tampering). As part of the agreement, he also admitted guilt to an additional seven counts left unresolved from the earlier mistrial (bank fraud and bank fraud conspiracy), forfeited several properties and accounts, and agreed to full cooperation with the prosecution. Background =FBI and special counsel investigation= Paul Manafort is a lawyer, lobbyist, and political consultant. He often lobbied on behalf of controversial foreign leaders including former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian politician with strong ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Manafort became an adviser to Yanukovych in 2004; after Yanokovych's overthrow he helped to organize an opposition party to the new government. He was also involved in investment projects with Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs.How Trump's campaign chief got a strongman elected president of Ukraine, The Guardian (August 16, 2016). The FBI reportedly began a criminal investigation into Manafort in 2014, shortly after Yanukovich was deposed. That investigation predated the 2016 election by several years and is ongoing. In addition, Manafort is also a person of interest in the FBI counterintelligence probe looking into the Russian government's interference in the 2016 presidential election. On January 19, 2017, the eve of Trump's presidential inauguration, it was reported that Manafort was under active investigation by multiple federal agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Director of National Intelligence and the financial crimes unit of the Treasury Department. Investigations were said to be based on intercepted Russian communications as well as financial transactions. It was later confirmed that Manafort was wiretapped by the FBI \\"before and after the [2016] election ... including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump\\". The surveillance of Manafort began in 2014, before Donald Trump announced his candidacy for President of United States. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed on May 17, 2017, by the Justice Department to oversee the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and related matters, took over the existing criminal probe involving Manafort. =Chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign= In February 2016, Manafort approached Donald Trump through a mutual friend, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. He pointed out his experience advising presidential campaigns in the United States and around the world, described himself as an outsider not connected to the Washington establishment, and offered to work without salary. In March 2016 he joined Trump's presidential campaign to take the lead in getting commitments from convention delegates. On June 20, 2016, Trump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and promoted Manafort to the position. Manafort took over control of the daily operations of the campaign as well as an expanded $20 million budget, hiring decisions, advertising, and media strategy. In August 2016, Manafort's connections to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions drew national attention in the US, where it was reported that Manafort may have illegally received $12.7 million in off-the-books funds from the Party of Regions. On August 17, 2016, Trump received his first security briefing. The same day, August 17, Trump shook up his campaign organization in a way that appeared to minimize Manafort's role. It was reported that members of Trump's family, particularly Jared Kushner, who had originally been a strong backer of Manafort, had become uneasy about his Russian connections and suspected that he had not been forthright about them.McCaskill, Nolan et al. \\"Paul Manafort resigns from Trump campaign\\", Politico (August 19, 2016): \\"The [Trump] family was particularly troubled by reports of Manafort's involvement with Russia and felt he hadn't been entirely forthright about his activities overseas, the source said. Family members were also unhappy about changes made to the GOP platform that were seen as beneficial to Russia, which they felt Manafort played a role in, the source added.\\" Manafort stated in an internal staff memorandum that he would \\"remain the campaign chairman and chief strategist, providing the big-picture, long-range campaign vision\\". However, two days later, Trump announced his acceptance of Manafort's resignation from the campaign after Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway took on senior leadership roles within that campaign. Upon Manafort's resignation as campaign chairman, Newt Gingrich stated that \\"nobody should underestimate how much Paul Manafort did to really help get this campaign to where it is right now\\". Gingrich later added that, for the Trump administration, \\"It makes perfect sense for them to distance themselves from somebody who apparently didn't tell them what he was doing.\\"Nussbaum, Matthew. \\"White House: Manafort who?\\", Politico (March 22, 2017).  Raid and pre-trial motions through June 2018  Manafort and Gates indictment from United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia superseding indictment, dated February 22, 2018 Manafort superseding indictment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, dated February 23, 2018 On July 26, 2017, the day after Manafort's United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing and the morning of his planned hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, FBI agents at Mueller's direction conducted a raid on Manafort's home in Alexandria, Virginia, using a search warrant to seize documents and other materials in regard to the Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Before the search, Manafort had voluntarily provided some documents to congressional investigators, including the notes he took during the meeting with Veselnitskaya. United States v. Paul Manafort was analyzed by attorney George T. Conway III (husband of Kellyanne Conway), who wrote that it strengthened the constitutionality of the Mueller investigation. On October 27, 2017, Manafort and Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury as part of Mueller's investigation. The twelve-count indictment charged them with conspiracy against the United States, making false statements, money laundering, and failing to register as foreign agents for Ukraine as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Manafort was charged with four counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts while Gates was charged with three. The charges arise from Manafort's consulting work for a pro-Russian government in Ukraine and are unrelated to the Trump campaign. On October 30, 2017, Manafort and Gates surrendered to the FBI, and a judge placed them both under house arrest and required them to provide unsecured bonds. On December 4, 2017, prosecutors asked the judge to revoke Manafort's bond agreement, charging that Manafort violated the terms of his bail by working on an op-ed piece with Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate with ties to Russian intelligence. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued an order on December 22, 2017, demanding that Gates explain why his comments in a brief, videotaped address to the fundraiser held in an Arlington Holiday Inn on December 19 did not amount to a violation of the gag order she issued in the case. Of particular concern to Jackson is Gates' involvement with the Washington-area lobbyist who organized the event, Jack Burkman. = 2018 = On January 16, 2018, Jackson denied the government's proposal for a May 14 trial, indicating that the criminal trial appears likely to start in September or October. Gates was released from home confinement, but not Manafort. A letter from Manafort's physician had asked that he be permitted to attend a gym for health reasons, but Jackson said, \\"While he's subject to home confinement, he's not confined to his couch, and I believe he has plenty of opportunity to exercise.\\" On February 1, 2018, three of Gates' attorneys filed a motion to withdraw their representation of Gates. Walter Mack, one of the attorneys, said in court the previous month that Mueller's prosecutors had warned him of more impending charges against Gates. Gates has reportedly added Tom Green, a prominent white-collar attorney, to his defense team, signaling a possible change to his legal approach; and attorneys from Green's firm were seen entering the building where Mueller works. On the hearing of the motion on February 8 before Judge Jackson, the attorneys cited 'irreconcilable differences' with their client. Gates' new attorney has not filed a formal appearance in the case, which is the typical procedure when changing counsel. The outcome of the hearing is still subject to a gag order. On February 15, 2018, CNN reported that Gates was finalizing a plea deal with Mueller's office, indicating he was poised to cooperate in the investigation. He had already undergone his \\"Queen for a Day\\" interview, in which Gates answered any and all questions from Mueller's team, including about his own case and other potential criminal activity he witnessed or participated in. On February 22, 2018, Manafort and Gates were further charged with additional crimes, involving a tax avoidance scheme and bank fraud, in Virginia. The charges were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, rather than in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, as the tax fraud overt actions had occurred in Virginia and not in the District, forcing Mueller to bring the charges in Virginia, because one of the defendants did not agree to waive the issue of venue jurisdiction. The new indictment alleges that Manafort, with assistance from Gates, laundered over $30 million through offshore bank accounts between approximately 2006 and 2015. Manafort allegedly used funds in these offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the United States, in addition to personal goods and services. On February 23, 2018, Gates pleaded guilty in federal court to lying to investigators and engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Gates said he had previously intended to challenge the charges against him, but recently decided to plead guilty. He admitted that he had lied to investigators in February 2018 while he was under indictment and negotiating with prosecutors. Gates faces a possible prison sentence of nearly six years, but he agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation for a possible sentence reduction, possibly only probation, depending on the level of cooperation he provides to the government. Through a spokesman, Manafort expressed disappointment in Gates' decision to plead guilty and said he has no similar plans. \\"I continue to maintain my innocence,\\" he said. On February 27, the special counsel moved to dismiss without prejudice 22 tax and bank fraud charges against Gates as part of their plea agreement. On February 28, 2018, Manafort entered a not guilty plea in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Jackson subsequently set a trial date of September 17, 2018, and reprimanded Manafort and his attorney for violating her gag order by issuing a statement the previous week after former co-defendant Gates pleaded guilty. On March 8, 2018, Manafort also pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Judge T. S. Ellis III of the Eastern District of Virginia set his trial on those charges to begin on July 10, 2018. On March 28, 2018, Manafort declined a plea deal. In response to Manafort's court motions that charges against him be dismissed because Mueller exceeded his investigative authority, Mueller's office on April 2, 2018, released in a court filing a partially-redacted memorandum of August 2, 2017, in which Rod Rosenstein specifically authorized Mueller to investigate whether Manafort \\"committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for president of the United States, in violation of United States law,\\" as well as whether he \\"committed a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.\\" Manafort's suit claiming that the Mueller investigation exceeded its investigative authority was dismissed on April 27, 2018. On June 26, 2018, after harshly criticizing the scope of the Mueller investigation the preceding month, Ellis issued an opinion stating that the Mueller investigation had acted within its authority, clearing the way for Manafort's trial to proceed. In a court hearing on April 19, 2018, the Justice Department for the first time specifically noted the Mueller investigation's interest in whether Manafort provided a backchannel between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, adding that following the money trail of Manafort's consulting business was a natural necessity of investigating such a backchannel. On June 4, 2018, Mueller accused Manafort of witness tampering by contacting witnesses by phone and encrypted messaging \\"in an effort to secure materially false testimony,\\" asking a federal judge to revise or revoke the release agreement that had kept Manafort out of jail pending trial. On June 8, 2018, the Mueller grand jury added additional charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice against Manafort and his longtime associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, whom Manafort had contacted to assist in influencing witnesses.https://www.justice.gov/file/1070306/download On June 15, 2018, Manafort's bail was revoked, and he was jailed pending trial. On July 17, 2018, Ellis denied Manafort's motion to move the trial to Roanoke, Virginia. Trial in Virginia Manafort's trial in the Eastern District of Virginia began on July 31, 2018, with District Judge T. S. Ellis III presiding. Manafort was charged with various financial crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and money laundering. There were 18 criminal charges including 5 falsifications of income tax returns, 4 failures to file foreign bank account reports, 4 counts of bank fraud, and 5 counts of bank fraud conspiracy. =Opening arguments= On July 31, a jury was seated, both sides made their opening statements, and the first prosecution witness was called. Uzo Asonye, an assistant United States attorney and a member of Mueller's team, presented opening remarks on behalf of the United States. Thomas Zehnle, one of Manafort's lawyers, presented opening remarks on behalf of Manafort. =Prosecution= On the first and second day, prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's expensive tastes and lavish lifestyle while he was working for Russian oligarchs. Numerous witnesses said they had been paid via wire transfer from banks in Cyprus. On the third day, two of Manafort's former accountants testified. The first one testified that Manafort signed tax forms four times between 2011 and 2014, stating that he had no foreign bank accounts. The second one, testifying under a grant of immunity, revealed that she had filed a false tax return on behalf of Manafort in 2014. She said she changed the amount of a loan so that Manafort would owe less tax, admitting that she had done it knowingly and that she regrets it. Rick Gates Rick Gates felony information Rick Gates' plea agreement with Robert S. Mueller Manafort's business assistant Rick Gates, who had earlier pleaded guilty to two felony counts in a plea bargain, was on the stand for three days. He testified that he committed crimes with Manafort. He said he and Manafort carried out an elaborate offshore tax-evasion and bank fraud scheme using shell companies and bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the United Kingdom to funnel millions of dollars to themselves from their political consulting work in Ukraine. Gates admitted to concealing the accounts and the income from U.S. tax authorities by disguising the income as loans via falsified bank loan documents. During testimony, Gates also admitted that he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort. Under cross examination, Gates admitted to an extramarital relationship approximately a decade ago that involved first-class flights and trysts in luxury hotels, and admitted that this affair was funded with money embezzled from Manafort. After Gates' testimony ended, an IRS agent testifying as an expert witness said that Manafort had failed to report at least $16 million in income from Ukraine between 2010 and 2014. When he testified that he had been present during part of the trial, Ellis berated the prosecution in front of the jury for allowing him to watch the trial. The prosecution filed a motion for a corrective ruling, citing the trial transcript where Ellis had earlier granted permission for the expert witness to attend. The next day the judge apologized and told jurors to disregard his remarks.  Corruption  After another day of explanatory testimony regarding bank records and such, the prosecution turned from the topics of foreign money laundering and bank fraud to that of Manafort's allegedly corrupt practices during and after his time as Trump's campaign chairman. This involved the testimony of several employees of the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago about Manafort's efforts to obtain large loans from the bank in 2016. Dennis Raico, a senior vice president at the bank, testified that Manafort's first contact with the bank occurred in April 2016 and that Manafort was discussing loans and politics with the bank's founder, CEO, and chairman Stephen Calk in May. Calk was named an economic advisor to Donald Trump's presidential campaign in August, at Manafort's suggestion. James Brennan, another vice president at the bank, testified that an employee at the bank noted that Manafort had no income as of July 2016, while claiming to be owed $2.4 million, and was more than 90 days late on a $300,000 credit card bill, which Manafort blamed on Gates. Brennan also testified that bank employees discovered Manafort had loans outstanding on two other unidentified properties.Witness: Bank Prez Opposed Manafort Loan Approved By Bank CEO Trump Adviser, Talking Points Memo, Tierney Sneed and Caitlin MacNeal, August 13, 2018. Retrieved August 15, 2018. Manafort also failed to disclose that he was in default on two other real estate loans. Brennan testified that the bank's president opposed issuing a $9.5 million loan to Manafort but was ordered to do so by Calk. That loan was the largest ever issued by the bank, and a subsequent loan to Manafort of $6.5 million was the second largest. (They were preceded by negotiations for a third loan, which in the end was not granted.) Calk told Manafort he wanted a position in the administration of then president-elect Trump, as well as inauguration tickets. In emails introduced into evidence at the beginning of the trial, Calk sent several messages to Manafort listing administration positions he aspired to, including four cabinet posts, numerous ambassadorships, and Secretary of the Army. Manafort then sent an email to Jared Kushner recommending Calk as Secretary of the Army, to which Kushner replied, \\"On it!\\". =Defense= The strategy of the defense was to shift blame from Manafort to Gates, by arguing that Gates was primarily responsible, and testified primarily to secure leniency for himself. On August 14, before the jury was seated, Ellis reminded Manafort of his rights and asked if he intended to testify. Manafort said he did not. The defense then rested its case without calling any witnesses. =Closing arguments= Closing arguments began and ended on August 15. Prosecutors argued that the case was about lies by Manafort to hide his income from federal authorities and defraud banks. They recognized that Gates was a problematic witness - \\"I'm not asking you to like him\\" - and urged jurors to consider the other 10 witnesses and the evidence - \\"The star witness in this case is the documents.\\" The defense argued that \\"the government has not met its burden of proof\\" and repeatedly accused Gates of lying. While the jury was deliberating, the judge revealed that he had been threatened and was being guarded by deputy U.S. marshals. Judge Ellis also said that if the jurors were identified, they would be threatened as well and that for their \\"peace and safety\\", he would not release their names. =Verdict= On August 21, their fourth day of deliberation, the jury found Manafort guilty on 8 of the 18 felony counts, including five counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failing to disclose a foreign bank account. Judge Ellis declared a mistrial on the remaining 10 charges. The jury consisted of six men and six women. According to one juror, it was a single juror who prevented conviction on the remaining 10 counts. The holdout, a female, reportedly said that she harbored reasonable doubt. Ellis rejected subsequent requests by Manafort to wear street clothing instead of a prison uniform in courtroom appearances. Trump responded to the decision by tweeting that he felt \\"very badly\\" for Manafort and his family: \\" 'Justice' took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to 'break' ‚Äî make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' Such respect for a brave man!\\" =Sentencing= On October 18, Ellis dismissed the remaining charges in the case without prejudice, seemingly clearing the way for final sentencing. Manafort was then scheduled to be sentenced in early February 2019 for his eight jury convictions in the Virginia case. However, on January 28, Ellis postponed the sentencing date until allegations Manafort had breached his plea agreement with prosecutors in the D.C. court were resolved. On March 7, 2019, Ellis sentenced Manafort to 47 months in prison, less 9 months for time already served, saying that Manafort had lived an \\"otherwise blameless life\\". The sentence was \\"far lighter than the 19- to 24-year prison term recommended under sentencing guidelines.\\" The 47 month sentence was for the most serious crime, bank fraud; the other crimes were given lesser sentences which will run concurrently. Trial in District of Columbia Statement of charges Paul Manafort pleaded guilty and agreed were true, dated September 14, 2018 Manafort's trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia began on September 14, 2018, with Judge Amy Berman Jackson presiding. In DC, Manafort was scheduled to be tried on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, failing to register as a foreign agent, money laundering, witness tampering and making false statements. The jury selection process began on September 4, 2018; voir dire was due to start on the 17th. During this time, the parties negotiated a plea deal, and on September 14, during what was technically his second trial, Manafort pleaded guilty to two charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States and witness tampering. He also admitted to most other charges against him, both in DC and those for which there was a hung jury at his first trial in Virginia; those charges will be dropped if prosecutors are satisfied that he has fully cooperated with them. As part of the plea bargain, Manafort agreed to the forfeiture of three bank accounts, a life insurance policy, and five New York properties estimated to be worth $22 million. Two of the properties were purchased with offshore funds as a form of money laundering, according to prosecutors. Manafort further agreed to \\"testify fully, completely and truthfully before any and all Grand Juries in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, and at any and all trials of cases or other court proceedings in the District of Columbia and elsewhere\\". =Post-trial activity= Mueller's office stated in a court filing on November 26, 2018, that Manafort had repeatedly lied about a variety of matters, breaching the terms of his plea agreement. Manafort's attorneys disputed the assertion. On December 7, 2018, the special counsel's office filed a document with the court listing five areas in which they say Manafort lied to them, which they said negated the plea agreement. It was also revealed that Manafort, through his attorney, had been briefing White House attorneys about his interactions with the special counsel's office. In January 2019, Manafort's lawyers submitted a filing to the court in response to the accusation that he had lied to investigators. Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with Konstantin Kilimnik, who is believed to be linked to Russian intelligence. The filing says Manafort gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him. In a hearing on February 7, 2019, prosecutors speculated that Manafort had concealed facts about his activities to enhance the possibility of his receiving a pardon. They said that Manafort's work with Ukraine had continued and he met with Gates, and also with Kilimnik, in an exclusive New York cigar bar. Gates said the three left the premises separately, each using different exits.Manafort continued Ukraine work in 2018, prosecutors say, Washington Post, Spencer S. Hsu, Rosalind S. Helderman, and Matt Zapotosky, February 7, 2019. Retrieved February 8, 2019. The judge ruled on February 13 that Manafort had lied about three separate matters after entering a plea bargain with prosecutors, relieving the government of any obligation they had to request leniency when Manafort is sentenced.Manafort Lied After Plea Deal, Judge Says, New York Times, Sharon LaFraniere, February 13, 2019. Retrieved February 22, 2019. =Sentencing= On March 13, 2019, Jackson sentenced Manafort to 73 months in prison, with 30 months concurrent with the jail time he had received in the Virginia case, resulting in an additional 43 months in jail (30 additional months for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and 13 additional months for witness tampering).Kevin Breuninger, \\"Paul Manafort gets additional 43 months in second Mueller sentence\\", CNBC, March 13, 2019. Retrieved March 24, 2019.\\"Paul Manafort, Trump's ex-campaign chair, sentenced to 43 more months in prison and faces new charges\\", CBC, March 13, 2019. Retrieved March 24, 2019. Manafort also apologized for his actions. Immediately following sentencing, Manafort's attorney Kevin M. Downing gave a statement to media outside the courthouse in which he falsely asserted that Judge Jackson had \\"conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case\\" and \\"Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with the Russians\\". Downing was heckled and drowned out by members of the public, shouting \\"Liar\\" and \\"That's not what [the judge] said.\\" The judge had actually said that the court had heard no evidence on the subject of whether Trump's campaign had conspired with Russia, and that the \\"no collusion mantra\\" was not accurate. After the earlier sentencing for the Virginia case, Downing had made a more carefully worded courthouse-steps comment, \\"There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia.\\" In both instances Trump seized upon Downing's comments to falsely claim that the judges had proclaimed there was no collusion with Russia.  Potential presidential pardon  When White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked at a press conference on August 22, 2018, whether Trump might pardon Manafort, she told reporters, \\"I am not aware of any conversations regarding that at all.\\" During an interview with Fox & Friends the same day, Trump did not deny the possibility, saying only that he had \\"great respect\\" for the legal challenges that Manafort was facing. On August 23, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Washington Post that Trump had asked in June about the possibility of pardoning Manafort and that the President's lawyers had advised him against the use of a pardon before Mueller's investigation had ended. Later the same day Giuliani told Fox News that the discussion in June had been about pardons in general and that Manafort's name had not been mentioned. In November 2018, after Mueller's office said Manafort had violated the terms of his plea deal, Trump publicly hinted that he might pardon Manafort. Congressman Jerrold Nadler, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, opined that \\"dangling a pardon in front of Manafort\\" could lead to charges of obstruction of justice.

She was born in Saint-Gingolph, Switzerland, and became a naturalised French citizen in 1995. Biography Sabine Weiss' father was a chemical engineer and made artificial pearls from fish scales. The family lived next to the border post and left Saint-Gingolph while she was still a child. Attracted at a young age by photography, she says: > I realized very young that photography would be my means of expression. I > was more visual than intellectual ... I was not very good at studying. I > left high school, I left on a summer day on a bicycle.Jean Vautrin, Soixante > ans de photographies, monographie, √âditions de La Martini√®re, 2007 Sabine Weiss began to photograph in 1932 with a bakelite camera bought with her pocket money and made contact prints on printing-out paper on her windowsill. Her father supported her in her choice, and she later learned photographic technique, from 1942 to 1946, from Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas, a studio photographer in Geneva. After this apprenticeship, she received the Swiss qualification in photography in 1945. Paris Weiss moved to Paris in 1946 and became Willy Maywald's assistant: > When I came to Paris, I was able to work at Maywald, whom a friend had > recommended to me. I worked there in conditions unimaginable today, but with > him I understood the importance of natural light. Natural light as a source > of emotion.Jean Vautrin, Sabine Weiss, √âditions de La Martini√®re, Paris, > 2003. Willy Maywald was working at that time on the first floor of a shed on 22 Jacob Street which belonged to an antique dealer, and that had neither water nor telephone. This work nevertheless allowed her to rub shoulders with the 'who‚Äôs who' of Paris of the time. She published her first photo report at the age of 21 in 1945. She thus attended the opening of the house of Dior and the presentation of the first collection at 37 Avenue Montaigne. In 1949, she traveled to Italy and met the American painter , whom she married on September 23, 1950. The couple adopted a daughter, Marion. She opened her own studio. Her photographs testify to the optimism of the post-Liberation years: \\"It was a beautiful period. We were between the end of the German occupation and the beginning of Americanization. People came out of a terrible ordeal and thought they could rebuild everything\\", she says.Vincent Jolly, ¬´ Sabine Weiss, le monde d'hier ¬ª [archive], Le Figaro Magazine, week of June 10, 2016, pages 68‚Äì73 She worked in various sectors: passionate about music, she portrayed the big names in music (Stravinsky, Britten, Casals, Getz) but also those of literature and art (L√©ger, Fitzgerald, Pougny, Giacometti, Rauschenberg, , Dubuffet, Sagan), cinema (Moreau), fashion (Chanel). She also worked for several magazines and newspapers known in America and Europe for advertising and press orders (Vogue, Paris Match, Life, Time, Town and Country, Holiday, Newsweek, Picture Post and Die Woche etc.). Her attention shifted toward documentary photography and she traveled not only in the United States but also in Egypt, India, Morocco and Myanmar to which she most recently returned in 1996. The Rapho agency From 1950, Weiss was represented by Agence Rapho, the leading French press agency managing the work of Robert Doisneau. He offered her a place in the agency after a meeting in the office of the director of Vogue. She befriended artists such as Cocteau, Utrillo, Rouault, and Lartigue. Amongst colleagues Doisneau, Boubat, Brihat, Dieuzaide,Robin Lenman, \\"Rapho\\"; in The Oxford Companion to the Photograph, ed. Robin Lenman (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; ). Brandt, Ken Heyman, Izis, Kert√©sz, Karsh, Lartigue, Ronis, Savitry and Elkoury, the only other woman at Rapho was Janine Ni√©pce. Nevertheless, the fact that Weiss was one of so few women then forging an independent career in photography was not a problem. For photojournalist , who worked with her on a story on the people of Omo (Ethiopia): > Although she is in a very masculine environment, she has really managed to > be accepted immediately, to establish herself as what she is since: a very > great photographer whom I esteem and admire‚Äú Weiss‚Äôs street photography, of children playing in the wasteland of her neighbourhood, Porte de Saint-Cloud and of Paris and its daily life, was produced independently of her magazine work, for love, and embraces the philosophy of humanist photography. At 28 she was recognised by Steichen‚Äôs inclusion of her in his \\"Post-War European Photography\\" at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1954, the Art Institute of Chicago devoted a solo exhibition to her which toured the USA. Then Steichen included three of her photographs in the MoMA exhibition The Family of Man, which travelled the world and was seen by nine million visitors. The pictures typify those she took for herself: Int√©rieur d‚Äô√©glise au Portugal (\\"Interior of a church in Portugal\\") of 1954 shows a child in white kneeling on the light-dappled tiled floor, face upturned in question toward her barefoot mother, who, like the surrounding phalanx of figures, is dressed in black; the exuberant Un bal champ√™tre avec une accord√©oniste sur la table (\\"Village dance with an accordion player on the table\\"), also 1954; and Un enfant tenant un √©pi qui fait des √©tincelles in which a child gleefully thrusts a sparkler almost into her lens. She says: > I photograph to preserve the ephemeral, fix chance, to keep in an image what > will disappear: gestures, attitudes, objects which are testimonies of our > passing. In 1957, Weiss made a series of photographs of the painter Kees van Dongen, whom she met through her husband, and on impulse they bought a small shed there overlooking the ruins of the castle at Grimaud. They enlarged the house in 1969 and stayed regularly until the death of her husband in 2007.Rapha√´l Dupouy, 'La dame au regard d'enfant' in Figure Libre, no 29, April 2010. In 1983, Weiss obtained a scholarship from the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs and carried out a study on the Copts of Egypt. In her late fifties, she participated in a longitudinal photographic study, a kind of ‚ÄòMass Observation‚Äô, of a small new town near Nice called Carros-Ie-Neuf over several years with Jean Dieuzaide and Guy le Querrec, working with sociologist Pierre Bourdieu and joined briefly by Leonard Freed.

Sakina Banu Begum was married to Shah Ghazi Khan, the cousin of Naqib Khan Qazvini, a personal friend of Akbar. His uncle Qazi Isa had long served as the Qadi of Iran, came to India and was taken into government service. In 1573, after his death, Naqib Khan reported to Akbar that he had left his daughter to him. Akbar went to Naqib's house and married her. Thus, two of his cousins were married into the imperial family. In 1578, Sakina Banu Begum was sent to Kabul, before Akbar's second march on the city. Her brother at that point seemed to have conducted negotiations with the Abdulkhairi Uzbek of the Marwa- un-nahr and with the Safavids, who treated him as a sovereign ruler as well as another Timurid potentate, Prince Sulaiman Mirza.

His often large, finely detailed paintings portray nature and urban landscapes, combining aspects of hyper-realism and photo-realism.  Life and career  Sam Foley was born in Wellington, New Zealand and in 1998 received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Otago School of Art in Dunedin. In 2007 he won a Merit Award (1st equal) at the Parklane Art Awards in Auckland, with his painting Pathway at Night. He was awarded twice (2008 - 2009) the Peoples Choice Award at the Norfolk House Realist Invitational in Dunedin, and twice (2009 - 2010) the Peoples Choice Award at The Wallace Art Awards in Auckland. In 2013 he won The Kaipara Wallace Arts Trust Award, with his painting Tilting at the Beast. The award founder and arts patron Sir James Wallace acquired one of Foley's kinetic paintings entitled Opoho Intersection No.1. Since 2008 he has been visiting Europe regularly, spending extensive periods of time in Berlin and attending residencies in Norway and Switzerland. His works can be found in several private and public art collections such as the Dunedin International Airport collection, the Historic Places Trust of New South Wales in Australia, The ASB Bank in Auckland, The Wallace Trust in Auckland, The Central Library and Salmon Hall in the University of Otago.  Moving Image Paintings  In 2008 Foley embarked on a 10 week research tour in Europe where he visited more than 30 major museums and galleries. Most of the contemporary galleries had a dedicated moving image section which brought up the idea how to incorporate moving image onto his work. At the end of his research tour Foley returned to New Zealand and started experimenting in his studio with video projections onto his paintings. He recorded video footage of the landscapes he was painting and projected those onto the finished painting. The result was a 'moving image painting' which transports the viewer into the painting for a more immersive experience.

It is located in the northern part of Pirin on its main ridge between the summits of Kralev Dvor (2,680 m) and Dzhengal (2,730 m). Momin Dvor is pyramid-shaped and was formed by glacial erosion from the three neighbouring cirques: Valyavishki, Popovski and Belemeto. It is built up of porphyry granite. Three short ridges connect Momin Dvor with the neighbouring peaks. The western ridge links it with Valyavishki Chukar (2,664 m) and at the same time separates the cirques Valyavishki and Belemeto; the ridge is part of a hiking trail leading from Tevno Ezero shelter to Dzhengal Peak. Another ridge stems in south-eastern direction towards Kralev Dvor and forms part of the main trail between Tevno Ezero shelter and Bezbog refuge. To the north- east a more difficultly accessible ridge links Momin Dvor and Dzhengal, situated on the neighbouring Polezhan secondary ridge. Its name means Maiden's courtyard in Bulgarian and was given to the peak because of the snow on its northern slopes that holds until late summer and appears as clean maiden's laundry hung out in her courtyard. According to local legends god Perun had a younger sister who lived near Samodivski Lakes and used to hang out her laundry on the terraces of Momin Dvor.

The monster is created by an unorthodox biology experiment. Biology appears in fiction, especially but not only in science fiction, both in the shape of real aspects of the science, used as themes or plot devices, and in the form of fictional elements, whether fictional extensions or applications of biological theory, or through the invention of fictional organisms. Major aspects of biology found in fiction include evolution, disease, genetics, physiology, parasitism and symbiosis (mutualism), ethology, and ecology. Speculative evolution enables authors with sufficient skill to create what the critic Helen N. Parker calls biological parables, illuminating the human condition from an alien viewpoint. Fictional alien animals and plants, especially humanoids, have frequently been created simply to provide entertaining monsters. Zoologists such as Sam Levin have argued that, driven by natural selection on other planets, aliens might indeed tend to resemble humans to some extent. Major themes of science fiction include messages of optimism or pessimism; Helen N. Parker has noted that in biological fiction, pessimism is by far the dominant outlook. Early works such as H. G. Wells's novels explored the grim consequences of Darwinian evolution, ruthless competition, and the dark side of human nature; Aldous Huxley's Brave New World was similarly gloomy about the effects of genetic engineering. Fictional biology, too, has enabled major science fiction authors like Stanley Weinbaum, Isaac Asimov, John Brunner, and Ursula Le Guin to create what Parker called biological parables, with convincing portrayals of alien worlds able to support deep analogies with Earth and humanity. Aspects of biology Aspects of biology found in fiction include evolution, disease, ecology, ethology, genetics, physiology, parasitism, and mutualism (symbiosis). =Evolution= Evolution, including speculative evolution, has been an important theme in fiction since the late 19th century. It began, however, before Charles Darwin's time, and reflects progressionist and Lamarckist views (as in Camille Flammarion's 1887 Lumen) as well as Darwin's. Darwinian evolution is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by intelligent machines. =Disease= Jack London's 1912 The Scarlet Plague (reprinted in 1949) takes place after an uncontrollable epidemic. Diseases, both real and fictional, play a significant role in both literary and science fiction, some like Huntington's disease and tuberculosis appearing in many books and films. Pandemic plagues threatening all human life, such as The Andromeda Strain, are among the many fictional diseases described in literature and film. Science fiction takes an interest, too, in imagined advances in medicine. The Economist suggests that the abundance of apocalyptic fiction describing the \\"near annihilation or total extinction of the human race\\" by threats including deadly viruses rises when general \\"fear and unease\\", as measured by the Doomsday Clock, increase. Tuberculosis was a common disease in the 19th century. In Russian literature, it appeared in several major works. Fyodor Dostoevsky used the theme of the consumptive nihilist repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in Crime and Punishment; Kirillov in The Possessed, and both Ippolit and Marie in The Idiot. Turgenev did the same with Bazarov in Father and Sons. In English literature of the Victorian era, major tuberculosis novels include Charles Dickens's 1848 Dombey and Son, Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 North and South, and Mrs. Humphry Ward's 1900 Eleanor. =Genetics= Aspects of genetics including mutation or hybridisation, cloning (as in Brave New World), genetic engineering, and eugenics have appeared in fiction since the 19th century. Genetics is a young science, having started in 1900 with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's study on the inheritance of traits in pea plants. During the 20th century it developed to create new sciences and technologies including molecular biology, DNA sequencing, cloning, and genetic engineering. The ethical implications of modifying humans (and all their descendants) were brought into focus with the eugenics movement. Since then, many science fiction novels and films have used aspects of genetics as plot devices, often taking one of two routes: a genetic accident with disastrous consequences; or, the feasibility and desirability of a planned genetic alteration. The treatment of science in these stories has been uneven and often unrealistic. The 1997 film Gattaca did attempt to portray science accurately but was criticised by scientists. Michael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park portrayed the cloning of whole dinosaur genomes from fossil remains of species extinct for millions of years, and their use to recreate living animals, using what was then known of genetics and molecular biology to create an \\"entertaining\\" and \\"thought-provoking\\" story. Naomi Alderman's 2016 novel The Power imagines that women have electric organs like those of the electric eel, Electrophorus electricus, creating powerful electric fields with modified muscles. The pits along the electric eel's body are lateral line organs, used to detect prey by sensing small distortions in the electric field. The lack of scientific understanding of genetics in the 19th century did not prevent science fiction works such as Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein and H. G. Wells's 1896 The Island of Dr Moreau from exploring themes of biological experiment, mutation, and hybridisation, with their disastrous consequences, asking serious questions about the nature of humanity and responsibility for science. =Physiology= The creation scene in James Whale's 1931 film Frankenstein makes use of electricity to bring the monster to life. Shelley's idea of reanimation through electric shock was based on the physiology experiments of Luigi Galvani, who noted that a shock made the leg of a dead frog twitch. Electric shock is now routinely used in pacemakers, maintaining heart rhythm, and defibrillators, restoring heart rhythm. The ability to produce electricity is central to Naomi Alderman's 2016 science fiction novel The Power. In the book, women develop the ability to release electrical jolts from their fingers, powerful enough to stun or kill. Fish such as the electric eel, Electrophorus electricus, create powerful electric fields with modified muscles, stacked end-to-end as cells in a battery, and the novel indeed references such fish and the electricity generated in striated muscle. =Parasitism= A 1990s gargoyle at Paisley Abbey resembling a Xenomorph parasitoid from Alien Parasites appear frequently in fiction, from ancient times onwards as seen in mythical figures like the blood-drinking Lilith, with a flowering in the nineteenth century. These include intentionally disgusting alien monsters in science fiction films, though these are sometimes less \\"horrible\\" than real examples in nature. Authors and scriptwriters have to some extent exploited parasite biology: lifestyles including parasitoid, behaviour-altering parasite, brood parasite, parasitic castrator, and many forms of vampire are found in books and films. Some fictional parasites, like the deadly parasitoid Xenomorphs in Alien, have become well known in their own right. Terrifying monsters are clearly alluring: writer Matt Kaplan notes that they induce signs of stress including raised heart rate and sweating, but people continue indulging in such works. Kaplan compares this to the \\"masochism\\" of liking very hot spicy foods, which induce mouth burns, sweating, and tears. The psychologist Paul Rozin suggests that there is a pleasure in seeing one's own body react as if to stress while knowing that no real harm will result. =Symbiosis= Symbiosis (mutualism) appears in fiction, especially science fiction, as a plot device. It is distinguished from parasitism in fiction, a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the parasite inflicts harm on its host. Fictional symbionts often confer special powers on their hosts. After the Second World War, science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in Ted White's 1970 By Furies Possessed, which viewed aliens positively. In The Phantom Menace, Qui-Gon Jinn says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force. =Ethology= Delia Owens's 2018 novel Where the Crawdads Sing is set in a North Carolina swamp, where the \\"marsh girl\\" protagonist compares her wayward boyfriends to the \\"Sneaky Fuckers\\" she reads about in an ethology article. Ethology, the study of animal behaviour, appears in the wildlife scientist Delia Owens's 2018 novel Where the Crawdads Sing. The protagonist, Kya, is abandoned by her parents at age six, and grows up alone in a North Carolina swamp, learning camouflage and how to hunt from the animals there. The local townspeople call her \\"the marsh girl\\". She reads about ethology including an article entitled \\"Sneaky Fuckers\\", using her knowledge to navigate the tricks and dating rituals of the local boys; and she compares herself to a female firefly, who uses her coded flashing light signal to lure a male of another species to his death, or a female mantis, who starts eating her mate's head and thorax while his abdomen is still copulating with her. \\"Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.\\" =Ecology= Ecology, the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment, appears in fiction in novels such as Frank Herbert's 1965 Dune, Kim Stanley Robinson's 1992 Red Mars, and Margaret Atwood's 2013 MaddAddam. Dune brought ecology centre stage, with a whole planet struggling with its environment. Its lifeforms included giant sandworms for whom water is fatal and mouse-like animals able to survive in the planet's desert conditions. The book was influential on the environmental movement of the time. In the 1970s, the impact of human activity on the environment stimulated a new kind of writing, ecofiction. It has two branches: stories about human impact on nature; and stories about nature (rather than humans). It encompasses books written in styles from modernism to magical realism, and in genres from mainstream to romance and speculative fiction. A 1978 anthology of ecofiction includes 19th and 20th century works by authors as diverse as Ray Bradbury, John Steinbeck, Edgar Allan Poe, Daphne du Maurier, E. B. White, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Frank Herbert, H. H. Munro, J. G. Ballard, and Isaac Asimov. =Fictional organisms= A mock taxidermy specimen of a fictional rhinograde invented by the German zoologist Gerolf SteinerSt√ºmpke, Harald (pseudonym of Gerolf Steiner), Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia with preface and illustrations by Gerolf Steiner. Fischer, Stuttgart, (1961). . Fiction, especially science fiction, has created large numbers of fictional species, both alien and terrestrial. One branch of fiction, speculative evolution or speculative biology, consists specifically of the design of imaginary organisms in particular scenarios; this is sometimes informed by precise science. Functions Fictional biology serves a variety of function in film and literature, including the supply of suitably terrifying monsters, the communication of an author's worldview, and the creation of aliens for biological parables to illuminate what it is to be human. Real biology, such as of infectious diseases, equally provides a variety of contexts, from personal to highly dystopian, that can be exploited in fiction. =Monsters and aliens= A common use of fictional biology in science fiction is to provide plausible alien species, sometimes simply as terrifying subjects, but sometimes for more reflective purposes. Alien species include H. G. Wells's Martians in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds, the bug-eyed monsters of early 20th century science fiction, fearsome parasitoids, and a variety of giant insects, especially in early 20th century big bug movies. Humanoid (roughly human-shaped) aliens are common in science fiction. One reason is that authors use the only example of intelligent life that they know: humans. The zoologist Sam Levin points out that aliens might indeed tend to resemble humans, driven by natural selection. Luis Villazon points out that animals that move necessarily have a front and a back; as with bilaterian animals on Earth, sense organs tend to gather at the front as they encounter stimuli there, forming a head. Legs reduce friction, and with legs, bilateral symmetry makes coordination easier. Sentient organisms will, Villazon argues, likely use tools, in which case they need hands and at least two other limbs to stand on. In short, a generally humanoid shape is likely, though octopus- or starfish-like bodies are also possible. Many fictional plants were created in the 20th century, including John Wyndham's venomous, walking, carnivorous triffids. in his 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids, The idea of plants that could attack an incautious traveller began in the late 19th century; the potatoes in Samuel Butler's Erewhon had \\"low cunning\\". Early tales included Phil Robinson's 1881 The Man-Eating Tree with its gigantic flytraps, Frank Aubrey's 1897 The Devil Tree of El Dorado, and Fred White's 1899 Purple Terror. Algernon Blackwood's 1907 story \\"The Willows\\" powerfully tells of malevolent trees that manipulate people's minds.

Juran's 1957 The Deadly Mantis File:Day of the triffids poster.jpgMan-eating plant: 1962 poster by Steve Sekely for a film adaptation of John Wyndham's 1951 novel The Day of the Triffids =Optimism and pessimism= H. G. Wells's 1898 The War of the Worlds struck a pessimistic note about human evolution. A major theme of science fiction and of speculative biology is to convey a message of optimism or pessimism according to the author's worldview. Whereas optimistic visions of technological progress are common enough in hard science fiction, pessimistic views of the future of humanity are far more usual in fiction based on biology. A rare optimistic note is struck by the evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane in his tale, The Last Judgement, in the 1927 collection Possible Worlds. Both Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 Childhood's End and Brian Aldiss's 1959 Galaxies Like Grains of Sand, too, optimistically imagine that humans will evolve godlike mental capacities. The grim possibilities of Darwinian evolution with its ruthless \\"survival of the fittest\\" has been explored repeatedly from the beginnings of science fiction, as in H. G. Wells's novels The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr Moreau (1896), and The War of the Worlds (1898); these all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival. Aldous Huxley's 1931 novel Brave New World is similarly gloomy about the oppressive consequences of advances in genetic engineering applied to human reproduction. =Biological parables= The protagonist's journey across Mars in Stanley Weinbaum's 1934 A Martian Odyssey The literary critic Helen N. Parker suggested in 1977 that speculative biology could serve as biological parables which throw light on the human condition. Such a parable brings aliens and humans into contact, allowing the author to view humanity from an alien perspective. She noted that the difficulty of doing this at length meant that only a few major authors had attempted it, naming Stanley Weinbaum, Isaac Asimov, John Brunner, and Ursula Le Guin. In her view, all four had impressively full characterizations of alien beings. Weinbaum had created a \\"bizarre assortment\\" of intelligent beings, unlike Brunner's crablike but extinct Draconians. What united all four writers, she argued, was that the novels centred on the interactions between aliens and humans, creating deep analogies between the two kinds of life and from there commenting on humanity now and in the future. Weinbaum's 1934 A Martian Odyssey explored the question of how aliens and humans could communicate, given that their thought processes were utterly different. Asimov's 1972 The Gods Themselves both makes the aliens major characters, and explores parallel universes. Brunner's 1974 Total Eclipse creates a whole alien world, extrapolated from terrestrial threats. In her 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin presents her vision of a universe of planets all inhabited by \\"men\\", descendants from the planet Hain. In the book, the ambassador Genly Ai from the civilised Ekumen worlds visits the \\"backward- and inward-looking\\" people of Gethen, only to end up in danger, from which he escapes by crossing the polar ice cap on a desperate but well-planned expedition with an exiled Gethenian Lord Chancellor, Estraven. They are ambisexual with no fixed gender, and go through periods of oestrus, called \\"kemmer\\", at which point an individual comes temporarily to function as either a male or a female, depending on whether they first encounter a male- or female-functioning partner during their period of kemmer. The invented biology reflects and exemplifies, according to Parker, the opposing but united dualities of Taoism such as light and darkness, maleness and femaleness, yin and yang. So too do the opposed characters of Genly Ai with his carefully objective reports, and of Estraven with his or her highly personal diary, as the story unfolds, illuminating humanity through adventure and science fiction strangeness. =Structure and themes= \\"The leafy sea dragon\\" (actually weedy seadragon) from William Buelow Gould's Sketchbook of fishes, c. 1832, used by Richard Flanagan in his 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish Modern novels sometimes make use of biology to provide structure and themes. Thomas Mann's 1912 Death in Venice relates the feelings of the protagonist to the progress of an epidemic of cholera, which eventually kills him. Richard Flanagan's 2001 novel Gould's Book of Fish, which makes use of the illustrations from artist and convict William Buelow Gould's book of 26 paintings of fish for chapter headings and as the inspiration for the various characters in the novel.  Realism  The geneticist Dan Koboldt observes that the science in science fiction is often oversimplified, reinforcing popular myths to the point of \\"pure fiction\\". In his own field, he gives as examples the idea that first- degree relatives have the same hair, eyes and nose as each other, and that a person's future is predicted by their genetic code, as (he states) in Gattaca. Koboldt points out that eye colour changes as children grow up: adults with green or brown eyes often had blue eyes as babies; that brown-eyed parents can have children with blue eyes, \\"and vice versa\\"; and that the brown pigment melanin is controlled by around 10 different genes, so inheritance is along a spectrum rather than being a blue/brown switch. Other authors in his edited collection Putting the Science in Fiction point out a wide variety of errors in the portrayal of other biological sciences.

It has narrowly elliptic leaves with a distinct leafstalk, and few-flowered and very small heads of 1‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì0.6 in) across. It is called stalked pincushion in English. The sweetly scented flower heads may be found around early December. It is an endemic species that only grows in a small area of the Western Cape province of South-Africa.  Description  Leucospermum secundifolium is a low shrub that grows along the ground with the tips rising up, that has very slender and rather diffuse stems of 1¬Ω‚Äì2 cm in diameter. These are initially covered in felty or woolly hairs, which are soon lost. The initially thickly felty or woolly elliptic leaves soon loose these hairs, are 5‚Äì8 cm (2‚àí3¬º in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.3‚Äì0.6 in) wide, have a stalk of 1‚Äì2 cm (0.4‚Äì0.8 in) long at their base, a rounded tip with one, sometimes three bony teeth and horny margins that are sometimes rolled inwards. The alternately set leaves are upright at right angles to the branches. The very small globe-shaped flower heads of 1‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì0.6 in) across are mostly individually set in the axils of leaves near the tips of the branches on a thickly felty or woolly stalk of ¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.2‚Äì0.6 in) long, and contains twelve to thirty flowers. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flattened globe-shaped and at only about 2 mm across comparatively very small. The bracts that subtend the head are set in a single whorl, each lance-shaped with a pointy tip, about 6 mm (¬º in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì2 mm (0.06‚Äì0.08 in) wide. The bract that subtends each flower individually is lance-shaped to broadly oval, with a pointy tip, somewhat cartilaginous in consistency, covered with a thick layer of felty hairs, growing to approximately 1 cm long and becoming woody after the flower has been pollinated. The straight 4-merous perianth is about 16 mm (‚Öî in) long. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube is 4‚Äì5 mm (0.16‚Äì0.20 in) long, cylinder-shaped, hairless at its base and felty higher up. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise is slender, felty, about ¬æ mm (0.03 in) wide, with all four perianth claws curling back to the top of the tube when the flower opens. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, consists of four lance-shaped to ellyptic lobes of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long and 1 mm wide, with few soft of felty hairs. From the perianth emerges a thread-like style of about 1.4 cm (0.56 in) long, that very slightly tapers nearing the tip. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is bluntly hoof-shaped, about 1 mm long with a groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four opaque, awl-shaped scales of about ¬Ω mm long. = Differences with related species = L. secundifolium can be distinguished from other species by its upright, eventually hairless rounded and narrowly elliptic leaves with a distinct stalk and its very small (1‚Äì1¬Ω cm across) and few flowered heads. A unique feature among Leucospermum species is that the bracteoles that subtend the individual flowers become woody after flowering. This character is shared with the species of the genus Vexatorella, but in vexators, the individual flower head, or panicle of heads, is at the very tip of the stem.  Taxonomy  As far as we know, the stalked pincushion was first collected for science in 1928 by Mary Pocock, a specimen in fruit. Only after material in flower was collected in 1956, a full description became possible. John Patrick Rourke described it and named it Leucospermum secundifolium in 1970. L. secundifolium has been assigned to the section Diastelloidea. The species name secundifolium is compounded from the Latin words secundum (second or fortunate) and folium (leaf) and indicates that the leaves of this species are all upright.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The stalked pincushion can be found only be found on the south slopes of the Klein Swartberg mountains, between Seweweekspoort and Towerkop at an elevation of around 1200 m (4000 ft), where it grows on Table Mountain Sandstone. The average annual precipitation in this area is 250‚Äì380 mm (10‚Äì15 in), mainly falling during the winter half year. The species is pollinated by insects, such as butterflies, flies and bees. The ripe fruits fall to the ground about two months after flowering, where these are collected by native ants, that carry them to their nests. Here they remain underground, safe for fire, seed-eating rondents and birds, until an overhead fire clears the vegetation and triggers the seeds to germinate.  Conservation  The stalked pincushion is considered a rare species because although it is not threatened at present in its mountainous habitat, it is restricted to an area of just .

The term itself is still establishing currency.  Context  Digital civics has arisen from concerns regarding the challenges faced by individuals and society in the digital age. As science and technology have advanced, so too, has human understanding of their place in the world. This has altered the way people interact with one another and the broader context in which they exist. Digital civics respond to these challenges by formulating a robust foundation upon which initiatives into digital citizenship and digital citizen engagement can be developed.  Definitions  Researcher Estelle Clements defines digital civics as \\"the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens who inhabit the info-sphere and access the world digitally.\\" Clements, who was a doctoral researcher at the Dublin Institute of Technology, first put forward this definition in 2010 as part of an educational project done in conjunction with the Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive. The goal of their project was to teach about life in the online world. According to Clements this definition meets three objectives: # It promotes an understanding of the environment where civic actions take place. # It acknowledges the information philosophy that underpins this environment. # It endorses the policy discourse that addresses the basic rights and ethical responsibilities of citizens. Other conceptions of digital civics are still emerging. Newcastle University has suggested that Digital Civics is about \\"Digital technologies and citizen- driven design.\\"  Philosophy of information  Numerous scholars have suggested that the Philosophy of Information is the most logical course to underpin policy and project work for life in the digital age. The Information Philosopher Luciano Floridi has played a critical role in the success of such work, particularly in exploration of Information Society, European Policy, and theEuropean Commission's Onlife initiative.  Features  Clements identifies four underlying pillars that contribute to a robust digital civics as well as four key concepts in which digital civics is grounded. = Underlying pillars of Digital Civics = 1\\\\. Philosophy (specifically the Philosophy of Information), as described by Luciano Floridi) 2\\\\. History (drawing from Media Ecology and Classical scholarship), 3\\\\. Ethics (particularly Virtue Ethics) 4\\\\. Civics (including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as a conjoining of the public and private personas called Hybrid selves). = Key concepts for Digital Civics = 1\\\\. It acknowledges the transformations in human life and our world brought about by new scientific breakthroughs and technological developments, and the impact these changes have on how we behave. 2\\\\. It recognises the importance of responding to these changes in ethical and intellectually rigorous ways. 3\\\\. It appreciates that we have a long historical tradition from which to draw when addressing these challenges. 4\\\\. Digital Civics is an appreciation of the informational nature of reality.  Contention of digital civics and virtue ethics  In considering the ethical issues that arise from digital age civic issues, numerous scholars have suggested that such ethical initiatives should use virtue ethics as a basis for a shared global information ethics: namely, Charles Ess, Shannon Vallor, and Richard Volkman (2010). In her doctoral work on digital civics pedagogy, Clements suggests that her findings were compatible with a framework of virtue ethics. However, the information philosopher Luciano Floridi asserts that a global information ethics cannot be built upon virtue ethics, because virtue ethics is \\"intrinsically egopoeitic,\\" and thus does not take into account responsibilities owed to the surrounding community or environment. To date, this matter is still contested.  Educational programs  In 2010, the first pedagogical program for digital civics was started by the Oscar Wilde Facebook Laboratory. It was a collaboration between the Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive and the Dublin Institute of Technology's Estelle Clements. A global team of researchers and educators created a multi-platform (online and offline) learning environment to teach students and the public about digital civics. The project formed the basis of Clements' doctoral work, which formulated a Model for Digital Civics in pedagogy. At the time, Clements was particularly concerned that new digital citizenship initiatives were not considering the necessary underlying philosophical and ethical issues raised by the digital age and sought to provide a robust foundation to solve this problem. In 2014, Newcastle University, launched a program to teach digital civics to postgraduate students at their Open Lab. The program research concentrates on \\"exploring how digital technologies can empower citizens and communities\\" and \\"trains doctoral students in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services.\\" In 2018, The MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics (YPP) released a digital civics toolkit described as: \\"a collection of resources for educators to support youth to explore, recognize, and take seriously the civic potentials of digital life.\\" The toolkit draws heavily from digital media literacy, focusing on five modules: Exploring Community Issues, Investigation, Dialogue, Voice, and Action\\".

Raised in Glasgow from 1859, it later became a battalion of the Highland Light Infantry. During World War I it served at Gallipoli, in Egypt and Palestine, in Ireland, and on the Western Front. Converted into an anti-aircraft artillery regiment just before World War II, it served in The Blitz and in the Middle East during the war, and continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1955. Origin An invasion scare in 1859 led to the emergence of the Volunteer Movement, and Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need began to be organised throughout Great Britain.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The 2nd Administrative Battalion of Lanarkshire RVCs (shown in the Army List as the 4th Admin Bn until March 1861) was formed in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, on 4 July 1860 to administer 11 company-sized RVCs that had been raised in that city:Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, pp. 257, 259.Grierson, pp. 265‚Äì9.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 127‚Äì38. * 30th (1st Central) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited in the East Central district of Glasgow, services accepted 28 December 1859, disbanded 1865 * 31st (Central Blythswood) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from leather trade workers, services accepted 21 December 1859 * 38th (Rifle Rangers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from mechanics in the Central district of Glasgow, services accepted 29 December 1859 * 45th (Grocers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from grocers, services accepted 10 January 1860 * 46th (Grocers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from grocers, services accepted 10 January 1860 * 47th (Grocers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from grocers, services accepted 10 January 1860 * 75th (2nd Company, Leather and Boot Trade) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from leather workers, services accepted 29 February 1860 * 84th Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from members of the grain and provisions trades, services accepted 24 April 1860 * 86th (Tailors) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from tailors, services accepted 7 May 1860 * 88th (Fleshers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited from butchers, services accepted 9 May 1860, disbanded 1864 * 96th Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 29 November 1860, later increased to two companies * 97th (Glasgow Guards) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì four companies recruited from men of exceptional physique, services accepted 30 July 1861; transferred to 1st Lanarkshire Engineer Volunteer Corps 1863Westlake, Engineer Volunteers, p. 10. On 20 June 1865 the 2nd Admin Battalion was consolidated as the 31st Lanarkshire RVC (taking the number of its senior surviving company) with headquarters (HQ) in North Frederick Street, Glasgow. In June 1869 it received the additional title The Blythswood Rifles in honour of its Commanding Officer (CO), Archibald Campbell of Blythswood House, who later took the title of Lord Blythswood. Campbell had served with the Scots Fusilier Guards in the Crimean War and had retired with the rank of 'Captain and Lieutenant‚ÄìColonel'. He was commissioned as Lt-Col in command of the 31st RVC on 1 December 1864.Army List, various dates.Archibald Campbell at The University of Glasgow Story.Archibald Campbell at Grace's Guides. In 1873, the Blythswood Rifles absorbed the 5th Lanarkshire RVC, previously the 7th Admin Bn formed in September 1860 to administer the following Glasgow RVCs: * 5th (1st Eastern) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 24 September 1859 * 21st (Parkhead Artisans) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited in the Parkhead district, services accepted 5 December 1859 * 34th (1st Rifle Rangers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 27 December 1859 * 35th (2nd Rifle Rangers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 27 December 1859 * 58th (1st Eastern Artisans) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 10 February 1860 * 59th (2nd Eastern Artisans) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 21 February 1860 * 64th (1st Rutherglen) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited at Rutherglen, services accepted 18 February 1860 * 65th (2nd Rutherglen) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited at Rutherglen, services accepted 18 February 1860 * 66th (Eastern Rifle Rangers) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì services accepted 17 February 1860 * 90th (Whitevale) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì recruited in the Whitevale district, services accepted 24 May 1860 The initial 12 companies in the 7th Admin Bn (consolidated as the 5th Lanarkshire RVC in 1860) had been reduced to 10 in 1864 and dwindled thereafter until it was absorbed into the 31st. Volunteer Force Cap badge of the Higland Light Infantry. When the RVCs were consolidated in 1880, the battalion was renumbered as the 8th (Blythswood Rifles) Lanarkshire RVC. Under the 'Localisation of Forces' scheme introduced in 1872 by the Cardwell reforms, the 31st Lanarkshire RVC had been grouped with the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot, the 90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers) and the 2nd Royal Lanark Militia in Brigade No 60. However, this affiliation was broken up in the Childers Reforms, under which the battalion became a volunteer battalion of the Highland Light Infantry (The Glasgow Regiment) (HLI) on 1 July 1881. It was formally redesignated as the 3rd (Blythswood) Volunteer Battalion, Highland Light Infantry in December 1887. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1; Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. Under this scheme the Volunteer Battalions of the HLI were included in the Clyde Brigade, later the Glasgow Brigade based at Hamilton. Lord Blythswood was succeeded as Lt-Col Commandant in 1897 by Colonel W. Clark, VD, who had been the unit's second Lt-Col since 1877. Sixty- one volunteers from the battalion served alongside the Regulars in the Second Boer War, mostly in the 1st 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Service Companies of the HLI, earning the battalion its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. In 1902 the battalion built a new drill hall at 69 Main Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow, while musketry training was carried out at a range at Gilbertfield near Cambuslang. In the same year, the Volunteer Brigades were reorganised, and the HLI battalions split from the rest of the Glasgow units to form their own Highland Light Infantry Brigade, still based at Hamilton. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the battalion became the 7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry.London Gazette 20 March 1908. The HLI Brigade now formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF.Thompson, pp. 3‚Äì5.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì15.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.Conrad, British Army, 1914. World War I =Mobilisation= The Lowland Division had been attending annual camp on the Ayrshire coast when the order to mobilise was received at 17.25 on Tuesday 4 August 1914. On return from camp the troops undertook guards and patrols at vulnerable points around Glasgow and the River Clyde. 7th HLI was under Lt-Col J.H. Galbraith, TD, commanding officer (CO) since 20 December 1911 . The division completed its mobilisation by 10 August and proceeded to its war stations, with the HLI Bde at Dunfermline. The troops were billeted in all manner of buildings. Through the winter of 1914‚Äì15 they dug and wired defensive positions, provided guards and patrols and undertook rigorous training.HLI at Long, Long Trail. =Recruitment= On 10 August, units of the division were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and the majority did so. On 31 August, the War Office authorised the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit for each unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the 1st Line original, but distinguished by a '1/' or '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Where recruitment was good, they also formed 3rd Line unitsBecke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Thompson, pp. 5‚Äì6. =1/7th Highland Light Infantry= The Lowland Division was warned for overseas service on 5 April 1915, and the infantry battalions received Long Lee Enfield rifles modified to take modern ammunition chargers. On 7 May the division was informed that it would be employed in the Gallipoli Campaign, and equipment such as sun helmets and water carts was issued. On 11 May the division was numbered as 52nd (Lowland) Division and the brigades also received numbers, the HLI becoming 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade. 1/7th HLI and the bulk of 157th (HLI) Bde embarked aboard the troopship Transylvania at Devonport Dockyard and sailed on 26 May, via Gibraltar and Malta, disembarking at Alexandria in Egypt on 5 June and going into camp at Aboukir.Thompson, pp. 7‚Äì11.Westlake, Gallipoli, pp. 205‚Äì7. Gallipoli Although some elements of the division had gone direct to the Gallipoli Peninsula, and others sailed on quickly from Alexandria, 157th (HLI) Bde on the Transylvania was turned back to Alexandria and the troops went back into camp. The battalion was not re-embarked until 28 June (aboard the Mauitor), arriving at Mudros on 1 July, Imbros on 2 July, and finally landing at Cape Helles on 3 July.Thompson, p. 14. The HLI attack at Achi Baba Nullah, 12 July 1915. 1/7th HLI moved into the firing line and support trenches on 5 July for its first short tour of duty under the guidance of the Royal Naval Division. It was back in the line on 11 July and took part in the attack on Trenches E10 and F12 on 12 July (the Action at Achi Baba Nullah). Under the command of Lt-Col Galbraith, the battalion advanced at 16.50 on the right of the brigade in four waves. Despite heavy shrapnel, machine gun and rifle fire, it took the Turkish front and support trenches without much difficulty, and the two leading waves pushed on to the third line, Trench E12. They discovered too late that this was nothing more than a scrape in the ground and offered no cover. They tried to hold on to this until the trench behind (E11) had been. consolidated, but casualties were heavy and at 18.00 the CO allowed the leading waves to withdraw to E11. Consolidation was difficult because of the number of dead in the trenches. The following morning the battalion came under heavy enfilade fire and retreated, but Lt-Col Galbraith rallied the men, charged, and re-took their positions by 07.00. By the time it was relieved on 15 July, 1/7th HLI had lost six officers and 40 other ranks (ORs) killed, 2 officers and 149 ORs wounded, and 53 ORs missing.Aspinall-Oglander, pp. 105‚Äì6.Thompson, pp. 78‚Äì81, 102‚Äì28. For the next three months, 1/7th HLI alternated with 1/5th and 1/6th HLI in the front line at 'the Horsehoe' and 'Argyle Street', broken by spells in reserve in the 'Redoubt Line', 'Wigan Road' and 'No 1 Australian Lines'. On the night of 20 October the battalion made a small attack on Trench H11A, and established a 'bomb sap', then repulsed a Turkish counter-attack (total casualties 2 killed and 8 wounded). Moving up into the firing line on 21 November the battalion suffered shellfire and several Turkish attacks, which were easily repulsed. Manning recently captured tranches G11A and G12 on 21 November, 1/7th HLI endured heavy bombardment and bombing from aircraft. Being on the high ground on the west of the Nullah, the battalion was able to bring down enfilade fire on the Turks attacking the neighbouring 1/5th HLI, and the Turkish attack failed.Thompson, pp. 160‚Äì1, 184‚Äì5. Casualties from sickness during the hot summer had been heavy, and the attrition continued through the bitter winter weather. By now it had been decided to evacuate the force. The Suvla and Anzac positions were evacuated on the night of 19/20 December, and 1/7th HLI contributed three bombing teams (2 officers and 26 ORs) to 157th Bde's elaborate diversionary attack that night and kept two companies in brigade reserve. The attack went badly and the reserves were required to support the bombing parties. The following night 1/7th HLI had to garrison the line for the weakened brigade.Thompson, pp. 190‚Äì202. Next it was the turn of the Helles position to be evacuated. The forces ashore were reduced from 31 December. On 1 January 1916 the battalion relieved the Anson Battalion of the RN Division at 'Hyde Park Corner'. The lines were then thinned out until on the night of 7/8 January battalion HQ and just 150 men, mainly machine gunners and signallers, held 'Eglington Tunnel' during the final evacuation. The last party to leave set up 'trip bombs' and automatically fired rifles and flare pistols to maintain the illusion that the line was still strongly held. The battalion was clear of the beach by 02.45 on 9 January and sailed aboard HMS Prince George for Mudros. The battalion had landed with 30 officers and 941 ORs and received 19 officers and 104 ORs as reinforcements. During the campaign it lost 7 officers and 709 ORs killed, 5 officers and 279 ORs wounded, 26 officers and 450 ORs evacuated to hospital sick, and 30 missing.Thompson, pp. 219‚Äì41. Egypt After the evacuation of Helles the 52nd (L) Division moved back to Egypt. After concentration it went to El Qantara and on 2 March 1916 it took over part of No 3 Section of the Suez Canal defences. While stationed at El Qantara in 1916, the 1/7th HLI formed a trench mortar team that was sent to Mesopotamia where it was attached to 7th (Meerut) Division. This team took part in the division's advance on Baghdad (March 1917), serving in the Battle of Sannaiyat. It then went to Palestine, where it served with the Meerut Division in the fighting from March 1918 to the Armistice with Turkey. As the 52nd Division historian wrote, 'Throughout its travels this small unit retained its identity'.Thompson, Appendix II. No 3 or Northern Section of the Canal defences had its outer flank anchored on the Mediterranean. Running inland were a series of redoubts manned by the infantry with machine guns and backed by artillery. On the night of 3/4 August a German and Turkish force attacked the position (the Battle of Romani). The redoubts came under heavy shelling and direct attack, but the attack was driven off by the British artillery. Attempts to outflank the Romani position were held by the ANZAC Mounted Division, and the defenders then moved to the counter- attack. By the night of 5/6 August 157th Bde was well advanced, though the pursuit bogged down in the appalling desert conditions of Sinai.Bullock, pp. 30‚Äì1.MacMunn & Falls, p. 156. Palestine After months of preparation the Eastern Expeditionary Force (EEF) crossed the Sinai Desert at the end of 1916 and prepared to invade Palestine, beginning the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. 52nd (L) Division was held in reserve during the 1st Battle of Gaza (26‚Äì27 March 1917) and was not committed.Bullock, pp. 44‚Äì5.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 310‚Äì4. There followed several weeks of preparation for the 2nd Battle of Gaza, during which 1/7th HLI began a daily routine of sending a company to turn a Turkish post out of an orchard to the front, only to retire back to the British lines at dusk. These apparently meaningless operations were designed to accustom the Turks to British troops being moved into the area, in order to cover preparations for the main attack. The first phase was carried out on 17 April, with 52nd (L) Division tasked with taking Ali Mansur and the adjoining hills. 157th Brigade slipped quietly into its positions before 01.00, and at 04.45 (before dawn) it advanced up the El Burjaliye Ridge to attack the cliffs of Ali Mansur, with 1/7th HLI advancing in the centre led by Lt-Col Galbraith. As the light grew, the Turks opened fire, and the British artillery bombardment began. When the bombardment ended, HLI patrols scaled the cliffs and were soon at the top, firing down on retreating Turks. By 07.00 the brigade was in complete possession of the objective, with patrols pushing out across the plain behind. Consolidation was carried out under Turkish shellfire. The second phase of the attack on 19 April against Ali Muntar, for which 157th Bde was in reserve, was less successful. The Turkish positions known as 'the Labyrinth' had not been sufficiently suppressed by the bombardment and although 155th (South Scottish) Brigade took a lunette on Outpost Hill, it could not be held, and changed hands several times. It was finally abandoned at 18.20, just as 1/7th HLI arrived to reinforce the position. 1/7th HLI then helped 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade to establish a line across the ridge. They dug all night in the hard ground, but by daybreak on 20 April the trench was less than 1 metre deep and came under mortar fire. Several men of the 1/7th HLI were killed trying to get water through to the men pinned down in this trench; the battalion lost 34 men by sniping during the day. At midnight the advanced line was withdrawn to a stronger defence line in rear. During the four-day battle the 1/7th HLI lost 4 officers and 14 ORs killed, 1 officer and 7 ORs missing, and 3 officers and 115 ORs wounded. Most of the missing were in fact dead, and many of the wounded also died.Bullock, pp. 46‚Äì7.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 329‚Äì48.Thompson, pp. 312‚Äì34. Capture of Wadi el Hesi. By the autumn of 1917 the EEF had been revitalised by the arrival of Sir Edmund Allenby as commander-in-chief, and the next operation (the 3rd Battle of Gaza, 31 October‚Äì7 November) was much better planned and successful. 52nd (L) Division down on the coast carried out a holding action while the Desert Mounted Corps swept round the Turkish flank. The Turks withdrew to defend the Wadi el Hesi, with 52nd (L) Division well up in pursuit. 157th Brigade led this pursuit, having been in reserve, and made for the mouth of Wadi el Hesi, accompanied by artillery and cavalry. 5th HLI captured the first part of 'Sausage Ridge' during the night of 7/8 November and 7th HLI, (now commanded by Lt-Col Edward Gibbons, originally of the Middlesex Regiment) pressed forward to extend 5th HLI's line down to the sea, and by dawn had secured both sides of Wadi Hesi. Daylight showed a sand ridge still occupied by the enemy from which they could bring down fire on the division crossing the mouth of the wadi, but a company of the 7th HLI advanced under heavy shell, machine gun and rifle fire across the sand ridge 'as if it was carrying out a parade movement'. The rest of the division followed up and took the rest of Sausage Ridge. The Turks retreated leaving behind large quantities of stores. 7th HLI's casualties in this successful operation were 6 ORs killed and 6 missing, 1 officer and 55 ORs wounded.Bullock, pp. 71‚Äì8.Falls, pp. 131‚Äì6.Thompson, pp. 372‚Äì89. The brigade continued leading the pursuit up the coast, marching through soft sand towards Esdud. The attack on Esdud was directed by 7th HLI on the left under Lt-Col Gibbons, with 5th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on the right, and darkness fell before the assaulting troops reached the hills that formed the objective, but they went through the Turkish defences with the bayonet. Casualties at this stage had been low, but consolidation had to be carried on under machine gun fire illuminated by flares, and fighting of several small counter-attacks. After midnight a serious counter-attack came in, with the Turks rushing the right hand part of 7th HLI's position. Private Jack with a Lewis gun maintained the end of the line, and Lt-Col Gibbons led an attack back up the hill, rifle in hand, to restore the position. 7th HLI had lost 5 ORs killed and 2 officers and 23 ORs wounded, but the Turkish position had been cracked open, the EEF's advance continuing next morning.Thompson, pp. 392‚Äì9. 52nd (L) Division assaulted Mughar Ridge on 13 November, leading to the capture of Junction Station the following day, while a composite force including 7th HLI marched into Mansurah.Bullock, pp. 80‚Äì1.Thompson, pp. 424‚Äì6. The EEF now began to advance on Jerusalem. 52nd (L) Division had to negotiate a poor road through the hills beyond Beit Liqya in heavy rain. On 20 November, at the start of the Battle of Nebi Samwil, 7th HLI under Lt-Col Gibbons moved up this track along a wadi to attack the hill village of Beit Duqqu. A guide led them astray, and they attacked Beit 'Anan (the objective of 5th HLI) by mistake. Attacked from two sides, that village fell quickly, 6th HLI climbed to take Beit Duqqu, and then the whole brigade cleared the villages behind by weight of rifle and machine gun fire. Over the following days 52nd (L) Division continued to make demonstrations while the EEF took Nabi Samwil.Bullock, p. 90.Falls, pp. 194‚Äì6.Thompson, pp. 434‚Äì7. The Turks began a counter-offensive in late November, when 157th Bde was defending Beit Ur al-Tahta. In front of 7th HLI the opposing lines were only 20‚Äì50 m apart, so the battalion had been given a high proportion of the brigade's machine guns and trench mortars. The attacks on 30 November and 1 December were driven off, and casualties among 7th HLI were very light.Bullock, pp. 91‚Äì2.Thompson, pp. 468‚Äì73. Passage of the Nahr el Auja After breaking this counter-offensive, the EEF captured Jerusalem on 11 December.Bullock, pp. 93‚Äì5. 52nd (L) Division's next operation was the tricky passage of the Nahr el Auja to launch the Battle of Jaffa. The troops practised using canvas boats on a village pond, then at 22.30 on the evening of 20 December the first assaulting waves went forward under cover of an artillery barrage. 7th HLI, under Lt-Col Gibbons, had the task of landing, then attacking the flank of the Turkish trenches defending the ford. All four companies were across by 01.00 on 21 December, and began their attack from an unexpected direction, quickly clearing the flooded Turkish trenches and dugouts. The battalion then signalled the rest of the brigade to cross by the ford, but the ford could not at first be found in the flooded river. By daybreak the division held a significant bridgehead, and the Royal Engineers were constructing pontoon bridges for the artillery. The advance was renewed up the coast on the morning of 22 December, with fire support from HMS Grafton and gunboats, until 52nd (L) Division reached the castle of Arsuf, overlooking the Plain of Sharon, where it halted. The Official History describes the passage of the Auja as 'one of the most remarkable feats of the Palestine Campaign'. 7th HLI suffered only 5 casualties.Bullock, p. 96.Falls, pp. 268‚Äì74.Thompson, pp. 486‚Äì501. Western Front In the early part of 1918 the 52nd (L) Division remained in the lines near Arsuf. Then on 24 March it was warned for a transfer to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. The division's units sailed from Alexandria between 4 and 11 April, and landed at Marseilles by 17 April. 157th Brigade was the last to entrain, on 19 April, and the division was concentrated near Abbeville on 23 April. On 29 April it moved to Aire-sur-la-Lys and continued training. On 6 May it moved to the Vimy area and took over front line trenches, 7th HLI taking an active part in patrolling. On 23 July the division was pulled out of the line into GHQ Reserve, and on 31 July it moved up to the front line at Oppy near Arras to join in the victorious Hundred Days Offensive that was about to get under way.Thompson, pp. 511‚Äì5. Men of 52nd (L) Division with captured machine guns at Qu√©ant, 6 September 1918. Most of 52nd (L) Division launched a surprise attack at H√©nin-sur-Cojeul during the Battle of Albert on 23 August. 157th Brigade launched its own attack the following day, the objective being part of the Hindenburg Line running behind the crest of H√©nin Hill. This entailed a advance with an enemy trench line on Croisilles Ridge on its right flank. The latter was to be taken 56th (1st London) Division. The approach march in the darkness crossed derelict wire and shellholes, but the brigade advanced promptly at 07.00 when the barrage started. It was a misty morning and it was 10 minutes before the German SOS barrage came down on its own lines, but it caught 7th HLI. 157th Brigade took the village of H√©nin-sur- Cojeul with little difficulty and began advancing up H√©nin Hill to the Hindenburg Line, but the creeping barrage and 56th Division had stopped short of the hill, and 157th Bde began to suffer casualties from its own guns. It got outposts into the wire of the Hindenburg Line by 16.00, but the only barrage that could be provided at short notice was thin, and the attack failed.Thompson, pp. 515‚Äì23. The attack was renewed at 09.20 on 27 August (the Battle of the Scarpe), with 7th HLI under Lt-Col Gibbons attacking on the right of the brigade. Opposition was fierce and casualties heavy, but the brigade got through the wire and trenches and crossed the Sens√©e river, only to find that 56th Division was held up again, and 157th Bde's flank was in the air. 157th Bde was involved in a desperate fight in a labyrinth of trenches, and it took 155th Bde to clear the trenches holding up 56th Division. 157th Brigade was unable to get further forward and was ordered to consolidate its position. 7th HLI's casualties from 22 to 31 August came to 5 officers and 58 ORs killed, 9 officers and 249 ORs wounded, and 23 ORs missing. 52nd (L) Division took part in the Battle of Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line on 2‚Äì3 September and made good progress against the triangle of defences linking the Hindenburg Line to the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Switch Line, but 157th Bde was barely engaged.Thompson, pp. 528‚Äì31, 541‚Äì4. Destroyed bridge over the Canal du Nord near M≈ìuvres. There was then a pause while the BEF prepared for a set-piece crossing of the Canal du Nord. Meanwhile, 52nd (L) Division was holding M≈ìuvres, which the Germans were determined to retake. Bitter fighting went on from 17 to 19 September with 7th HLI initially in reserve, then counter- attacking on 19 September to retake the northern edge of the village. The CO, Lt-Col Gibbons, was mortally wounded during this action.Thompson, pp. 548‚Äì52.7th HLI at Remembering the Dead of World War I. After the fight at M≈ìuvres, 52nd (L) Division was given a reduced role in the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September. 157th Brigade advanced south from M≈ìuvres with tank and air support to clear both sides of the canal and Hindenburg Line. 7th HLI (commanded by Major C. Gibb) followed 6th HLI, dropping companies off in the dry brick-sided canal bed to mop up machine gun positions, and then supported 156th Bde onto its objective with rifle fire.Edmonds & Maxwell‚ÄìHyslop, pp. 32‚Äì4.Thompson, pp. 560‚Äì5. From 7 to 30 September, during the fighting at M≈ìuvres and the attack at the Canal du Nord, 7th HLI lost 5 officers and 13 ORs killed and died of wounds, 1 officer and 99 ORs wounded, and 8 ORs missing. By now the battalion's strength was down to about 400 men.Thompson, pp. 568‚Äì9. On 7 October the division was pulled out of the line and transferred north. It went back into the line on 28 October, taking over positions on the Jard Canal, north of Valenciennes.Edmonds & Maxwell‚ÄìHyslop, p. 396.Thompson, pp. 570‚Äì1. During the whole of October, 7th HLI's casualties amounted to only 1 OR killed and 8 wounded. Valenciennes fell to the BEF on 2 November and the German defences began to fall apart. On the night of 7/8 November, 7th HLI got patrols across the canal by means of canvas boast and broken bridges. The code word 'Hunt' was given, and the division crossed the following day to begin the pursuit of the broken German forces. On 10 November it attacked Herchies, north of the Mons Canal, which was held by a rearguard of machine guns and field guns. 7th HLI relieved a Canadian battalion on the Canal du Centre just outside Mons itself. When the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11.00 the following morning, the division was clearing Herchies.Edmonds & Maxwell‚ÄìHyslop, pp. 526, 531, 536‚Äì7, 554. After the Armistice 52nd (L) Division was engaged in training and clearing up the battlefields. Drafting and demobilisation proceeded and the units were quickly reduced to cadres. The 7th HLI was disembodied on 24 May 1919 and the last men from the division entrained for the UK on 31 May. The division was reformed in Scotland in 1920. =2/7th Highland Light Infantry= The 2/7th HLI was formed in September 1914. The 2nd Line Lowland Divisional and Brigade HQs were formed in January 1915, but it was some time before the various formations and units were assembled from their depots. Training was held up both by the lack of modern arms and equipment, and the need to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st Line. By August, however, the division was substantially complete and stationed at Bridge of Allan with the HLI brigade at Dunfermline, when they were officially numbered 65th (2nd Lowland) Division and 196th (2/1st Highland Light Infantry) Brigade respectively.Becke Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5.65 (2nd L) Division at Long, Long Trail. In November 1915 the infantry battalions in the 64th (2nd Highland) and 65th (2nd Lowland) Divisions were numbered sequentially, the 2/7th HLI becoming No 23 Battalion; in January 1916 they reverted to their previous regimental designations. Also in November 1915 65th (2nd Lowland) Division went into winter quarters, but 196th Bde remained at Dunfermline. In March 1916 the division moved into England and joined Southern Army (Home Forces), 196th Bde being quartered around Danbury, Essex. In January 1917 65th (2nd Lowland) Division moved to Ireland to relieve 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been the first TF formation to serve in that country. At first 196th Bde was stationed at the Curragh, Galway and Naas, but later the whole brigade moved into Dublin. During 1917 the 2nd Line TF battalions in 65th (2nd Lowland) Division were progressively replaced by Graduated Battalions of the Training Reserve; by 30 July the 2/7th HLI ceased to exist and had been replaced by 221st Graduated Bn (previously 21st (Reserve) Bn Welsh Regiment). The 2/7th (Blytshwood) Bn HLI was formally disbanded at Naas on 13 January 1918.Training Reserve at Long, Long Trail. =3/7th Highland Light Infantry= A 3rd Line or reserve battalion was formed at Glasgow on 25 March 1915. By 8 April 1916, when it was redesignated 7th (Blythswood) Reserve Bn, HLI, it was stationed at Ripon in Yorkshire. On 1 September 1916 it was at Catterick Camp when it was absorbed into the 5th (City of Glasgow) Reserve Bn of the regiment. =21st Highland Light Infantry= In 1915 the Home Service men of the HLI brigade were combined into 9th Scottish Provisional Battalion, which joined the Scottish Provisional Brigade (later 1st Provisional Brigade) on 22 May. In April 1916 the 1st Provisional Bde moved from Scotland to Kent to take over coastal defence duties, with 9th Bn stationed at Deal. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and at the end of 1916 the remaining battalions were formed into numbered battalions of their parent units in new Mixed Brigades and Home Service Divisions. 9th Provisional Bn became 21st HLI on 1 January 1917, while 1st Provisional Brigade became 221st Infantry Brigade (later 221st Mixed Brigade). Part of the role of these home defence units alongside the Training Reserve was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. 21st HLI continued in this role until the end of the war.Army Council Instructions, January 1916, Appendix 18.HQ 221 Mixed Brigade War Diary 4 August 1914 ‚Äì 30 July 1919, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 95/5458. Interwar The TF reformed on 7 February 1920 and reorganised as the Territorial Army in 1921, with 7th HLI once again in 157th (HLI) Bde of 52nd (Lowland) Division.Titles and designations, 1927. The Beardmore Cadet Corps was also affiliated to the battalion at this time. =Anti-Aircraft conversion= During the 1930s the increasing need for anti- aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. The 7th HLI was one of the battalions selected, becoming the 83rd (7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery on 1 November 1938, consisting of Regimental HQ (RHQ) and three batteries (257, 258, 259) all based at Bridgeton. It adopted the simpler title of 83rd (Blythswood) AA Regiment in July 1939.Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì8, 776.Litchfield, p. 291. It formed part of 42nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade, newly formed to take responsibility for the AA defence of Glasgow and the Clyde estuary.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II =Mobilisation= 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. On 1 June 1940 those AA regiments like the 83rd equipped with 3-inch or the newer 3.7-inch guns were termed Heavy Anti- Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. =Blitz= Formation sign of 12 AA Division. 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt continue to served with 42 AA Bde through the period of the Phoney War and the Battle of Britain.12 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45. Farndale, Annex D.Routledge, Tble LXV, p. 397. Following the Luftwaffe 's defeat in the Battle of Britain, it began night attacks on Britain's cities ('The Blitz'). 3rd AA Division's responsibilities were split in November 1940 and a new 12th AA Division created, to which 42nd AA Bde was transferred, with its responsibility restricted to the defence of Glasgow and the Firth of Clyde.Pile's despatch. Collier, Chapter XVI The industrial town of Clydebank near Glasgow was badly hit on the nights of 13/14 and 14/15 March 1941 in the 'Clydebank Blitz', but none of the raiders was brought down by AA fire.Collier, Chapter XVII.Collier Appendix XXX. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and other ranks to provide the basis for a new 403 HAA Bty formed by 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry on 12 December 1940. Once trained, this battery joined a new 123rd HAA Rgt at King's Park, Glasgow in March 1941.Frederick, p. 783. The urgent need for more HAA guns on Clydeside was well known: the authorised scale had been 80 in 1939, raised to 120 in 1940, but in February 1941 there were still only 67. A new scale of 144 guns was authorised on 21 March, but only 88 were in position.Collier, Chapter XVIII. There were three other heavy raids on Clydeside during the Blitz, on the nights of 7/8 April, 5/6 and 6/7 May 1941.Collier Appendix XXXI. However, after the Blitz ended in May 1941, sufficient reinforcements were arriving to allow AA Command to withdraw 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt to meet the urgent need for AA reinforcements in overseas theatres. The regiment left AA Command in July 1941 and joined the War Office Reserve with 257, 258, 259 HAA Btys.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/5 and WO 33/2323. =Middle East= Tenth Army insignia. By October 1941 the regiment was on its way to join Middle East Forces. On arrival it was sent to Persia and Iraq Force (Paiforce) in Iraq, where General Henry Maitland Wilson was trying to build up the AA resources of Tenth Army to meet a possible German advance on the vital oilfields via the Caucasus. This was a slow process: by June 1942, 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt was still the only HAA unit in Tenth Army. By the end of the year it formed part of 8 AA Bde in Tenth Army. The tasks undertaken were the defence of the Basra base area, RAF Habbaniya, Baghdad, Mosul and the oil installations at Kirkuk. Each of these gun defence areas received one HAA battery.Joslen, pp. 484, 487‚Äì9.Routledge, pp. 199‚Äì200. 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt was joined by 238 (Bristol) HAA Bty, which had left 76th (Gloucester) HAA Rgt and travelled to the Middle East in December 1941.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. Wilson's planned AA defences never reached their full extent. After the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad the Luftwaffe was never in a position to attack Iraq or Persia and from April 1943 the AA defences were run down. 8th AA Brigade and 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt moved to Palestine and came under Ninth Army. 4 AA Bde remained in Iraq, responsible for Habbaiya, Basra, and a few oilfields, but it was given two important training tasks in addition to its operational commitments. The first was to organise and train four Polish AA regiments from the thousands of former Prisoners of War (Anders' Army) released by the Soviet Union to form II Polish Corps under British command. Their technical training was assigned to 83rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt. A second task for 83rd HAA Rgt was to provide 258 HAA Bty as a cadre to form the basis of 25th Indian HAA Rgt on 6 April 1942. In May 1943 the first battery of 25th Indian HAA Rgt was ready for duty and posted to Habbaniya. This regiment was complete by March 1944, and in May the Indian Army took full responsibility for AA tasks under Tenth Army. 4 AA Brigade and 83rd HAA Rgt returned to Middle East Forces, where the AA organisation was also being run down.Routledge, Table XXVI, p. 165. The regiment with 238 (Brisyol), 257 and 259 HAA Btys was placed in suspended animation in North Africa on 4 September 1944. Postwar AA Command formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted in January 1947, the regiment reformed at Bridgeton as 483rd (Blythswood) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA ('Mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit; 483 Rgt dropped the designation in 1950‚Äì51). It formed part of 77 AA Bde at Glasgow.Frederick, p. 1017.Farndale, Annex M.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 onwards. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, and there was a reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 483 (Blythswood) HAA Rgt amalgamated with 474 (City of Glasgow) HAA and 591 (Cameronian) LAA Rgts to form a new 445 (Cameronians) LAA Rgt withFrederick, pp. 1014, 1025. * P (Cameronians) Bty * Q (Blythswood) Bty * R (Glasgow) Bty Further amalgamations in 1961 saw the Blythswood and Glasgow batteries merged as Q Bty, and in 1967 the regiment was disbanded. Although elements continued to serve in the TAVR, the Blythswood lineage was ended. Uniform and Insignia Mackenzie Tartan. The RVCs that were raised in 1859‚Äì60 wore variations on Volunteer grey or green uniforms and different headgear.A number of uniforms of the unit's constituent RVCs were illustrated by Maj-Gen Sir James Grierson in 1909; see Grierson Plate XXX and Blythswood Bn at Scottish Military Articles. However, in July 1861 the 2nd Admin Bn adopted a Rifle green uniform with scarlet collars and piping, a Rifle green shako with black ball-tuft and black belts. The uniform of the 7th Admin Bn was similar but with black facings, adopting a black busby with a black plume in 1872. In 1874 the combined unit adopted a uniform of scarlet tunics with blue facings and trousers, with blue Glengarry bonnets, replaced by a helmet in 1878. From 1886 the battalion adopted the full uniform of the HLI with yellow facings and tartan Trews. After 1908 it followed the HLI in changing to buff facings. The trews would have been in Mackenzie No 5 tartan, the regimental tartan of the HLI.Mackenzie HLI tartans at Regiments.org.Money Barnes, p. 295. From 1947 to 1955 the 483rd HAA Rgt wore a Mackenzie tartan flash on the left arm of battledress blouses. Honorary Colonel The following served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion: * Alex. C. Ewing, VD, 3 June 1864 to 1902. * William Stirling, VD, (supernumerary Hon Col, having held the appointment with the 7th Admin Bn from 22 May 1863) * Col Lord Blythswood, VD, former CO, appointed 28 May 1902 * Col W.

In March 2020, with 5.81 million active lines, it is the fourth mobile operator in Italy following Wind Tre, TIM and Vodafone Italy.  History  Iliad Italia was founded in 2016 as an Italian subsidiary of the French group Iliad SA. In 2017, in view of the launch and in compliance with the provisions of the European Commission, the acquisition of the frequencies ceased by Wind Tre began following the merger of Wind and 3 Italy; as of 31 December 2017, Iliad has acquired almost 300 of the sites abandoned by Wind Tre, while the remaining will be transferred, according to the agreements, by the end of 2019. The French holding said it would invest more than ‚Ç¨1 billion for the launch and development of the new Italian mobile operator (including those to win the new 5G frequencies in Italy) and also expected about a thousand hires. On 16 January 2018 the name of the Italian administrator of Iliad Italia, Benedetto Levi, was officially announced, together with the presentation of the new logo and the institutional website. As part of the implementation of the infrastructures required to cover the Italian territory with its own network, on 16 February 2018, an agreement was reached with the Spanish group Cellnex, which provides Iliad Italia with over 7700 cellular antennas in Italy. Finally, on 29 May 2018, the official launch of the operator takes place, in conjunction with the presentation of the commercial offer and the start of the sale of SIM cards with new numbers or to carry out the number portability from other phone operators. On 18 July 2018, just under two months after its launch, Iliad Italia officially announced that it had reached one million customers between requests for portability and new subscriptions. On 4 September 2018, the Iliad group releases the results of the first half of 2018, reporting the achievement ‚Äì by early August ‚Äì of one and a half million customers in Italy; actually, on 6 September 2018, Iliad Italia issues a press release confirming the achievement of two million customers.  Simbox distributions  Iliad introduced the Simboxes in Italy, a new type of sales point, conceived and created by the French group, Aures and already in use since 2014 on the French market by Free Mobile; these are SIM card vending machines, which allow customers to register and purchase it independently.  Network  Iliad's 3G, 4G and 5G network is being implemented; however, the operator benefits from national coverage through an agreement with Wind Tre in ran sharing (3G and 4G) and roaming (2G). Iliad signed an agreement, respectively, with Cellnex (February 2018) and INWIT (February 2019) in order to install its antennas on their towers. Iliad Italia utilises, inter alia, CommScope telecommunications equipment and collaborates with Cisco Systems (April 2019) and Nokia (September 2019) to implement a state-of-the-art national network (IPv6) in Italy based on segment routing (SRv6) and to achieve its 5G network.

The frontage of the main rectangular block has three storeys and six bays, with a porch having two pairs of Tuscan columns beneath a pediment. Only the attached tower remains of the previous stone building. The house stands in an estate of gardens, of parkland and of woodland. A Grade I listed summerhouse stands in the grounds. History The Homme estate was acquired from the crown by Thomas Kyrle in 1574. His son John was created a baronet and was twice High Sheriff of Herefordshire. He was succeeded by his grandson and the latter by his eldest daughter Vincentia, who married Sir John Ernle, son of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Their daughter Constantia married but had no children and the estate passed to her cousin's son, James Money, whose grandson James added the Kyrle name to his own and was created a baronet. The estate passed down in the Money-Kyrle family for several generations until inherited by Roger Money-Kyrle, who sold the estate, much reduced in size, to his uncle, the Reverend Cecil Money-Kyrle, vicar of Much Marcle. It then descended via Cecil's sister‚Äôs grandson, Vice-Admiral John Ernle Pope, to the family of the latter‚Äôs step-daughter who possess it today.

Gunter Malle, Oberwolfach 2006 Malle received his doctorate in 1986 from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology under the supervision of Heinrich Matzat with thesis Exceptional groups of Lie type as Galois groups. He completed his habilitation in 1991 at Heidelberg University and from 1998 was a professor at Kassel University. Since 2005 he is professor at the Technische Universit√§t Kaiserslautern. Malle does research on linear algebraic groups, finite groups of Lie type and on local-global conjectures in finite-group representation theory, e.g. the Brauer height-zero conjecture, the Alperin weight conjecture, and the McKay conjecture and its block-wise version known as the Alperin-McKay conjecture. Malle's research also deals with the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic of the structure of class groups of quadratic number fields in algebraic number theory, the asymptotic distribution of Galois groups of number fields, and with the inverse problem of Galois theory. In 1993 he began a collaboration with Michel Brou√© and Jean Michel concerning Spetses (named after the Greek island Œ£œÄŒ≠œÑœÉŒµœÇ where the program was initiated). The starting point was the question of whether every finite complex reflection group is a Weyl group of an object analogous to a finite group of Lie type. They baptized the unknown, yet to be constructed, objects Spetses.

Biography  Zohdy Qadry was born in 1972 in Nahf in the Western Galilee. He studied at The Academy for Art and Industry in St. Petersburg, Russia in the 1990s where he also completed a master's degree in wall paintings. He worked in St. Petersburg for several years and returned home in 2004. Qadry's work relates directly to Palestinian history and he is considered as a plastic artist who brings Palestinians‚Äô socio-historical issues into the art field via modern and simple painting. The infrastructure of Qadry's plastic art was made by pairing the Palestinian experience with the Russian art legacy as practiced at the Mochina institute. Qadry's work has far-reaching contexts ‚Äì a result of his life path and his time in Russia ‚Äì and combines a Palestinian-Russian modern style of art. = Non-Geometric Themes = The main theme in Qadry's work between 1996 and 2003 was that of \\"Home\\". In the painting, Nahf (1999), the scene overlooks the houses of Nahf from outside of village in a distance on a foothill, we see small houses and the mosque's minaret which seems representation of nostalgia. Qadry painted a series of olive trees between 2002 and 2003. In this series he moves from representing one tree to a number of trees and adopted three-dimensional technique in this series with the shape of a square grid. Looking over time at his painting ‚Äì from The Family (2002) to Something inside You (2011) ‚Äì one can see a transition from the figurative style to the abstract. = Geometric Theme = In recent years Qadry took geometric shapes as his artistic language. This works does not represent reality but rather to present to the logic of formation, materially and formally. This body of work proposes aesthetic questions about how the principle of plastic art production works in the colonial Palestinian context, and how does art acquires socio-historical meaning in general. In the \\"Memory of Immigration (2012) exhibition, which based on the Idea that visualization of Palestinian tragedy or Al-Nakba, Qadry included some geometric painting series. Qadry participated in a group exhibition, \\"Take Painting\\" at the Petach Tikva Museum of Art, the paintings in which were characterized as \\"not romantic representations of ruins observed somewhere out there in the landscape; they are themselves ruins‚Äîcomposite sites of the real and the allegorical, hybrid accumulations of abstract and figurative idioms\\". Some viewed Qadry's work as modernist formalism with a hidden political essence that blocks any connection to the real world and presents the viewer with a closed world. Others critiqued the way Qadry's works hangs in main space of the gallery and connects the paintings hanging on it to one unit and this formation \\"form connected with the history of painting to ideas of disrupting the present order, but here, the diagonal plaster wall does not disturb order but rather sets it up.\\" Qadryhimself declared when he released \\"Non-Subject\\" series: ‚ÄúAs a painter, I strive to formulate numerous questions ‚Äì and answers ‚Äì as part of the format of painting, rather than cling to artistic or social laws and values intended to dominate me and dictate my fate.‚Äù However, by his works it seems able to express Palestinian's socio-historical tragedy through visualization via its technique, material and in an abstract geometrical language.

Formed as the twelfth named storm of the 2018 typhoon season near Okinotorishima on July 24, Jongdari gradually intensified and developed into the fourth typhoon of the year on July 26. Influenced by an upper-level low and a subtropical ridge, Jongdari executed a rare counter-clockwise southeast of Japan on the next day. At that time, it also reached peak intensity. The typhoon made landfall in Kii Peninsula, over Mie Prefecture of Japan locally early on July 29. Jongdari is one of the four Pacific tropical cyclones since 1951 that approached Honshu on a westward trajectory; the others were Typhoon Viola in 1966, Tropical Storm Ben in 1983, and Typhoon Lionrock in 2016. Meteorological history A tropical disturbance formed southeast of Guam on July 19 and tracked westward steadily. After issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on July 21, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression early on July 22, although the location of its low-level circulation center was not clear. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), however, kept reporting it as a low-pressure area until it was upgraded to a tropical depression late on July 23. After the slow consolidation for several days, the system was upgraded to a tropical storm near Okinotorishima at around 18:00 on July 24 by agencies such as JMA and JTWC, with an international name Jongdari. A microwave imagery revealed a low-level forming eyewall next day, indicating a consolidating system. After JMA upgraded Jongdari to a severe tropical storm at noon, the system accelerated northeastward under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the south. On July 26, as Jongdari started to interact with an upper-level cold-core low to the north which significantly enhanced poleward outflow, it intensified to a typhoon in the afternoon despite increasingly unfavorable vertical wind shear. Over the warm sea surface temperatures between near the Ogasawara Islands, JMA reported that Jongdari had reached peak intensity at 00:00 UTC on July 27, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), and a minimum central pressure of 965 hPa (28.50 inHg). Although JTWC indicated Jongdari reached peak intensity at 12:00 UTC with one-minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), the rugged eye of Jongdari kept periodically visible with an elongated structure due to the further interaction of the upper-level low which had moved to the northwest side of the typhoon. As the steering influence transitioned to a subtropical ridge to the northeast, Jongdari executed a rare counter-clockwise turn to the southeast of Japan. Jongdari began to be inundated by subsidence on July 28, as the Fujiwhara effect had made the upper-level low move to the west of the typhoon. It also initiated a weakening trend while accelerating northwestward and then westward toward the Japanese island of Honshu. At around 01:00 JST on July 29 (16:00 UTC July 28), Typhoon Jongdari made landfall over Ise, Mie Prefecture with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 120 km/h (75 mph) and the central pressure at 975 hPa (28.79 inHg). The storm weakened rapidly inland and made its second landfall over Buzen, Fukuoka Prefecture, at around 17:30 JST (08:30 UTC), with ten-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a central pressure of 992 hPa (29.29 inHg). At around 10:30 CST (02:30 UTC) on August 3, Tropical Storm Jongdari made landfall over Jinshan District, Shanghai. Jongdari rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating on the next day. Impact =Japan= 24 people were injured when the typhoon hit Japan. JR-West train services were delayed or cancelled due to the storm. Although Jongdari didn't directly hit Hokuriku region, it did bring f√∂hn wind to the area because it is located at the leeward slope of the Japanese Alps. Niigata prefecture recorded temperatures close to . Agricultural damage in Chiba and Aichi Prefecture were about JP¬•1.59 billion (US$14.3 million). Preliminary industry loss were estimated between US$1.4‚Äì2 billion. =China= Total damage from Jongdari were about CN¬•420 million (US$61.5 million).

The book describes a 2009 boating accident in which Schuyler was the sole survivor; his three friends, including NFL players Marquis Cooper and Corey Smith, died in the accident. Not Without Hope was a New York Times best- seller.  Description  Not Without Hope describes a 2009 boating accident that took the lives of NFL players Marquis Cooper and Corey Smith and Schuyler's best friend Will Bleakley. Co-author Schuyler survived the incident. On Saturday, February 28, 2009, at about 6:30 AM, the four men embarked in a 21-foot single-engine boat owned by Cooper from the Seminole Boat Ramp near Clearwater Pass. They had gone fishing in the Gulf of Mexico about off of Clearwater, Florida. At around 5:30 PM, they went to pull up the anchor and head back to port, but the anchor was stuck. When Cooper tried to thrust the boat forward in an attempt to dislodge the anchor, the vessel became submerged and capsized, tossing the men overboard. According to Schuyler, over the next several hours, his three companions each eventually succumbed to hypothermia. Schuyler was the sole survivor. On March 2, 2009, he was found by the United States Coast Guard. Schuyler was near death, clinging to the engine mount of the capsized vessel.  Accident victims  * William Ward Bleakley (born November 20, 1983, in Crystal River, Florida) was 25 years old at the time of the incident. He graduated from Crystal River High School with honors, where he played varsity football, baseball, and soccer.

At the beginning of his college career, he was invited to walk-on to the USF Bulls football team. He played in USF's first two bowl games, including its first bowl victory. Bleakley and Schuyler met in the sixth grade,Florida Boat Accident Survivor: 2 NFL Players Gave Up Hope played football together at USF, and became best friends. In the early morning of March 2, 2009, according to Schuyler, Bleakley became non-responsive, exhibited signs of hypothermia, and separated from the fishing boat. This was less than six hours before Schuyler himself was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Bleakley's body was lost at sea; he is missing and presumed dead. * Marquis Victor Cooper (born March 11, 1982, in Mesa, Arizona) was age 26 when the boating accident occurred. He was a linebacker in the National Football League. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the third round of the 2004 NFL Draft. Cooper had also played for the Minnesota Vikings, Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Oakland Raiders. He played college football at the University of Washington. Cooper was the owner of the 21-foot single-engine boat on which the four men had gone fishing and which eventually capsized. In the early morning of March 1, 2009, according to Schuyler, Cooper became non-responsive, exhibited signs of hypothermia, and separated from the fishing boat. According to Schuyler, this occurred approximately one hour before Smith had done the same, and approximately a full day before Bleakley did likewise. Cooper's body was lost at sea; he is missing and presumed dead. * Nicholas L. (\\"Nick\\") Schuyler (born January 18, 1985, in Chardon, Ohio) was 24 years old at the time of the incident.

Co- author Jer√© Longman  Having had no experience as an author, Schuyler asked Jer√© Longman to co-author Not Without Hope with him.Not Without Hope - The Author's Purpose Jer√© Longman (born July 17, 1954, in Coronado, California) grew up in Eunice, Louisiana. He received his bachelor's degree in journalism from Louisiana State University in 1976. Longman has been a sports reporter for The New York Times since 1993, covering a variety of international sports, primarily the Olympic Games. Prior to working at The New York Times, Longman covered the Philadelphia Eagles and the Philadelphia 76ers for The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1982 to 1993. He also worked as a general assignment sportswriter for the paper. From 1977 to 1982, Longman served as a general assignment reporter and sports writer as well as a school district beat reporter at the Dallas Times Herald. In addition, he wrote about high school and college sports at The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi, from 1976 to 1977. In 2009, Longman and his colleague Juliet Macur were awarded first place in the Associated Press Sports Editors (APSE) Breaking News Category for their report raising questions about the ages of the Chinese gymnasts at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Longman is the author of The Girls of Summer (2000), a book about the United States soccer team that won the 1999 Women's World Cup. He also wrote Among the Heroes (2002), a book about United Airlines Flight 93 that was hijacked during the September 11 attacks and crashed in Pennsylvania after the passengers and crew rebelled against the hijackers. Among the Heroes became a New York Times bestseller. In addition, Longman authored The Hurricanes (2008), about a high school football team in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, struggling to be reborn in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Hurricanes was chosen by Slate magazine as one of the Best Books of 2008.  Official report of accident  On March 25, 2009, a report was released based on a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission investigation into the capsizing; the investigation included interviews with Schuyler (the survivor) and an inspection of the boat. The report concluded the following: * the anchor line was tied to the port-side transom as part of a (mistaken) plan to free the anchor; * the vessel, which had a motor, was then throttled forward; * the rear of the vessel was pulled into the water because the vessel's motor had been throttled without enough slack in the anchor line; and * the capsizing ejected the operator and occupants into rough Gulf waters. The conclusions were accompanied by additional details from the Schuyler interviews. According to Schuyler, after the capsizing, he and the other three men, all wearing flotation devices, struggled overnight to remain on top of the capsized hull of the boat, with water reaching chest-high over the partially submerged hull and waves of approximately 6 feet. Cooper and Smith became non-responsive and separated from the vessel between 5:30 AM and 6:30 AM on the morning of March 1, and Bleakley became non-responsive and separated about 24 hours later, which was less than six hours before Schuyler was rescued. The investigator described the symptoms Schuyler witnessed as characteristic of hypothermia.

He is a leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement. Personal life and family Ali Wazir belongs to the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe of the Pashtuns. His father, Malik Mirzalam Wazir, was the chief of the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe. Ali Wazir received his early education in Wanna, South Waziristan. While studying law at Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, he was influenced by the International Marxist Tendency group and became a political activist. In 2003, Ali Wazir's elder brother Farooq Wazir, who was a tribal leader and activist critical of the Taliban's presence in Waziristan, was assassinated by the Taliban militants. It marked the start of a long campaign during which the Taliban killed thousands of local activists, politicians, and clerics in the Pashtun tribal areas who had opposed the Taliban. In June 2004, Ali Wazir's father, Malik Mirzalam, was picked up by the authorities under the collective responsibility clause of the Frontier Crimes Regulations. In July 2005, while Ali Wazir was in prison under the same law, the Taliban killed his father, brother, two uncles, and two cousins in a single ambush near their home. When Ali Wazir was briefly released by the authorities, the funerals had already ended. Remembering the day in July 2005, Ali's mother, Khwazhamina, said: \\"Our whole front yard was red with the blood oozing from our martyrs. Our house was eerily silent and empty after their remains were taken to the graveyard for burial. Only the cries of our small children echoed in the blank courtyard.‚Äù Her family said that she lived in a doorless room afterwards, because of her fear of being awaken to a tragic news by a knock at her door. In May 2020, Ali's first cousin Arif Wazir was assassinated. Between 2003 and 2020, 18 male members of Ali Wazir's extended family were killed by the militants. The militants also ruined the businesses owned by his family. Their gas stations were demolished, their tube wells were filled with dirt, and their apple and peach orchards were sprayed with poisonous chemicals. In 2016, their market in Wanna was blown up with dynamite. After the blowing up of the market, the locals of Wanna were prevented from collecting donations to help Ali Wazir's family. ‚ÄúThey were told it would set an unacceptable precedent because the government cannot let anyone help those it punishes,‚Äù Ali Wazir wrote in his article. 2018 assassination attempt On June 3, 2018, during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, gunmen affiliated with the Taliban attacked Ali Wazir and other supporters of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) in Wanna, South Waziristan. Ali Wazir survived but three supporters of PTM were killed in the attack while dozens others, including Ali Wazir's cousin Arif Wazir and a local journalist Noor Ali Wazir, were injured. Many of the injured were taken to hospitals in Dera Ismail Khan. A local senior journalist, on condition of anonymity, told that his sources confirmed that the attack was carried out by the Nazir Group, a faction of the Taliban militants which operated in South Waziristan. The dispute between the two parties in Wanna had started on June 2 when a pro- government militant leader, Ainullah Wazir, took away Pashteen hats from PTM activists by force and set the hats on fire. To condemn the act of the militant leader, Ali Wazir announced that a protest sit-in was to be held by PTM in Wanna from June 4. In response, the militants with guns went to Ali Wazir's home and asked him to either leave the area or leave PTM. When Ali Wazir refused to comply with their demand, they attacked Wanna's Mirzalam Market and a nearby petrol pump owned by Ali Wazir. However, a large number of unarmed PTM supporters gathered at the market to support Ali Wazir and resisted the militants, after which the militants indiscriminately opened fire on the PTM supporters. The PTM leader Mohsin Dawar alleged that when the militants fled after the attack was repulsed, security forces reached the area who also opened fire on the unarmed PTM supporters, injuring many of them. Mohsin Dawar added: ‚ÄúEven though the military imposed a curfew in the area, but it has not discouraged the people from coming out and expressing their support for the PTM.‚Äù The PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen also claimed that the attackers were backed by the Pakistan Army and intelligence agencies. Following a protest call by Pashteen, PTM held protest rallies in several cities including Peshawar, Quetta, and Islamabad to condemn the attack on Ali Wazir. On June 4, the Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor claimed at a press conference that a firefight had taken place between PTM supporters and a government sponsored peace committee, . Political career Ali Wazir ran for the seat of the National Assembly of Pakistan as an independent candidate from Constituency NA-41 (Tribal Area-VI) in 2008 Pakistani general election but was unsuccessful. He received 3,294 votes and lost the seat to Abdul Maalik Wazir. He ran for the seat of the National Assembly as an independent candidate from Constituency NA-41 (Tribal Area-VI) in 2013 Pakistani general election but was unsuccessful.

In 2018, he became one of the leaders of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) which emerged after the extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud. He was offered Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) ticket by Imran Khan to contest 2018 general election from his Constituency NA-50 (Tribal Area-XI) which he declined, following which Imran Khan decided not to field candidate against him in the constituency.

The term is abbreviated as EHG. During the Mesolithic, the EHGs inhabited an area stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Urals and downwards to the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Along with Scandinavian Hunter- Gatherers (SHG) and Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), the EHGs constituted one of the three main genetic groups in the postglacial period of early Holocene Europe. The border between WHGs and EHGs ran roughly from the lower Danube, northward along the western forests of the Dnieper towards the western Baltic Sea. EHGs are attested to about 75% Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) descent, and to have contributed significantly to the ancestry of the WHGs and SHGs (who were a mixture of WHG and EHG). During the Neolithic and early Eneolithic, EHGs on the Pontic-Caspian steppe formed the Yamnaya culture, perhaps after some admixture with Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHGs). The genetic cluster formed from this admixture is known as Western Steppe Herder (WSH). The Yamnaya culture and its descendants are supposed to have embarked on a massive migration leading to the spread of Indo-European languages throughout large parts of Eurasia. Research In their groundbreaking genetic study, Haak et al. (2015) identified the Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) as a distinct genetic cluster in samples of two males. The EHG male buried in Karelia ca. 5500-5000 BC was found to be carrying R1a1 and C1g. The EHG male buried in Samara ca. 5650-5550 BC was found to be carrying R1b1 and U5a1d. The authors of the study also identified a Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) cluster and a Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer (SHG) cluster, with SHG being intermediate between WHG and EHG. It was suggested that EHGs harbored mixed ancestry from Ancient North Eurasians (ANEs) and WHGs. The people of the Yamnaya culture were found to be a mix of EHG and Near Eastern populations. During the 3rd millennium BC, the Yamnaya people embarked on a massive expansion throughout Europe, which significantly altered the genetic landscape of the continent. The expansion gave rise to cultures such as Corded Ware, and was possibly the source of the distribution of Indo-European languages in Europe. EHGs may have mixed with Near Eastern populations, which formed the Yamnaya culture, as early as the Eneolithic (5200-4000 BC). Researchers have found that EHGs may have derived 75% of their ancestry from ANEs. WHGs were in turn a mix of EHGs and the Upper Paleolithic people (Cro-Magnon) of the Grotte du Bichon in Switzerland. SHGs were determined to be a mix of EHGs and WHGs. The people of the Mesolithic Kunda culture and the Narva culture of the eastern Baltic were a mix of WHG and EHG, showing the closest affinity with WHG. Samples from the Ukrainian Mesolithic and Neolithic were found to cluster tightly together between WHG and EHG, suggesting genetic continuity in the Dnieper Rapids for a period of 4,000 years. The Ukrainian samples belonged exclusively to the maternal haplogroup U, which is found in around 80% of all European hunter-gatherer samples. Meanwhile, the people of the Pit‚ÄìComb Ware culture (CCC) of the eastern Baltic appear to be closely related to EHG. This is in contrast to earlier hunter-gatherers in the area, who were more closely related to WHG. This was demonstrated using a sample of Y-DNA extracted from a Pit‚ÄìComb Ware individual. This belonged to R1a15-YP172. The four samples of mtDNA extracted constituted two samples of U5b1d1, one sample of U5a2d, and one sample of U4a. In January 2018 researchers published details of an analysis of 13 SHGs and found all of them to be of EHG ancestry. SHGs from western and northern Scandinavia had more EHG ancestry (ca 49%) than individuals from eastern Scandinavia (ca. 38%). The authors of the study suggested that the SHGs were a mix of WHGs who had migrated into Scandinavia from the south, and EHGs who had later migrated into Scandinavia from the northeast along the Norwegian coast. EHGs and WHGs displayed lower allele frequences of SLC45A2 and SLC24A5, which cause depigmentation, and OCA/Herc2, which causes light eye color, than SHGs. Members of the Kunda culture and Narva culture were also found to be more closely related with WHG, while the Pit‚ÄìComb Ware culture was more closely related to EHG. Northern and eastern areas of the eastern Baltic were found to be more closely related to EHG than southern areas. The study noted that EHGs, like SHGs and Baltic hunter-gatherers, carried high frequencies of the derived alleles for SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, which are codings for light skin. =The Genomic History of Southeastern Europe= In an analysis of a large number of individuals of prehistoric Eastern Europe, thirty-seven samples were collected from Mesolithic and Neolithic Ukraine (9500-6000 BC). These were determined to be an intermediate between EHG and SHG. Samples of Y-DNA extracted from these individuals belonged exclusively to R haplotypes (particularly subclades of R1b1 and R1a) and I haplotypes (particularly subclades of I2). mtDNA belonged almost exclusively to U (particularly subclades of U5 and U4). A large number of individuals from the Zvejnieki burial ground, which mostly belonged to the Kunda culture and Narva culture in the eastern Baltic, were analyzed. These individuals were mostly of WHG descent in the earlier phases, but over time EHG ancestry became predominant. The Y-DNA of this site belonged almost exclusively to haplotypes of haplogroup R1b1a1a and I2a1. The mtDNA belonged exclusively to haplogroup U (particularly subclades of U2, U4 and U5). Forty individuals from three sites of the Iron Gates Mesolithic in the Balkans were also analyzed. These individuals were estimated to be of 85% WHG and 15% EHG descent. The males at these sites carried exclusively R1b1a and I (mostly subclades of I2a) haplotypes. mtDNA belonged mostly to U (particularly subclades of U5 and U4). People of the Cucuteni‚ÄìTrypillia culture were found to harbor about 20% hunter-gatherer ancestry, which was intermediate between EHG and WHG. =The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia= In a genetic study published in Science in September 2019, a new ancestral component called West Siberian Hunter-Gatherer (WSHG) was discovered. WSHGs were found to be of about 30% EHG ancestry, 50% ANE ancestry, and 20% East Asian ancestry. Physical appearance The EHGs are believed to have been light-skinned and brown eyed.

Biography Mikhail Venyukov was born in the village of Nikitino Pronsky district of Ryazan province (now Korablin district of the Ryazan region). At the age of thirteen, he was accepted into the Cadet Corps; in 1850 he graduated with the rank of artillery ensign in the Nobility Regiment. Venyukov attended St. Petersburg University, entered the Academy of the General Staff, graduating in 1856. In early May 1857 lieutenant Venyukov as a senior adjutant arrived at the headquarters of the troops of Eastern Siberia. Governor-General N. N. Muraviev invited Venyukov to go with him to the Amur. In his diary Veniukov wrote: \\"My dream to be on the Cupid, which at that time represented a major political interest, was coming true.\\" Venyukov was entrusted with compiling topographic maps and analyzing military statistics to fully assess the political situation in the Far East with a view to its further settlement. In St. Petersburg, he met with GI Nevelskim. On the instructions of Governor-General Veniukov, there was a land expedition along the Ussuri River. In connection with this, Nevelskoy provided the future traveler with valuable information about the Lower Amur and Ussuri regions. In February 1858, MI Venyukov, then in Irkutsk, began preparations for his first expedition: through Ussuri, and through the Sikhote-Alin to the ocean. And on June 1, 1858, MI Venyukov and his companions‚Äîthe hundredth Peshkov, the translator Maslennikov, the sergeant-officer Karmanov, the orderly and the eleven Cossacks, began their journey from Kazakevichevo, which is located next to the recently founded Khabarovka. The 26-year-old officer walked more than 700 km from the mouth of the Ussuri to the pass through the Sikhote-Alin. Arriving at the sea, Veniukov intended to continue his journey to the Vladimir post, but he had to return along his previous route, because the Chinese living near the mouth of the Zerkalnaya River (formerly known as Tadushu) had with threats blocked the way of the expedition.–í–µ–Ω—é–∫–æ–≤ –ú. –ò. –ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è –ø–æ –ü—Ä–∏–∞–º—É—Ä—å—é, –ö–∏—Ç–∞—é –∏ –Ø–ø–æ–Ω–∏–∏. ‚Äî –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫: –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –∫–Ω. –∏–∑–¥-–≤–æ. ‚Äî 1970.–ê—Ä—Å–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤ –í. –ö. –ü–æ –£—Å—Å—É—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º—É –∫—Ä–∞—é. ‚Äî –°. 43.–¢–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏–∫–∞ –ö–∞–≤–∞–ª–µ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–∞ During the trip he wrote an expeditionary report \\"Description of the Ussuri River and the lands east of it to the sea\\". The report gives the physical geography of the newly discovered region, presents the life of its extremely rare population and possible prospects for settlement and development. Personal circumstances forced Mikhail Ivanovich to leave Siberia. In March 1859 Veniukov spoke in St. Petersburg at the Russian Geographical Society with a report on his trip to Ussuri . The information presented to them was highly appreciated by the audience, and in particular by the vice- president of the Petr Petrovich Semenov-Tyan-Shansky Society. All his further work was devoted to travel with scientific purposes. In the years 1857‚Äì1863. Venyukov traveled to Amur, Ussuri, Transbaikalia, Issyk-Kul, Tien-Shan, Altai and the Caucasus. In 1861 he was promoted to the rank of Major. He then served in Poland as chairman of the commission on peasant affairs. In the years 1868‚Äì1869, he undertook a round-the-world trip, with particular attention to China and Japan. Venyukov spent 1974 in Asiatic Turkey, and in 1876 was promoted to the rank of Major-General. In 1877, Venyukov filed a petition for resignation from military service and was dismissed \\"Major-Major with uniform\\". In the same year he left for Paris. He lived in France, Switzerland, England, and was elected a member of the geographical societies of these countries. Veniukov traveled extensively in North Africa, Madagascar, Zanzibar, South and Central America, Norway, and Italy. These trips produced numerous printed works of a geographical and military-geographical nature. His scientific works were published by the French Academy of Sciences. Obelisk on the Venyukov Pass In 1878, Venyukov published an article in the Stock Exchange Gazette (1878, No. 92), in which he sharply criticized Vesin's work \\"On the Road to India\\" (Golos, 1878, No. 81). As a supporter of Justice Pyotr Pashino in the newspaper \\"Russian World\\" (1878, number 94) Venyukov delivered a letter against the article Venyukova, and refuting all the arguments on which it is based, called the act of the author of the article \\"indecent towards society\\".–ü–∞—à–∏–Ω–æ, –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å : –≤ 25 —Ç–æ–º–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥‚Äî–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, 1896‚Äî1918.

Mikhail Ivanovich Venyukov died in Paris on July 17, 1901 and was buried, according to the will, next to the grave of Alexander Herzen in Nice. The village of Veniukovo, of the Vyazemsky district of the Khabarovsk Territory, standing on the Ussuri River, was named in his honour, and a school in the village built using the proceeds of his will. The pass through the Sikhote-Alin Range near the village of Kavalerovo, Primorsky Krai, is also named in his honour. There is an obelisk on the pass. The Venyukovka River in the Terneysky District is likewise named in his honour. Selected bibliography * 1 Old and New Treaties of Russia with China. - SPb., 1863. - 95 p. * From memories.

Early life and education  Alston was born on 22 May 1907 in Birkenhead, Cheshire. She was educated at Wallasey High School and Penrhos College, Colwyn Bay. She obtained a BSc in mathematics in 1927 and a diploma in education in 1928, both from the University of Liverpool. While at university, she took flying lessons and obtained her private pilot's 'A' flying licence in 1929. She then spent 5 years teaching mathematics in Rotherham and Nottingham, and simultaneously working towards a MSc in aerodynamics at the University of Nottingham. Her MSc was awarded in 1932.  Career  = Teaching 1929-33 = After graduating from the University of Liverpool, Alston taught mathematics in Rotherham and Nottingham from 1929 to 1933 while completing her Master's degree. Throughout her consequent scientific career, Alston committed herself to the improvement and communication of aviation education. = Research scientist and flight test observer, RAE Farnborough 1933-45 = Alston joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield in 1933, working under Hermann Glauert and supervising the Aero department's spinning tunnel. She often flew as an observer on hazardous test flights as part of her research work. During World War II, as well as her RAE work, Alston was seconded to Ringway Airport (now known as Manchester International Airport) to oversee problems with the introduction of troop-carrying gliders into the British Army's Glider Pilot Regiment. She completed the RAF basic and advanced pilot-training courses in Miles Magister and Harvard trainers, becoming a founder member and Adjutant of the RAF Technical Flight. In 1944, Alston investigated the cause of Fairey Barracuda torpedo bomber accidents. Together with her pilot Eric Brown, she carried out test flights and found problems with flap positions in conjunction with rudder input to be the cause of the crashes. Brown later stated that \\"I cannot leave the accident investigation without paying tribute to one of the flight-test observers involved in these tests - Mrs Gwen Alston. Mrs Alston was a truly remarkable 'lady boffin', who, despite having lost her scientist husband in a fatal crash while on a similar duty, never flinched at any risky flight and in all circumstances displayed the essence of courage\\". She was a founding member of RAF technical flight, the Aerospace Education and Recreation Organisation and became an associate of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1956. = Inspector of Schools 1946-72 = In 1946, she was appointed as H. M. Inspector of Schools in England, by the Ministry of Education. Amongst her responsibilities, Alston was expected to give advice and inspect aeronautical matters, including educational training for the aviation industry, sport and recreational flying and air education in schools and colleges. A speech she gave to the Women's Engineering Society in October 1956, entitled Technological Training and Employment of Women detailed the issues faced by girls in the education system who might be interested in careers in science or technology. Alston retired in 1973.  Personal life and family  Alston was an avid aviator, obtaining her flying license from the Royal Aero Club in 1929 and completing basic and advanced RAF pilot training. Whilst working at Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield in 1933, Alston met her future husband Peter Alston, a Civilian Scientific Officer, who died on 16 February 1939 near Eyke, Suffolk, while testing a military aircraft. The Royal Aeronautical Society's RP Alston Medal, originally a prize for work in the field of air safety through stability and control but since 1957 awarded for practical achievement associated with the flight testing of aircraft, was first awarded in 1949 in memory of Alston's late husband. The medal features an eagle in flight with a hot air balloon in the background.  Awards and honours  * In 1969, Alston became the first recipient of the Scott-Farnie Medal for her contribution to aviation education. * In 1970, Alston became an Honorary Companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

He is known for his work determining the molecular hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC), including demonstrating the roles of the tumour suppressor protein APC and the WNT signalling pathway, as well as the involvement of intestinal stem cells in tumourigenesis Education After obtaining a BSc in genetics from the University of Nottingham and an MRes in Biology from the University of Manchester, Owen went on to obtain a PhD from the University of Edinburgh.PhD thesis: Genetic control of apoptosis and tumourigenesis in murine models of intestinal neoplasia Career Owen was a postdoctoral fellow at Cardiff University investigating the role of the APC gene in Wnt signalling and cancer. In 2005, he became a Junior Group Leader at the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, and in 2011 he was appointed the Institute's Deputy Director. In 2016, the Institute's Director, Professor Karen Vousden moved to the Francis Crick Institute and became CRUK's chief scientist, and Owen acted as interim Director of the Beatson Institute until being appointed as the next Director in 2017. He also leads the CRUK Glasgow Centre, which aims to bring together scientists and clinicians to work together on cancer research, drug discovery and patient care. Research =The Phenotype of APC loss in vivo and key effector pathways= Owen was the first person to acutely delete the APC gene in the murine intestine, a model that he then used to elucidate the key pathways that APC controls in vivo. Using this model system, Owen's group identified critical functional roles for genes such as MYC, RAC and MTOR. Additionally, the use of this and other models has allowed Owen's group to identify potential chemoprevention strategies. For example, the group's work on aspirin showed that embryonic and perinatal exposure to aspirin suppresses neoplasia associated with the loss of Apc function. =Neutrophils in colorectal and other cancers= Owen's group showed that neutrophils are associated with the earliest stage of CRC, and using mouse models they showed that inhibition of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 could suppress both colitis and spontaneous cancer. This was confirmed by the Dubois group in 2013. Owen's group continued these studies into the pancreas to show that inhibition of CXCR2 suppresses metastasis in pancreatic cancer. =The cell of origin of colorectal cancer= In collaboration with Hans Clevers's laboratory, Owen's group showed that Lgr5-positive cells are an efficient cell of tumourigenesis. Within the same study, they also showed that non-stem cells lacking APC could form lesions but would rarely progress. Following on from these studies, the group worked with Florian Greten's laboratory to show that additional mutations can cause an expansion in the cell of origin. This work built upon work in Owen's laboratory on understanding the cooperation of APC with mutations in other genes such as KRAS and PTEN. =Key regulators of metastasis= Owen's group has developed models of metastatic disease and identified critical components of the metastatic pathway, which has led to the design of trials specifically aimed at targeting metastatic disease in pancreatic cancer, e.g. Dasatanib in resectable pancreatic cancer patients. The group also provided definitive functional information on the role of mutant p53 in metastasis and mechanisms behind the process: integrin recycling, LOX, RHO The group also identified critical roles for RAC and its GEFs in melanoma migration and metastasis. Awards and honours In 2007, Owen won the Young Scientist Frank Rose Award in recognition of his contributions to translational cancer research and in 2012 he was awarded the CRUK Future Leaders in Cancer Research Prize for his contributions to cancer research. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012 and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2017.
