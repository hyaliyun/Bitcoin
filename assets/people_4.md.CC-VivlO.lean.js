Pietraszko was a noted spiritual director and chaplain as well as a popular confessor but was best known for his sermons and for his homiletic writings. He did his ecclesial studies just before World War II broke out and was a brief hostage of the Gestapo after the Nazi forces invaded Poland in 1939. He later came under the watch of the communist secret service following the conflict for his attempt to see new churches constructed and church art and architecture preserved. The process for his beatification opened in 1994 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated on 21 December 2018 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue which enabled for Pietraszko to be titled as Venerable. Life Jan Pietraszko was born on 7 August 1911 in Buczkowice as the eldest of three children to the poor farmers Józef Pietraszko and Anna Migdał (d. 11.5.1914); he received his baptism in the Transfiguration church on 13 August from Father Andrzej Lenart. His two brothers were Władysław and Józef. His mother died when he was three after which his father married his sister-in-law with on 15 August 1916 whom he had seven children thus leaving Pietraszko with five half-sisters and two half- brothers. Pietraszko did his initial schooling in Buczkowice from 1917 until 1923 and then did high school in Bielsko-Biała; he graduated from high school in 1931 and following this commenced his ecclesial studies. He did his theological studies in the Jagiellonian and then received his sacerdotal ordination to the priesthood on 5 April 1936 (Palm Sunday) from the then- Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha in the Saint Francis church. From 1938 until 1939 and again from 1943 until 1944 he served as the aide and chaplain to Archbishop Sapieha. From 1936 until 1938 and again from 1939 until 1942 he served as a vicar in Rabka in the Saint Mary Magdalene parish. The Nazi forces invaded Poland therefore instigating World War II and for a brief time the Gestapo held him hostage on 2 September 1939. He served in the Trinity parish church from September 1942 until January 1943. From January 1944 until November 1946 he served as a vicar in Zakopane and then from 1947 until 1948 served in the Saint Stephen parish. Pietraszko from September 1948 until his death served in the Saint Anne church where from 18 February 1957 he would act as the \\"de facto\\" parish priest in the absence of a pastor. From 24 September 1947 until 1957 he served as the prefect for the seminarians of Kraków. On 23 November 1962 he had learned that Pope John XXIII made him an auxiliary bishop for the Kraków archdiocese (an appointment that Bishop Karol Józef Wojtyla (future pope) had requested). He received his episcopal consecration on 15 April 1963 from Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński in the Wawel Cathedral; the principal co-consecrators were Bishops Karol Józef Wojtyła (with whom he became close friends) and Julian Jan Groblicki. Pietraszko - as a new bishop - was able to attend the last two sessions of the Second Vatican Council. He was enthusiastic about the Council and its reforms and supported the idea that he could celebrate the Mass in Polish for the benefit of the faithful. Upon being made a bishop he was made a vicar general for the diocesan priesthood (auxiliaries are granted an area or region to look after) on 4 July 1963 and from 12 March 1966 headed the archdiocesan commission for architecture and art which he took a special interest in. He fought for the creation of new churches despite the atheistic communist regime prohibiting this and it put him under the radar of the secret service who began their watch over him since around 1970. It was an exceptional case after being made a bishop that Pietraszko did not resign his position as a parish priest to accept his episcopal nomination since he wished to remain a simple pastor. He spent a great deal of time in the confessional making him a sought-after confessor; he was also noted for his sermons which he took great time in preparing (after careful reading) thus making him a popular preacher. These sermons had a basis in important aspects of Sacred Scripture but would be rooted in a particular subject that came from certain scriptural texts. He also made it a practice where collections could not be taken during the traditional singing of Christmas carols in his church. He walked around often in a simple black clerical cassock as opposed to his episcopal attire. From 20 December 1968 he began his membership in the archdiocesan liturgical commission. Pietraszko died in a neurological clinic on 2 March 1988. In an official telegram of condolence his friend Pope John Paul II hailed him for his \\"particular wisdom\\". His remains were interred on 7 March in the Saint Anne church under the altar of the Exaltation of the Cross. Beatification process The beatification process for the late prelate opened in the Kraków archdiocese under Cardinal Franciszek Macharski in a diocesan process that launched on 18 March 1994 and closed on 24 April 2001; its task was to accumulate documentation (including his spiritual writings) and witness interrogatories. The formal launch to the cause came on 7 July 1994 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree and titled Pietraszko as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated this process on 22 February 2002 as having adhered to the congregation's regulations for conducting causes. In 2012 the postulation (officials in charge of the cause) submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials. This dossier was the culmination of all the evidence gathered during the diocesan phase; it detailed the late bishop's life and his reputation for holiness thus making the official argument for his becoming a saint. Theologians approved the dossier on 27 February 2018 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishops months after. Pietraszko became titled as Venerable on 21 December 2018 after Pope Francis confirmed that he had practiced heroic virtue during his lifetime. The first postulator assigned to the cause was Stanisław Ryłko who had been a student of Pietraszko. The current postulator for this cause is Monsignor Właysław Gasidło.

After receiving information about a rebellion in Persia and an epidemic in the main Persian army, the Byzantine armies in the East under the orders of Emperor Justinian I initiated a hasty invasion of Persarmenia. The outnumbered Persian forces in the region successfully performed a meticulous ambush at Anglon, decisively ending the Byzantine campaign. Background The Sasanian ruler Khosrow I began an invasion of Commagene in 542, but retreated to Adurbadagan and halted at Adhur Gushnasp, intending to begin a campaign against Byzantine Armenia. The Byzantines approached Khosrow I to begin negotiations, but in the middle of this they received information about the epidemic of the so-called Plague of Justinian in Khosrow I's force and a rebellion in Persia by the prince Anoshazad. Seeing this as an opportunity, Emperor Justinian I commanded all Byzantine forces in the east to initiate an invasion of Persarmenia. Byzantine invasion Martin was the newly-appointed magister militum per Orientem at the time, but according to primary sources did not have much authority over other generals. The Byzantine invasion force, which numbered 30,000 in total, was initially scattered: * Martin and his forces, stationed in Citharizum with Ildeger and Theoctistus * Peter and Adolius and their forces * Valerian, the magister militum per Armeniam, stationed near Theodosiopolis; joined by Narses (a Persarmenian) and his regiment of Herules (under Philemouth and Beros) and Armenians These forces united only after crossing the Persian border, in the plain of Dvin. Justus, Peranius, Domnentiolus, John, son of Nicetas, and John the Glutton stayed at Phison, near Martyropolis, performing minor incursions into Persia. Sasanian forces in Persarmenia numbered 4,000 and were under the command of Nabedes. They concentrated themselves at the mountainous village of Anglon (probably identical to Ankes, Dsakhgodn Canton, Ayrarat Province, Kingdom of Armenia) which featured a fortress and was located near the Dvin plain. They prepared a defensive position for an elaborate ambush by blocking the entrances to the village, digging trenches, and setting up ambushes in the houses of the village outside the fortress, while marshalling the army below. According to Procopius, the Byzantine generals lacked a proper union among themselves. The Byzantine forces proceeded into the rough terrain of Anglon, and hastily formed a single-line formation after the commanders were informed of the Persian presence, with Martin forming the center, Peter forming the right, and Valerian (probably joined by Narses) forming the left. Narses and his regulars and Herules were the first to engage. Apparently, part of the Persian army was defeated, and the Persian cavalry feigned retreat toward the fortress, and their flight was followed by Herules and others as koursores. The Persians, including their archers, then launched their ambush from the buildings outside the fortress, easily routing the lightly-armored Herules, while their commander Narses was mortally hit in the temple in close combat. A general Persian counter-attack then resulted in the routing of the Byzantines. The Persians did not pursue them beyond the rough terrain out of fear of an ambush. Adolius was among those killed in the retreat. Analysis The only source describing the battle is the Byzantine historian Procopius, whose account is especially critical of the Byzantine army's performance in the campaign. However, modern sources have disputed his assessments. The force in the battle is considered an example of the \\"inadequacy\\" of many of the recruited soldiers. Others note the lack of coordination between the Byzantine generals. According to J. B. Bury, Procopius (who was a companion of General Belisarius) has exaggerated the incompetence of the Byzantine generals in the battle and the severity of their defeat. Petersen also considered aspects of Procopius' description of the battle—including alleged poor organization and leadership of the force, and Byzantine soldiers marching in disarray and \\"mixed in with the baggage terrain\\"—to be a distorted description of what were actually intentional strategies and tactics. Sarantis et al. (2013) notes the meticulous ambush by the defenders, describing it as \\"heroic\\". Anglon is an example of the less common form of defensive fortification in which settlements are outside of the defensive structures; this is sometimes seen in the Caucasus, another example is seen in the siege of Tzacher/Sideroun in 557. The outcome of the battle gave the Persians the momentum in the Lazic War.

It is recognized by China as a Geographical Indication Product. Yongfeng chili sauce is made of Yongfeng chili, polished glutinous rice, wheat, soybeans, and salt. It is prepared by boiling, grinding, mixing, fermenting, and aging, and produces a dark red, spicy sauce. Characteristics The finished sauce is a translucent reddish-brown with an amber luster, fragrant with Yongfeng pepper and wheat, and has a mellow sweet and spicy flavor. History and culture A farmer in Yuanxiao Village, Yongfeng, chops peppers People began to make chili sauce in the Yongfeng area during China's Ming dynasty during the reign of Chongzhen Emperor. The chili sauce has been made in Yongfeng for more than 300 years. Annual production starts after the Dragon Boat Festival as the rainy season ends. Home cooks make their own sauces, and rooftops of houses often have a sauce tank fermenting in the sun. Along with Xiangtan lotus seeds and Changsha stinky tofu, Yongfeng chili sauce is known as \\"Hunan Sanbao\\" or one of Hunan's three treasures. Business and economics According to a government report, Yongfeng chili sauce sales revenues were nearly 100 million yuan in the year 2000, representing taxes and profits of 30,000,000 CNY (4,469,550 USD) for Shuangfeng county. By the year of 2009, there were more than 100 chili sauce production enterprises in Shuangfeng county, including 3 enterprises with an annual production capacity of over 2,000 tons. Ingredients and production Cow-horn peppers used in the production of Yongfeng sauce Yongfeng chili sauce can be made with bell pepper, cow-horn pepper and line pepper. =Industrial production= The Chinese government in 2007 approved an application for Geographical Indication Products status for Yongfeng chili sauce, specifying the ingredients and their proportions for industrial production. These are: * 50% fresh Yongfeng red pepper, bell pepper, horn pepper * 7% wheat flour * 3.5% glutinous rice flour * 2.5% soybean powder * 25% water * 9% salt. The specified process calls for boiling the soybean, wheat, and rice flours, crushing or grinding the chili pepper, adding salt, then a natural fermentation process in which the sauce is set in the sun in open containers to ferment and form koji. =Home production= Local farmers and many families each have an inherited family recipe, which they adjust according to family members' flavor preferences. For example, some local vegetables named Dao Dou (sword bean Canavalia gladiata (Jacq.) DC.) and Di Can (Stachys geobombycis C. Y. Wu) are added into the chili sauce in Yuan Xiao village. The quality of the sauce relies on the weather. The mixed materials need to be exposed under strong sunshine for about 40 days until the color of the sauce is dark red and the aroma is overflowing. Usually, the sunshine near the summer season in Shuangfeng county is qualified. Traditionally, the fermentation is taken under sunshine, but for some industrial process, temperature controlled fermentation technology is usually a guarantee of production and quality.

Professional wrestling career  = Tokyo Joshi Pro (2013–present) = Yamashita trained in Kyokushin and mixed martial arts from a young age and originally had hopes of being an idol, and took part in many auditions for idol groups, though struggled to get anywhere.

Yamashita accepted the offer and moved to Tokyo at age 17 to begin training under Mikami shortly after. In TJP's early years, it was a small promotion that mainly ran shows alongside live music and other live performances.

Biography Abelardo Estorino was born in Unión de Reyes on 29 January 1925. After Bachillerato studies in Matanzas, he trained as a dental surgeon and practiced as such for three years (1954–1957), dividing time between the job and his literary vocation. He wrote his first play, Hay un muerto en la calle, in 1954. It remains unpublished. The success of his second dramatic work, El peine y el espejo, written in 1956 but released in 1960, placed him firmly in the world of literature and drama. After studying stage direction at the Teatro Estudio de Cuba and working with Julio Matas and Herberto Dumé, it was the 1960s that marked the growth and direction of his work. El robo del cochino (1961) and La casa vieja (1964) were his most notable plays from this period. He also adapted works for the theater, such as El mago de Oz (The Wizard of Oz), El fantasmita, La dama de las camelias (La Dame aux Camélias) (1968), and Las impuras by . In that decade Estorino traveled to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, joined the National Council of Culture, and participated in the First National Congress of Writers and Artists of Cuba. During this time he received the first recognitions of his long career, such as mentions for the Casa de las Américas Prize for El robo del cochino and La casa vieja, the latter for the production directed by Berta Martínez. He continued the decade with Los mangos de Caín (1965) and El tiempo de la plaga, in addition to the comedy Las vacas gordas. Estorino was the life partner of artist Raúl Martínez. In the 1970s, in spite of the marginalization that he suffered, like other intellectuals, due to his homosexuality, he did not stop writing. After directing an adaptation of Lope de Vega's La discreta enamorada, he wrote La dolorosa historia del amor secreto de Don José Jacinto Milanés, a literary work that required him to do complex research into Spanish colonial Cuba. At this point his output constituted an intimate journey through the intricacies of the human being as part, for good and for bad, of that social structure that is the family, the core on which Estorino focuses to look at the reality of society as a whole. This explains why many of his plays were successfully performed in theaters in Europe (Norway, Sweden, Spain) and the Americas (United States, Chile, Venezuela).

Built on the former site of an ancient temple to Athena, it was converted to a Christian monastic site, possibly as early as 382 AD. The site grew to include many structures spread over a wide area, but sometime later it was largely if not wholly abandoned. Tradition holds that it was reestablished as a Christian monastery in 1683 and that numerous miraculous healings have occurred there. Over the ages, the condition of the monastery has ebbed and flowed with the tide of wars, occupations, famines, and faltering or flourishing economies. The monastery complex includes a moderately sized, ornately decorated, Byzantine-style church, and a second small but quaint chapel. Outside, the monastery rewards visitors with scenic 360 degree vistas, made accessible by an impressive rampart that encircles the complex and enables visitors to easily walk the site perimeter. Dedicated to “Our Lady of Healing,” the monastery is primarily used to celebrate the Nativity of Mary, the feast day commemorating the birth of the Virgin Mary, which occurs annually on September 8. Greek churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary are usually called Panagia. On the feast day, hundreds or thousands of worshippers converge on the monastery from all directions, individually or in large groups, arriving by foot, donkey, car, bus, or other means. The monastery has sleeping and eating quarters for several dozen overnight visitors, but the remainder either camp outside or find other accommodations. The monastery maintains a minimal staff of one or two residents. Despite this, it is open most days and accepts visitors and tourists, welcoming even those arriving primarily for the magnificent views of the mountains, valleys, and seas below. Liturgies are held regularly, and special services and visits can be arranged on short-notice by contacting the monastery.  Name  The Greek word Panayia (Παναγία) or Panagia literally means “All Holy;” however, it is used in the Eastern Orthodox Church as a title for the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. In English, and in western Christian traditions like the Roman Catholic Church, the analogous title is “Our Lady.” The word Yiatrissa (Γιάτρισσα) comes from the Greek for “Doctor” or more generally, “Healer.” Thus, a literal translation of Panayia Yiatrissa yields “All Holy Healer,” but a more commonly understood English translation is “Our Lady of Healing,” which provides a more clear reference to the Virgin Mary. The name Panayia Yiatrissa is pronounced: pah-nah-YEE-ah yee-AH-tree-sah (/pɑːnɑː'jiːɑː jiː’ɑːtriːsɑː/)  Locale  Regional map of Panayia Yiatrissa Panayia Yiatrissa is located on the Taygetos mountain range where it juts into the Mediterranean Sea and forms the southernmost peninsula of mainland Greece, also known as the Mani Peninsula, ending at Cape Matapan (more commonly called Cape Tenaro). The monastery sits on a saddle ridge straddling the eastern and western slopes of Taygetos, with the Laconian Gulf visible to the east and the Messinian Gulf visible to the west. This location is one of few natural crossing points between the two slopes of the peninsula, and in fact the monastery sits at the boundary between the history-rich regions of Laconia and Messinia. Panayia Yiatrissa also lies on Europe’s E4 long distance hiking path, as it traverses south from Sparta, crosses Taygetos, and descends to the sea at Gythio. The Taygetos peninsula has been inhabited since Neolithic times and its archeological sites record several millennia of human history. The region was densely populated at times, sought after by numerous empires, and served as a crossroads for invaders, marauders and pirates. The population remained relatively high well into the 20th century; however, modern demographic trends and recent economic troubles have severely reduced the population. Yet, during summer months the nearby beaches on both Laconian and Messinian shores attract millions of visitors, breathing a tenuous vitality into the area. In addition to the beaches, visitors are attracted to the many historic sites and the natural beauty of the region. Yiatrissa overlooking Kastania village. The pre- revolutionary Venetzanakis tower is at center, and historic Church of the Metamorphosis at far-right Nearby Alepotrypa Cave houses one of the earliest Neolithic burial sites in Europe. Mycenean beehive tombs have been discovered adjacent to the nearby village of Arna, approximately 2.5 air-miles away (4 km). Roman era artifacts and burial sites (early centuries AD) are well known in/around the immediately adjacent villages of the Sminos municipality, the closest being at Kastania. In the 1200s, Frankish crusaders subdued the region and established a major fortification at nearby Mystras. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the collapse of the Byzantine empire, the last Byzantine emperor made Mystras his stronghold, holding out for seven years until the city finally fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1460. During the medieval era the Taygetos peninsula became known as the Mani Peninsula, and the local population became known as Μανιάτες (Maniotes), who claim to be descendants of the ancient Spartans. During the Ottoman period, the Mani Peninsula became a hotbed of rebellious activity leading up to the Greek Revolution of 1821. In an attempt to control the area, the Ottomans established new towns and posted a heavy garrison in/around the Castle of Bardounia, just below Panayia Yiatrissa. Many battles were fought within earshot of the monastery, particularly the 1770 Battle of Kastania at the Venetzanakis towers During World War II, the area around Panayia Yiatrissa was home to many resistance fighters; and then again home to partisans during the Greek Civil war.  Birth of Panayia Yiatrissa  The detailed history of Panayia Yiatrissa was described (as follows) in 1902 by the monastery’s Abbot Sofroniou Sarantopoulou, based on “factual information from multiple sources and consideration of oral tradition.” He found that a religious site had existed in different forms dating back centuries to times when Greeks believed in the twelve gods of Olympus, and that the monastery of today is located where a Temple of Athena once stood. The temple had multiple priests who maintained the sanctuary and an altar for performance of rituals. In the year 382 AD, a priest of the temple to Athena, a man named Vrasithas (Βρασίδας), traveled to the Peloponnesian city of Patras and was introduced to a new monotheistic religion, Christianity, that was burgeoning at the time. (Modern scholars would probably note that the “Edict of Thessalonica” was issued in 380 AD, making Christianity the Roman Empire’s state religion.) In Patras, Vrasithas was converted, baptized, and given the Christian name Vitalios (Βιτάλιος). Upon his return to the Temple of Athena, he convincingly preached to the other priests, who also converted to Christianity. Tradition states that these men then spread Christianity throughout the region of Laconia. The Temple of Athena was transformed into a church dedicated to “γεννέσιον της Θεοτόκου και αειπάρθενου Μαρίας,” literally “the birth of the Mother of God, the ever- virgin Mary.” Afterwards, the priests constructed a complex consisting of various buildings, eventually creating a small town spanning approximately 200,000 sq meters, the span being attested to by remnants of ancient structures that he states have been found. He notes, however, that the tyranny of time and devastating wars have left little but the coarsest materials from this period. Nonetheless, to this day, the area remains known as “καλογερικό,” meaning “a place of monks.” From this era of Christianization, circa 400 AD, to the late 1600s, a large gap appears in Sarantopoulou’s history. In fact, it is well known that this region of Laconia, the Mani peninsula in particular, resisted large-scale conversion for many centuries. Another version of the history is more consistent with this fact. According to regional lore, a well- known saint named Νίκων ο μετανοείτε, “Nikon the Repentist,” passed through the monastic complex and gained inspiration there (circa 980 AD). He then went on to traverse the remote and rugged region of Mani, where the “fiery apostle of the new religion” is credited with building many churches in the recalcitrant Mani region below Taygetos. The two versions are not entirely contradictory and perhaps both contain elements of truth. In any event, it seems clear that after some additional centuries, the monastic complex fell into disuse and perhaps complete abandonment. Sarantopoulou’s story picks up again, in 1632 AD, where he describes the legend of a local lord from the wealthy Iliofenti family of Kastania (“Chestnut town,” then known as Kastanitsa, or little Kastania), a village just below today’s Panayia Yiatrissa: > \\"Kyriakoulis Iliafentis with his wife Maria, both being 56 years of age and > having no children, were distraught and ashamed by their childlessness” (it > being a social stigma), “decided to separate themselves from the community > of Kastania and to live in isolation. With this in mind, they built a church > on the old temple site using boulders that remained. They also built a large > bridge” (in the valley below) “to the town of Arna, and donated all their > properties, to this purpose, and planned to build housing for monks to live > on the monastery site. Unexpectedly, however, the barren wife Maria gave > birth to a son the year after they built the church; and she gave birth to a > second son another year later. From them are descendant many of the > families…” (that are well known in Kastania, broader Laconia, and even > distant regions, including) “…a branch of the Stefanopouli family that > migrated to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, from which came Napoleon > the Great.\\" Sarantopoulou’s account continues on to describe a variety of other miraculous events that have occurred in relation to Panayia Yiatrissa, many related to healings. However, while it is clear that the name “Panayia” (Παναγία) may date back as far as the original temple’s conversion to Christianity (be it 382 or 980 AD), it is not clear when or why the name “Yiatrissa” (Γιάτρισσα) was first used. There is a distinct possibility that the name was associated with the original Temple of Athena, as Athena is occasionally associated with the medical arts (yiatriki, ιατρική) as well as chastity and virginity (parthenos, παρθένος), making the combination of names “Panayia Yiatrissa” a natural transition for reference to the “Virgin Mary, Healer” (alternately “Our Lady the Healer”).

Newland was baptized on 9 March 1685, the third but eldest surviving son of Sir George Newland, a wealthy scrivener of London, and his wife Rebecca Turgis, daughter of Edward Turgis, Draper, of London. In 1703, he inherited the manor of Gatton, which had control of one of the Parliamentary seats at Gatton, from Thomas Turgis, MP to whom he was distantly related. He matriculated at St John’s College, Oxford on 13 May 1703, aged 17 and was also admitted at Inner Temple in 1703. He married Martha Shepeard (died 1724), daughter of Edmund Shephard, Painter-Stainer, of Fleet Street, London on 25 July 1710. In 1711, he was called to the bar. Newland was an ardent Tory, and in 1710 provided Dr Sacheverell with a glass carriage so the crowds could see him when he was called to Parliament, and was said to have thrown money at the crowd to incite them to cheer. At the first opportunity after coming of age, Newlands was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Gatton at the 1710 general election. He was considered a ‘worthy patriot’ for helping to discover the mismanagements of the previous ministry and a ‘Tory patriot’ for opposing the continuation of the war. At the 1713 general election he was returned unopposed at Gatton and gave his attention the return of his father as MP for the City of London. However his father committed suicide on 26 March 1714, probably in a temporary fit of insanity. Newland remained active in Parliament. Newland was returned unopposed at the 1715 general election. With the change of administration, he was one of the Tories who were dismissed from the Surrey commission of the peace in 1716. He voted against the Government in all recorded divisions in that Parliament and subsequent parliaments after he was returned in 1722, 1727 and 1734. Newland died on 4 May 1738, leaving three daughters. His brother George succeeded to his Parliamentary seat at Gatton.

Other transliterations of his name used by himself include Kalužnin, Kaluzhnin and, notably, Léo Kaloujnine, predominantly used in publications pertaining to his time spent in France. Biography and education Kaluznin was raised by his mother as his parents divorced after his birth. His father, Arkadii Rubin, moved to England and was not a part of his life. His mother, Maria Pavlovna Kaluznina, came from nobility and Russian culture, especially for music and literature would become a big part of her influence. She would remain an important part of his life. They lived in St. Petersburg until they moved to Germany in 1923. The mother worked as a governess, while Kaluznin joined a secondary school in 1925, then to be graduated in 1933. He was fortunate that the high school had a very high academic basis. Kaluznin caught his love for mathematics in the school. In 1933, he entered the Humboldt University of Berlin, then left the university in 1936. The university had an important lecturer named Issai Schur who influenced Kaluznin's future interest in algebra. After this, he moved to study at the University of Hamburg, where famous mathematicians such as Emil Artin, Erich Hecke and Hans Zassenhaus lectured. Kaluznin was able to do some research and then was able to complete a theorem of Kurosh on the classification of abelian groups. Moving around again in 1938, Kaluznin and his mother moved to Paris, where Kaluznin started to study at the Sorbonne.World war II made it difficult for him to complete his studies. So he went to a vocational school to try to become an electrician. On June 22, 1941, Soviet citizens living in France were interned at a camp near Paris. This started out pretty easy and Kaluznin could still listen to lectures from other mathematicians in this camp. He even researched Galois theory, which is used to determine if certain equation solutions can be written with rational functions. Unfortunately, in March 1942, Kaluznin was moved to a concentration camp in Wahlsburg. The concentration camp was much more difficult than the internment camp back in France. Somehow his mother was able to send him food while he was at the concentration camp, otherwise he might not have survived. After the war, Kaluznin returned to Paris. He got some work translating for the Soviet Embassy in Paris but was finally able to return yet again to his mathematical studies. In 1948, he completed his thesis on Sylow p-subgroups of symmetric groups. This was probably one of his most productive period in life. He finished many papers collaborating with him, Krasner, and for even presenting at seminars. Around 1951, Kaluznin and his mother wanted to go back to USSR. The Soviet bureaucracy instead insisted that he go work in East Germany due to the shortage of technical specialist. So Kaluznin went back to Humboldt University in Berlin and did yet another thesis on Stable automorphism groups to become a full professor. Return to USSR Finally, in 1955, Kaluznin was able to return to the USSR. Various mathematicians worked on his behalf to get them a professorship at Kiev State University which he would continue until 1985. In 1957 he had to defend a third thesis related to ‘Sylow p-subgroups of symmetric groups. Complete products of groups. Generalizations of Galois theory'. He created a department of mathematical linguistics at the state university maybe due to his marriage in 1962 to linguist, Zoya Mikhailovna Volotskaya. They lived separate most of their life but did have two children. Due to his time abroad in Germany and in France, he was seen as a foreigner. In the 1970s, he had to leave a couple of the positions he had. This prevented him from going conferences abroad and had to try to do his work by mail. He focused on his students, various research projects and the new area of computer algebra. His students very much enjoyed his lectures. His son Mikhail came under government scrutiny due to Mikhail's interest in religion. This did not make things easier for his father. Kaluznin's health deteriorated and he died as a result of burns from an accident. Outside of mathematics, Kaluznin had many interests. He loved classical music, philosophy and western literature. Until 1970, he was a very heavy smoker, sometimes smoking as many as 60 cigarettes a day. Finally, on January 1, 1970, he stopped and never smoked again. He was a good dresser and enjoyed red wine and beer. Works Kaluznin's research spread wide most notably in group theory and abstract groups. He worked on the Sylow p-subgroups of symmetric groups and even mathematical linguistics. Despite not being able to go to many conferences he contributed to the application of computers in algebra. The universal embedding theorem is sometimes called the \\"Krasner-Kaloujnine universal embedding theorem\\" due to his joint proof of the theorem with Marc Krasner.

Krishna. The film is produced by Swapna Krishna under the banner RRR Motion Pictures and bankrolled by Zee Studios. It stars Sudeep, Sunil Shetty and Aakanksha Singh in the lead roles, while Kabir Duhan Singh, Sushant Singh, Avinash, and Sharath Lohitashwa play supporting roles. Pailwan marks Sunil Shetty's debut in Kannada cinema. The score and soundtrack of the film was composed by Arjun Janya. The film follows the journey of an orphan who goes on to become a wrestler and a boxer while getting into brawls with those who disrupt his personal life. Initially the film team planned to release it in nine languages, but later it settled for five languages, due to the Hindi language theatrical release. The film released on 12 September 2019, while the Hindi version opened a day later, on 13 September.  Plot  Tony Sebastian (Kabir Duhan Singh) is a renowned boxer who often resorts to dirty tactics for winning the matches. He kills his opponent towards the end of one such match, following which his coach, Vijayendra (Sharath Lohitashwa), tries to make him understand but sets out to find another student as his replacement when Tony does not listen. Vijayendra arrives at the house of a former wrestler named Sarkar (Suniel Shetty) living in Gajendragarh and learns the story of a young orphan named Krishna whom Sarkar witnessed fighting off a group of boys in exchange for helping other kids get food. This impressed Sarkar, who then adopted Krishna and turned him into a wrestler, Kichcha (Sudeep), who emerged victorious in every wrestling competition that he participated in. However, a goon mocked Sarkar during the match, causing Kichcha to fight him and his goons in a temple where Rukmini (Aakanksha Singh) noticed him. They met and fell in love, despite Kichcha's vow not to fall in love until he became a national champion. The goon whom Kichcha had beaten up turned out to be a henchman of Raja Rana Pratap Singh (Sushant Singh), an oppressive ruler of Ranasthalipura who had to be defeated in a wrestling match if Kichcha wanted to fulfill his father's dream. In the meanwhile, Rukmini's father (Avinash) opposed their marriage upon thinking Kichcha was after her wealth. Rukmini's father reported Kichcha to Sarkar, who indirectly instructed him to focus only on wrestling. With Rukmini's marriage and his wrestling match with Rana happening on the same day, Kichcha first fought off and defeated Rana. He then proceeded to marry Rukmini against her father's wishes. Kiccha also insults Sarkar, who ordered Kichcha to leave the house along with his wife, along with the wrestling tactics that he has been taught. Years pass by, and Kichcha is living with his wife and daughter (Sharvari) peacefully, often doing small jobs to make a living. On the other hand, Rana is still traumatized by the defeat and pays visits at Kichcha's house, inviting him for another match. However, despite the threats, Kichcha peacefully declines. On the other hand, Vijayendra ends up locating Kichcha and decides to meet him. Rukmini's ailing father meets Sarkar and tells him that Kichcha was not after his daughter's wealth, and that he brought her and their daughter at the hospital to meet him, thus clearing all the trouble in their relationship. However, Rana kidnaps Kichcha's daughter, and his goons beat up Kichcha when he refuses to wrestle. Seeing that he has kept his promise of not wrestling, Sarkar arrives and fights some of the goons, leaving the rest and Rana himself to be beaten up by an injured Kichcha. Rana is arrested by the police, and Kichcha reunites with Sarkar. Having seen Kichcha's fighting skills, Vijayendra asks him to train for a boxing match. Kichcha tells Sarkar that with the prize money, he wants to help the poor but talented children who are unable to fulfill their dreams due to poverty. Sarkar and Vijayendra start training Kichcha, and on the day of the match, Kichcha is initially unable to fight properly and at times ends up using wrestling techniques that are not permitted as per the rules. However, he soon starts defeating his opponents one by one, resulting in a match with Tony where the latter fights dirty and injures Kichcha using illegal moves, bringing him in a situation where low eyesight could result in disqualification. However, the doctor helps Kichcha with the vision test, and the fight resumes. Despite being injured badly, Kichcha manages to defeat Tony. After the match, Tony receives a cookie from Vijayendra's bakery as the response to a joke he had cracked earlier, and Kichcha now sets out to fulfill Sarkar's dream by entering a wrestling match.

The drug is conditionally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under application number 141-475 for use in treating canine lymphoma pending a full demonstration of effectiveness. Originally developed by Gilead Sciences as GS-9219, rabacfosadine is no longer being pursued for use in the treatment of lymphoma in humans. The active form of rabacfosadine is a chain-terminating inhibitor of the major deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases. In vitro studies have demonstrated that rabacfosadine inhibits DNA synthesis, resulting in S phase arrest and induction of apoptosis. It also inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes in dogs with naturally occurring lymphoma.  Veterinary uses  The FDA label indication is \\"For the treatment of lymphoma in dogs\\". Rabacfosadine can be used in dogs with lymphoma new to treatment and in dogs that are no longer responding to conventional chemotherapy. It comes in the form of a sterile, lyophilized powder that is reconstituted and administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Infusions are given once every three weeks for up to five treatments.  Adverse effects  Common side effects of rabacfosadine are decreased white blood cell count, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite or loss of appetite, weight loss, decreased activity level, and skin problems.

Biography Jovan Horvat's ancestors were originally from Slavonia. In the 1670s, his grandfather Marko Kurtić settled in the Habsburg Military Frontier where his family had lived since 1740 when they came as refugees from the Smederevo Sandzak. Marko distinguished himself in the Austrian military fighting ancestral enemies and earned a patent of nobility and a coat of arms from Emperor Leopold I. His son Samuil became a landowner in a village named after the family, Curtici, near Arad. In 1726 Samuil received a Nobiliary particle de Kurtić (ot Kurtić) from Charles VI after serving as governor of Waradin (now Oradea, Romania).Later, Samuil's son Jovan, born in Petrovaradin in 1722, would carry the nobiliary particle proudly as he advanced through military ranks in an Austrian infantry regiment and later in Russia where his title was also recognized. In 1751 Jovan Samuilović Horvat de Kurtić, his brother Dimitrije, and Nikola and Teodor Chorba contacted Mikhail Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ryumin, the Russian Ambassador to Austria, and requested his permission to migrate to Russia. Bestuzhev-Ryumin accepted their request on the condition that it be approved by the Russian Government. The Government not only approved their immigration but offered them and their families citizenship and employment in the Russian military. In fact, all the families of the officers who served in the Austrian military were granted citizenship and all officers were given jobs in the Russian army. While waiting for a response from St. Petersburg, Jovan Horvat, along with 281 other military officers and subalterns submitted their resignation request to the Hofkriegsrat, the Aulic War Council of Austria, so that they could be released from the Austrian military and transfer into Russian service. Their resignations were immediately forwarded to Maria Theresa, the Austrian Empress who at the time was on friendly terms with the Russian Empress, had no problem discharging and freeing them from their obligations. On the 13th of July 1751, Ambassador Bestuzhev-Ryumin received confirmation from Empress Elizabeth of Russia that Horvat and the other officers were given permission to leave for Russia and that jobs would be made available for them in the Russian military. Horvat eventually would be promoted to General and the other officers who showed equal élan achieved high ranks in the Russian military as well. Bestuzhev-Ryumin, his secretary Chemyev, Horvat and brothers Nikola, Todor and Jovan Chorba, Jovan Šević, and Rajko Depreradović set out to organize the migration in three groups. Led by Jovan Horvat, a convoy of officers and their families and others left Austria and arrived in Imperial Russia at the end of September 1751. Most of the settlements were named after the ones in their homeland. With the Empress's consent, Jovan Horvat built the foundation of the Fort of St. Elizabeth (named in honor of her Saint patroness, now located in today's Kropyvnytskyi, an administrative center of the Kirovohrad Oblast). The fort would play an important role in Russia's victory over Turkey. After the Russo-Turkish War, Lieutenant General Peter Tekeli who was the commander of all armed forces stationed in Novorossiya (formerly New Serbia and Slavo- Serbia), used the Fort of St. Elizabeth to disband the Zaporozhian Cossacks and destroy their base, the Zaporozhian Sich in 1775. In the New Serbian corpus founded in 1759 that united the regiments under his command, Horvat saw the possibility for the formation of the Serbian national core on the territory of the Russian Empire. He formed and was the head of the executive power with departments for military affairs, foreign affairs, economy, and finances, though he made many enemies along the way, namely Simeon Piščević as attested by his memoir. The Supreme Court, which he initiated and founded, was the same court that sentenced him in exile for alleged abuse of power and corruption.

Burridge was the second son. of Robert Burridge merchant of Lyme Regis, and his wife Mary. He established himself as a London merchant and shipowner, trading to the West Indies, Spain and America but kept a business interest in the West country. He married Martha, Ledgingham, daughter of Warwick Ledgingham of Ottery St. Mary Devon in 1695. His wife had inherited the manor of Ottery St. Mary in Devon and his uncle, John Burridge. settled a reversionary life interest in the manor of Thorn Falcon in Somerset on him at the time of his marriage. Burridge later bought from his father the reversion of Charmouth in Dorset. Burridge became a Freeman of Lyme Regis 1704, and obtained a political interest of his own by making a loan of £300 to the corporation and securing a mortgage on the town's waterworks. At the beginning of 1708, Burridge was one of the merchants whose complaints about shipping losses led to an inquiry in the Lords into the shortage of cruisers and convoys. At the 1710 general election he succeeded his uncle to what had virtually become the family seat at Lyme Regis. He soon made clear his Whig political allegiance by voting for the motion of ‘No Peace Without Spain’ on 7 December 1711. On 6 June 171, he told in favour of a bill to continue the Act enabling Quakers to affirm. He voted against the French wines duties bill on 6 May 1713. Marked as a Whig who was engaged in trade, Burridge also voted against the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. He was returned unopposed for Lyme Regis at the 1713 general election and voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March1714. Burridge was returned unopposed at the 1715 general election and voted with the Administration in all recorded divisions of the Parliament. In 1717 the Crown seized his estate for a debt of £2,600 for wine duties. He paid off over £1,000 by November, and intended to pay the rest in 8 or 10 months. He is mentioned in a report of the South Sea bubble inquiry as having accepted £2,000 stock from the Company on 17 March 1720 without paying for it. At the 1722 general election there was a contest and he was returned by his father who was the mayor. He became mayor himself for the year 1726 to 1727 and after a contest at the 1727 general election he returned himself. This was contrary a resolution of the House of Commons of 1685 and he was unseated on petition on 28 February 1728. On 15 August 1730, he applied to Walpole for assistance from the secret service funds on the grounds that he had served in parliament for nearly 20 years and had received little in return. He stood again for Lyme Regis at the 1734 general election, but was heavily defeated. In 1746 he petitioned George II in extravagant language, claiming that Walpole had promised him, in 1731, a further ‘secret service sum of £1,000’, which had not been paid. Burridge died without issue on 2 February1753.

The Taegeukgi protestors, or the Taegeukgi crowds (Korean: 태극기 부대) got their because they vehemently swung or wore South Korean flags (the Taegeukgi) during rallies. On October 26, 2016, the first candlelight protest was held, demanding Geun-hye to step down from office. Since then, an estimated 18 million protesters over the course of 6 months gathered in Gwanghwamun Plaza to demand the resignation and impeachment of former president Park Geun-hye. The demonstrations continued until Geun-hey was dismissed from presidency in March 2017, even after the Constitutional Court confirmed the National Assembly's call for impeachment. Public anger centered on Park Geun-hye's role in political corruption regarding his personal acquaintance, Choi Soon-sil, and her role in unlawfully intervening with state affairs and coercing conglomerates to contribute large sums of money to Choi's own foundation. Pro-Park advocates, also known as 'silver patriots' representing an older generation, believed anti-Park forces were the pro-North Korean sympathizers and manipulated by biased media. To them, what they were doing was for the protection of liberal democracy that they think they had contributed to rescue from direct communist threats in the past.  Controversies  = Conservatism = The Taegeukgi protests have been remarked as the first massive political assembly by the conservative camp after the democratization of South Korea. Taegeukgi crowds do not support Geun-hye's policy or political vision. In the 2012 South Korean presidential election, Geun-hye won with a majority 51.55% of votes. Geun-hye's party, the Liberty Korea Party, had leaned toward the conservative end of political spectrum so this attracted many conservative voters. However, when Park's change in political corruption was uncovered, 85% of Korean citizens agreed to impeach her from presidency. In addition to this, a large number of conservatives joined the pro-impeachment rallies for a long period of time, which proved that not only the liberals, but also a majority of conservative supporters of Geun-hye turned against her. The “good past” of Taegeukgi protestors had been projected through Geun-hye. Most of the key participants of the rallies were the generation that played a key role during the time of industrialization and high economic development of South Korea under the former dictator Park Chung-hee. = Taegeukgi and other flags = From demonstrations against Japanese imperial rule to the democratization movement in 1987, waving Taegeukgi elicited patriotism and strong resistance to unjust persecution. However, as Taegeukgi protestors began to vehemently swing Taegeukgi, it is more and more becoming a symbol for the extreme right-wing activism. In the 1970s, Park Chung-hee, a former dictator of South Korea as well as the father of Geun-hye, gained a number of advocates through modernization of South Korea. When Jung-hee took power through a military coup, he used Taegeukgi to legitimize his dictatorship and to a right-wing ideology. Chung-hee treated all the other dissenting voices of his policy as pro-communism and that were to be eradicated in the political arena. One thing Chung-hee actively propagated was “the Reds” (Korean: 빨갱이) which refers to an expression of hatred toward North Korean communism. Chung-hee also exploited this notion to oppress any political critiques. Waving Taegeukgi is a strategy of the extreme right Taegeukgi protestors employed to represent their own definition of patriotism, democracy and nationalism and merged it with a sense of nostalgia of their glorious past. The flags of the United States or pro- Trump slogans were also rampant during the rallies. This is because Taegeukgi crowds have faith that the US's military intervention prevented communism to override the South during the Korean War. The US flags therefore symbolize more than an ally of South Korea. To Taegeukgi protestors, the US is expected be hawk-eyed against left-wing forces and any other pro-North Korea sympathizers.  Participation  = Number of protestors = On March 1st Movement Day, the Taegeukgi rallies were held. The main organizer of Taegeukgi protests, National Rebellion Movement Headquarters to Dismiss Presidential Impeachment (Korean: 대통령탄핵기각을위한국민총궐기운동본부; in short 탄기국), reported the 15th anti-impeachment demonstration participation was over 5,000,000. This estimate had been criticized to be absurd because Seoul’s population is 9,904,312 (2015), Busan has population of around 3,500,000, Denmark has population of 5,600,000, and Norway has a population of 5,200,000. The issue of estimating participants emerged on January 13, when the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency announced not to release estimated number of participants. The police had released an estimated number of participants, but as protests with conflicting interests are held simultaneously and the participation numbers have had aroused confusion, police publicly reported not to count the numbers. Police operated a security force for safety and prevention of unexpected collisions at the protest site. The purpose of counting the number was an essential part to approximate numbers of tactical units to be dispatched. Police used the Fermi method. The Fermi method is estimating the number of people per area with an assumption that 5-6 people can fit in 3.3 square meters (1 plung). As such, the police estimate the number of people according to their internal needs, so strictly speaking, it is not the 'official announcement' of the estimated number of people. The size of the gathering is often a public concern, so the media has only made its own estimates available to the public. = Paid participants = The broadcasting network JTBC, based on the testimony of participants and leaders of pro-Park groups, reported on January 26 that pro-Park Taegeukgi crowds were paying people to attend rallies so as to inflate the number of participants. General members of the Korea Parent Federation () could receive KR₩20,000 (US$), and the pay was sometimes raised to ₩60,000 ($). Some people in financial difficulties, including the homeless, could be paid ₩50,000 ($) if they took a shower and tidied their appearance. Any young women with babies could receive ₩150,000 ($).

Consisting of four troops of cavalry, the corps was first raised in 1813 during the Peninsula War to deal with an excess of criminality and desertion in Wellington's armies. It was disbanded after that campaign ended in 1814 but was reformed in 1815 during the Hundred Days campaign. The corps also served in the subsequent occupation of France. The unit was Britain's first standing military police force. A successor unit was raised for service in the Crimean War of 1853–1856 and a permanent military police was established in 1877.  Background  By 1813 the British Army had been engaged in the Peninsula War for more than five years. Owing to the lengthy campaign it had been noted to be suffering from higher levels of desertion and criminality. In a January 1813 letter to the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Earl Bathurst the Duke of York, commander in chief of the British Army, proposed the formation of a new corps to help keep discipline. This corps, known as the Cavalry Staff Corps, Staff Corps of Cavalry or Staff Dragoons, was formally constituted by the Prince Regent in April 1813. The unit is regarded as Britain's first standing military police force and is acknowledged as the forerunner to the Royal Military Police.  Formation and service in the Peninsula  One troop of the corps was raised in Great Britain, one in Ireland and two from the army in Spain. The men were selected for their good character from volunteers from several regiments. The British troop comprised 76 men from the 2nd and 7th Dragoon Guards, the 2nd Dragoons and the 7th Light Dragoons. The Irish troop was of 68 men from the 1st and 6th Dragoon Guards, the 6th Dragoons and the 13th Light Dragoons. The troops formed in Spain together consisted of four captains, four lieutenants, two cornets, six sergeants, six corporals and 120 privates, all volunteers from cavalry regiments already in the theatre. The Spanish units were placed under the command of a Major Commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Scovell KCB of the 57th Foot. In consequence of the position the enlisted men selected received extra pay: sergeants got an extra shilling a day, corporals eight pence and privates six pence. The units were formed at Fresneda de la Sierra Tirón, initially on horses the men brought with them from their regiments until replacements could be sent from England. Scovell's orders stated that the unit was to be employed for duties similar to those carried out by the French Marechaussee (gendarmerie) and to carry out \\"the duties of the police of the army, and in others of a confidential nature\\". The unit also provided orderlies, which previously had to be supplied by the line cavalry regiments, patrolled the line of march, guarded supply depots and prevented soldiers from entering occupied towns and cities. Detachments of the corps were allocated to each division with the army in the peninsula. The unit ranked in precedence after the cavalry but before the Foot Guards. It was disbanded on 25 September 1814, following the end of the war with the signing of the Treaty of Paris.  Uniform  When first formed no official uniform was available and Staff Corps members instead wore a red scarf tied around their right shoulder as a distinguishing mark. It had originally been proposed that the corps should wear the uniform of the Royal Staff Corps (a similarly organised engineering unit) but with bearskin hats, a feature that would make them easily distinguishable from line cavalry. However the corps was eventually issued its own unique uniform. The jackets were red – similar to those worn by the Dragoon Guards; whilst the plastron (blue), girdle (striped) and overalls (with double stripes on the legs) were similar to those worn by Light Dragoons. The corps wore the light cavalry shako with a unique all-red plume and all piping and cords were in white which was meant to reflect the non- combat nature of the force. The saddle roll was marked with SD (\\"Staff Dragoons\\") and the troop letter. The enlisted men were armed with cavalry carbines.  Waterloo campaign  The Duke of Wellington reformed the corps during the Hundred Days. Three men were taken from each cavalry regiment under Wellington's command, British or otherwise, and combined into a unit of two troops. The men were granted additional pay of one franc per day. Scovell commanded the unit and was requested to bring former officers of the corps over from Britain. These officer's commissions were dated 10 August 1815. The two troops accompanied Wellington's army on the march to Paris and a further two troops were raised to serve during the occupation of France. The corps was disbanded on 24 December 1818.  Crimean War and legacy  During the Crimean War the concept of a mounted staff corps to maintain discipline was revived. The Mounted Staff Corps was formed in 1854 and served until October 1855. The men were recruited largely from the Irish Constabulary and were used to protect supplies being unloaded at dockyards, among other duties. The members of the corps wore a uniform reminiscent of the Cavalry Staff Corps: red tunics with hussar braid and blue facings; double striped black overalls and a plumed, police-style helmet. They were armed with the 1829 pattern light cavalry sword and Colt revolvers. Mounted police continued to be used on an ad-hoc basis from 1855 but were formally re-established in 1877 as the Military Mounted Police. This was supplemented by the Military Foot Police in 1882 and these two units are the direct antecedents of the modern Royal Military Police.

Hooker was the editor of the paper and Dora G. Ogle was the business manager, while Hooker and her husband, Donald R. Hooker, provided the main financial backing. Members of the National American Women’s Suffrage Association (NAWSA) could subscribe to the national Woman’s Journal (Boston) and the Maryland Suffrage News at the same time, but the Maryland Suffrage News also was available by separate subscriptions. Eventually, the JGL affiliated with the National Woman’s Party, a group that advocated for suffrage via congressional amendment, a stance that led to its withdrawal from the NAWSA.  History  The first issue of the Maryland Suffrage News was published on April 6, 1912. The newspaper quickly became the voice of the white women’s suffrage movement in Maryland, since other general circulation newspapers, such as the Baltimore Sun and local papers, did not always publish or pay attention to news related to suffrage. While the majority of subscribers lived in Maryland, the paper had a national reputation with readers in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, and California. The audience for the paper was primarily middle- and upper-class white women and their supporters. Even though the JGL published the newspaper and promoted more radical political views that were in line with Edith Hooker's own beliefs, the Maryland Suffrage News served to build a community among various woman’s suffrage interests from across the state and promote a statewide women’s suffrage movement. The Maryland Suffrage News regularly printed news and information from other suffrage organizations, such as the Maryland Women’s Suffrage League and the State Franchise League, as well as local suffrage leagues regardless of their state or national suffrage affiliations. The newspaper presented news, information, editorials, and images of the suffrage movement on the local, state, and national levels. The Maryland Suffrage News functioned not only as an educational resource for women readers, but also as a motivational force by providing practical tips on how to organize and debate the suffrage amendment. Historian Diane Weaver writes, \\"Suffrage News editors early on developed a 'Speakers Class,' and devoted columns to train suffrage advocates to speak on the connection between home, activism, and suffrage.\\" When the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, the Maryland Suffrage News ceased publication. The Maryland Suffrage News advocated for the formation of the Maryland League of Women Voters, which was organized in 1921 and soon thereafter began to publish the Maryland Voter.

Life Calcutta military orphan school, converted in 1782 from a rum distillery by William Fitzpatrick of the Bengal fund He was the eldest son of Colonel James Kirkpatrick, Madras army, and grandson of James Kirkpatrick, M.D. the author. His father was in command of the troops at Fort Marlborough, Sumatra, in 1777, and returned home in 1779. He married Katherine, daughter of Alexander Monro, by whom he had three sons—William, George, in the Bombay civil service, and James Achilles. He died at Hollydale, Kent, in 1818, aged 89. William Kirkpatrick, the eldest son, became a cadet in 1771, was appointed ensign in the Bengal infantry on 17 January 1773, lieutenant 9 April 1777, captain 3 April 1781, and major 1 March 1794. He was Persian interpreter to Giles Stibbert, who was commander-in-chief in Bengal in 1777–9 and 1780–5, and prepared a Persian translation of the articles of war (printed 1782). Afterwards he was resident with Mahadji Scindia at Gwalior, and served on Lord Cornwallis's staff as Persian interpreter in the Third Anglo-Mysore War of 1790–1. In 1793, after disputes between Nepal and Tibet, a Chinese army crossed Tibet and took up position near Kathmandu. The Nepalese sought British support, Cornwallis offered to mediate, and Kirkpatrick was sent on a mission to meet the Nepal's envoys at Patna. They went on to Nayakote, where the rulers of Nepal held court, and the British officers of the mission were the first to visit what was then an unknown mountain country. In 1795 Kirkpatrick was appointed resident with the Nizam of Hyderabad, but in 1797 was invalided to the Cape, being replaced by his brother James Achilles Kirkpatrick. In Cape Town Kirkpatrick met Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who took him back to India with him as confidential military secretary. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel 12th native infantry 1 January 1798, lieutenant-colonel commandant 8th native infantry 30 June 1804, colonel 6th native infantry 25 April 1808, major- general 4 June 1811. In a despatch dated 10 January 1802, Wellesley declared himself indebted to Kirkpatrick for help against Tipu Sultan. Kirkpatrick was appointed one of the commissioners for the partition of Mysore after the fall of Seringapatam, for which he received a sum of ten thousand pagodas. In 1801 he was made resident at Pune, but left India later that year, in poor health. Kirkpatrick died on 22 August 1812, aged 58. He was survived by his ex-wife Maria, and his Indian lover Dhoolaury Bibi, both of whom received a substantial legacy in his will. Kirkpatrick suggested and promoted the Bengal Military Fund, and helped to select the India Library that went to the India Office. His knowledge of the subcontinent was praised by Richard Wellesley, but his brother Arthur Wellesley was less impressed with the Kirkpatrick family. Works Kirkpatrick wrote Grammar of the Hindoo Dialect and an Arabic and Persian Vocabulary (1782), published with East India Company support. He translated works from the Persian, and also published a translation of the Diary and Letters of Tippoo Sultaun (London, 1804), and an Account of the Mission to Nepaul in 1793 (London, 1811). Family Kirkpatrick married Maria Pawson, a member of the Yorkshire gentry, in September 1785 after a short courtship. She subsequently accompanied him back to India. Their relationship resulted in four children, but quickly became strained and fell apart. Maria already returned to England with her children in 1788. From then on, Kirkpatrick attempted to keep contact with her, but they grew increasingly distant and legally separated in 1797. The children were consequently put into the care of William's family, whereas Maria went back to India with her new lover. In contrast, Kirkpatrick had a much longer- lasting relationship with Dhoolaury Bibi, an Indian woman. They were together from before 1777 until his marriage with Maria in 1785, and resumed their affair when his wife left India in 1788. Kirkpatrick had four daughters with Maria: #Clementina, who married Admiral Sir John Louis, 2nd Baronet; #Barbara, who married Charles Buller, M.P.; #Julia, who married Edward Strachey (1774–1832), son of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet, and was mother of Sir Edward Strachey, 3rd Baronet; and #Eliza, who died unmarried. In addition, he fathered two children with Dhoolaury Bibi who he legally acknowledged.

A coroner's report dated 29 November 1860 concerning a concealment of birth was made as follows:Inquests Taken Into Suspicious Or Unexplained Deaths For the County of Devon 1855-1864, Articles taken from North Devon Journal, edited by Lindsey Withers :On Monday last, an Inquest was held by Richard Bremridge, Esq., County Coroner, at the house of Mr John Luxton, yeoman, at Speccott, in the above parish (i.e.Merton), on the body of a new-born child there lying dead. From the evidence adduced it appears that Mrs Luxton had for some time suspected that her servant, ELIZABETH BLIGHT, was in the family way, and accused her of it, which she repeatedly denied. On Sunday morning, in consequence of information received from her niece, Frances Stevens, who slept with BLIGHT, Mrs L. was induced to go to her bed-room, where she saw appearances which induced her to believe that the servant had given birth to a child. She was questioned on the subject but stoutly denied that any such thing had taken place. Mr Luxton thereupon went to Torrington, and called in the assistance of Dr Jones, who, on going to Speccott, and examining the girl, became fully satisfied that her mistress's suspicions were well-founded. On being pressed on the subject, BLIGHT partially admitted the fact; and on a search being made the body of an infant was discovered on the dung heap near the piggeries, which was subject to post mortem examination by Dr. Jones. It was the body of a fully developed infant, 6 ¼ lbs. in weight and 20 inches in length, and appeared to have been perfectly healthy. the lungs, on being placed in water, did not float, which was an indication that they had not been inflated. Under these circumstances, the Jury returned as their verdict that the child was still-born. The woman thus exculpated from the more serious charge, will, in due course, take her trial for the minor offence of concealing the birth of her off-spring, the Coroner having given directions to that effect.

Predecessors  The encyclopedia was originally published in 1901 as Hill's Practical Encyclopedia in four volumes. The \\"supervisor\\" was Thomas Edie Hill, while the \\"editor\\" was L. Brent Vaughn. Simultaneously the set was also published as the School Library Encyclopedia, but under a different imprint. The next year both versions of the encyclopedia were reprinted, as well as a third entitled Hills Practical Library of General Knowledge. It would be reprinted under the latter name again in 1904 and 1905.S. Padraig Walsh Anglo-American General Encyclopedias 1704-1967 New York: R. R. Baker and Company, 1968 p.76 In 1907 the encyclopedia was published again as the New Practical Reference Library, this time in six volumes and published by Dixon, Hanson and Company of Chicago and New York. The staff for this edition included Charles Herbert Sylvester, William Francis Rocheleau, Kennth L. Pray, Anna McCaleb, Helga M. Leburg and Albertus V. Smith. Thomas Hill was notably absent. The set was republished again in 1911 under the imprint of Dixon, Hanson and Bellows. The editions of 1913, 1914 and 1915 were published under the imprint of Hanson-Bellows and in 1917 under the imprint of Hanson-Roach-Fowler. This was significant, because that same firm published the first edition of the World Book Encyclopedia the same year, and the two shared basically the same staff, including Ellsworth Decatur Foster. The final edition of the New Practical Reference Library was published in 1918. In 1919 the encyclopedia was acquired by Ralph Durham Company, revised and published as the American educator.Walsh pp.3, 125  American Educator  The first edition under the American Educator title was published in eight volumes in 1919. A revised edition was published in 1922 and other followed in 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, with slight changes in the subtitles and the name of the publisher. After a period of revision in 1927, new, 10 volume editions were published in 1929 and 1930. In 1931 the encyclopedia was bought out by United Educators, Inc. and the name changed to American Educator Encyclopedia, beginning with the 1932 edition. Since then the work was published under continuous revision, eschewing new editions for continuously publishing and revising the work annually.Walsh pp.3-4 In 1957 it was available in both 10 or 14 volume editions, the latter including \\"supplementary material on Nature, Recreation, Hobbies and a Study Guide.\\" This was discontinued by 1965 when the set was only available in 14 volumes without the supplements.Walsh p.4 After its final revision in 1972 the set had 20 volumes.

There were 16,000 cross references 693 maps and 12,000 illustrations, 15% of which were in color.Kister pp.27-8  Reputation  While the encyclopedia claimed to have more Nobel Prize winners among its contributors than any other in the world, its reputation was decidedly mixed. In the late 1960s it was called \\"one of the better small, family encyclopedias in the United States\\", by the time of its discontinuation it was considered a substandard compared to its competitors.Kister p. 28Walsh p.4 The sets reputation was also marred by complaints to the Federal Trade Commission about the practices of the encyclopedias vendors. These were Cease and Desist Orders Docket #3349 in 1938, #3428 in 1939 and #4554 in 1942.Walsh p.4 Despite its annual revision, the encyclopedia was often out of date due to lax and inconstant editing. The quality of the articles themselves was often superficial, incomplete or accurate. Some controversial subjects such s abortion were not mentioned at all. The cross references were erratic and there was no index, hampering the encyclopedias ease of use. The quality of the illustrations was described as \\"from mediocre to poor\\" and the psychical layout was considered \\"drab and uninviting.\\" Nevertheless, the articles were often clear and economical, and could be useful to those who could read at the junior and high school reading levelsKister p. 28  Canadian editions  The American Educator was published as the Dominion Educator in Canada in 1919.

Unless otherwise stated, this list is based on a list published by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The NPS list contains 269 species when taxonomic changes have been taken into account. Another 29 species, many of which have a very few records or only one, have been added from eBird up to July 2020. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags define some categories of occurrence. *(PP) Probably Present per the NPS (10 species) *(PP)* Probably Present per the NPS but with eBird records (17 species) *(UC) Unconfirmed per the NPS (2 species) *(UC)* Unconfirmed per the NPS but with eBird records (1 species) *(I) Introduced - a species established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention (5 species) Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. *Snow goose, Anser caerulescens (PP)* *Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons *Canada goose, Branta canadensis (PP) *Wood duck, Aix sponsa *Blue- winged teal, Spatula discors (PP)* *Cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera (PP)* *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata (PP)* *Gadwall, Mareca strepera (PP)* *American wigeon, Mareca americana *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos *Mexican duck, Anas diazi *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca *Canvasback, Aythya valisineria *Redhead, Aythya americana *Ring-necked duck, Aythya collaris *Lesser scaup, Aythya affinis *Bufflehead, Bucephala albeola *Common merganser, Mergus merganser (PP) *Ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis New World quail Order: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae The New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. *Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus *Scaled quail, Callipepla squamata *Gambel's quail, Callipepla gambelii *Montezuma quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae Pheasants, grouse, and allies Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae Phasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies.

He became the centre of a legend surrounding the acquisition by the EIC of a licence to trade freely in India and establish the first EIC factories on the banks of the Hooghly River in Bengal. According to the legend, incorrectly retold for over a century, Boughton treated and cured emperor Shah Jahan's daughter Jahanara Begum of burns after her clothing caught fire, and in return the emperor granted the EIC a licence to trade freely and to open factories. Boughton was further credited with receiving concessions from the emperor's son Shah Shuja for treating one of the prince's concubines. After being retold in a number of reputable sources mainly throughout the eighteenth century, EIC expansion in the Indian state of Bengal in the 1840s became attributed to Boughton's story. However, when later historians examined its details, some details were found to be impossible due to inconsistencies in dates and the absence of evidence that the emperor's licence ever existed. Background In the early days of the EIC, doctors frequently travelled with traders who were on their way to establish factories. In addition to medical care for themselves and their ships, warehouses, and factories, these \\"Company ship surgeons\\" were found to be useful in trading medical treatment for concessions from rich rulers. In India, EIC establishments included Bombay, Surat, Persia, Madras and the east coast, and Bengal and the Bay. Boughton was one of the early medical practitioners of this era, the others including John Woodall, William Hamilton, John Zephaniah Holwell, and William Fullerton. The English acquired a foothold in India in 1613 by establishing a factory at Surat under the reign of Jahangir and with Portuguese opposition. In 1631, by the order of Shah Jahan, the Portuguese were expelled from Hooghly, and seven years later the emperor appointed his son Shah Shuja to be Viceroy of Bengal. The capital of the province was changed from Gaur to Rajmahal in 1639. Life Boughton entered Surat in 1644 and was appointed to Asalat Khan, the paymaster general of the Mughal empire, who was keen on having the services of a European surgeon. Subsequently, Boughton travelled to Agra. Following the death of Asalat Khan in 1647, Boughton was appointed to the emperor’s son, Shah Shuja, then the governor general of Bengal based at Rajmahal. When one of the prince's concubines developed a pain in her side, Boughton was able to cure her and, according to colonial administrator John Beard in 1685, in return received exemption from duty for personal trade but not for the EIC. In 1649, Captain Brookhaven's ship from London arrived in Bengal with duty-free goods \\"upon the account of Boughton's nishauns\\", giving the British an advantage over other traders. Two years later, the British returned to establish a factory at Hooghly and obtain another exemption for the EIC. They obtained this by informing Shah Shujah that the previous privileges given by Shah Jahan were for the exemption of all duty. The legend The traditional story differs and first appeared in the second volume of Robert Orme's History of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan from 1745 with a more detailed description in Stewart's book, amongst a number of other publications. Their primary sources are likely to have been two accounts, one by EIC ship captain Thomas Bowrey and the other by John Beard. It was also reiterated in the article \\"Surgeon in India: Past and Present\\", contributed by Dodwell and Miles to the Calcutta Review in 1854 (vol. xxiii). =Appearance in India= Prior to 1639, as stated in Charles Stewart's 1813 book The History of Bengal, Sir Thomas Roe, who had been sent by James I as ambassador to Jahangir in 1615 and who remained in the Mughal courts for three years, made an entry regarding Boughton in his memoirs, when he wrote that Boughton \\"had for his dinner three hens, with rice, his drink being water, and a black liquor called cahu [coffee], drank as hot as could be endured\\". This story was found to be untrue and related to another Boughton. For many years after there is no mention of him until 1636–1637, when he appears stationed in Surat in medical charge of the EIC's ship the Hopewell, as part of the Bombay establishment. =Jahanara Begum's burns= Jahanara Begum 1635 In either 1636, 1643, 1644, or 1645, Jahanara Begum, the favourite daughter of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, was severely burnt when her clothing caught fire in an accident during a dance performance. Local healers had failed to cure her, and, at the advice of vizier Assad Khan, the Emperor requested an English surgeon. The council of Surat recommended Boughton, the surgeon of the EIC ship the Hopewell, as best-qualified for attending to the Princess and sent him to the Deccan, where the emperor had his camp. Boughton was successful in healing her and, in return, was asked to name his reward. His request was for the EIC to be granted the privilege and licence of founding factories in Bengal and of trading there freely, without the requirement to pay duty. =Sultan Shah Shuja= Shuja, Mughal Prince Thereafter, to secure and begin trading, Boughton travelled to Rajmahal, where he became acquainted with the Viceroy of Bengal, Shah Shuja, one of the Emperor's sons, and where further privileges were granted after Boughton healed a lady from the Sultan's zenana. With royal approval, Boughton sent for his EIC men, and subsequently factories were founded at Hooghly, Balasore, and Pipli. He was described \\"with that liberality which distinguishes Britons, sought not for any private emolument, but solicited that his nation might have liberty to trade free of all duties in Bengal and to establish factories in that country\\", and had therefore been credited with the beginnings of the EIC's trade in Bengal. Inconsistencies An alternative account based on evidence from the historian Firishta is given in Alexander Dow's book The History of Hindostan, from the death of Akbar to the complete settlement of the empire under Aurangzebe (1772). There is enough evidence to show that Boughton pleased his royal patients and had much \\"influence in high places\\", important enough that the legend gained popularity and was retold in reputable sources for over a hundred years, gaining its acceptance as true. The legend was first scrutinised by historiographer Sir William Foster. A number of dates have been found to be incompatible. Boughton was not near any royal residence or Agra at the time of Jahanara's injuries. On 3 January 1644, an official letter to the directors of the EIC in London, addressed by its president and council, discloses that Boughton was not sent to Shah Shuja until several years later than the legend tells. Therefore, when further royal concessions were obtained, he was not in Rajmahal as stated in the legend. In addition, Jahanara's burns occurred in 1643–1644, while Boughton's mission to Agra occurred a year later. Her burns had in the meantime been treated and cured by Hakim Anitulla of Lahore. It is also not possible to credit the founding of the factory at Balasore to the further concessions, as it had already been established 12 years before Boughton's visit to Agra. In Stewart's book, he leaves a footnote regarding the concessions given by the emperor, saying \\"I was not able to find a copy of this firman among the Indian records.\\" Death Gabriel Boughton died in India shortly after the opening of the ports.

University of Colorado Health was formed on July 1, 2012 (doing business as UCHealth since 2014), as a joint operating company between the authority and Poudre Valley Health (of Poudre Valley Hospital). In August 2012, voters in Colorado Springs approved a special election measure to allow UC Health to lease and operate Memorial Hospital. In February 2017, the system retitled itself as UCHealth. In addition to a refurbished website and logo, it added an app for patients.  Awards and recognition  UC Health has been ranked as a top hospital in the United States on several occasions. In 2012, it was listed as a Thompson Reuters Top 100 Hospital, and in 2017, it was included in a list of America’s Top Hospitals, ranked in 11 adult specialties by U.S. News & World Report. In 2018, the hospital achieved Level 1 Trauma Center Status. Also that year, the hospital received a Comprehensive Stroke Center designation.

The film stars Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, and Stanley Tucci. The Witches was originally scheduled for a theatrical release by Warner Bros. Pictures, but was later pulled from the release calendar due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was later announced that it would be available to stream on HBO Max in the United States on October 22, 2020, with a theatrical release in select markets on October 28, 2020, by Warner Bros.

Talks of a new adaptation of Dahl's novel began in December 2008, when Guillermo del Toro expressed interest in making a stop motion film. No further developments on the potential project emerged until ten years later in June 2018, when Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct and write the script. Del Toro would produce, alongside Zemeckis and Alfonso Cuarón, in addition to having a screenplay credit. The film takes place in Alabama during the 1960s, instead of the novel's 1980s England and Norway, and the boy protagonist is African American, instead of Norwegian-British like the boy in the original novel and previous adaptations. Nevertheless the adaptation was described by Zemeckis as being closer to the original novel than 1990 adaptation, directed by Nicolas Roeg. Kenya Barris co-wrote the film. =Casting= In January 2019, Anne Hathaway was cast in the role of Grand High Witch. Octavia Spencer was cast in February, with newcomers Jahzir Bruno and Codie-Lei Eastick also joining. In May, Stanley Tucci and Chris Rock were added. In September 2020 it was revealed that Kristin Chenoweth was cast in the film. =Filming= Principal photography began on May 8, 2019, with filming locations including Alabama, Georgia and at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Hertfordshire, England and Virginia Water Lake in Surrey, England. It was expected to wrap on June 25. On June 19, a crew member was stabbed in the neck on the Warner Bros. Studios set in Leavesden. = Marketing = The film collaborated with a Roblox game named \\"Islands\\" for a limited time Halloween event. It features a boss battle with the Grand High Witch, one of the main antagonists of the film.  Music  In July 2019, it was announced that Zemeckis's frequent collaborator, Alan Silvestri, will compose the film's score. Release The film is scheduled to debut on October 22, 2020, on HBO Max in the United States. It was previously scheduled to be released on October 9 then pushed to October 16, 2020, before being pulled entirely from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The road also has a number of small closes, including Brocas Close, Tobin Close, Huson Close, Briary Close and Hornby Close. Appearance The road has many large, grey brick houses, decorated with Corinthian capitals, these are from the Victorian Era and were designed by Samuel Cumming. Unlike the south side of the road, these structures were mostly undamaged from The Blitz in World War 2 (though, the east part of the road was destroyed and had to be rebuilt as part of the Chalcots Estate development). When entering from the east direction, one can see that the left side of the road is decorated by many brown and white modern, cube shaped households.

History The appointment of military commanders to administrative positions, while maintaining their military duties began in the 16th century. Voivods were appointed to Ukrainian cities with military administrative authority. The name of the Military Governor appeared only in 1801, when, following the accession to the throne of Emperor Alexander I, the Military Governors were appointed in five border provinces (Kiev Governorate, Podolian Governorate, Lithuania Governorate-General, Little Russia Governorate and Belarusian Governorate).Encyclopedia of Military and Marine Sciences / Edited by: Heinrich Leer. Volume I. Bezobravo Printing House and Comp.: St. Petersburg. 1883-1897. General provisions The Military Governor was appointed to govern a province, region, city, or fortress, and in wartime to administer an area occupied by war law. In the area under his jurisdiction, he performed both civil and military administration. The post of military governor did not consider any advisory institutions. The Military Governor was appointed and dismissed by the Highest Orders and Decrees of the Governing Senate on the proposal of the Minister of War by prior agreement with the Minister of the Interior. The Military Governors were appointed to control the regions, most of which were part of the Governorate-Generals and which were located on the border edges of the Russian Empire. Such as: Kutais Governorate, Dagestan Oblast and Kars Oblast in the Caucasus Krai; The Primorskaya Oblast, the Amur Oblast and the Trans-Baikal Oblast in the Priamursk Governorate-General; Akmolinsk Oblast, Semipalatinsk Oblast and Semirechye Oblast in the Governor-Generalship of the Steppes; Syr-Darya Oblast, Fergana Oblast and Samarkand Oblast in the Russian Turkestan. The Ural Oblast and the Turgay Oblast were governed by the Military Governors, but were not part of the Governorate-Generals; the heads of the Transcaspian Oblast and Sakhalin also have the rights of the Military Governor. The commander-in-chief of the Kronstadt port is simultaneously considered the Military Governor of the city of Kronstadt. This also includes various areas of the Cossack troops — the Trans-Baikal, Ural, Primorskaya and Amur Oblasts, where the heads of the region were the atamans of the Cossack host.Military Governor (Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary) Authority The Military Governor concentrates both civil and military control of the region. In civil administration, the Military Governor, in the performance of his duties, is guided by a provision common to the governors. In wartime, all Military Governors are subordinate to the commander-in-chief of the army, if the territory entrusted to their control enters the area occupied by the army.Sytin's Military Encyclopedia / Volume I. (Edited by Ivan Sytin): St. Petersburg. 1912. In cases of military land units, the Military Governors are subordinate to the commander of the Military district. The troops and personnel of the directorate, located on the territory under the control of the Military Governor, are subordinate to him as the head of the division. Military Governors have the right to inspect troops and military establishments in the area. The Military Governor does not interfere in the internal control and the economy of the troops if the field troops located in the regions, which have their direct command, depend on the Military Governors only for the performance of local service. The Governors-general and military governors during their stay in the capital are present in the Senate, in its general meeting and in the departments of the provinces entrusted to them.

Meldrum is a British scientist who is a Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Leeds where she works on bio-inspired materials and crystallisation processes. She won the 2017 Royal Society of Chemistry Interdisciplinary Prize.  Education  Meldrum studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 1989. She joined the University of Bath for her graduate studies, working on bio-inspired systems where she completed her PhD on nanoscale synthesis in 1992. Career and research Meldrum was appointed a postdoctoral research fellow at Syracuse University, where she worked on nanoparticle assembly with Janos Fendler. Whilst there, she contributed to the book Biomimetic Materials Chemistry. Meldrum was a Humboldt Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, working on crystallisation using surface plasmon spectroscopy with Wolfgang Knoll. She explored chemical deposition of PbS on gold using self- assembled monolayers. Following this position, she worked at the Australian National University on biomineralisation. Meldrum joined Queen Mary University of London as a lecturer in 1998. She moved to the University of Bristol in 2003, where she established new techniques to control crystal morphologies. In 2009 Meldrum was appointed as a Professor at the University of Leeds. Meldrum was awarded an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Fellowship in 2010. Her fellowship considers confined crystallisation in biological systems. She studied the crystallisation of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate and their behaviour in confined systems. She demonstrated that confinement slows crystallisation, stabilising metaphases. Confined crystallisation can be used to control the polycrystalline structure of crystals. Supported by the Leverhulme Trust, Meldrum showed that even nanoscale confinement can template crystallisation. Meldrum looks to use biology to guide crystal growth, demonstrating precipitation with mould and via an amorphous precursor phase. She also looked how water-soluble block copolymers can influence the crystallisation of barium sulfate and calcium carbonate. Meldrum's work uses nature as an inspiration for materials design. She focuses on biominerals such as bones, teeth and shells. She monitors the amorphous and precursor phases of biological crystal formation. Meldrum uses nanoparticles as additives in crystal growth, using the particle surface chemistry to tune particle occlusion. Amongst several organic additives, Meldrum has incorporated amino acids into calcite. The choice of additive is guided by genetic algorithms, resulting in the production of crystals with desired properties. She has evaluated how the surface topography impacts ice crystallisation, showing acute geometries give rise to a confined crystalline, which is followed by the formation of a bulk phase. The Meldrum group develop microfluidic devices to monitor crystallisation processes. Crystallisation is usually difficult to monitor, as precipitation occurs very rapidly and is severely impacted by impurities. Microfluidic devices offer more control of the crystallisation rate, providing reproducible conditions for crystal growth and the potential to analyse the growth in situ. Meldrum developed a Crystal Hotel to study crystallisation in a variety of environments and equilibrium conditions. Meldrum has developed a range of experimental techniques; including Bragg coherent diffraction imaging, Brewster angle microscopy, liquid-cell Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Infrared spectroscopy. =Awards and honours= Meldrum was appointed lead editor of the Materials Research Society (MRS) Bulletin in 2016. In 2017, she was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry Interdisciplinary Prize. She was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant in 2018.

He was Dean of Wiesbaden, the state capital of Hesse, at the central parish St. Bonifatius from 1974 to 1996. He served for two years at the Eibingen Abbey founded by Hildegard of Bingen. In 1999, he founded the Wiesbaden chapter of the charity organisation africa action, which provides help in health care and education in countries of the Sahel region. He was active as a priest until his death, and had traveled to West Africa to contact the partner organizations. He received Burkina Faso's highest national award, the Knight of the country's National Order, in 2016.  Early life  Born Joseph Werner Bardenhewer in Arnsberg on 30 January 1929, Bardenhewer moved with his family to Wiesbaden in 1937, where he attended the . He studied at the Philosophisch-Theologische Hochschule Sankt Georgen and in Fribourg, Switzerland. He was ordained a priest by Bishop Wilhelm Kempf on 8 December 1955.  Religious career  Bardenhewer (fourth from right) between Bishop Ambroise Ouédraogo from Maradi, Niger, and Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul with members of the board of africa action in Wiesbaden in 2011 His first position was as Kaplan (assisting priest) in Nauort from 1 January 1956. In mid-1959, he was called to the administration of the Diocese of Limburg by Alexander Stein, to serve as the Diözesansekretär of the Sozialreferat (Department for Social Affairs). From 1962, he was a priest for the Berufsschule in Wiesbaden. From 1967, he was vicar of the Wiesbaden parish St. Andreas and became its parish priest on 1 November 1968. Simultaneously, he was the dean of the section Wiesbaden-Mitte from 1971 to 1974. He co-founded an ecumenical association, Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sozialer Brennpunkt (Working group social focal point), in close collaboration with the Protestant parish of Matthäus, political parties, schools and social groups. Bardenhewer was the parish priest of Wiesbaden central Catholic parish St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, from 16 June 1974 until his retirement on 31 January 1996. The officeholder has traditionally also been dean of Wiesbaden. His focus was social work, both in the parish and beyond, the deepening of faith in services and especially a 1992 action \\"Aufbruch '92\\", and spiritual communication in several groups in the parish. He was inspired by the Second Vatican Council and named the new parish house \\"Roncalli-Haus\\" after Pope John XXIII. He was president of the local Caritas organization and on the board of . After his retirement at age 67, Bardenhewer served for two years as the Spiritual, the priest of Eibingen Abbey in Rüdesheim, which Hildegard of Bingen had founded.  Humanitarian activities  After his return to Wiesbaden, Bardenhewer founded a charity organisation in 1999, the Freundeskreis Wiesbaden, the Wiesbaden group of , which supports health care, especially fighting blindness, and education in the countries of the Sahel. The initiative came from a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment for whom Bardenhewer cared. The man had seen on TV that in Africa, eye surgery for only DM 30 (US $15) could help a blind patient to see. With the help of Caritas, Bardenhewer connected the group in Wiesbaden to the existing Ghana action. The Wiesbaden group made the building of five eye clinics in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger possible and enabled young people to study ophthalmology or train to be opticians. The fifth clinic in Mopti, Mali, was named after Bardenhewer in 2011, \\"Centre ophtalmologique Père Joseph Werner Bardenhewer\\". He published a book by the cardinal of Burkina Faso, Philippe Ouédraogo, translated into German as Gott allein genügt (God alone suffices) by Stefanie Götzmann in 2018. Bardenhewer traveled to West Africa, seeking direct contact with the institutions there, such as in 2018 to Burkina Faso. He was known there as Père Joseph. A street in the capital Ouagadougou was named after Wiesbaden to honor the help from the Wiesbaden group. In 2016, Bardenhewer was awarded the highest award of Burkina Faso, Knight of the National Order. He celebrated his 90th birthday in a monastery in Burkina Faso, as part of one of his project journeys. On 24 February 2019, he celebrated a mass of thanks at Mariä Heimsuchung in Wiesbaden-Dotzheim.  Death  Bardenhewer died on 10 April 2019 in a hospital in Wiesbaden.

He, along with Janet Rogers, make up the poetry collective Ikkwenyes. They co-produced the poetry CD Got Your Back. His artwork has been displayed at locations such as the American Indian Archaeological Institute.  Early life and career  He attended the Manitou Community College at LaMacaza, Quebec and graduated with an AFA from the Institute of American Indian Arts in Sante Fe. He also attended a summer session at the Alfred College of Ceramics and graduated from the Kansas City Art Institute with a BFA in Sculptor and Creative Writing. Jacobs worked for the Mohawk Nation newspaper and Akwesasne Notes, an international native journal, as a poetry editor from 1972-1974 and a co-editor from 1983-1986. He was involved with the founding of the community newspaper, Indian Time, and he co-founded Akwekon, a Native arts journal he also co-edited from 1985-1986. He has worked as a DJ, talk show host, news director, program director and assistant station manager for CKON, Mohawk Nation Radio. He taught art and poetry at Akwesasne Freedom School, and was artist-in-residence at the Akwesasne Museum. His art reflects his concern with both the ideal and the real. He explores what it means to be Indian and the creation of the Indian- self. As a Mohawk with land situated across the Canada and U.S. border, he comments on the meaninglessness of borders.  Poetry  Jacobs has put out two poetry collections. His first, Landscape: Old and New Poems, was published in 1984 through Blue Cloud Quarterly Press. His second, Loving... in the Reagan Era, was released in the 1990s. It is a beat-inspired autobiographical and social examination of the 1980s where Jacobs wrote about his work at a nuclear power plant, his children, Indians, Ronald Reagan's policies, and the truth about the American Dream. It relates both his personal experience and provides a cultural critique. In 1979 Jacobs did his first performance piece with an artistic band that consists of other Santa Fe artists called Tribal Dada at the Kansas City Art Institute. The purpose of the group was to create some kind of artistic movement in Santa Fe. The group also performed in 1992. Through the performances of the group, they attempted to convey what Jacobs refers to as the Indian thinking, concepts and conceptual thinking.  Visual Art  Todd Moe has likened Jacobs' art to decoupage, as he cuts fabric that came from his mother and grandmother — both quilt makers — and glues and varnishes it together into a collage. In the early days, Jacobs also used his mother's calico scraps, cigarette packaging and butter wrappers for material for his art. He created mixed media art collages portraits of Native peoples as a way of countering pop culture images and stereotypes.

Lloyd Ventrix was an ex-con who became divorced from Helen Ventrix, who had the custody of their daughter, Kimberly. Using a suit that allowed him to turn invisible that he acquired from a place he worked at on parole, Lloyd sneaked into Kimberly's bedroom and posed as her imaginary friend \\"Mojo\\". During one of these meetings, Lloyd learned that Helen and Kim were going to be moving away from Gotham soon and he did not like the idea.

Founded in 1984, the non-profit organization accommodates girls aged 6 to 18 in six main choirs and numerous satellite choirs in low-income communities. Chorus members perform locally, nationally, and internationally. The chorus has released several CDs. In 2017, the organization opened the city's first public choir for girls and boys with special needs. History The Tucson Girls Chorus was founded in 1984 by Margie Kersey, who had been working as a music teacher since 1965. The initial call for auditions attracted 63 girls, and the first concert took place in spring 1985. By 1986, choirs were performing at local events such as the Tucson Rodeo Parade and Christmas tree lighting ceremonies. The first U.S. tour took place in April 1987 in Los Angeles, California, and the first international tour was scheduled in 1999 in the United Kingdom. A choral summer camp opened in 1995. Membership in the chorus reached a high of 263 girls in five choirs by the time of Kersey's retirement in 2005. However, shortly after her departure, the organization went into decline, with staff members and board members leaving the project and membership falling to a low of 60 girls. New artistic director Marcela Molina, a native of Bogotá, Colombia, and holder of a doctorate in choral conducting from the University of Arizona, launched membership drives and also broadened the group's community outreach. The chorus regained its footing and began increasing its membership and profile. Each of the main choirs performs in a public concert in May and December. Touring takes place in the spring, with the Jubilate Choir performing in regional concerts in California, New Mexico, and Washington, and the Advanced Choir performing across the United States and also internationally, having visited France, Italy, Finland, Norway, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and China. The chorus also engages in fund- raising and community service. In January 2011, girls gathered to sing at a memorial to victims of the Tucson shooting. The Tucson Girls Chorus is a member of the Arizona Choral Arts Association. It maintains its headquarters in the George Mehl Family Foothills Park in northeast Tucson. Personnel The Tucson Girls Chorus was originally geared to girls in grades 2 through 8, but by 2003 had broadened its membership to encompass girls ages 6 to 18. Girls are divided into the following choirs: *Bumblebees (kindergarten and first grade) *Ladybugs (2nd and 3rd grades) *Hummingbirds (4th and 5th grades) *Mariposa Singers (6th and 7th grades) *Jubilate (8th and 9th grades) *Advanced Choir (9th through 12th grades) An alumni choir was formed in 2013. In 2013–2014, the organization inaugurated four satellite choirs to service girls in low-income communities. These are located in Downtown Tucson, Sahuarita, Green Valley, and on the Pascua Yaqui Reservation. Called Engagement Choirs, they offer lower tuition rates and the opportunity for rehearsals closer to home. The Engagement Choirs perform with the other ensembles at the chorus' main local concerts. In 2017, the chorus opened a co- educational satellite choir for children with special needs. Called the Tutti Choir, it is led by a board-certified music therapist who engages the children in \\"sensory-enriched music theory and vocal classes\\". The Tutti Choir is open to girls and boys in grades 2 through 8 and is the first public choir in the city servicing children with physical and learning disabilities.

It was awarded the Prix Goncourt des Lycéens that same year. The translation of the novel into English was published in 2018 by New Directions. Synopsis The novel details the trip that Michelangelo could have made in May 1506 in Constantinople at the request of Sultan Bajazet who invited him to abandon the work of the tomb of Pope Julius II in order to instead design a bridge on the Golden Horn, an arm of the sea that separates the Istanbul from the district of Pera, on the Bosphorus. Reception Julie Étienne, for Le Monde, wrote that the novel is \\"solemn and graceful at the same time [...] even if it happens to graze preciousness, and doesn't always avoid somewhat stiff lyricism and symbolism.\\" Writing for The New Yorker, Julian Lucas praised the quality of the translation by Mandell. According to literary review aggregator Book Marks, the English translation of the novel received mostly positive reviews.

Life and career  Moritz Schröter was the son of Moritz Schröter, who himself was a university professor. After his father′s death in 1867, Gustav Zeuner became the guardian of 16-year-old Schröter. After finishing the Gymnasium in Zürich, Schröter studied at the Polytechnikum Zürich, where he was awarded a diploma in engineering. From 1873 to 1876 he worked in the locomotive factory Georg Sigl in Wiener Neustadt. He then returned to Zürich, to become the university assistant of Georg Veith. In 1879, Schröter became a professor of theory of machines at the Polytechnikum München, where he built a new laboratory for machine design. From 1908 to 1911, he was the Polytechnikum′s headmaster. Schröter helped designing four important machines in engineering history: the refrigerator (1887), the steam superheater (1894/1895), the Diesel engine (1897), and the steam turbine (1900).

Design and development The Kondor D 1 was an unequal span single-seat biplane of wooden construction, powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine and armed with two LMG 08/15 Spandau machine guns. The D 1 had a single spar lower wing with V interplane struts, similar to Nieuport 11 practice. The first flight of the Kondor D 1 occurred in the autumn of 1917, but test flights showed it to be underpowered and Walter Rethel, with Paul Ehrhardt, developed an improved version of the design, the Kondor D 2, which Rethel completed after Ehrhardt retired due to ill health. Confusion reigned after the second D-type competition at Aldershof because the Idflieg referred to the two Kondor D 2 prototypes as the D.I and D.II during the competition, which were actually fictitious designations.

Seriya 1. Matematika. Mekhanika (6) (1995), 108-109..  Life  Feldman was born on 26 November 1918 in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast of southeastern Ukraine. He entered in 1936 the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics at the University of Leningrad where he specialized in number theory under the supervision of Rodion O. Kuzmin. After his graduation in 1941, Feldman was called up by the army and served from October 1941 until the end of the World war II. For his service, he was awarded the Order of the Red Star, the Order of the Patriotic War (second class), and the medals \\"For the Capture of Königsberg\\", \\"For the Defence of Moscow\\", Medal \\"For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945\\". After his demobilization, he started his PhD in 1946 at the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Moscow, under the supervision of Alexander O. Gelfond, and he presented his Ph.D. thesis in 1949. In 1950, he became head of the Department of Mathematics of the Ufimsky Oil Institute, where he was assigned until 1954. He lectured at the Moscow Geological Prospecting Institute from 1954 to 1961. From September 1961 Feldman worked at Moscow State University, first in the department of mathematical analysis, and then in the department of number theory. In 1974 he became Doctor of Science. Feldman got full professorship in 1980. Feldman died on 20 April 1994.  Work  Feldman obtained important results in number theory. His main research area were the theory of Diophantine approximations, the theory of transcendental numbers, and Diophantine equations. In 1899, French mathematician Émile Borel strengthened the famous theorem of Charles Hermite that proved in 1873 the transcendence of the number ' without having been specifically constructed for this purpose. Later different estimates of the measure of transcendence were considered for other numbers too. Feldman's mentor Gelfond obtained his most famous result in 1948 in his eponymous theorem, also known as the 7th Hilbert's problem: : If α and β are algebraic numbers (with α≠0 and α≠1), and if β is not a real rational number, then any value of αβ is a transcendental number. In 1949, Feldman further improved Gelfond's method to estimate of the measure of transcendence for logarithms of algebraic numbers and periods of elliptic curves. Of special importance is his result from 1960 on the measure of the transcendence of the number \\\\pi.

Design and development The Kondor D 2 was a basically a redesign of the D 1, which had proven underpowered in flight tests. Like the D 1, the D 2 was a single-seat biplane of wooden construction, powered by an Oberursel Ur.II rotary engine and armed with two LMG 08/15 Spandau machine guns. However, the D 2 differed from its predecessor in having equal span wings with a two-spar lower wing with parallel inter-plane struts. The first flight of the Kondor D 2 took place in May 1918, in time for the second D-type competition at Aldershof in June 1918. Oberleutnant Hermann Göring praised the aircraft's flying qualities, but criticised the poor performance, consequently the D 2 was not ordered into production. Confusion reigned after the competition, up to the present day, because the Idflieg referred to the two D 2 prototypes as the D.I and D.II during the competition, which were actually fictitious designations. The first D 2 prototype had ailerons on the upper wings, while the second D 2 prototype had ailerons on both upper and lower wings.

She was also involved in the founding and implementation of the Vienna Settlement Movement, serving in various capacities on its board from 1901 to 1932. Early life Friederike Mautner von Markhof, known as \\"Fritzi\\", was born on 20 December 1872 in , a village near Vienna, in Austria-Hungary to Karoline \\"Charlotte\\" (née Biehler) and Georg Heinrich Mautner von Markhof. Her father's , originally from Smiřice in Bohemia, were involved in brewing, and her grandfather, was knighted for his development of a method to industrially produce compressed yeast. Her father expanded the brewery, which became the third-largest distillery in Europe, opening a yeast and brewing factory in Floridsdorf in 1864 and another in 1893. Mautner von Markhof grew up in the wealthy, assimilated Jewish family, known as much for their philanthropy as their entrepreneurial endeavors. On 21 June 1894, she married Luther (Dr. Ludwig) Mekler von Traunwies, a Procurer for the Lower Austrian Financial Ministry, who died in Baden on 2 September 1901. Activism In 1901, Mekler von Traunwies, joined with founders, Marie Lang and Else Federn, and other interested women like Marianne Hainisch, Betty Kolm, Grete Löhr, Baroness Amelie von Langenau, and in the establishment of the . Based on the model of the Passmore Edwards Settlement in London, the society aimed at uplifting the poor and provided a kindergarten, meals, medical clinics and theatrical evenings for children and their parents. By 1903, Mekler von Traunwies was serving as president of the Vienna Settlement Society and would hold the post for the next four years. She attended the 2nd Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance held in Berlin in 1904, which was its organizational meeting and joined the association as one of the founding members. In 1905, she married , a divorcé with a young son, Friedrich G. Zeileis. The newly constituted family moved into an apartment at #7 Reichsratstraße and Zeileis developed a strong bond with her new step-son. In turn, her family influence was instrumental in helping Valentin make the business contacts he needed. She continued her involvement in the suffrage movement, translating for Carrie Chapman Catt on a trip to Vienna in 1906. Catt and Aletta Jacobs made the trip to Austria after the Copenhagen Conference of the IWSA to discuss women's rights with Austrian feminists. In 1907, she remained active in the (Federation of Austrian Women's Organizations), but stepped down as president of the Vienna Settlement Society, taking over the post as vice president. She would remain the vice president until 1920. Gallspach Castle In 1912, Zeileis' husband Valentin bought the from his friend Hugo Seyrl, a brewery owner. For eight years he commuted between Gallspach and Vienna, renovating the castle into a health spa. When the Austrian legislature passed a law in 1919 making all uninhabited castles subject to government expropriation, Valentin permanently settled his family in Gallspach. Though Zeileis was no longer living in Vienna, she remained active in the settlement society, serving as both a member or on its board through at least 1932. Death and legacy Zeileis died in 1954 (May 4th) in Gallspach.

It grows in sites which alternate between hot, dry summer conditions and snow cover in winter. Epilobium nivium grows in small, isolated colonies where it typically forms the dominant species in its microhabitat. This species is only known to grow from cracks in rock outcrops and associated talus where there is essentially no soil development. E. nivium is known to grow on mafic igneous rock, and it may be entirely restricted to such substrate.California Natural Diversity Database element occurrence records for Epilobium nivium https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Data/CNDDB/Maps-and- Data The Snow Mountain area is composed of late Jurassic age undersea volcanoes which erupted from the ocean floor. Mountains in this area are composed chiefly from flows of finely crystalline basalt. These rocks are more resistant to erosion than surrounding rocks, which is why after later uplifting they remain as some of the highest peaks in the vicinity. Other rocks which eroded more quickly left the volcanoes exposed. Snow Mountain area shows signs of Pleistocene glaciation. These are the most southerly glacial features known in the Coast Ranges.Brown, R. & F. Federspiel. Snow Mountain Wilderness Study Area, California.

Mineral resources of the Snow Mountain Wilderness Study Area, California. US Geological Survey Bulletin 1495. https://books.google.com/books?id=XznwAAAAMAAJ Epilobium nivium sites outside of the Snow Mountain Wilderness are typically mapped as mesozoic metavolcanic rocks or as portions of the Franciscan Complex, which is a mix of rock types including mesozoic sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.Jennings, C. et al. Geologic Map of California, 2010 edition. California Geological Survey. Geologic maps of the Castle Peak area show those rocks are mostly sedimentary, specifically radiolarian chert and metagraywacke. There are only a few reports of E. nivium near Castle Peak. It is unclear whether the species has been found there on sedimentary rock. However, there are occasional intrusions of diabase in this area, so E. nivium may be restricted to outcrops of mafic igneous rock on Castle Peak.Blake, M. & A. Jayko. 1983.

Most of the known sites are near trails or roads. Much of the high-elevation rock outcrops within the known range are in wilderness areas with limited accessibility.

Outside of being default poses in animation software, T-poses are typically used as placeholders for animations not yet completed, particularly in 3D animated video games. In some motion capture software, a T-pose must be assumed by the actor in the motion capture suit before motion capturing can begin. As an Internet meme Starting in 2010 and resurfacing in 2017 the T-pose specifically has become a widespread Internet meme due to its bizarre and non sequitur appearance, especially in video game glitches where there would otherwise be an animation. In a prerelease video of the game NBA Elite 11, the demo was filled with glitches, notably one unintentionally showing a T-pose in place of the proper animation for the model of player Andrew Bynum.

Gorcenski was a counter-protester at the Unite the Right rally in 2017, and subsequently created the site 'First Vigil' to track the trial information of white nationalists.  Early life and education  Emily Gorcenski grew up in Columbia, Connecticut. Gorcenski is a transgender woman.  Activism  = Unite the Right = In August 2017, Gorcenski was a counter-protester at the Unite the Right rally in her city of residence of Charlottesville, Virginia. At the August 11 \\"torch\\" rally, she was sprayed in the face with pepper spray by white supremacist Christopher Cantwell, who pleaded guilty to charges of assault and was barred from Virginia for 5 years, and was also attacked by Atomwaffen Division member Vasillios Pistolis. In the wake of her assault at the rally, Gorcenski and one other counter-protester pressed charges against Cantwell, who in turn filed a federal lawsuit against them. In response, Gorcenski and her co-defendant counter-sued Cantwell. In the lawsuit, Gorcenski was repeatedly misgendered by both Cantwell and his attorney, Elmer Woodard. Woodard's motions to have the court refer to Gorcenski by her pre-transition name (and for the court to use male pronouns) were both denied. Both lawsuits were settled in 2018 with a mutual release of claims. Due to her public opposition to the rally, Gorcenski was harassed online and doxed. She told The Intercept that she had been victim to transphobic harassment from before the rally in Charlottesville. Gorcenski was swatted in October 2017 after the rally's organizer Jason Kessler reportedly doxed her. Kessler was subsequently arrested, though charges were dismissed when new evidence showed Kessler did not control the account that posted Gorcenski's address. In 2018, due to safety concerns, Gorcenski left Charlottesville for Berlin, Germany, where she now resides. = Digital activism = Gorcenski's experiences at Unite the Right led her to use her skills as a data scientist to help identify and dox white nationalists and members of the alt-right engaged in criminal activity. Gorcenski created the website 'First Vigil' to track the trial information of white nationalists and associated individuals. The site uses court documents and other public records. Gorcenski was named one of the fifty most influential feminists in 2018 by Bitch magazine for her work in creating First Vigil. In 2016, Gorcenski criticized the ethics of a study by an independent researcher who released the private information on approximately 70,000 users of the dating website OkCupid. The study in question was widely panned for being unethical, racist, and a breach of user privacy. Gorcenski covered the issue in a discussion with Sarah Jeong at Mozfest in 2017. Gorcenski sometimes speaks about the ethics of emerging technology, such as consumer internet of things devices. In 2016, Gorcenski explored software quality controls for electronic voting machines, expressing concern for the apparent lack of mandatory standards. During the George Floyd protests in 2020, Gorcenski launched whentheycamedown, a people's history project to document the removal of statues of historical figures aligned with white supremacy and colonialism.  Writing  Gorcenski is a sporadic political opinion writer. After president Donald Trump controversially stated that there were \\"very fine people on both sides\\" at the Charlottesville rally, Gorcenski wrote an op-ed for The Guardian where she argued that his speech demonstrated his unwillingness to criticize neo-Nazis, which emboldened white supremacy. Her criticism extends at times to the Democratic Party, where she takes issue with what she perceives as the exploitation of the terror attack at Unite the Right for political gains.

The novel was originally published in Polish as Król kier znów na wylocie in 2006 and was translated into English by Phillip Boehm as Chasing the King of Hearts in 2013. It follows the life story of Izolda Regensberg during the Holocaust in vignettes, short chapters often less than a page long.  Plot  Living in Warsaw, Poland around 1940, Izolda and her family witness the city transform into a ghetto created to contain Jewish citizens. After she marries a Jewish man named Shayek, they escape the Warsaw Ghetto and obtain fake Polish identities as the Pawlicki’s. While Izolda stays in the Hotel Polski while visiting her friend Jurek, Germans surround the hotel and arrest everyone, Poles and Jews alike. She is sent to Pawiak as a Pole, where she witnesses many Jews murdered, including Shayek’s mother. Eventually, she is released from Pawiak as a non-Jew, and is reunited with her husband. However, Shayek is found to be a Jew while working in Krakow and is sent to Auschwitz. When Izolda finds out where her husband is, she begins working as a smuggler to send Shayek packages of food and supplies until he is transferred to Ebensee, a subcamp of Mauthausen. She travels to Vienna in attempts to gain information about how to rescue her husband from Mauthausen, but she ends up being arrested by the Viennese Gestapo and tortured until she reveals that she is a Jew. She is then sent to Auschwitz but is transferred to Guben by persuading Dr. Mengele that she has nursing experience. She escapes Guben and returns to Vienna where she begins working at a military hospital for the German army. When the Soviet army captures the city, they realize that Izolda is a Jew, so they help her to get across the American front to rescue her husband from Mauthausen. She finally reaches her King of Hearts, but a few years later, after having a few children together, Shayek ends up leaving Izolda, consumed by guilt that his entire family died except for him. The story ends in the 21st century in Israel with Izolda telling her family stories of her struggles in the Holocaust.  Characters  * Izolda Regensberg (Polish Alias - Maria Pawlicka) is the main character of the story. Her determination and strength are emphasized in her struggle to reunite with her husband. * Yeshayahu Wolf, known as Shayek by his wife Izolda, is the King of Hearts. He is taken captive early in the story and is the focus of the protagonist’s journey. Throughout the story Shayek is presented as a man overwhelmed by guilt who believes he does not deserve to live. * Lilusia Szubert is a Polish friend of Izolda who gives her the fake identity of Maria Pawlicka, dyes her hair blonde, and teaches her how to act as a Pole. * Terenia is the sister of Lilusia and a fortuneteller. She gives Izolda a tarot card reading with Shayek representing the King of Hearts, giving Izolda a goal to chase after. * Jurek Szwarcwald is introduced as Izolda’s first love before she meets Shayek. He introduces her to Bolek before he and his wife flee Poland. * Bolek is a Polish construction manager working in the Warsaw Ghetto by day and smuggling out Jews by night. He helps Izolda get Shayek out of the ghetto.  Historical context  The majority of this novel takes place in Poland during the 1940s. During this time, anyone found out to be Jewish was taken away to concentration camps in the horror known as the Holocaust. Many of these camps and German prisons are present throughout Chasing the King of Hearts. The first German camp introduced in the novel is the Pawiak Prison in Warsaw, Poland. Over 37 thousand Jews were executed here, including Shayek’s mother. Following Izolda’s stay in this prison as a Pole, her husband is abducted out of Krakow, presumably during the liquidation of Krakow in 1943. Thousands of Jews who were taken during the liquidation were taken to Auschwitz. Mauthausen and Auschwitz were two of the biggest concentration camps created for the Jews and are both present in Chasing the King of Hearts. Shayek and Izolda both spend time in Auschwitz and Shayek is sent to a sub-camp of Mauthausen, Ebensee. Ebensee was a labor camp to construct tunnels for Germany, so survival here was much more likely since there were not exterminations as in many others. Izolda and Shayek are reunited after Ebensee’s liberation in 1945. Other historical sites are referenced during the book including Izolda’s brief stay at the Viennese Gestapo, The Hotel Metropole. It is here that she learns of the Warsaw Ghetto and is taken away to Auschwitz as a Jew, most likely taking place around early 1944, between the time of the Warsaw Uprising and the hotel’s destruction.

Correct answers are worth 10 points each, and the team receives an additional 50 points if all three members answer correctly. Each team plays two questions in this round. =Round 2= This round is played in the same manner as the first round, except that the question values are doubled (20 points per individual correct answer, and 100 bonus points if all three players are right). =Round 3= In this round, the questions are given without multiple choice options. Each team confers and writes down their answer. The team that chose the category is given the first opportunity to reveal their answer. Unlike the previous rounds, the opposing team can steal the points with a correct answer if the first team is wrong. Each team's first question is worth 200 points, and their second question is worth 400 points. At the end of this round, the team with the most points wins the game and plays the bonus round for $10,000. If at any time either team cannot catch up, the game ends immediately. In the event of a tie after the third round, the team captains are given one multiple choice question. Buzzing in with a correct answer wins the game, while a wrong answer loses the game. =Bonus round= The winning team plays the bonus round for $10,000. The game begins with the first player at the central podium. Fatone asks a series of questions, each with three choices. The player must answer without conferring with his or her teammates. As long as the player continues to answer questions correctly, he or she stays at the podium. If the player answers incorrectly, he or she is eliminated from the round, and the next player in line comes up to the podium. In addition, the team may pass one question during the round without penalty. If the team answers seven questions correctly before all three players are eliminated, they win $10,000 plus the $1,000 from the main game for a total of $11,000. If not, they win $1,000.

The Romanesque Revival Union Block was designed by John E. Tourtellotte and constructed in 1901, and the Renaissance Revival Montandon Building was designed by J.W. Smith and constructed in 1908. Also known as the Fidelity-Union Block, the buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1979. With Union Block The Union Block a 2-story, brick and sandstone commercial building with 126-ft frontage on Idaho St and 120-ft depth between Idaho and Bannock Sts, constructed by contractors Walker & Jensen in 1901. The building includes space for five storefronts, and the second floor was designed for 21 offices and for a 55-ft by 120-ft meeting room and music hall. Original commercial tenants of the building included the O.K. Grocery Co., Beal Furniture, Regan Mercantile Co., and Idaho Hardware & Plumbing Company which expanded into the Union Block from their adjoining building. The music hall was leased by Professor Christensen's Dance Academy. Montandon Building The Montandon Building is a 2-story, brick and sandstone commercial building designed by J.W. Smith and completed in 1908. August F. Montandon had owned the northeast corner lot at N 8th St and W Idaho St since 1899, and Montandon buildings were demolished to build the new Montandon Building, constructed to house the Anderson-Blomquist Department Store, later known as George A. Anderson & Co. The Montandon Building is a combination of two commercial buildings, the corner building constructed in 1908 and an earlier 2-story building on Idaho St that was the location of Idaho Hardware & Plumbing Co. A second floor was added to the hardware building in 1901 in order that the facade more closely conform to that of the Union Block. The NRHP nomination form indicates that the second floor was added in 1908. During construction of the Union Block, Montandon's planning for the Eighth and Idaho corner included either a 3-story or a 4-story building that conformed in style to the 2-story Union Block design. In August, 1901, Montandon had settled on a 3-story building, and he contracted for delivery of 500,000 bricks. Montandon's plans changed again before 1902, and he finally constructed 1-story, wood frame buildings with a sandstone facade at the Eighth and Idaho corner, adjacent to Idaho Hardware & Plumbing Co. Montandon's wood frame buildings were demolished in 1908 prior to excavating the corner for the Montandon Building. The Telephone Building on Main St in Boise was briefly known as the Montandon Building in 1900. Montandon had purchased property adjacent to the Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone Building, built in 1899, and in 1900 he constructed an adjoining building and combined both buildings behind a common facade of finished sandstone.

His trading house mainly traded on the Danish West Indies. He was also part of the management of the marine insurance company De private Assurandeurer and director of the Bank of Denmark. As a liberal politician, he was involved in the work for a free constitution and a co-founder of the Free Press Society (Trykkefrihedsselskabet). He was a member of Copenhagen City Council from 1840 and its chairman from 1841. He lived in the now listed building at Kronprinsessegade 28 from 1812. Early life and education Hvidt was born in Copenhagen, the only son of textile merchant and later royal agent Niels Nielsen Hvidt (1738–98) and Anna Beata Schwindt (1739–1808). He graduated from Borgerdyd School in 17191 and then studied theology at the University of Copenhagen from 1791 to 1795. He then worked as a house teacher for district governor C.L. Scheel-Plessen at Lindholm. Career Hvidt took over the family's trading house when his father suddenly died in 1798. The trading house thrived under his management but was hit hard by the war with England. Hvidt intended to study law but was instead employed as an exchange commissioner (børskommissær) in 1809. He was appointed as member of several commissions and had a significant influence on the important veksellov of 1825. Gvidt revived his trading house in 1816. The company mainly traded on Saint Croix in the Danish West Indies. After a few years he had restored his position as one of the largest ship-owners in the country. Hvidt acquired Denmark's first steam vessel Caledonia in 1821 and a few years later commissioned the first steam vessel built in Denmark from Jacob Holm's shipyard. Hvidt was also active in the insurance market. In 1830–35, he was a member of Bank of Denmark's board of representatives and was from 1835 and until his death one of its two commercial directors. Hvidt was also a member of Københavns Sparekasse's board of directors. He was a member of Grosserer- Societetet's committee from 1817 and was in 1842 elected as its president. He was appointed as curator of vajsenhuset in 1821 and was a member of ;missionskollegiet in 1838–54. Politics In the 1830s and 1840s, Hvidt was a central figure in the liberal movement. He was elected as a member of De Oplyste Mænds Forsamling in 1832 and was vice president of the Procincial Assemblies (' Stænderforsamlingerne) in 1835–36, 1840 and 1842. Hvidt and professor J.F. Schouw instigated the foundation of Trykkefrihedsselskabet in 1835. He was also a co-founder of Den Slesvigske Hjælpeforening in 1844. Hvidt was elected for Copenhagen City Council in 1840 and served as its president in 1841–53. He was appointed as Minister Without Portfolio in the so-called March Cabinet and was involved in the drafting of the government's proposal for a democratic constitution. He was a fairly passive member of the Danish Constituent Assembly. Personal life Kronprinsessegade 28 Hvidt married Wilhelmine Therese Lorck (28 May 1782 - 17 June 1852) on 20 August 1800 in Memel. She was a daughter of the Danish consul Lorentz Lorck (1743–1805) and Catharine Elisabeth Rohrdanz (1752–1831). Rendering of the L N.

It is used by at least two deaf people – one in each of two different communities – and their family and friends, but not by the community as a whole. There are reported to be about 100 signers, but statements of numbers this high are not likely to be accurate. There appear to be many Mehek families with deaf members. Signs are not standardized, and vary significantly between deaf individuals, with many signs being ad hoc. This suggests multiple instances of home sign and perhaps a contact pidgin rather than a coherent language. Other than pointing and holding a flat hand above the ground to indicate various people's heights, Hatfield (2016) found only thirty sign that were consistent between utterances and between signers, and most of these are highly mimetic, some full-body signs, rather than simply iconic hand signs as in developed sign languages. One sign even involves touch the hands with the feet. Signing involves a great deal of pointing and repetition, and the repetition \\"often takes a variety of forms\\". However, the system does include an apparent topic- comment construction, with a \\"preparatory clause\\" that sets the stage for what will be described, unlike what is found in spoken Mehek. For example, for 'a man and a woman fought', the signer will indicate the relative heights of the participants before signing 'man' (pat shoulder), 'woman' (pat head or make fists for breasts) and 'fight' (slap one's face).Adam Hatfield (2016), A grammar of Mehek, p. 400–404.

Education and career Coppersmith was born on March 18, 1957 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania; her parents were a lawyer and a piano teacher. She majored in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating in 1978. After a year of study as a Churchill Scholar in applied mathematics at the University of Cambridge, she went to Cornell University for additional graduate study, completing a doctorate in physics there in 1983. Her dissertation, Dynamics of an Incommensurate Harmonic Chain, connected the theory of dynamical systems to condensed matter physics, and was supervised by Daniel S. Fisher. Fisher was at Bell Labs at the time, and Coppersmith herself did most of her doctoral research at Bell Labs, so the official chair of her doctoral committee was instead N. David Mermin. After postdoctoral research at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Bell Labs, and Princeton University, she joined the staff at Bell Labs in 1987. She moved to the University of Chicago in 1995, to the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2001, and to the University of New South Wales in 2018. Research Coppersmith's research has included such varied topics as the way seashells stack together on the beach, the folding patterns of thin gold sheets, the crystalline structure in layers of mother of pearl, the propagation of forces within granular materials, the relation between the atomic structure of materials and their bulk strength, and the design of nano-scale devices for quantum computing.

In these roles, he is an employee of Virgin Galactic, a private spaceflight company which is developing sub-orbital space tourism flights. On 13 December 2018, Stucky and co-pilot Frederick Sturckow flew VSS Unity VP-03, a Virgin Galactic test flight which reached an apogee of . This surpassed the United States convention for the boundary of outer space, (), but fell short of the Kármán line (), the internationally recognized boundary. The flight was notable as an uncommon example of a high-altitude flight with an apogee falling between the two altitudes; other examples include eleven flights of the North American X-15 and Soyuz MS-10, an aborted spaceflight which had occurred weeks earlier. Stucky is an accomplished aviator with experience in military, commercial, and experimental flight. Early life Mark Stucky was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Paul and Lidia. He lived in Salina, Kansas during his childhood, where Paul taught physics at a local college. Stucky's interest in aviation dates to 1974, when he began hang gliding off of cliffs. He aspired to be a pilot and astronaut, goals which could be realized through entrance into military service. However, Paul was a Mennonite who believed in pacifism, and forbade his son to join the military. Stucky's interest in hang gliding led to a design project which resulted in a scholarship to study at Kansas State University; he graduated in 1980 with a B.S. in Physical Science. Stucky's desire to become a pilot was strong enough that he joined the United States Marine Corps, against his father's wishes. Career Stucky received flight training and performed test flights under the auspices of various branches of the armed forces, including the Marines, the Navy, and the Air Force. He flew the F-4 Phantom and \\"all models of\\" the F/A-18 Hornet. During the first Gulf War, Stucky flew several combat missions. Following the war he continued his education, completing an M.S. in Aviation Systems at the University of Tennessee. In 1993 Stucky was hired by NASA as a test pilot. He left the organization in 1999, citing disappointment over a dearth of piloted research projects. He took work as a civilian commercial pilot for United Airlines until 2003 when he re-entered the military, now in the Air Force. Stucky returned to duty in the Middle East, this time in the Iraq War. While there, he followed news of a private spacecraft which had made sub-orbital flights: in 2004 SpaceShipOne, designed by Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites, flew into space three times. Stucky considered that there might be other avenues for becoming an astronaut. SpaceShipOne's success prompted Virgin Group magnate Richard Branson to found Virgin Galactic and partner with Rutan for the development of a sequel craft, SpaceShipTwo, to be used by the new company. In 2005 Rutan and Branson co-founded The Spaceship Company, a further manufacturing entity expressly intended to supply Virgin Galactic with a fleet of SpaceShipTwo craft. Stucky returned from the Iraq War in 2007 and moved to Nevada, still in the employ of the Air Force, engaged on a classified project. He reached out to Scaled for a job opportunity and was hired as a test pilot in 2009. The first instance of SpaceShipTwo, the VSS Enterprise, made its first flight in 2010; Stucky piloted several test flights of the craft until its catastrophic breakup in 2014. Despite severe criticism following the disaster, Virgin Galactic continued development of its program; Stucky was hired directly by Virgin Galactic as a test pilot in 2015, as part of restructuring. During this period he also served as president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots for a one-year stint, the normal term of the organization's leadership. In 2016 Stucky piloted the first free flight of the second SpaceShipTwo craft VSS Unity, following release from its companion mother ship, the White Knight Two-class VMS Eve. VSS Unity VP-03 On 13 December 2018, at an altitude of 43,000 feet, the VMS Eve released the VSS Unity for its fourth powered test flight. Lead pilot Stucky and co-pilot Sturckow flew Unity at a maximum Mach of 2.9 to a maximum altitude of 82.7 kilometers, thereby surpassing the 50-mile limit used in the United States to denote the limit of space, but falling short of the Kármán line. Both craft landed safely afterwards. The flight was publicized online in various tweets by Virgin Galactic, Branson himself, and related personnel. Per the U.S. convention the flight was the first human spaceflight beginning in the United States since STS-135, the final flight of the Space Shuttle in 2011. Personal life Stucky is divorced from his first wife Joan with whom he has three children including a son, Dillon, and daughter, Sascha. He has remarried to a second wife, Cheryl Agin.

Constructed in 1997, Novar was of the earlier developments of Scottish on-shore wind generation. It provided a significant contribution to the local economy during construction and through its Community Benefit Fund. In 2010 an additional 16 turbines were constructed taking the yearly generation capacity to 53.8 megawatts.  Location  Novar Wind Farm is made of two sites located on the Novar estate, 5 miles (8 km) north-west of the village of Evanton and 5.5 miles (8.8 km) west of the town of Alness. 6 miles (10 km) to the south-west lies the Munro Ben Wyvis which is a National Nature Reserve and is a height of 1046 m (3431.7 ft). The land is predominately heath land covered in heather but is also used for grazing for sheep. Gravel access roads were built to allow the construction and maintenance of the site.  Construction  Novar A was built and commissioned by Npower (United Kingdom) in 1997 with x34 500 kW Bonus (Siemens) turbines being connected to National Grid (Great Britain). Between 1997 and 2010 ownership changed hands several times until Ventient Energy took it on. In 2010, RWE began construction began to expand the site with the addition of 16 larger 2,300 kW Enercon turbines. In September 2012, The Energy Minister for the Scottish Government, Fergus Ewing officially opened the new site. This increased the generating capacity from 17 megawatts to 53.8 megawatts.  Community Benefit Fund  As with many wind farms in Scotland, a Community Benefit Fund was set up. The fund is a contract whereby the operator agrees to pay a fixed amount to local communities per megaWatt generated. In this case RWE Innogy who currently operate Novar Wind Farms have agreed to pay £2000 for every megawatt Novar generates. The money is split between the local community councils of Kiltearn, Ardross, and Alness who then decide how the funds are spent. Often the funds go to local schools for items such as books and toys, or towards helping community groups with funding.

It was founded and is published by the German artist Andreas Müller-Pohle. History European Photography first appeared in 1980 as a quarterly magazine in German and English. Each issue focused on one particular theme and also reported on international photo initiatives, exhibitions, and book publications. It drew on an international network of photographers, critics, and curators. Only the first few issues were restricted to European themes; according to Müller- Pohle, by 1985 at the latest, “the magazine title had changed […] from the literal to the metaphorical: Europe meaning transnationalism, pluralism, diversity.” [1] In addition to presenting current photographic positions, the magazine has played a decisive role in the theoretical and programmatic debate on the medium of photography and has had a lasting influence on this.[2] Alongside Andreas Müller-Pohle, important authors have included Jean-Claude Lemagny, Derek Bennett, Boris Groys, Hubertus von Amelunxen, and Vilém Flusser. In 1982, the European Photo Galleries Guide was published, of which seven further updated and successively expanded editions under the title European Photography Guide followed through 2003. The editors described the eighth and final edition – the collaborative effort of over forty correspondents in thirty-four countries – as “the most comprehensive reference work on the photography-and-art scene in Europe ever published.”[3] In 1983, the first theoretical book publication was the essay Für eine Philosophie der Fotografie by the media and cultural philosopher Vilém Flusser, whom Andreas Müller-Pohle had met two years earlier at a symposium in Düsseldorf and who subsequently became a regular columnist for the magazine.[4, 5] An English translation was published in 1984 under the title Towards a Philosophy of Photography. Flusser’s collaboration with European Photography continued on various levels until his death in 1992, most importantly as a columnist for the magazine (“Reflections”) and as author of the ten-volume Edition Flusser published by Müller-Pohle.[6] Also in 1983, European Photography took over the magazine Print Letter, which had been founded in 1976 by Marco Misani in Zurich and was aimed at galleries, museums, and collectors.[7] It was continued in European Photography until 1989 as an separate section of the magazine and was last mentioned in the imprint in 1995. In 1993, European Photography changed its publication frequency from quarterly to half-yearly, now with a new format (24 x 30 cm) and page count (84). In 2004, the publishing house moved from Göttingen to Berlin. Ethos European Photography was devoted to the presentation of current photographic positions in media theory, and was heavily influenced in its early stages by the theories of media philosopher Vilém Flusser, whose writings appeared in the magazine. Initially representing young European photography, it soon turned to contemporary non-European developments, separately covering Australian and North American photography in two editions in 1985 (issue 23 and 24); “If you will, the title changed at that time from the literal to the metaphorical: Europe [representing] Transnationalism, pluralism, diversity.”Andreas Müller- Pohle, in: European Photography, 85/86, p. 79 European Photography Guide In parallel the magazine has maintained and updated a European Photo Galleries Guide, first published in 1981, and later renamed the European Photography Guide.

Able to lift 90,000, tons ABSD-5 could raise large ships, like aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and large auxiliary ships, out the water for repair below the ship's waterline. She was also used to repair multiple smaller ships at the same time. Ships in continuous use during war need repair both from wear and from war damage from naval mine and torpedoes. Rudders and propellers are best serviced on dry docks. Without ABSD-5 and her sister ships, at remote locations months could be lost in a ships returning to a home port for repair. ABSD-5 had provisions for the repair crew, such bunk beds, meals, and laundry. ABSD-4 had power stations, ballast pumps, repair shops, machine shops, and mess halls to be self-sustaining. ABSD-2 had two rail track moveable cranes able to lift tons of material and parts for removing damage parts and install new parts. The USS Audubon (APA-149) a Haskell-class attack transport repaired in August 1945 is one of the many ships repaired in ABSD-5. The USS Mississippi (BB-41) was repair in ABSD-5.

She maintained a successful career in eastern Europe during the early 1920s, later moving to Prague, Czechoslovakia, and becoming a theatre critic. She married Jewish journalist Hans Goldlust in 1929. When Hans was arrested by Nazis in 1938, Golz-Goldlust secured his release, helping him and his other relatives escape to England. She stayed in Prague to help the Resistance, a dangerous task which she accomplished by hiding Jewish refugees, smuggling financial resources and information across borders, recruiting new resistance members, and holding resistance meetings at her home. After she and several other resistance members were arrested by Nazis in 1942, Golz-Goldlust confessed to her part in the resistance and claimed her associates were innocent, successfully securing their release. Her family's legal attempts to have Golz-Goldlust freed were ultimately unsuccessful. In May 1943, she was sentenced to death by the Nazis, and was executed by guillotine in October of that year. Golz-Goldlust's personal letters were compiled and published in book-form after the war, and her story became further popularized via articles, radio broadcasts, and a stage play. In 1988, Golz-Goldlust was recognized posthumously as Righteous Among the Nations.  Biography  = Early life and career = Maria Agnes Belokosztolszky was born to a Catholic family on January 30, 1895, in Vienna, Austria. Her mother was Czechoslovakian, while her father was Polish. She had a sister named Rosi. After high school, Belokosztolsky trained as an opera singer and ballet dancer. She took on the stage name Marianne Tolska. Throughout the early 1920s, she appeared in performances in Linz, Stuttgart and Salzburg City, working with Austrian composer Nico Dostal and singing operettas alongside tenor Richard Tauber. During this time, she married and divorced twice. In 1924, Belokosztolszky moved to Berlin, where she met Jewish editor and journalist Hans Goldlust. The two married in 1929. Hans had informally adopted the surname 'Golz' to avoid social stigma surrounding traditionally Jewish- sounding names in Germany, so when Marianne married him she adopted the surname Golz-Goldlust. The couple moved to Prague in 1934, and Golz-Goldlust put her skills to work as a theatre critic. = Resistance work = When the Nazis invaded Prague in 1939, Hans was arrested. Golz-Goldlust successfully got him released, helping him escape to England. She also helped Hans' mother and sister escape the country. Instead of joining them in safety, Golz- Goldlust decided to stay in Prague to help other persecuted Jews. She began holding social gatherings at her house to find like-minded citizens, and she soon met local resistance organizer Ottokar Zapotecky, whose network helped smuggle refugees out of Prague. Golz-Goldlust recruited new resistance members from Czechoslovakia and Austria, assisting Jewish refugees in their escape by putting them in touch with the network and moving financial resources across borders. She hid refugees in her home, continued to hold resistance meetings, and arranged to smuggle important information about Prague conditions to the exiled Czech government over in England. = Death and legacy = A prison photo of Golz-Goldlust On November 19, 1942, Golz-Goldlust and several of her resistance associates were arrested by the Nazis. Golz-Goldlust confessed immediately, telling her interrogators that she was the only resistance member in the group, and her associates were consequently allowed to go free. Golz- Goldlust was held in Pankrác Prison. Despite her captivity, however, she continued to write a steady stream of letters to friends and contacts; the letters were written on paper scraps and smuggled out of prison whenever she had meals brought to her. Although Golz-Goldlust's family pursued legal means to have her freed, most lawyers were unwilling to risk the wrath of German authorities by arguing in her defense. Czech lawyer Marie Schrámek finally agreed to take the case, but was ultimately unable to free Golz-Goldlust, despite an appeal to the Special German High Court and to the Reich Minister of Justice. In May 1943, Golz-Goldlust was sentenced to death for her actions, and she was guillotined on October 8, 1943. In 1946, Golz-Goldlust's letters were compiled and published as a book titled Zaluji (I Accuse), and later in German translation as Der Große Tag (The Great Day). Her story was eventually featured in radio broadcasts, articles, and a play. In June 1988, Golz- Goldlust was formally recognized posthumously by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations for her work rescuing Jewish refugees. An olive tree was planted in her honour at the Yad Vashem Memorial Centre in Israel. In 2011, the German Resistance Memorial Centre held a special exhibition focused on Golz- Goldlust's life.

They stated that this difference was enough to justify elevating it from a subspecies to a species. Biology and ecology It is a nocturnal species, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves. It is colonial, with these cave roosts consisting of up to 1,000 individuals. Range and habitat The Somalian trident bat is found in the Horn of Africa in Somalia, as well as the Yemeni island of Socotra. It inhabits arid areas such as savanna, shrubland, grassland, and desert. Conservation As of 2017, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because it was only recently recognized as a full species, and as such, information is lacking regarding its ecology and distribution.

Biography  Kengiro Azuma's work (1971) at a sculpture symposium in St. Margarethen Azuma was born March 12, 1926 in Yamagata, Japan to a family of bronze artisans. When he was 17, Azuma joined the Imperial Japanese Navy as a Kamikaze pilot, but the war ended before the time came for him to sacrifice himself. World War II and the discovery of the emperor's humanity had a great impact on the Japanese people. For Azuma personally, it created a spiritual void that pushed him towards art. From 1949 to 1953, Azuma studied sculpture at the University of Tokyo. In 1956 he moved to Italy after receiving a scholarship from the Italian government. Azuma studied at the Brera Academy in Milan where he was a student and eventually the art assistant of Marino Marini (sculptor). In 1966, his work was exhibited as part of \\"The New Japanese Painting and Sculpture\\" at the MoMa in New York. Azuma lived and worked in Milan for most of his career. He continued as Marino Marini's art assistant until Marini's death in 1980. From 1980 to 1990 he was a professor at the Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti.

Background and safety measures  Transportation is a core part of a functioning society, and managing the health impact of transportation falls under the branch of public health. Many measures have been taken over the years to improve health outcomes related to transportation. Accidents are the third leading cause of death in the United States, and one quarter of those are motor vehicle accidents, accounting for 40,327 deaths per year. Starting in the 1960s, campaigns began popping up all over the United States to promote motor vehicle safety. These campaigns used a multi-pronged approach to increase the safety of automobiles. They lobbied locally and in Washington DC to mandate certain safety features such as airbags and seatbelts, both of which reduce injury in the event of an accident. These campaigns also used a variety of public health intervention methods to spread awareness of motor vehicle safety. In the states where interventions took place, seat belt usage skyrocketed. Motor vehicles contribute greatly to aggregate emissions all over the globe, which can have serious negative impacts on the health of the population. In the 1970s, the Nixon administration created the Environmental Protection Agency as well as passing the Clean Air Act. Both of these measures not only helped to reduce the amount of harmful emissions being produced by motor vehicles in the US, but they also helped improve health measures. For example, it was found that reducing the amount of lead in gasoline directly correlated with decreasing blood lead content from 1976 to 1980. Biking is an essential form of transportation for many citizens. Biking comes with its own set of health benefits and detriments. Biking is one of the few forms of transportation that keeps the traveler active. This activity gives the rider a cardiovascular workout increasing muscle strength and joint mobility while reducing stress levels and body fat content. Although biking does have wonderful health outcomes for the body, the risks biking poses does have an impact on overall health outcomes. While helmets do protect the rider in the event of crash or accident, the mere presence of a helmet increases the likelihood of a rider getting into an accident with a car. More bike-specific infrastructure such as bike lanes and bike paths is needed to keep bikers safe. Commercial air travel ranks as the safest form of transportation in terms of deaths per billion miles traveled, with .07 deaths/billion miles traveled, followed by bus travel at .11 deaths/billion miles traveled and train transport at .43 deaths/billion miles traveled. Automotive travel ranked as the most dangerous with 7.3 deaths/billion miles traveled.  Air quality and emissions production  Comparison of Growth Areas and Emissions 1980-2015, US The six main pollutants monitored by the EPA that can have serious health consequences are particulate matter, ground-level ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Particulate matter consists of a mix of solid and liquid matter such as dust, dirt, or smoke that makes up two categories, PM10 and PM2.5, the former being anything smaller than 10 micrometers and the latter being anything smaller than 2.5 micrometers. PM10 can get deep within your lungs while PM2.5 is so small it can get into your blood stream both of which cause damage and is overall harmful for your health. When nitrogen oxides interact with volatile organic compounds near the surface of the Earth, ground-level ozone is formed which can cause a variety of respiratory issues and exacerbate existing conditions like COPD and asthma which is common in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children. Lead is a soft metal that when introduced to the human body, can cause damage throughout many body systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, immune, and renal systems. Carbon monoxide is introduced into the air through combustion reactions, and when inhaled, the carbon monoxide mimics oxygen molecules and binds to hemoglobin, not allowing for proper oxygenation, which can exacerbate pre- existing conditions such as asthma and COPD. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide both are synthesized through combustion reactions and have negative impacts on the respiratory systems. All six of the criteria air pollutants are created either directly or indirectly from combustion reactions of fossil fuels. Measures have been taken starting in the 1970s to start to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air, thus aiming to improve health outcomes related to air quality. For example, the catalytic converter was introduced to the automotive industry. It functions by filtering exhaust from a combustion engine in a vehicle for potentially harmful gasses and catalyzes reactions to transform them into less harmful chemicals such as water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Also, reducing the amount of lead in gasoline did directly correlate with a decrease in blood lead content during a four year period in the 1970s. Although continuous measures have been taken to reduce the emissions content due to cars, they still rank unfavorably compared with other forms of travel. > \\"In absolute terms, the picture is clear. Worldwide, road users account for > about 71% of transport CO2 emissions, with railway companies making up less > than 1.8%, next to 12.3% for aviation and 14.3% for shipping, according to > the International Energy Agency and International Union of Railways.\\" In terms of emission production, bikes are the obvious leader in this category considering they produce nearly no emissions to run. They are also smaller and create less pollution in terms of production. On average, the production of a single bicycle creates around 530 pounds of carbon dioxide, which can be generally offset by about 400 miles of biking instead of driving. There are arguments that bikers need to consume more food, which leads to emissions productions in other ways and that drastically adds to the total emissions produced by bikers in comparison to drivers, but a biker would have to have a diet extremely high in beef consumption in order to substantially offset the emissions benefits of biking. Of course, like any other mode of transportation, feasibility and practicality play a role in the use of bikes in a different setting. Biking is impractical for long distance journeys or journeys where one would need to bring many things with them. But, for the most part, biking is most practical in suburban and urban environments for short journeys. Over 60% car journeys in the US in 2008 were between 0–10 miles long. This statistic illustrates that bikes are a very feasible option for a lot of journeys in the US. On top of the feasibility of bike usage due to distance, biking is also the quickest way to travel around urban areas. Considering that 62.7% of the population of the US lives in cities, biking is a feasibility for a large percentage of the population.  Urban centers and public transportation  Public transportation is broad term encompassing a wide variety of methods of transportation including commuter rails, light rails, heavy rails, trolleys, and busses. These diverse methods of transportation provides millions of Americans with a way to travel around the area in which they live. Public transportation as a whole has a variety of health benefits. Using public transportation makes a person more active, therefore making them more likely to be healthier and decreasing risk for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes. Taking public transit makes a rider safer compared to drivers in personal vehicles. Public transit produces less emissions than cars which reduces levels in the air, decreasing risk for the harmful effects of emissions.

His studies of mammals primarily concerned the Italian colonies of Africa. De Beaux was also a conservationist, authoring one of the first papers to argue the ethics of conservation, \\"Biological ethics: an attempt to arouse a naturalistic conscience\\". Early life De Beaux was born 5 December 1879 in Florence, Italy. Career = Zoology = From 1911–1913, he was a scientific assistant at the Carl Hagenbeck zoo. He was later employed at the University of Genoa as a professor of zoology. Next, he worked at the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova (Genoa Natural History Museum), where he served as Director from 1934–1947. While at the Museum he managed a small zoo so as to make scientific observations on living mammals. Drawing from this work, he published one of the first scientific papers on the possible effects of captivity on the skeleton and fur color of animals. He also undertook several hybridization experiments at the zoo, including a blackbuck × Dorcas gazelle cross, as well as among varieties of leopards or jackals. De Beaux undertook several studies of mammals of the Italian colonies of Africa. He described a number of new mammal species and subspecies, including Patrizi's trident leaf-nosed bat, the Somalian trident bat, and Parissi's slit-faced bat. = Conservation = In 1923, de Beaux joined the International Society for the Conservation of the European bison. This organization was the world's first to attempt to save an animal species from extinction by means of captive breeding. In 1930, de Beaux published \\"Biological ethics: an attempt to arouse a naturalistic conscience\\", which Pedrotti called \\"his most important study.\\" In it, de Beaux defined biological ethics as the \\"study and definition of man's moral position before the living beings which do not belong to the human race, beginning with the moral premise that man was not able to create the species.\\" \\"Biological ethics\\" has been called \\"one of the first works on the ethical aspects of conservation\\". De Beaux made ethical arguments in several other publications. In one paper on the European bison, he argued that \\"man is not in the world to destroy or exploit nature, but to preserve it and increase its value\\". In another publication advocating for the conservation of brown bears in Trentino, he stated that living organisms are inimitable by man; while man can discover and destroy nature, he cannot create it. Pedrotti stated that de Beaux's biological ethic could be summed up as \\"take care that no animal or plant species disappears from the face of the earth, that is, respect every expression of life, which encloses within itself its own solution to the immense problem of existence\\". De Beaux also emphasized the role of education in conservation, highlighting the importance of facilities such as zoos, aquaria, natural history museums, and botanical gardens. He stated that they \\"promote not only naturalist knowledge, but also love and a sympathetic attitude for plants and animals\\". American conservationist Aldo Leopold began a correspondence with de Beaux in 1934 after reading an English translation of \\"Biological ethics\\", saying that he read the paper \\"with very intense interest\\". In his letter, Leopold enclosed his own publication in a similar vein, \\"The Conservation Ethic\\". De Beaux's conservation publication actually predated Leopold's by several years, as the English translation was not published until 1932, which was around when Leopold wrote \\"The Conservation Ethic\\". Death De Beaux died on 29 September 1955 in Torre Pellice, Italy.

Born August 4, 1888 in Buguruslan, Russia, Charchoune lived most of his life in France where he died in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges on November 24, 1975.  Biography  Serge Charchoune briefly studied art in Moscow before being drafted into the army in 1910. He deserted and in 1912, he went to Paris where he quickly became interested in the Cubist Movement, studying under Henri Le Fauconnier. During the war, he took refuge in Barcelona where he met the painters Albert Gleizes, Marie Laurencin, and Francis Picabia. After the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, he tried to return to Russia, but failed and ended back in Paris. He attended Dadaist meetings at the café Certá and participated in Dada demonstrations, notably the \\"Trial of Barrès\\" organized by André Breton. He founded the Dadaist group Palata poetov and in 1921 wrote Foule immobile: poème, arguably his most significant contribution to the movement. He exhibited at the Montaigne Gallery in a show organized by Tristan Tzara as well as at the Berlin gallery Der Sturm. From the 1930s to the 1950s, Charchoune experimented with both abstract and representational figures, often mixing the two. His style, as described by British artist and critic Merlin James, was an \\"alternative\\" abstraction as compared to many of his contemporaries. Charchoune took inspiration for his artworks from the music of classical composers like Bach and Tchaikovsky Charchoune's work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Centre Georges Pompidou, and Moscow Museum of Modern Art.

Jenckes was raised in a family of London cutlers and found employment west of London at a sword factory. After his wife and daughter died, and about the time the sword factory closed, he left his only surviving child with family and immigrated to New England. About 1645 he was working at the Saugus Iron Works near Lynn, Massachusetts. He is credited with making the first casting in America, inventing and manufacturing a new kind of scythe, and creating tools for the first American-made coins. The son he left in England, Joseph Jenckes Jr., joined him at Saugus and later founded the town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Early life Jenckes's baptismal record, St. Ann BlackfriarsJoseph Jenckes was baptized on , at St. Ann Blackfriars, London. His parents were John Jenckes Sr. (b. ) and Sarah Fulwater (b. 1573), both of St. Ann Blackfriars parish. He had an older sister, Sarah (b. 1597), and at least two older half brothers, John Jenckes Jr. (–) and Jonas Jenckes (–1622). His patrilineal line has been traced to 15th-century Shropshire. Joseph Jenckes was raised in a family of cutlers and trade guild members. His father, John Jenckes Sr., and his half brothers, John and Jonas, were cutlers and members of the Worshipful Company of White Bakers, a London guild for bakers of light-grain bread. Jenckes's maternal grandfather, German immigrant Henry Fulwater (–1603), was a cutler and a member of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers. London guilds—called livery companies—regulated trade in the city and provided apprenticeships. Membership conferred social status and city voting rights. Livery companies would accept new members by patrimony (inheritance) who no longer practiced their ancestors' trade, which is why some Jenckeses were members of a bakers' guild. In 1627, Joseph Jenckes married in Horton, Buckinghamshire, which is about 20 miles west of St. Ann Blackfriars, London. Sword cutler at Stone's factory Sword made by Joseph Jenckes Sr. Between and , Joseph Jenckes worked as a sword cutler at Benjamin Stone's sword factory at Hounslow, Middlesex, which is about 14 miles west of St. Ann Blackfriars. In 1629, Benjamin Stone, a member of the Company of Cutlers in London, converted a grain mill into a sword factory on the Cutt River in Hounslow Heath to meet the demand for military swords created by the ongoing Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). Stone employed English cutlers and German sword makers from Solingen. The swords were delivered primarily to the Tower of London's armory, with peak production between 1634 and 1637. By 1642, the First English Civil War had begun and Stone's sword factory was moved to Oxford. The Powysland Museum in Welshpool, Wales, has a sword in its collection made by Joseph Jenckes. The sword blade is inscribed with the words “JENCKES JOSEPH\\" on one side and \\"ME FECIT HOVNSLO” (Made in Hounslow) on the reverse. Immigration to New England While in Hounslow, Joseph Jenckes became a widower in 1635 and one of his two children died in 1638. In 1639, he petitioned authorities to build a newly invented blade mill at Isleworth, however it is not known if he followed through with his plans. In , Jenckes left his only child, Joseph, in England with family and immigrated to New England. In 1642, Jenckes was mentioned in New Hampshire records and, in 1643, he was mentioned in a deed for land near Kittery at the York River in Maine. He was working at the Saugus Iron Works near Lynn in Massachusetts Bay two years later. Blacksmith at the Saugus Iron Works =Association with the ironworks= By 1645, Joseph Jenckes was associated with the Hammersmith ironworks, later called the Saugus Iron Works. The Saugus Iron Works used the most advanced technology of the time and was the first successful integrated ironworks in America. Map of the partially restored Saugus Iron Works The business venture to build an integrated ironworks on the Saugus River began long before Jenckes arrived. In the late 1620s, bog iron ore was discovered in the Saugus River marshes near Lynn. In 1641, John Winthrop the Younger had samples of the ore shipped to England and soon afterwards an investment consortium headed by Winthrop called \\"The Company of Undertakers of the Iron Works in New England\\" invested in the proposed Saugus River project. In 1645, Winthrop resigned his position as company agent and was succeeded by Richard Leader. Leader chose the site and laid out the plan for the ironworks at the newly-formed company town called Hammersmith. The ironworks started operations in 1646 and, at its peak, engaged more than 200 workers. In 1647, Richard Leader gave permission to Jenckes to erect his foundry and forge along the tailrace (water channel) below the Saugus Iron Works blast furnace. In the mid-1650s, the Company of Undertakers entered bankruptcy and as part of the settlement much of the Saugus Iron Works—Jenckes's shop, the rolling mill, the slitting mill, and a corn mill—was awarded to a local businessman, Joseph Armitage. In 1656, Jenckes mortgaged his home and purchased these structures and the machines they contained. In 1678, the ironworks ceased producing iron, and in 1682 the dam was removed above Jenckes's shop. Jenckes died the following year. =Archaeology at the Jenckes site= Products recovered from Jenckes site displayed at Saugus Iron Works Museum Between 1948 and 1953, archaeologist Roland W. Robbins excavated various sites at the Saugus Iron Works. In 1952, Robbins excavated what he called the \\"Jenks Site\\" where Jenckes built his foundry and forge on the tailrace. He uncovered a wrought-iron tuyere (bellows pipe), an anvil base, axes, chisels, knives, four water wheels, a water wheel hub and shaft, a cannonball, a sawmill saw blade, a scythe, hoes, spades, ox and horse shoes, and other objects. He discovered the \\"likely remains of Jenks' forge hearth\\" and he found the remains of a slitting mill and evidence of a wire-making operation. =Career highlights= First machine patent in America In 1646, Jenckes was granted the first machine patent in America. He received a 14-year patent for a new kind of water-driven machine to make scythes, sawmill saw blades, and other edged tools. In his application to the Massachusetts General Court, he asked for “the usuall priveleg and liberty Granted by the high Court of Parliament in England to men that doe first sett upon workes of this nature”. He explained that he had “expended his estate, study, and labour, and have brought things to perfection; Another when he seeth it makes the like; and soe I loose the benefit of that I have studied for many yeeres before; which will tend to my Great damadg if not my utter undoeing”. The patent was issued by the General Court and bore the signatures of Governor John Winthrop and Deputy Edward Rawson. First casting in America 1930 marker displayed at the Saugus Iron Works Museum Jenckes made the first iron casting in America. The small pot with three legs, a lid, and bale (a handle) was presented by Jenckes to Samuel Hudson. Called the Saugus Pot, it is now displayed at the Saugus Public Library. Metallurgy tests confirmed that the pot matches metal fragments found at the site of the Jenckes forge. Scythe patent In 1655, Jenckes was granted a 7-year patent for an improved scythe \\"for the more speedy cutting of grass\\". The European scythe had a straight snath (long wooden shaft) and the scythe blade was short and thick, which reduced its efficiency. The Jenckes scythe had a double-curved snath and the scythe blade was longer, thinner, and lightweight. The blade was strengthened by a chine (a rib) on back. The Jenckes scythe became known as the American scythe and it remains substantially unchanged today. Tools for the first coins in America (probable) In 1652, John Hull and Robert Sanderson were appointed mint masters for Massachusetts Bay Colony. According to tradition, Jenckes cut dies for the first coins minted in America, such as the pine tree shilling. While there is no direct evidence for this claim, there is circumstantial evidence that Jenckes created steel punches, blank dies, and other tools for the Hull Mint. Jenckes had an early interest in coin making. In 1654, Jenckes wrote a letter to Edward Hull, John Hull's brother, about recruiting a die maker. In 1672, Jenckes petitioned the General Court to make coins; however, the court rejected Jenckes's request: \\"In ans to the humble proposal of Joseph Jenks, Sen. for ye making of money etc the Court judgeth to meet not to grant his request\\". In the 1650s, Hammersmith had the only blast furnace hot enough to make steel or case hardened wrought iron punches, die blanks, crucibles, and other tools that Hull and Sanderson required. First fire engine in America (inconclusive) Boston suffered a serious fire in 1653 and the following year the selectmen of Boston approved the purchase of fire engines from Joseph Jenckes: \\"The select men have power and liberty hereby to agree with Joseph Jynks for Ingins to Carry water in Case of fire, if they see Cause soe to doe\\". In 1702 the selectmen referred to an old engine in need of repairs which may have been the Jenckes engine. However, no document confirming that Jenckes made the engine has been found. The legend of Thomas Veale (folklore) In 1658, according to popular legend, Captain Thomas Veale and three other pirates sailed up the Saugus River. The pirates visited the Saugus Iron Works at night and left a note on the door of Jenckes's forge requesting shackles. They hid in Lynn Forest at a place now called Pirates' Glen. The order was filled, but the shackles were used on three of the pirates. Veale escaped and buried treasure in a nearby cavern, now called Dungeon Rock, where he died during an earthquake. Family Joseph Jenckes married Joan Hearne on , at Horton, Buckinghamshire. Joan Hearne was born in in Horton and died on at Isleworth, Middlesex. They had two children: Elizabeth, b. 1597; and Joseph Jenckes Jr., b. 1599. His daughter, Elizabeth, died in 1638 in England and his son, Joseph, who remained in England when his father emigrated, joined him at the Saugus Iron Works in . He married secondly Elizabeth in in New England. Elizabeth—whose maiden name and origin are unknown—was born in 1604 and died at Lynn in 1679. They had five children: Sarah, b. 1652; Samuel, b. 1654; Deborah, b. 1658; John, b. 1660; and Daniel, b. 1663. His son Joseph Jenckes Jr. would be a founder of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and his grandson, Joseph Jenckes 3rd, was the 19th governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. A descendant was Nicholas Brown Jr., the philanthropist who gave his name to Brown University. Legacy 1898 marker displayed at the Saugus Iron Works Museum The Saugus Iron Works is considered the birthplace of the American iron and steel industry. Some products of Joseph Jenckes's forge, a copy of his patent, and two historical markers mentioning his accomplishments are displayed in the museum at the Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site in Lynn, Massachusetts.

He first collected autographed space items among other collectables, eventually focusing mainly on astronaut flown personal mementos and artifacts. His collection includes a large selection of space flown numismatic items, including an assemblage of $2 bills signed by astronauts that were carried while in orbit or during lunar landings during the golden age of space exploration. His unique collection of $2 bills carried by astronauts appear in the online Jefferson Space Museum. He has also exhibited pieces from his collection at the Kansas Cosmosphere and the Southern Illinois University Museum His collection has also been covered on PBS and WGN TV's \\"Backstory with Larry Potash\\" program on the episode titled How NASA sold the American Public on Space. Space Historian Jurek is the co-author of the 2014 book Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program, which he cowrote with David Meerman Scott. The book focuses on the use of marketing techniques and marketing agreements between NASA and private industry to promote the importance of the Apollo missions to the US public. He has provided public lectures on the subject as well. The book contains around three hundred images of original ads and marketing materials, cut down from an initial collection of about three thousand. Jurek argues that what occurred during the marketing of the Apollo missions set the precedent of the modern interaction between the public and mass media. For his book he also appeared on the Science Channel’s television series NASA's Unexplained Files, as well as the documentary The Two Dollar Bill. He is also a contributor to Air & Space Smithsonian. He also served as a consulting producer on the 2019 critically acclaimed PBS/American Experience documentary, Chasing the Moon. In 2019 Jurek released the book The Ultimate Engineer: The Remarkable Life of NASA’s Visionary Leader George M. Low. Publishers Weekly said of the book that, \\"The result of Jurek’s extensive research and careful use of detail is a comprehensive portrait of a figure vastly greater in significance than in name recognition.\\" The Library Journal’s review declared the book “scholarly, yet accessible and engaging,” and “is as much a history of NASA as a biography of George Low, and as such is an important contribution to the history of the agency.” Jurek had previously written of Low in Air & Space Magazine, declaring Low \\"the man who won the moon race\\" for his work as Apollo Program Manager.

He was named a Fellow of the American Society of Agronomy in 2018.https://www.usu.edu/today/index.cfm?id=58111 Bugbee has also provided TEDx Talks on his work, and has been awarded the Utah Governor’s Medal for Science and Technology. Research Bruce Bugbee has studied recirculating hydroponics since the 1980s and has used the principles to create self- sustaining ecosystems. He has focused his study of hydroponics partially on use for long-term space missions. In his work on developing crop sustainability for long-term space missions, Bugbee additionally focuses on nutritional needs for space explorers, determining how many different crops would be needed to sustain life. He also states that gravity is needed in order for plants to grow properly. Bugbee has worked with NASA in his research on regenerative systems and the effects of microgravity on plants. He first began working with NASA upon his arrival at Utah State University in 1981. He was a part of the team to first grow crops on the International Space Station. This work has expanded to include lettuce and radishes. Bugbee’s work with NASA also includes the development of crop growing systems for future life on the Moon and Mars in addition to in orbit or in space shuttles. When the film The Martian was released in 2015, Bugbee supported the idea that crops could be grown on Mars using similar methods to those used in the book and movie so long as proper composting methods were utilized. He has worked on projects for Mars farming including the use of fiber optics for indoor lighting. As a part of this research, Bugbee was involved in the 2017 creation of the $15 million Space Technology Research Institute \\"Center for the Utilization of Biological Engineering in Space.\\" Bugbee has been a critic of the use of indoor farming as a means of solving food shortages, citing concerns about the large amount of electricity needed to provide light for photosynthesis . His work in this area has included studies into the efficacy of LED lights for indoor growing. In 2018, he was a part of a project on reducing the energy costs of indoor farming that received a $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute for Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Research Initiative. Personal life Bugbee is married to his wife Diana West and lives in the Crockett House (Logan, Utah), a home registered in the National Register of Historic Places, where the two have developed a garden that is used for community events and parties. Co-authored with his wife, he has published a book that covers photography from each of the annual gardens since 1982.

He visits his high school and is overcome by memories. So, a reunion is arranged through their school WhatsApp group. At the reunion, his friends Murali (Ravishankar Gowda), Sudha (Joythi Rai) and Sathish (P.D. Sathish Chandra) catch up with him. Murali hesitantly mentions that Jaanu (Ram's childhood sweetheart) is coming from Singapore. In 1999, Ram and Jaanu have been friends and classmates in tenth grade. Jaanu is a talented singer. Ram develops a love for Jaanu and she reciprocates. Once their board exams are over, they have a moment with each other where Jaanu asks him not to forget her until they meet again after the holidays. Jaanu (Bhavana) arrives at the reunion and searches for Ram. When Subha points Ram's location to her, Jaanu walks towards him. She reminisces the first day of 10th grade when she eagerly awaits Ram's arrival to the classroom, but he doesn't show up. She finds that Ram has left the school because his father had financial difficulties and his family relocated to Banglore overnight.

He returned sadly and never tried to meet her since then. Jaanu is devastated listening to this and reveals that she never saw them at her college and thought it was her stalker who was troubling her. Ram tells that except for the mistake of assuming that she hated him, he knew everything about her life. He also tells about seeing her from afar at her wedding.

Jaanu obliges and narrates an improvised version of the time when Ram tried to meet Jaanu at her college.

Ram shows Jaanu a collection of their old memories like love poems, dried flowers and their school uniforms. They realize that time is running out and go back to Jaanu's hotel to get ready for her flight in a few hours. Jaanu is sad knowing that she will leave Banglore and Ram very soon. At the airport, Ram escorts her till the boarding gate and they bid a teary farewell. Jaanu then gets into the flight and leaves. Back at his home, Ram finds Jaanu's clothes that he had put to dry the previous night.

By 1914, around 1,500 Bukharan Jews had immigrated, and 4,000 more arrived in the early 1930s. In 1940, publications in Bukhori were shut down by the Soviets along with most Bukharan schools.

In 1950 thirteen religious Bukharan Jews in Samarkand were arrested and sentenced to 25 years. Similar arrests happened to prominent Bukharim in Kattakurgan and Bukhara. The Six-Day War led to a rise in Jewish patriotism among Bukharan Jews and many carried out demonstrations as refuseniks. Until 1972, there was no major immigration of Bukharim to Israel. It was from then until 1975 when 8,000 managed to immigrate from the USSR. By 1987, 32,000 Bukharan Jews lived in Israel, around 40% of the Bukharim. In 1990, there were riots against the Jewish population of Andijan and nearby areas. This led to most Jews in the Fergana Valley immigrating to Israel or the United States. =1990s–present= From 1989 to 2005 over 5,000 Bukharan Jews from Kyrgyzstan came to Israel due to increased hostility in the region.

The tour started on January 11 and ran until January 21, 2019, with shows taking place in Osaka, Ehime, Kyoto, Gifu, Chiba and Tokyo. The 2019 tour was the ninth time that NJPW and CMLL co-promoted shows in Japan under the Fantastica Mania name. With a total of eight shows scheduled, the tour tied the 2018 tour as the longest in Fantastica Mania history at that point in time. The four initial shows featured six matches each night, while the four latter shows featured seven. Select events were shown on Fighting TV Samurai and TV Asahi, or live on NJPW World with subsequent video-on-demand options. Background The 2019 Fantastica Mania tour was the ninth year in a row where Japanese wrestling promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promoted a series of shows with their Mexican partner Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Due to the co- promotional nature of the shows, they rarely featured any development in ongoing NJPW or CMLL storylines, opting instead to focus on inter-promotional matches. The Fantastica Mania shows featured various professional wrestling matches planned out by CMLL and NJPW, with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform. For the 2019 tour El Desperado, Sho and Yoh all competed under the ring personas they used during their training excursions with CMLL. El Desperado reprised his role as Namajague, CMLL's version of the Japanese folklore demon Namahage. Sho and Yoh, collectively known as Roppongi 3K, worked under the names Raijin and Fujin respectively. Highlighted matches on the tour include Carístico – a técnico – teaming with rudos in various relevos increíbles tag matches, as well as the four-team CMLL Family Tag Tournament, with the winners facing the winners of last year's CMLL Brothers Tag Tournament, Los Guerreros Laguneros (Último Guerrero and Gran Guerrero). The January 20 show was the only show to feature a championship match, as La Nueva Generación Dinamita (Sansón, Cuatrero and Forastero) defended the Mexican National Trios Championship against Atlantis, Titán and Ángel de Oro. The 2019 tour also featured the in-ring debut of Atlantis Jr., the son of Atlantis, working every show on the tour. The January 18 show hosted a memorial match in honor of Mexican wrestler Black Cat, who died of a heart attack on January 28, 2006. In this match, the team of Satoshi Kojima, Toa Henare, Raijin and Fujin defeated Los Ingobernables (Terrible, Tetsuya Naito, Bushi and Shingo Takagi). In the tour's last night, on January 21, the characters from the Japanese movie \\"My Dad is a Heel Wrestler\\" squared off in a special tag team match, with the team of Dragon George (Kazuchika Okada) and SweetGorilla Maruyama (Togi Makabe) defeating the team of Gokiburi Mask (Hiroshi Tanahashi) and Ginbae Mask (Ryusuke Taguchi).

He received a master's degree at St Cross College, Oxford University and was named the 2007 and 2014 Alumnus of the Year. The college has named the West Quad library and garden room after him and his wife Catherine, an alumna of Lincoln College, Oxford.http://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/50/campaignhttps://issuu.com/lincolncollege4/docs/lincoln_record__2014___f___web At Oxford, he was on the university’s 1995 national championship basketball team. Wigdor has lectured on university campuses as a guest lecturer and speaker.https://sha.cornell.edu/app/attach/get.html?target=events_calendar&id;=6062 Career Wigdor clerked for the Federal Court and worked as an attorney in the Suffolk County district attorney’s office. He then worked for corporations defending themselves against discrimination suits while an attorney at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. In order to begin prosecuting those discrimination suits themselves, he founded Wigdor LLP in 2003 with the future District Attorney for Brooklyn, New York Kenneth P. Thompson. That year he received a $7.5 million jury award against Wal-Mart, which was one of the largest yet under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 .http://www.wigdorlaw.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/10/Walmart_Newsday.pdf In his career, Wigdor coined the phrase “recessionary discrimination” to describe the use of the economy as a pretext for discrimination. Among his cases, in 2009, he represented five women in a gender discrimination matter against Citibank, a case that appeared on the front cover of Forbes Magazine. In 2012 Wigdor represented Nafissatou Diallo, a housekeeper attacked in the Sofitel Hotel by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund. In terms of discrimination cases against large financial groups, he has represented clients in a gender discrimination case against Dresdner, and pregnancy discrimination cases against Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. He has also represented clients against Fox News, settling for approximately twenty clients out of court for $10 million. Other notable cases he has represented have included a racial discrimination case on behalf of actor Rob Brown against Macy’s, and the representation of Charles Oakley against James Dolan and Madison Square Garden. As a complainant himself, Wigdor brought a lawsuit against SoulCycle after being banned from the spinning studio subsequent to the representation of one of its former instructors. Wigdor represents five NY1 anchorwomen in an age and gender discrimination lawsuit against Charter Communications. He also represents the former Chief of Staff to Adam Neumann in a pregnancy discrimination complaint against WeWork. On January 21, 2020, five days before the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Wigdor filed a complaint with the EEOC on behalf of Deborah Dugan alleging that she was unlawfully stripped of her role as President and CEO of The Recording Academy in retaliation for her complaints of gender discrimination, voting irregularities, financial mismanagement and conflicts of interest at the Academy. The case prompted widespread controversy surrounding the credibility of the awards and reportedly caused Taylor Swift to cancel a surprise performance at the ceremony in solidary with Dugan. Hours before the ceremony, Wigdor publicly called on the Recording Academy to immediately reinstate Dugan as CEO. Alicia Keys, the ceremony’s host, appeared to reference Dugan’s allegations during her opening monologue. Other celebrity musicians who have publicly backed Dugan amid the controversy include Nicki Minaj, Sheryl Crow, Chuck D, Sean Combs and Tyler, the Creator. Due to his representation of Dugan, Wigdor was named to Billboard's Top Music Lawyers list in 2020. On May 5, 2020, multiple media outlets reported that Wigdor represented several women in an investigation led by the New York Attorney General's office into sexual harassment allegations at NBC News, including Megyn Kelly and Linda Vester. On May 8, 2020, it was revealed that Wigdor represented Tara Reade in her sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden. On May 11, Wigdor sent a letter to Biden urging him to authorize a search of his Senate papers housed at the University of Delaware for a copy of a sexual harassment complaint that Reade said she filed against Biden in 1993. Wigdor also pressed the Secretary of the United States Senate to authorize a similar search for documents related to the complaint. On May 22, it was reported that Wigdor’s firm no longer represented Reade. Wigdor told the press that the decision was “by no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms. Reade” and that his views on the allegations had not changed. On July 1, 2020, it was reported that Wigdor represented the victim in a sexual misconduct case that led to the termination of Fox News host Ed Henry. On July 20, Wigdor filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Jennifer Eckhart and Cathy Areu alleging that Henry had raped Eckhart and sexually harassed both women. The lawsuit further alleged that Fox News supported and promoted Henry after it received multiple complaints of sexually inappropriate behavior against him, and only fired him once it became aware of a forthcoming lawsuit. Fox News on-air talent Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Howard Kurtz and Gianno Caldwell were also accused of sexual harassment in the lawsuit. Harvey Weinstein cases Wigdor has represented at least six victims of alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein. Three of Wigdor’s clients, Wedil David, Kaja Sokola and Dominique Huett, filed civil lawsuits alleging that they were sexually assaulted by Weinstein after he invited them to meet with him to discuss potential acting roles. Another client of Wigdor's, Tarale Wulff, testified during Weinstein’s criminal rape trial in New York that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2005. Weinstein was convicted of criminal sexual assault and rape in the third degree, and received a sentence of 23 years in state prison. After it was reported that Weinstein reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with his accusers, Wigdor publicly rejected the deal. Two other Weinstein accusers, Zelda Perkins and Rowena Chiu, later retained Wigdor to file their own objections to the proposed settlement. On July 14, 2020, one day after Wigdor filed a 36-page brief arguing that the proposed settlement was unfair to Weinstein's victims and should have been dismissed, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein held a 20-minute hearing in which he swiftly rejected preliminary approval of the settlement and denounced some of its terms as \\"obnoxious.\\" In recognition of his central role in the Weinstein cases and other high-profile legal matters, Wigdor received the New York Law Journal's Distinguished Leader Award and landed on The Hollywood Reporter's Top 100 Power Lawyers list.

Early life Kenwright was born in Walton, UK. He went to Alsop High School.  Career  Kenwright began a career in retail at the age of seventeen, and there are reports in the news about his situation. He founded the retail clothing company Yes & Co six years later. Within six years, the company had 32 locations and eleven million pounds in annual turnover. After selling the company, he became involved in real estate and development. Working mostly in apartment buildings Kenwright declared bankruptcy in 2010 owing very large amounts of money. After the bankruptcy he began to rebuild his business. =Development= Kenwright repurchased the apartment buildings he lost in the crash within two years, refocusing on multi-bed apartments for large group rentals. During this period he cofounded the Titanic Hotel, a Titanic-themed hotel located in the building where the ship was first registered. Kenwright founded Signature Living in 2008,https://www.boutiquehotelnews.com/home/news/2017/6/1/record-profits-for- signature-living-group/ a developer that restores historic buildings. Many of his developments have become hotels, having four in the City of Liverpool. The company has about 250 million pounds in annual turnover. The company also provides some housing for those who have lost their homes. From late 2018, lenders and investors experienced difficulties in gaining their contracted returns. This resulted in extensive coverage in the media, such as the BBC and Liverpool Echohttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- merseyside-50420937https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- merseyside-48152236https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool- news/pressure-mounts-signature-living-angry-17275330.

In the short term we have put two of our hotels up for sale (the Shankly Hotel and James Street Hotel) which have a combined value of £50 million with a retained equity of £22 million. We are actively progressing the sale and expect to complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2020.\\" The transactions were not completed in the first quarter of 2020 as Kenwright stated they would be.

Matthew Ingram and Michael Lennon, of Duff & Phelps, are joint administrators of the parent company and two other group companies - including the Shankly Hotel company, which is also in administration.

Early life  Edna Christofferson was the daughter of Martin and Mary Elizabeth Bissner, immigrants from Alsace-Lorraine. Upon arriving in the United States, they settled in Pipestone County, Minnesota, where Edna was born in 1886. She had three siblings who died in childhood: Bertha, Edward, and Jack. Two brothers, William and Harry, survived. When Edna was five years old, her family moved to Vancouver, Washington. She attended school at the House of Providence and was interested in becoming a nurse.  Marriage to Rudolph Becker  Edna married Rudolph Becker Jr. in September 1906. Becker was the heir to the Becker Auto Company, a car dealership in Portland, Oregon. When the Beckers' home caught fire in 1907, Edna Becker ran back into the flaming building to rescue her pet dog. Since the building also housed their auto garage, the fire was estimated to cause 15,000 dollars' worth of damage (over 403,000 dollars today). In 1909, Edna's friend Hazel Maddux was accused of vehicular manslaughter. Edna, who had seen the collision, was a reluctant witness. Though she freely admitted knowing the driver's identity, she refused to say who it was, claiming that \\"The woman has an old and kindly mother whose heart would be broken did she know of this.\\" Maddux was found not guilty. The Beckers' marriage had ended by November 1912, when Edna Becker married Silas Christofferson. Since Rudolph Becker Jr. was still alive, it can be assumed they had divorced.  Marriage to Silas Christofferson  Becker made her first flight in 1911, with Silas Christofferson as her pilot. She sat on the lower wing of his biplane, holding onto a wooden strut for support. They took off from Pearson Field in Vancouver, reaching heights of 500 feet and circling the field twice. The flight lasted eight minutes. On September 1, 1912, Silas Christofferson made the first hydroplane flight in Oregon, taking off from Oaks Amusement Park. He chose two women, Edna Becker and Mrs. R.F. Cox, to take turns flying with him. By then, Becker was determined to become a pilot and had ordered her own biplane. As she explained, \\"I have an inordinate craving to fly at a tremendous height, and I intend to indulge myself.\\"Edna Christofferson with the hydroplane used on her honeymoon flight Edna (right) and Silas Christofferson kiss goodbye Becker was the second of the women to ride with Silas Christofferson, taking off at 5 PM. With no safety harness, she clung to an aluminum bar with a half-inch diameter. Despite a strong wind, the two reached an altitude of 1,250 feet. Upon landing, they received a standing ovation from the tightly packed crowd. Edna Becker and Silas Christofferson were married on November 19, 1912, at the King Hill apartments in Portland. The marriage took many of their friends by surprise. An hour after the ceremony, they made a honeymoon flight over the Willamette Valley that lasted thirty minutes. The Christoffersons moved to San Francisco, where Silas opened a flying school. The school, which relocated to Redwood City in 1914, attracted students from around the world and trained several female pilots. Though Edna made many flights with Silas as her co-pilot, she did not fly solo during their marriage. After she made a mistake while volplaning, Silas refused to give her further lessons \\"until she should prove capacity to do the right thing at the time of emergency.\\" A 1913 article mentioned Edna Christofferson helping her husband prepare planes for an air show, and claimed she \\"knows pretty near everything there is to know about aeroplanes.\\" A Reno Gazette-Journal article, looking back on Silas's career in 1961, mentioned Edna approving a landing site for Silas, and said that \\"his wife's advice was sought and always adhered to by the famous airman.\\" After the Christoffersons' friend Lincoln Beachey was killed in 1915, she organized a ceremony to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his death. On October 31, 1916, Silas was testing a new biplane prototype when his engine died. He glided downward for several hundred feet, then fell the last one hundred feet to the ground. Edna had been watching his flight and was one of the first people to reach him. She directed the men who carried him to the ambulance and accompanied him to the hospital, where he died of internal injuries. Edna arranged for him to be buried alongside Lincoln Beachey in the Cypress Lawn Cemetery. After the funeral, she went to stay with relatives on an Oregon ranch for a year.  Radiology Career  In 1917, Christofferson enrolled in a post-graduate class in X-ray operation. She struggled with the subject matter at first, but became a proficient X-ray technician. She began her career at the Providence St. Vincent Medical Center in Oregon, but moved to Seattle to study with Eddy Jerman at \\"the Providence hospital\\", possibly Providence Seattle Medical Center. She also worked at the Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center. After further studies in Chicago, she was named vice president of the American Association of Radiological Technicians. For six years, Christofferson worked for Dr. F. E. Diemer as his chief X-ray technician. In 1925, she founded her own school in Portland for X-ray technicians, teaching basic and advanced courses. She acted as an expert witness in at least one criminal trial, examining the defendant in her capacity as an X-ray specialist. Christofferson traveled to Germany in 1930 for post-graduate work at the Lerchenfeld Institute in Hamburg. She was impressed by commercial aviation in Europe, noting the efficiency of the Berlin airport in particular. By 1932, 153 students had graduated from Christofferson's school. Many went on to become technicians at hospitals throughout the Pacific Northwest.  Marksmanship  Christofferson placed second in an international police shooting competition in 1927, scoring 52 out of 60 points. Participants included members of the Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, and Victoria police departments. Christofferson was the only female competitor. Christofferson believed that \\"a pistol, and a knowledge of its operation, is the best possible means of home protection for a woman.\\" She was the founder and president of the Oregon Women's Revolver Club, formed in 1928. The club had fifteen charter members, including Christofferson's sister-in-law, Ethel Bissner. A score of at least 75% in marksmanship was required to join. Christofferson convinced the Portland Police Bureau to sponsor the club and to let them use the police shooting range. She also arranged access to shooting ranges in Clackamas and at Vancouver Barracks. She was awarded a medal for expert shooting by the United States Department of War after achieving a rating of 85% at the army course in Vancouver, Washington. At the time, only two other women in the country had made this qualification. Christofferson traveled to New York in 1928, where she took part in a police shooting competition and scored 96 out of 100 possible points. Police captain Ralph Micelli called her \\"the best woman revolver shot I have ever seen.\\"  Aviation Career  Christofferson was one of twenty-four Portland women who founded an Oregon chapter of the Women's National Aeronautic Association in 1930. She was the first president of the chapter, with stunt pilot Dorothy Hester serving as vice president. In 1931, she was appointed to the Oregon state board of aeronautics. In 1931, Christofferson enrolled in a flying class run by the National Solo Flying Corporation. The company operated a Portland airport soon to be dedicated in honor of her late husband, and Christofferson wanted to fly at the dedication ceremony. She made her first flight on July 31, 1931 with instructor Charles Hanst. Christofferson, who was used to earlier plane types, remarked that \\"I would have felt more at home and would have done much better, if I had had a wheel instead of a stick to control the plane.\\" On October 31, 1931, she spoke at the dedication, then flew alone over the airfield, dropping flowers from the plane. It was the fifteenth anniversary of Silas Christofferson's death. In February 1932, Christofferson set out on an expedition to Alaska with pilot William Graham. The two were hoping to find the lost steamship SS Baychimo, which held a cargo of valuable furs. En route to Atlin, British Columbia, head winds and lack of fuel forced them to make an emergency landing. They spent ten days camped on an uncharted lake, enduring temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit, before they were rescued by pilot Stanley McMillan. Though they did not find the ship, Christofferson staked two gold claims in the Kougarok district near Nome. Christofferson returned to Portland on June 26, 1932. There, her friends and family welcomed her back at the Swan Island Airport. In July\`1932, she obtained her private pilot's license. She set out again for Alaska in October 1932, and stayed there, panning for gold, for the next three years. Christofferson returned to Portland in December 1935. She was accompanied by fellow prospector Isador Fix, who she had worked with closely in Alaska. Sometime before 1939, Fix and Christofferson married. Edna Christofferson died in a hospital in Vancouver, Washington on March 8, 1945. Her age was recorded as 64, though an 1886 birthdate would have made her 59 years old at the time of her death. >  See also  * Amelia Earhart * Dorothy Hester Stenzel * Hazel Ying Lee * > Leah Hing * Eddy Jerman *Lincoln Beachey *Evelyn Waldren References > Category:1886 births Category:1945 deaths Category:American female aviators > Category:Aviators from Oregon Category:Radiographers Category:People from > Vancouver, Washington Category:Aviators from Portland, Oregon > Category:Scientists from Portland, Oregon ","title":"Edna Christofferson"},{"id":"59692282","text":"The Chalybeate Spring at Mittagong, New South Wales was a perennial, carbonated, chalybeate (iron-rich) mineral spring Successive chalybeate springs at Mittagong had, over many thousands of years, created a deposit of iron ore that was mined by the Fitzroy Iron Works, which was closely associated with the early development of the town of Mittagong, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia. The spring was for many years a tourist attraction, mainly during the second half of the 19th century and first few decades of the 20th century.The Chalybeate Spring is within the small enclosure on the right. The (disused) 'Top Works' of Fitzroy Iron Works is in the background and the 'Ironstone Bridge' on the Great South Road (now Old Hume Highway) is in the middle distance. (From the Australian Town and Country Journal, Sat. 1 April 1893, p27).  Discovery and name  225x225pxThe traditional owners of the country around Mittagong are the Gandangara people. It is not known if they used the spring as a water source but this small spring, given its strong-tasting water and earthy odour, would be an unlikely water source, with plentiful freshwater nearby. It is likely that the limonite in the area surrounding the spring would have been used as ochre pigment. The discovery of the spring by European settlers does not seem to be recorded but the surveyor Jacques noted the presence of iron ore in the course of realigning the Great South Road (now Old Hume Highway) toward the new town of Berrima in 1833. As the spring lay within the ore deposit, is likely that the spring was first identified around that time. During late January 1849, the then Governor of New South Wales, Charles Augustus FitzRoy, visited the spring. He named it 'Lady Mary's Well',Interpretative sign located adjacent to the former Mineral Springs Reserve in Mittagong. after his wife Lady Mary FitzRoy who had been killed in a carriage accident in December 1847 in the Domain of Government House, Parramatta. Over the years, variants of the name involving 'Lady Mary' or 'Lady Fitzroy' were used occasionally but, on the whole, this official name did not stick. For a time, the spring was thought to be the only chalybeate spring in New South Wales. In fact, there were other chaleabeate springs in the Southern Highlands—near Berrima, Hill Top and Picton—and there were other springs within Mittagong, even in close proximity. The Mittagong spring remained known as 'The Chalybeate Spring' throughout its existence.  Description  340x340px The Chalybeate Spring was situated on the top of a grassy knoll on southern side of the Great South Road (now Old Hume Highway) about a quarter of a mile (400m) from the Mittagong railway station. It was described in 1896 as \\"no more than a little hole in the ground from which the water oozes up through the crevices among the hematite ore\\". In later years, the spring-water emerged from a pipe. Chalybeate springs in the Mittagong area, in their natural state, were described by the Geological Surveyor, J.B. Jaquet, as follows, \\"They generally issue from centre of saucer-like depressions (\\"craters\\") in the top of low mounds (\\"cones\\"). The cones are composed of material brought up from below in solution, just as the walls of a volcano are made up lava and ashes, which have issued through the vent. The cones never attain great dimensions. There is always a tendency for the vent to become choked with deposited oxide, and when this occurs the spring seeks a fresh channel and issues from the surface somewhere in the vicinity of the base of the cone. So it happens that the deposits are often composed of a series of cones which, owing to encroachment upon the other, have lost their identity and coalesced together.\\" The naturally-carbonated, iron-rich water was described as having \\"an inky taste and an earthy odour\\". The spring-water ran clear but turned ‘rusty’ in colour after a few hours. It was stated that \\"The water has considerable medicinal properties, the quantity of iron in solution being so minute as to be readily assimilated by systems needing the tonic effect that iron Imparts.\\" The flow rate of the spring does not seem to have been directly measured. The spring was described as 'oozing' or 'flowing'. Around 1901, there were three active springs; the largest—presumably the Chalybeate Spring—had an estimated flow rate of 100-gallons/hour (455-litres/hour), with the other two flowing at much lower rates.  Chemical analysis  The analysis of the mineral content of the water (1962) was: * Iron Bicarbonate* C2H2FeO6 ; 85.5 ppm *Magnesium Bicarbonate* Mg(HCO3)2 ; 32.0 ppm *Calcium Bicarbonate* Ca(HCO3)2 ; 29.1 ppm *Sodium chloride NaCl ; 30.8 ppm *Potassium chloride KCl ; 9.1 ppm *Magnesium chloride MgCl2 ; 8.5 ppm *These compounds exist only in aqueous solution. The iron content of the spring-water was very high. It was over three times that of the famous Chalybeate Spring at Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England.  Significance  Ironstone Cottage', which survives today. = Iron ore deposit = The spring's water ran clear but turned rusty after a few hours Once the iron-rich water was exposed to the atmosphere and dissolved carbon dioxide was liberated, iron hydroxide precipitated. By this process—over an estimated 30,000 years—chalybeate springs at Mittagong built up a significant deposit of limonite, a type of iron ore. The ore had grades between 44% and 57% iron. The total resource on the Fitzroy land at Mittagong was estimated at 150,000 tons, part of a total of an estimated 1.5-million tons that was associated with chalybeate springs in the surrounding district. The Geological Surveyor, J.B. Jaquet, described the ore as follows, \\"The limonite ore of which the deposits are composed is in part ochreous and powdery, and in part compact. The ochreous ore exists as a superficial coating on the compact variety. It varies in colour from pale yellow to deep red or brown, and is known locally as \\"oxide\\". .... The compact variety has a deep brown colour, is slightly vesicular, and frequently contains fragments of roots, stems, and other vegetable remains which have been enclosed during the deposition of the oxide. It also sometimes includes grains of sand.\\" The iron ore deposit led to the establishment of the Fitzroy Iron Works in 1848. This was the first commercial iron smelting operation in Australia and is widely regarded as the beginning of the iron and steel industry in Australia, The \\"oxide\\" limonite from the Mittagong deposit was also used in the 19th and 20th Centuries to purify town gas by removing noxious Hydrogen Sulphide from the gas. In March 1941, a shortage of shipping, under wartime conditions, made it sensible to mine local sources of iron ore in New South Wales, rather than rely upon ore carried by sea from South Australia. The Mittagong ore body, although relatively small, lay close to a rail connection to the Port Kembla steelworks and was the closest local deposit to it. Approximately 14,000 tons of ore was mined during 1941, from a location close to the spring.341x341px = Township of 'New Sheffield' = A later incarnation of the Fitzroy Iron Works, when the blast furnace was built in the 1860s, led in turn to the foundation of the township of New Sheffield, one of the small townships that were precursors to Mittagong. = Tourist attraction = Despite its proximity to the iron ore mine and the Fitzroy Iron Works—until that works closed for the last time on 1 July 1896—the Chaybeate Spring was already an attraction from the mid-19th century onwards. Around the time of Governor FitzRoy's visit in 1849, there were already moves to exploit the spring and it was reported that \\"invalids from Sydney and other parts will have the advantage of these waters, combined with an invigorating and cheerful atmosphere\\". Following Governor Fitz Roy's visit, the water was analysed and advice given that it was best drunk as soon as possible after it emerged from the spring. While working for the Mittagong Land Company, in 1884, Edward Larkin improved the recreational facilities at the Chalybeate Spring, which lay on the company's land, and added a pipe to allow visitors to more easily obtain its water. The spring was one of the reasons for the establishment of a railway station at Mittagong. The NSW Railway Tourist's Guide of 1889 (page 26) states that at Mittagong, \\"There are several chalybeate springs, one of which, near the town, flows into a bricked well, whence it is dispensed to invalids and others\\". The water of the spring became well known. A newspaper article in 1909 attested to the popularity of the spring, \\"The chalybeate springs right in the town are being availed of at all hours of the day. All who partake of the cool, sparkling mineral water are unanimous In their praise of its curative and invigorating properties. Many, indeed, are recommended by their medical advisers to visit the town for the sole purpose of availing themselves of a course at the chalybeate spring.\\" A newspaper article in 1921 described the facilities at the spring as follows:\\"The spring has been enclosed. There are summer-houses and seats, and provision made so that invalids taking the waters may rest and picnic, procuring refreshments on the spot. The waters have proved extremely beneficial to visitors, and are dally attracting others from all parts. The local Tourists' Association, recognising Its value, has taken great pains to make the spot comfortable and attractive.\\"  Decline and disappearance  By 1938, mineral springs were no longer fashionable and the Chalybeate Spring at Mittagong had slipped from public consciousness. The iron ore mine and the Chalybeate Spring had co-existed for many years. The Fitzroy iron ore mining operation had been on a small scale, commensurate with the small capacity and sporadic operation of the 19th-century iron-works. In 1941, iron ore was again mined from a location close to the spring. Despite assurances that the spring would be protected, the mining activity caused the Chalybeate Spring to ‘deviate’ from its pre-war position. The land on which the Chalybeate Spring flowed had always been privately owned. In 1945, Nattai Shire Council was asked to approve a plan to erect poultry sheds at the site of the spring. In 1948, the spring was \\"now enclosed in a fowl run.\\" However, in 1962, it was still possible to collect water for a chemical analysis. By 1986, the land on which the spring lay was owned by the Mittagong RSL Club. In 1986, the club sold the land to the Wingecaribee Shire Council at below commercial rates. The land around the spring was set aside as the Mineral Springs Reserve. A small museum, the Mineral Springs Historical Centre, was built to commemorate the Fitzroy Iron Works. A visitor to Mittagong in October 1988 noted that, \\"Next to the RSL Club is the Mineral Springs Historical Centre. In front of the building is a cairn beneath which the \\"healing\\" waters of Mittagong's famous Lady Fitzroy mineral spring have been retapped\\" and that the springwater was \\"freely available to all, flowing continually from a brass tap.\\" The Mineral Springs Historical Centre was open for less than a year in 1988. When precisely the spring ceased to exist is unclear. In 2005–2006, remains of the Fitzroy Iron Works were uncovered prior to the construction of the Highland Marketplace shopping mall. These remains are now preserved within the carpark of the shopping mall. The focus of preservation and commemoration of the iron- works therefore moved to the north side of the Old Hume Highway, perhaps leaving the Mineral Springs Reserve with less justification for its existence. The Wingecarribie Shire Council's local environmental management plan of 2010 rezoned the Mineral Springs Reserve (Lot 33, DP9299), from 'public open space' to ‘operational land. In 2011, an application was put to the council, which had suffered huge losses on its investments during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, to subdivide the land. On the westernmost lot, the former museum building became the Wingecarribie Aboriginal Community Cultural Centre in July 2012. The other lot was destined to go to the Mittagong RSL Club; it is still vacant land with the appearance of parkland.  Legacy and remnants  153x153px Wet ground and grass-covered iron oxide mound at the site of the former Mineral Springs Reserve – Jan. 2019 There is an interpretive sign with information about the spring and the history of the land, outside the former Mineral Springs Reserve near the entrance to the Mittagong RSL Club from the Old Hume Highway. The name of the nearby Springs Resorts—owned by the Mittagong RSL Club—refers to the old spring, There is still a significant amount of iron ore—deposited over millennia by chalybeate springs—on the southern side of the Old Hume Highway, at the western end of the former Mineral Springs Reserve and under nearby houses along the Old Hume Highway. Bare patches of the hillside are rust-coloured and ironstone rock outcrops in places. The Fitzroy Iron Works—built to exploit the iron ore—was important in the development of Mittagong, and left its own legacy and remnants. A pile of ironstone rocks, some rust-coloured buried concrete, stonework and brickwork, and some vandalised cast-iron lamp-posts—all still present in January 2019, at the top of the hill, in the former Mineral Springs Reserve—are the remnants of the last incarnation of the Chalybeate Spring. The Chalybeate Spring, at least as it was in 1988, no longer exists. A little further down the hill from the pile of rocks—towards the Old Hume Highway—there is a low retaining wall and a patch of permanently wet ground. Just above the wall an oozing chalybeate source has built a small soggy mound of water-saturated iron oxide that is covered in lush grass. It may be all that remains today of the once renowned Chalybeate Spring.

History and culture  Several pā sites exist and Ngāti Hine, Ngāti Naho and Ngāti Pou are associated with marae in the area. In 1863, at the Battle of Rangiriri, the area was lost and, after the invasion of the Waikato was completed, the land was confiscated. Parts were later returned, but most was sold to settlers, or granted to soldiers of the Third Waikato Regiment. The Great South Road came through the area in 1863 and the railway in 1877. =Marae= There are two marae in the area, affiliated with the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāti Tai, Ngāti Kuiaarangi, Ngāti Mahuta and Ngāti Whāwhākia: the Ōkarea Marae and Pokaiwhenua meeting house, and the Taniwha Marae and Me Whakatupu ki te Hua o te Rengarenga meeting house. In October 2020, the Government committed $2,584,751 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Taniwha Marae and 7 other Waikato Tainui marae, creating 40 jobs.

The microbe is believed to have obtained the gene for degradation of porphyran via horizontal gene transfer. The porphyranase encoding gene is believed to have been derived from the microbe Zobellia galactanivorans. Microbes in the gut are responsible for their production of carbohydrate active enzymes or CAZymes. CAZymes are responsible for a variety of functions involving complex carbohydrates such as synthesis, recognition, or metabolism. Moreover, CAZymes are not encoded in the human genome, highlighting the importance of microbes in digestive processes. B. plebeius contains a gene known as BACPLE_01693 which encodes β-porphyranase-A.  Composition of red algae Porphyra  Porphyra is a genus of red seaweed. The two main Porphyra used in Japanese dishes are P. yezoensis and P. tenera which are commonly used in sushi. Porphyra spp. also known as nori in Japan contains compounds such porphyrans and agaroses that are indigestible to people lacking B. plebius. Rhodophyta, the phylum of red algae, has a cell wall composed of sulfated galactans. Agarans, a main component of the cell wall is composed of alternating 3-linked β-D-galactose and 4-linked α-L-galactose. Porphyran is a water-soluble agaran found in Porphyra. The porphyran backbone is composed of roughly 30% 3-linked β-D-galactose and 4-linked 3,6-anhydro-α-L-galactose. The remaining 70% is composed of 4-linked α-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate or 3-linked β-D-galactopyranose.  Function of β-Porphyranase-A  β-Porphyranase-A is a catalytic enzyme that hydrolyzes the (1→4) linkage between β-D-galactopyranose and α-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate in porphyran. Furthermore it contains a TIM barrel domain and two β-sandwich domains.  Comparison of β-Porphyranase-B and β-Porphyranase-A  There is a 35% sequence similarity between β-Porphyranase-B and β-Porphyranase-A. Furthermore, orthologs between Z. galactanivorans and Bacteroides plebeius-1698, a strain of Bacteroides plebeius, contain a sequence similarity of 48%-69%. Homologous genes between other Bacteroides species only have a 30% sequence similarity. Moreover, porphyranase genes in both Z. galactanivorans and B. plebeius are located in similar orders along their chromosome, or are syntenic.

A large number of white flowers are arranged along a drooping flowering stem. It is native to areas between Sulawesi and the southwest Pacific. Description Phreatia paleata is an epiphytic herb with a very short rhizome, threadlike roots and more or less spherical pseudobulbs long and wide. Each pseudobulb has one or two strap-like leaves long and wide. A large number of white, non-resupinate flowers about long and wide are arranged along a drooping flowering stem long. The sepals and petals are elliptic to egg-shaped and spread widely apart from each other. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide, the lateral sepals slightly narrower and the petals shorter and only about wide. The labellum is about long and wide with pimply edges and a triangular tip. Flowering occurs between January and April. Taxonomy and naming The white lace orchid was first formally described in 1877 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach who gave it the name Eria paleata and published the description in the journal Linnaea. In that journal Reichenbach had suggested the name Phreatia paleata and in 1911 Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Kraenzlin formalised the name. The specific epithet (paleata) is derived from the Latin word palea meaning \\"chaff\\". Distribution and habitat Phreatia paleata usually grows on rainforest trees in Sulawesi, the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Norfolk Island, Fiji, New Caledonia, Samoa and Vanuatu. Conservation This orchid is classed as \\"endangered\\" on Norfolk Island under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species are its small population size and changes to the hydrology of the forest where it grows.

Ramanathan (30 December 1895 – 9 March 1970) was an Indian politician who served as the minister of Madras Presidency in the Congress-led government of 1937. He was the founder of the Self-Respect Movement. Early life Ramanathan was born on 30 December 1895 in Kodaivillagam, near Mayiladuthurai in Tanjore District, Madras Presidency, British India (present day Mayiladuthurai district, Tamil Nadu, India). He was educated at Pachaiyappa's College, Madras Christian College and Madras Law College. Political career Ramanathan joined the Indian National Congress to participate in Indian independence movement during his college years. As a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, he was involved in the promotion of Khadi in Madras. He was arrested during the Non-cooperation movement for his participation. In 1922, when some members of the Congress decided to contest the elections, they formed the Swaraj Party. Some Brahmins in Madras, led by Rajagopalachari, welcomed the move, but a group of non-Brahmins, led by Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and Ramanathan, opposed it. In the party meeting of 1925, Ramanathan proposed a resolution, on behalf of Ramasamy, for proportional representation to the non- Brahmins but it failed. After the failure of the resolution, Ramanathan founded the Self-Respect Movement to safeguard the interests of non-Brahmins. He became the secretary and invited Ramasamy to took the leadership of the movement. He felt that Gandhi was favouring Brahmins in the Congress and he opposed the Gandhi's views on varnashrama dharma (caste system in India). In September 1927, Ramanathan and Ramasamy met Gandhi to solve the issues but it did not make any impact on both sides. In the same year, he left the Congress party. The English newspaper named Revolt was started in 1928 with Ramanathan as its editor to propagate ideas of the Self-Respect Movement. Ramanathan and Ramasamy went on a tour of the Soviet Union and Europe in 1931–1932. During their stay in Soviet Union, according to Anaimuthu, a follower of Ramasamy, they were scheduled to meet with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on 28 May 1932. However, \\"Ramanathan's contact with Trotskyites had infuriated the apparatchiks and they were therefore asked to leave immediately\\". In London, Ramanathan translated Lenin's On Religion into Tamil, which was later published in Kudi Arasu, a Tamil weekly magazine. Ramanathan rejoined the Indian National Congress in 1936. He was elected from the Mayavaram constituency in 1937 Madras Presidency Legislative Assembly election. He became the Minister for Public Information and Administration Reports in the Rajagopalachari cabinet of 1937–1939. In 1947, he wrote a book titled Gandhi and the Youth, in which he criticized the ideas of Gandhi on caste and Khadi. He retired from politics and died on 9 March 1970.

Education and early career Kneeland was born in Brooklyn, studied at the Packer Collegiate Institute, and graduated from Vassar College in 1911. After graduate study at Teachers College, Columbia University, she taught nutrition at the University of Missouri beginning in 1914. In 1917 she returned to graduate study at the University of Chicago, working there with Hazel Kyrk. She taught at Barnard College from 1918 to 1919, and at Kansas State Agricultural College from 1919 to 1922. At Kansas State, she headed the department of household economics. After beginning her government work, she completed a doctorate in 1930 at the Robert S. Brookings Institute of Economics and Government at Washington University in St. Louis. Government work The US Bureau of Home Economics was founded in 1923 as part of the United States Department of Agriculture, and Kneeland joined the bureau in 1924. There, she headed its division of economics. Her work there involved analysing household work, expenditures, and consumption, and comparing rural households with the urban middle class. Through time-use research, she showed that homemakers were overworked, and that then-modern home appliances had not significantly reduced the amount of time they spent on housework. She also pushed back against the idea that the scientific management principles of industrial factories were an appropriate way to reduce the inefficiencies of housework. In 1934 she became implicated in a political scandal when Indiana educator William Wirt attacked the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt in a story published by the New York Times. Wirt claimed that insiders within Roosevelt's circle had admitted that the New Deal was designed to fail in order to provide a pretext to crack down on Roosevelt's political enemies and overthrow the government in collusion with the Soviet Union, then led by Joseph Stalin. In Congressional hearings, held in response to these accusations, Wirt stated that he had heard these things from Kneeland at a dinner party. However, Kneeland denied that she had spoken to Wirt on the subject, other witnesses corroborated her story, and the investigating committee concluded that Wirt's claims were \\"untrue in every sense\\". After 1935, she worked for the United States House Committee on Natural Resources. She moved to Palo Alto, California in 1960, where she lived in her retirement. Recognition In 1949 Kneeland was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association for being an \\"outstanding worker in the field of statistics of income distribution\\". Personal life Kneeland never married; in 1938, Time Magazine described her as \\"a small, hard-working spinster\\". Alison Laurie argues that Kneeland participated in a trans-Pacific romance with New Zealander Elsie Andrews, whom she met in 1934 at the conference of the Pan-Pacific Women's Association in Honolulu. However, they did not meet again, and although Andrews' later writings attest to a continued attraction to Kneeland, there is little evidence for the same from Kneeland.

The game features 64-player matches starring anthropomorphic animals who use a variety of weapons and firearms from a 2D overhead perspective and was built using the Unity game engine. An early version was launched on Steam Early Access on December 12, 2018, with a free-to-play demo version released the following month in January 2019. Gameplay Super Animal Royale is a 2D, top-down, third-person battle royale shooter where up to 64 players compete to be the last person standing using a variety of weapons. Players create a character from one of several \\"Super Animals\\", including different breeds and colors of various species, which are unlocked by collecting animal DNA awarded after each match. Experience points are granted based on the player's performance at the end of each game, which allow them to level up and gain access to new potential species. Cosmetic items can also be obtained that can be used to customize an animal's appearance such as shirts, hats, mustaches, and glasses. After joining a lobby, players mingle in a non-combat area until the match begins, with non-player bots joining the queue if less than 64 human players are present a few seconds before the start of the game. Each combatant parachutes from a large eagle onto a battlefield containing weapons, protective armor, and Health Juice which can be stocked to restore health when needed. Initially wielding a katana, players can find automatic and semi- automatic guns and ammunition along with grenades used to defeat other players. Hamster balls can also be entered for protection as well as running over opponents. Poison gas will creep in from the outer edges of the map as the match progresses, forcing players into progressively smaller areas until the end of the game. Each game can be joined solo, as a duo, or as a squad. Development Super Animal Royale began development in October 2017 by members of Pixile Studios. The game was inspired by similar shooter games such as H1Z1 and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, with its 2D aesthetic taken from \\"classic top-down adventure games.\\" Lead designer Michael Silverwood and lead developer Chris Clogg built the game in Unity, and created the line-of-sight mechanic of hiding players in object's shadows by modifying an existing Unity plugin to aid with performance. Silverwood stated that his decision to have the game feature cartoon animals was that he liked the absurd humor of juxtaposing whimsical, colorful characters with surprisingly angry and violent personalities. Sign-ups for the alpha version began in March 2018, where players could register on the title's official website. A later version of the title was released on Steam Early Access on December 12, 2018, which launched with a \\"Free Weekend\\" promotion for the following four days. On January 3, 2019, a permanent free-to-play demo version was released which allows players to transfer their progress and unlocked content to the full, paid version of the game when purchased.

Her mother was famed gossip columnist Louella Parsons.  Biography  Louella Parsons and her daughter Harriet Parsons, 1959 = Beginnings = Harriet was born in 1906 in Burlington, Iowa, the daughter of Louella Parsons and her first husband, John Dement Parsons. She appeared as \\"Baby Parsons\\" in several movies, which included The Magic Wand (1912), written by her mother. Harriet attended Wellesley College, graduating around 1929. = Writing = She began working as writer for Metro-Goldwyn Mayer in 1928 but left after a year to become a columnist and associate editor for Photoplay as well as writing for other magazines such as Liberty. She left to write for Hearst's International News Service and Universal Service in 1931 and worked there until 1933, when she went to work for Columbia Pictures as a producer. She wrote for The Los Angeles Examiner from 1935 through 1943; had a syndicated column for Hearst from 1938-1940 (Hollywood in Review); and had her own weekly radio show on NBC in 1938, Hollywood Highlights. = Producer career = In 1933, she began working for Columbia Pictures producing their Screen Snapshots documentary shorts and in 1940 she moved to Republic Pictures, directing and producing a series of documentary shorts called Meet the Stars, in which she commented on the goings-on of Hollywood A-listers. She produced her first feature film, Joan of Ozark, in 1942 and was then hired by RKO as a feature film producer in 1943. When Howard Hughes took over, Parsons was one of the only producers he kept on. She worked at RKO for 12 years, although the experience was a frustrating one: The studio often reassigned stories she'd chosen to other producers. She was one of only three female producers active in the United States from 1943 to 1955 (the others being Virginia Van Upp and Joan Harrison). In 1956-7 she worked for 20th Century Fox Television. She also co-produced Benn Levy's play Rape of the Belt on Broadway in November 1960. = Personal life = In 1931, she and actor Edward Woods announced their engagement; it was broken off by 1932. She married actor and playwright King Kennedy in September 1939; the couple separated in 1944. Parsons sued him for divorce in March 1945, citing cruelty. Parsons adopted a daughter, Evelyn Farney, who would become a dancer. She was a co-founder (with her mother) of the Hollywood Women's Press Club and was a director and member of the entertainment committee member of the Hollywood Canteen during World War II. = Death = She died in 1983 at the age of 76 after suffering from cancer for two years.

A storage space for fireworks of the MS Vuurwerk BV company ignited and exploded. There were 2 deaths, 20 or 30 non-fatal injuries and the explosions caused heavy structural damage in a large surrounding area. Although the direct cause of the explosion was never determined, scientists from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) did find contributing factors which led to such an unexpectedly powerful explosion and so much damage. However, the TNO's recommendations for stricter safety precautions for the production and storage of fireworks have not been carried out, due to fragmented responsibility for fireworks regulations placed in different governmental organisations, and a lack of urgency and resolve amongst the officials involved. The failure to amend policy led to the much larger Enschede fireworks disaster that happened nine years later (13 May 2000).  Course of events  = Location and construction = The MS Vuurwerk BV factory was located 50 metres east of the Diefdijk, a north–south dyke which forms the municipal and provincial border between the municipalities of Culemborg (province of Gelderland) in the east and Vianen (then province of South Holland, since 2002 province of Utrecht, since 2019 as part of Vijfheerenlanden) in the west. The company was housed in two buildings: the first one containing a bunker dating from the Second World War (which remained intact during the disaster), an office, an assembly hall (25 by 16 square metres) and 5 small storage rooms. The second building, 20 metres to the east, was completed in 1990 and had only been in operation for a few months when the calamity occurred. It consisted of an assembling hall (20 by 12 square metres), four storage rooms (no. 6, 7, 8 and 9) and two workrooms (no. 3 and 4). The storage room walls were made of 0.2 m thick unreinforced concrete blocks, while the ceiling consisted of concrete hollow core slabs. The inner wall of the cavity walls were also concrete blocks while the outer wall was brickwork. The assembly hall was composed of steel trusses covered with asbestos plates. = Background = The owner, Henk Koolen, had been working in the fireworks business for 15 years, and achieved a good reputation within the Netherlands and abroad. Nearby residents including Cornelis (Kees) Uittenboogaard had unsuccessfully protested against the fireworks factory's construction in the 1980s. A number of petitions were presented and Uittenboogaard even fought a legal battle against the factory up until the Council of State, but to no avail. It proved to be particularly difficult to prevent the factory's establishment because he and most other close residents of MS Vuurwerk lived on the South Holland side of the dyke, and thus could not influence the decision-making of the municipal and provincial authorities on the other side. In the run up to and the aftermath of the disaster, victims from Vianen complained that their interests had all too often been overlooked. = Explosions and fires = On 14 February 1991, around 11:50, a heavy explosion occurred in an outbuilding of MS Vuurwerk. Most likely, there were actually two explosions within 20 seconds of each other, the second one much stronger than the first. An enormous air pressure wave ensued, which caused major structural and bodily damage in a vast area around it. There was also a pitch-black cloud of dust which, according to Uittenboogaard, lasted for 5 to 7 minutes and obstructed all vision. The first thought of many residents was that war had broken out and a bombardment was taking place, or something like an airplane had crashed. For hours on end, fireworks continued to ignite, with new small explosions as a consequence, until late in the afternoon. At the time of the catastrophe, seven employees were present in the factory. Of these, five were able to escape, including the owner Henk Koolen, co-worker Aat Boeschoten and a female secretary. The two remaining employees were initially reported as missing, later in the day it became clear they had been killed by the explosion. In a radius of approximately 5 kilometres surrounding the fireworks factory, window panes shattered or trembled dangerously. The air pressure wave was so powerful that cars driving by on the A2 motorway 100 metres away were almost blown off the road. = Firefighting efforts = EOD Wheelbarrow in 2006. The fire brigade arrived soon and closed down the perimeter. However, no one knew what kind of materials were stored inside the compound, or how high the risk of another huge explosion was. Especially in the still-intact bunker where many unexploded fireworks were stored. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal service (EOD), which, coincidentally, was headquartered in Culemborg until 2011, deployed a \\"Wheelbarrow\\" observation robot for reconnaissance. This robot tried to find a sign of the two missing persons while also attempting to determine whether it was safe enough for firefighters to approach the fire. The firefighters had to wait until either the 'end of the afternoon' or the 'beginning of the evening' until they were given permission to start extinguishing efforts, when the EOD deemed the danger of further explosions to be over.  Aftermath  = Victims and damage = There were two fatalities: factory owner Henk Koolen's daughter and her husband. Reportedly, 20 to 30 people sustained non-lethal injuries. Furthermore, a couple of dogs, kept as pets by nearby residents, were killed. The disaster also inflicted long-term psychological damage upon nearby residents. Structural damage was estimated at 4 million Dutch guilders (1992). MS Vuurwerk was only insured for 1 million guilders. Some neighbours, such as livestock farmer Cornelis (Kees) Uittenboogaard and farmer J. Martens, were sufficiently insured, but most of the victims did not have enough insurance, or for religious reasons had decided not to insure themselves at all. One year later, legal struggles about who had to pay which damages were still ongoing. = Clearance and reconstruction = The army was deployed to aid in clearing the debris from the explosion. In the first three days of the operation, the soldiers had already gathered 22 tonnes of rubble in the surrounding fields. Not only was the area riddled with numerous pieces of brick, concrete, metal, wood and glass, but also asbestos. Dozens of families were housed in temporary homes for years. Reconstruction was hindered by the fact that no party could be held responsible, and thus it was impossible to determine whether the victims should be paid indemnities from the insurance companies or the government. It was not until 29 March 1993 that nearby residents received word that they would be paid damages. The insurance companies of the factory repaid a million guilders to the injured parties and the factory itself paid another 300,000 from its own assets to cover all damage. Meanwhile, the municipalities of Culemborg and Vianen demanded another 700,000 guilders in compensation, primarily for the removal of asbestos pollution in the environment. Because it was found out that the damage sustained by the residents was estimated too high and did not amount to 1.3 million but rather 660,000 guilders, the municipalities, who were recognised as injured parties, eventually received 550,000 guilders of indemnities at the end of March 1993. Nevertheless, the nearby residents claimed even more compensation for the extra costs they had incurred for matters such as temporary housing. = Documentary = Journalist Hans Polak made a documentary in the months after the disaster, called Vuurwerk aan de Diefdijk (\\"Fireworks near the Diefdijk\\", 1991) for the VARA programme Impact. The film focuses on the clearance, reconstruction and emotional processing of nearby residents, as well as on the responsibilities of local government, including the handling of damage claims and allowing a possible rebuilding of the factory. = Factory reconstruction cancelled = To the great distress and annoyance of the overwhelming majority of nearby residents, Koolen has long maintained plans to rebuild his fireworks factory. Because it had never been determined that MS Vuurwerk had made mistakes, the municipality could not obstruct his plans when he intended to reconstruct his factory on the very same location. He also made a few preparations in doing so. In the end Koolen decided against it, sold his business to his colleague Aat Boeschoten, and died a few years later in 1996. As of 2016, the terrain of the exploded factory, unchanged but overgrown since the early 1990s, is still in the hands of a granddaughter and grandson of Koolen. There were no plans for the terrain, but they did not intend to build another fireworks factory.  Investigation and consequences  = Cause of the explosions = In April 1991, the TNO Prins Maurits Laboratorium published a report on the Culemborg fireworks disaster, commissioned by the Ministry of Defence. TNO concluded that relatively light fireworks in large quantities caused an unexpectedly heavy explosion, because they were no longer contained within their packages. Moreover, the fireworks had been misclassified as belonging to the risk class 1.1. In the end, the direct cause of the explosions has never been determined, but experts later mostly support the hypothesis that a spark caused by static electricity probably led to fire. As soon as there was a fire burning, a destructive chain reaction ensued. TNO concluded that there probably had been two major explosions, the first occurring in storage room 6, quickly followed by the second in storage rooms 7, 8, and 9. This is derived from the facts that two craters were found, with concrete plates from the crater under rooms 7, 8 and 9 shoved over those under room 6, and the crack patterns in the concrete floors in front of the four rooms. Another fact is that most, but not all, witnesses testified having heard two explosions within 20 seconds of each other, the second being much more powerful. In April 1993, the direct cause of the explosion had still not been discovered, making it unclear whose responsibility it was. Eventually, after much struggle, all parties involved agreed to a compromise regarding repayments. = Quantity of powder = Nearby residents had always been told only 50 kilograms of powder were stored in the factory, but because of the powerful blast, initial assumptions hypothesised many more. Exactly how many and which kind of explosive substances and products were kept inside at the time of the disaster has never been clarified. As of 2001, the consensus amongst experts, including the Openbaar Ministerie in Utrecht, research institute TNO, and inspectors and colleagues in the fireworks business, was that there had 'presumably' not been more than the permitted 200 kilograms of gunpowder present in February 1991. Once every two to three weeks, an inspector visited MS Vuurwerk, who, according to then- commander H. Kapel of the Corps Inspectors Dangerous Substances (an inspection service within the Ministry of Transport), would have noticed it if the maximal quantity had been exceeded. Therefore, TNO's conclusion was that fireworks obtained significantly more explosive power when assembled and modified. Because the fireworks had also been misclassified, the factory contained much heavier fireworks than the company's licence allowed for. = TNO recommendations; reflection after 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster = The April 1991 TNO report made several recommendations to the four government ministries involved in order to improve fireworks safety. These comprised, amongst other things: * Fireworks should be stored much further away from built-up areas than was common at the time. * Testing of major fireworks, regarding their classification, should happen seven times: 'from fabrication via transportation, modification, assemblage, storage, once again transportation and usage.' * Discouraging applying the same risk class to the transportation phase as to the succeeding phases, 'especially when the firework is no longer stored in the packaging and modifications to the fireworks have been done.' As soon as the fireworks are taken out of the packages and modified, they must be reclassified. On 13 May 2000, a similar but much larger fireworks disaster happened in Enschede at the S.E. Fireworks factory, leading to 23 deaths, about 950 injuries, and the complete devastation of the entire residential area of Roombeek. In response, it was almost unanimously concluded that these could have been prevented or better controlled if the lessons from the Culemborg fireworks disaster had been converted into more rigorous safety measures. Everyone wondered why this had not occurred. Investigations showed that little to nothing was done with TNO's recommendations, because the ministries and inspection services 'had communicated badly with each other, or not at all', Interior Minister Klaas de Vries admitted in 2001. The 15 January 2001 investigative report of the Firefighting Care and Disaster Control Inspection of the Ministry of the Interior, titled Onderzoek vuurwerkramp Enschede. Follow up Culemborg (\\"Enschede fireworks disaster investigation. Follow up Culemborg\\"), attempted to answer the question ‘To what extent have the conclusions and recommendations, proceeding from investigation into the 1991 fireworks explosion in Culemborg, resulted in actions?’. The report revealed that the TNO report was first presented to the Ministry of Defence, which serves an advisory role when granting licences to fireworks companies. But the Defence service for Environmental Licences did not consider urging stricter rules to be part of its job. In a 1991 letter, Arnhem-based advocate general Korvinus warned his superiors at the Ministry of Justice about other fireworks storage facilities throughout the Netherlands, but this ministry did not regard fireworks storage as its task. The Dangerous Substance Accident Control service from the Interior Ministry did seek to introduce stricter regulations for fireworks, which was discussed in several meetings of the Commissie Preventie Rampen door gevaarlijke stoffen (CPR, Dangerous Substances-borne Disasters Prevention Commission), but that was part of the Firefighting department, which at the time was supposed to focus on extinguishing fires, not on controlling risks. Rules surrounding the storage of fireworks were seen as the responsibility of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM). During ten CPR meetings conducted from 12 September 1991 until 31 March 1994, the subject of fireworks was deferred every time, and eventually eliminated. A February 2001 evaluation report revealed that the CPR was barely interested in fireworks. After investigation by TNO, the topic was put back on the CPR agenda in 1995; a working group was established to revise the fireworks directive, but the ministries involved did not provide funding and personnel for it. In 1999, the CPR decided to repeal the current fireworks directive. While waiting for a new directive, the Ministry of Defence's office, which advised municipalities on issuing licences to fireworks companies, acted on its own accord. However, the office appeared to barely function properly. Because of this bureaucratic maze with fragmented responsibilities, almost nothing was done with the TNO recommendations, and no extra safety measures were taken until after the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster. Since the explosion of the Culemborg fireworks factory in 1991, almost all 26 Dutch fireworks companies operated outside of populated areas; as of 2000, a few were located on the outskirts of urban areas. At the time, the choice of location for fireworks companies was a municipal responsibility. S.E. Fireworks was the last company still operating in the middle of a residential area. The municipality of Enschede commanded a relocation, scheduled for 2002, due to a desire to build more houses on the current factory grounds; safety was of secondary concern.

Most's call of the play has been dubbed by the NBA as \\"the most famous radio call in basketball history.\\" Background John HavlicekHavlicek was in his third year with the Celtics, and had already won two NBA championships with the team under coach Red Auerbach. In a run that would span a total of 11 championships in 15 years (including four before Havilicek joined the team) with center Bill Russell among a lineup of future Hall of Fame members, Auerbach singled out his swingman Havilicek as the \\"guts of the team\\". Other standouts on the team included Tom Heinsohn, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, John Thompson, and Satch Sanders, all of whom would be named to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Entering the playoffs, the Celtics had won the Eastern Division regular season championship, which granted them a bye into the division finals. Their opponents would be the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by star center Wilt Chamberlain, a player they had acquired just that season in a mid- year trade. Chamberlain, who had previously played for the prior Philadelphia team, the Philadelphia Warriors, was something of a local hero and was also noted for his long rivalry with the Celtics center Bill Russell. Philadelphia had its own cast of future Hall of Famers to support Chamberlain, including Hal Greer and Chet Walker. The 76ers played the Cincinnati Royals in a five- game series for the opening round of the playoffs; they defeated the Royals in four games to advance to the conference finals against the top-seeded Celtics. During the first six games of the seven-game finals series, the Celtics and 76ers alternated victories on their home courts to tie the series at 3-3 and bring on a deciding game seven. The final game was held at the Boston Garden on April 15. Boston had trailed by one point at half time, but had turned it around in the third quarter and held a healthy 11-point lead in the waning minutes, with Havilicek and teammate Sam Jones accounting for over half of the Celtics 110 points. In a flurry of late scoring, Chamberlain took control of the game and scored 10 consecutive points to bring the game to 110-109 with five seconds to go. Following Chamberlain's last basket, the Celtics center Bill Russell inbounded the ball from under his own basket, attempting a long pass down the court, however the high pass hit a guide wire holding up the basket. As a result, Philadelphia got the ball under its own basket, putting them into position to take the lead. The play Philadelphia put the ball in the hands of guard Hal Greer. Greer first looked to Wilt Chamberlain, however the long-armed Bill Russell was guarding Chamberlain closely, frustrating Greer's attempt to get him the ball. That left Greer's best target as forward Chet Walker, who was being covered by Havlicek. Havlicek was playing a bit off from Walker, giving Greer an opening to inbound the ball. By rule, a player has only five seconds to inbound the ball, and with Greer looking first to Chamberlain and waiting as long as possible before changing his mind, Havlicek counted silently down to four and, anticipating Greer's pass, broke toward Walker. Greer's high lob to Walker was cut short when Havlicek leaped and with his right hand deflected the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who dribbled out the rest of regulation. As the buzzer sounded, Jones passed the ball back to Havlicek, who launched a half-hearted shot towards the basket, it inconsequentially fell to the floor as time expired, preserving the win for the Celtics, and giving them the Eastern Division championship en route to their seventh straight NBA championship. In what has since been named the greatest call in the history of basketball, radio announcer Johnny Most became increasingly animated as he called down the final five seconds of play: > Greer is putting the ball into play. He gets it out deep and Havlicek steals > it! Over to Sam Jones! Havlicek stole the ball! It's all over! It's all > over! Johnny Havlicek is being mobbed by the fans! It's all over! Johnny > Havlicek stole the ball! At the conclusion of the game, an elated Boston crowd rushed the floor, lifting Havlicek on their shoulders and marching him around the court. Legacy The steal is marked as one of the greatest moments in NBA history. Sports Illustrated ranked it as the #61 moment in all of sports. The New England Historical Society dubbed it the greatest broadcast moment in basketball history. Havlicek went on to become the Celtics' all-time leading scorer with 26,395 points in a Celtics record 1,270 games played. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984. Johnny Most would be a radio fixture for Celtics games for decades to come, finally retiring in 1990. Amongst the retired numbers in the rafters at the Celtics home court is a microphone in Most's honor. After his death, he was awarded the Curt Gowdy Media Award by the Basketball Hall of Fame for his on-air contributions to basketball, including the Havlicek call.

This species was first described as Silybura shorttii by Richard Henry Beddome, in 1863. It is found only in the Shevaroy Hills of Salem district in Tamil Nadu state in South India. This species was misclassified into Uropeltis ceylanica, a snake endemic to the Western Ghats, for a long time, till a recent taxonomic study proved it to be a distinct species with a very narrow geographic range. It is a burrowing snake, presumed to be nocturnal; feeding on soft-bodied worms. Becomes active during the rains. This is a \\"data deficient\\" species, as it is yet to assessed for its conservation status. Description A small (< long) dark bluish black coloured burrowing snake, with distinct yellow cross bands across. Rostral visible from above, smaller than nasal, not completely separating nasals; nasals in contact with one another posteriorly, prefrontals not in contact with rostral, subequal in size to nasal and ocular scales; nasals pierced by nostril, divided by rostral anteriorly but in contact with each other posteriorly; prefrontals somewhat larger than nasals and oculars, subequal to frontal; frontal longer than broad, distinctly smaller than parietal; parietals large, largest of all head scales; supralabials 4,4 (left, right), 1st and 2nd ones small, 3rd below eye, 4th the largest; infralabials 3,3 (left, right), elongate; mental scale small, subequal to 1st infralabial, but as wide as long; body scales imbricate, cycloid; dorsally around body in 19 (one head length after neck): 17 (at midbody): 17–15 (one head length before vent) rows; ventrals 141–156 (148.5±10.6), angulate laterally; anals 2, left overlapping right, each larger than a body scale; subcaudals 10–12 pairs +1 terminal scale; tail shield distinctly truncate above, mildly concave, circumscribed and ridged; covered with 30–31 (30.5±0.7), bi- and tri-carinate thickened scales; 10 scales across the length and 4–5 (4.5±0.6) across the width of the tail shield. Colouration  The dorsum is dark coffee brown with distinct bright yellow cross bars formed by series of yellow blotches across consecutive scales in dorsal scale rows; 34–47 (41±7.0) such cross bars present on body and tail; venter largely yellowish with dark brown spots and blotches, the dark spots restricted mostly to either side where ventral scales contact the outermost coastal scale rows; a pair of thick yellow stripes anteriorly along the neck and forebody on scale rows 3–5, the stripes extending to the level of the 36th–48th (42±8.4) ventral scale; the stripe passing through lower half of supralabials, below the ocular scale and upper half of infralabials; eye pale whitish-grey; inside of mouth pale pink; tongue of same colour, its tips lighter.

He served as a chaplain following his ordination and celebrated clandestine Masses and other services during the Spanish Civil War leading to his arrest. It was during his imprisonment that he saw the need to better evangelize to bring the Gospel message to those that either rejected or did not know about God while also seeing it as his objective to minister in prisons. He did this in the time after his release from prison until near the end of his life when he retired upon the significant decline of his health. The steps to initiate his beatification cause started in the 1990s soon after he had died but the cause launched in 2001 therefore enabling for him to be titled as a Servant of God. He became titled as Venerable on 21 December 2018 after Pope Francis recognized that Hernández had practiced heroic virtue during his lifetime. Life Doroteo Hernández Vera was born on 28 March 1901 in Matute de Almazán to poor parents Santiago Hernández and Juana Vera. He was baptized on 29 March in the Assumption parish and it was done in haste because it had been feared that he had been born almost half-dead therefore was in danger of a premature death. From the age of four he felt called to enter into the priesthood and in 1915 commenced his ecclesial studies in Sigüenza that ended in 1925. He received his sacerdotal ordination to the priesthood on 20 March 1926 in Tarazona from Bishop Isidro Badía Sarradell (he celebrated his first Mass on 26 March) and then commenced his pastoral activities in Soria; he served first as a chaplain for the Sacred Heart College but would serve as a chaplain for most of his ecclesial life. Hernández was arrested on 14 April 1937 following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (he was conducting clandestine Masses and other services during this period for the faithful) but was released from prison that following 26 August; it was during that time that he realized his purpose was to minister to prisoners but to find methods of better evangelizing the message of the Gospel to the faithful and to those that either rejected or did not know about God. Following his release he started to assist prisoners condemned to death since his imprisonment left a lasting impression on what his duties as a priest meant. He started a small group of working-class women dedicated to evangelization but conserving their secular state as opposed to making them part of a religious congregation. He founded the secular institute Cruzada Evangélica in Santander on 8 December 1937 and it became a pious association in 1938 after the Bishop José María Eguino Trecu approved its founding. But in 1942 the bishop forced them to become a formal religious congregation (in contradiction of the institute's original intent and mission) since secular institutes had no legal ecclesial form until Pope Pius XII formalized them in 1947 in his apostolic constitution Provida Mater Ecclesia. The institute later received formal diocesan approval in Santander on 18 May 1951 and received formal papal approval over two decades after from Pope Paul VI on 8 December 1976. In 1942 fire spread in Santander resulting in people losing their homes and schools being burnt down. This also left a great number of people living on the streets prompting Hernández to begin efforts to see the construction of two new schools for the children. He also began collaborating with Catholic Action in Santander around this stage. Hernández died on 6 November 1991 in Madrid following a long and painful illness (he suffered from cerebral atherosclerosis that affected both swallowing and his speech); his institute has since spread across the world to places such as Bolivia and Zambia. Beatification process The institute's General Council in Madrid in their meeting held on 18 December 1999 decided to lodge a formal request for the cause for the late priest's beatification to be introduced. The official request was made to the Bishop of Alcalá de Henares Jesús Esteban Catalá Ibáñez who then approved the appointment of the Dominican priest Crescencio Palomo Iglesias to be the first postulator for the cause on 8 February 2000. The cause was launched on 2 January 2001 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree thus issuing their assent to the cause being opened and titling Hernández as a Servant of God. The diocesan investigation into his life and reputation for holiness (as well as gathering his spiritual writings) took place from 3 February 2001 until 12 June 2004 with the evidence being sent to the C.C.S. in Rome. The C.C.S. validated the diocesan phase on 30 November 2006 after determining that the tribunal adhered to the C.C.S. regulations for conducting causes. The Dominican priest Vito Tomás Gómez was appointed as the postulator at this stage. On 21 November 2016 the postulation submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. Cardinal Prefect Angelo Amato so that the C.C.S. could investigate the cause further. Theologians approved the cause after assessing the dossier as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members sometime following this.

She founded SoapBox Labs in 2013, a company that applies artificial intelligence to develop voice and speech recognition applications that are specifically tuned to children's voices. It builds language learning appliances for education like text reading and speech therapy, and modules for toys, gaming, voice control, augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics, and the Internet of things. As of 2015 she is CEO of SoapBox Labs, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. The startup raised $3.6 million.  Education  Scanlon holds a PhD in digital signal processing and electronic engineering. She executed research for Columbia university, IBM, University College Dublin, and Nokia Bell Lab in Dublin.  SoapBox Labs Voice Technology for Kids  The off-the-shelf voice technology found in devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home are built primarily for adults, using adult voice data. Kids have higher pitched voices and unpredictable speech patterns. Unlike adults, kids also won't adapt their speech to ensure they are understood by voice-controlled user interfaces and smart assistants. Voice technology based on adult voice data models performs poorly when used by kids, and the younger the kid, the poorer the performance. “The voice technology used in mobile phones or other devices isn’t nearly sophisticated enough to be used with children\\". \\"While people are probably familiar with speech recognition for adults, in voice assistants or in smart speakers, our technology has been built specifically for children, and that’s modelling their voices and speech behaviors using state of the art AI technology” SoapBox Labs uses deep neural network-based speech recognition technology to analyze children's speech in real-world noisy environments SoapBox Labs has created its own unique children’s speech dataset (consisting of thousands of hours of children’s speech data), and combined this with the team’s understanding of children’s voice and behaviors. The resulting platform is said to leverage deep learning (AI) techniques to power the startup’s proprietary models and scoring algorithms, and ultimately provide far better speech technology targeted at children  Awards  Soapbox Labs was awarded a 1,5 million euro grant by EU SME in 2017.

Design  Canon FD 55mm ƒ1.2 AL element diagram The FD 55mm ƒ/1.2 AL uses a variation of the double-Gauss lens design, in which the positive meniscus element of the front Gauss pair is aspherical.

Variants  In March 1975, Canon introduced a multicoated version of the lens, known as the FD 55mm ƒ/1.2 S.S.C. Aspherical.  Radioactivity  Like a number of other contemporary lenses, the Canon FD 55mm ƒ/1.2 AL incorporated thoriated glass, a kind of optical glass that is doped with thorium dioxide. The inclusion of this compound makes the glass radioactive. Over time, thorium decay causes F-centers to form in the glass, resulting in an amber discoloration.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History In the mid-1800s, Wilhelm Roethke served as the head forester on the estate of Otto von Bismarck's sister in Pomerania. He resigned in 1870 and move to Berlin, where he established a flower shop. In 1872 or 1873 he emigrated to the United States, along with his wife Bertha and their three sons, Emil, Carl, and Otto. Roethke settled in Saginaw, where he opened a market garden and florist shop. In 1882, he purchased the 20-acre parcel where these houses now stand, and constructed a series of greenhouses to support the business. By 1901, the business was much expanded, and Carl and Otto were running it. The entire family lived together on their property. In 1904, Carl Roethke constructed a fieldstone- walled house (now 1759 Gratiot) near the greenhouses and moved into it with his family. Otto Roethke followed suit in 1911, constructing a hip-roof Colonial house (now 1805 Gratiot) for his family next to his brother's house. The elder Roethke died in 1911, leaving the florist business to Otto and Carl. By this time it was a large operation, employing 25 people. The brothers ran it until 1922, when Otto's heath began to fail. Carl bought out his brother, but died himself the next year, leaving his widow Margaret to run the business. The firm lasted into the 21st century. The Otto Roethke house at 1801 Gratiot is particularly notable as the childhood home of Otto's son, poet Theodore Roethke. He lived in the house from 1911, when it was constructed, until he entered the University of Michigan in 1925. Description The Roethke Houses are located side by side at 1759 and 1805 Gratiot Avenue, respectively. =Carl Roethke House= Carl Roethke House The Carl Roethke House is a one-and-one-half-story gable-front building. The first floor is covered with uncoursed cobblestones; the gables on the second story are covered with patterned wood shingles. The house has two porches: one at the front and one at the rear. A gable dormer with flaring eaves is located on the west slope of the roof, with a three-sided bay window projecting below on the house's first floor. On the east side is a two-story bay, with a gable roof with flaring eaves above and an entrance on the first floor below. The windows inf the house are asymmetrically placed. On the first floor, the windows and doors are set in segmentally arched frames. On the second floor, a row of three, single-pane windows separated by Tuscan columns is located in the peak of the front gable, above a pair of double-hung, one-over-one windows. Four multi-light windows in a small dormer are behind the gable roof of the two-story bay. =Otto Roethke House= Otto Roethke House The Otto Roethke House is a two-story hip-roof Colonial Revival structure with symmetrical, central entrance facade and clapboarded-covered walls. It has wide boxed eaves and a brick-clad foundation. On the front facade, a single hipped-roof dormer is located in the center of the roof. A porch on the first floor with Tuscan columns runs almost the entire width of the house. At the rear is a two-story enclosed porch topped with a hip roof. The overhanging second story of the porch is supported by three thin metal posts.

The predecessor East Central district had a whole grade-sharing agreement in which East Central sent students in grades 7-12 to the Northeast Community School District. Northeast later sued the new Easton Valley district after that district stated that the grade-sharing agreement was no longer in place as Easton Valley was not the same district as the former East Central, and therefore had refused to pay Northeast related costs. The Northeast district began asking for compensation after the Iowa Supreme Court decided that the grade-sharing agreement was still in place; Northeast argued that the contract had been breached. In 2015 a settlement was reached involving Easton Valley paying Northeast $450,000. The leadership of what would become Easton Valley was seeking to close the Sabula school due to potential future upkeep costs and because of how old it was; it was to retain the Miles school. The Sabula school remained vacant until 2015, when the Easton Valley board voted unanimously in favor of demolishing it.

The long border includes the Himalayan territories as well as Indo- Gangetic Plain. The current border was delimited after the Sugauli treaty of 1816 between Nepal and the British Raj. Following Indian independence, the current border was recognised as the border between Nepal and the Republic of India. Description The border starts in the west at the western tripoint with China near the Tinkar Pass. It then proceeds to the south-west through the Himalayas, the Sivalik Hills and then the Gangetic plain, initially overland and then utilising the Sharda River. Just east of Majhola it turns to the south-east and proceeds in that direction overland, occasionally utilising various rivers and hill crests. North-west of Islampur the border turns to the north-east and proceeds overland to the eastern Chinese tripoint. History Areas ceded by Nepal as part of the Treaty of Sugauli The border region has historically existed at the edge of various Indian and Nepali kingdoms. It took its modern shape during the period of British rule in India which began in the 17th century. During the late 18th century the Nepali kingdom launched an expansion drive, bringing them into conflict with the British and resulting in the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-16). Nepal was defeated, and by the Treaty of Sugauli it was forced to cede large areas of land to Britain, effecrively creating the modern India-Nepal boundary. Finding the Terai region difficult to manage, the British returned parts of it to Nepal in 1816. India gained independence in 1947, and three years later it signed a friendship treaty with Nepal, by which both countries agreed to respect the territorial integrity of the other. Since then relations have largely been cordial, though a number of border disputes remain. There have also been occasional blockades on the border at times of tension, for example in 1987 and 2015. Border disputes There are two existing territorial disputes between India and Nepal, over the Kalapani territory, a area at the India–Nepal–China trujunction in North West Nepal, and Susta, a – area in Southern Nepal. : \\"Kalapani, 35 square kilometres piece of land, is entangled in controversy since mid-1996, a few months after the ratification of the Mahakali treaty (with India on the harnessing of hydro-power) by Nepal's Parliament.\\" Nidhi Jamwal, As a river changed its course, a village on the India-Nepal border became disputed territory, Scroll.in, 19 March 2017: '\\"An area of some 5,000 acres [approximately 2,023 hectares] of land in Narsahi-Susta area adjoining the Gandak river in West Champaran district has been encroached upon by Nepalese nationals....,\\" is how the then Union Minister of External Affairs answered a question in the Lok Sabha in 2002. Shrestha, however, alleged that over 14,860 hectares of Nepali land in Susta has been encroached upon by India.' In addition, in May 2020, Nepal has begun to dispute the source of the Kali River, claiming it to be at Limpiyadhura, and allocating of Indian territory to itself through the issue of a new map. It did not explain why this dispute newly arose. Sugam Pokharel, Nepal issues a new map claiming contested territories with India as its own, CNN, 21 May 2020. Border crossings There are several major border crossings that the Indian Integrated Check Posts (ICP) use for processing cargo customs and immigration entry for citizens of third countries.

Indian and Nepali nationals do not need passports or visas to enter each other's countries, and tens of thousands of people cross the border every day for tourism and shopping. The Indian side of the border is regulated by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) along with local police. The Nepali side of the border is regulated by the Armed Police Force (APF) along with the local branch of Nepal Police. Often SSB (India) and APF (Nepal) perform joint patrols on the border. On a local level, Indian and Nepali district officials meet regularly to discuss security challenges and other issues on their respective border portions. Such meetings are usually attended by District Magistrates, local SSB representatives, customs chiefs from India including the Chief District Officer (CDO), local APF, Police and custom chiefs from Nepal.

Name The point has also been known as Brown's Point (1812), Silverdale Point (1818) and Lindeth Point (1828); the name Jenny Brown Point was in use on an 1829 estate plan and was used by the Ordnance Survey from 1848. The identity of Jenny Brown is uncertain, though a daughter Jennet was born in 1628 to Robert Walling of Dikehouse, the farm at the point, and married Robert Brown (or Browen or Browne); one of their daughters was Jennet (born 1665), named Jennye in her father's will. It has been said that Jenny was a lover waiting for her lost sailor to return, a nanny who saved her charges from the tide, a lodging-house keeper, or a steam engine (or \\"jenny\\") sent to Brown's Point. Chimney A nearby chimney, sometimes described as a tower, is grade II listed and has been the subject of archaeological and archival investigations. It is now believed that the chimney is most likely to be the remains of a short-lived copper mining and smelting project set up by Robert Gibson in the 1780s. He was Lord of the Manor of Yealand and incorrectly assumed he had the right to mine for copper at Cragfoot, inland from the point, on land owned by the Townleys of Leighton Hall. The copper was processed in a reverberatory furnace at Jenny Brown's Point of which the remaining chimney was part. The whole operation was abandoned in 1788 after lawsuits, and Gibson died in 1791. Walduck's Wall Near the point there exists what is left of Walduck's Wall, an attempt to reclaim an area of land between the point and Carnforth: work began on the project in 1877 and ceased in 1879, and the stones were hidden under the bay's shifting sands for many years before re-emerging in 1975.

Proposed as a candidate for the Presidency of the Community of Madrid by the President of the Assembly of Madrid, Juan Trinidad, who had previously prevented an investiture session for Ángel Gabilondo by scheduling an investiture session without a candidate in July 2019, Díaz Ayuso was sworn in as President of the regional government on August 14, with 68 votes in favour (corresponding to members of the Popular, Citizens' and Vox parliamentary groups in Madrid) and 64 against (corresponding to members of the Socialist, Más Madrid and United We Can- Madrid en Pie parliamentary groups). In January 2020, she hired Miguel Ángel Rodríguez as chief of staff. Her vice president, Ignacio Aguado, then explained his disagreement with the decision. Six months after her inauguration as President of the Community of Madrid, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Spain with special virulence in the Community of Madrid. In accordance with the state of alarm decreed by the Spanish government on 14 March 2020, the government of the Community of Madrid, like the other autonomous communities, took immediate measures [required clarification] such as the closure of schools and leisure centres, shows and sports events, retired people's day centres, religious celebrations, the closure of hotels and tourist accommodation, shops considered not to be of basic need and the limitation of travel to those needed to go to work or buy food. It also adopted protection measures in public transport, and tax reductions in the payment of Business Tax (IAE) and Property Tax (IBI) for leisure, hotel and commercial premises, travel agencies and large stores, on the condition that they maintain the jobs until the end of the year. Presential activity was suspended in all Community Citizen Service offices, and teleworking was encouraged. In view of the saturation of hospital services, hotels in Madrid were medicalized for minor patients. Ayuso stopped appearing before the Madrid Assembly on 5 March 2020, and the chamber was closed for more than a month. Ayuso was criticized for delivering high-quality FFP2 and FFP3 protective masks to the citizens of the Community of Madrid for free, which arguably could provoke that these kind of masks became scarce in hospitals — it later was revealed that hospitals were also well supplied with this equipment. Ayuso opposed his government partner's, Citizens party, request for the army to intervene in the homes of the elderly. However, the army ended up entering the homes, against her own criteria, finding corpses and people \\"in extreme situations and in poor sanitary conditions\\" during Covid-19 epidemic. Also in March 2020, after the declaration of the state of alarm, Ayuso proceeded to terminate the contracts of all the concessionaires of school canteens, and hired for 2 months fast food franchises such as Telepizza, Rodilla or Viena Capellanes to feed the children of families that had a reduced price in the canteens because they were beneficiaries of the Minimum Income of Insertion (RMI). In May 2020, her Director General of Public Health, Yolanda Fuentes, resigned, disagreeing with Ayuso's decision to request the transfer from phase 0 to phase 1 of the confinement, because it was not based on \\"health criteria,\\" a position Ayuso reportedly took after a meeting with businessmen.

At one time East Central had a whole grade-sharing agreement, in which East Central sent students in grades 7-12 to the Northeast Community School District. East Central residents had the option of instead attending Preston Community School District's secondary school in an open enrollment scheme, although most secondary students attended Northeast. =Merger and aftermath= By 2012 there were discussions on merging with Preston, and Robert Lagerblade, the superintendent of the Preston district, presented a report stating that there would be a better financial system. The district's area education agency, Mississippi Bend Area Education Agency, received a petition of over 1,200 people who wished to schedule an election that would determine whether East Central and Preston would merge. Mississippi Bend accepted the petition, and in June 2010 scheduled a vote for the fall of 2010. East Central sued Mississippi Bend for determining the election time. Mary E. Howes, the judge of the Jackson County District Court, stated that Mississippi Bend AEA had the right to determine the time of the election. East Central decided to submit an appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court, with three school board members voting in favor and two voting against. Voters in both districts approved the merger, by 776–122 in the Preston district and 620–598 in the East Central district. The anti-merging group Opt4EC had asked for a recount of East Central ballots, but the recount found no difference in the numbers. On July 1, 2013, East Central merged with the Preston district to form the Easton Valley Community School District. Therefore, the Easton Valley secondary school in Preston became the default high school, and Easton Valley residents who wished to remain at Northeast would have to participate in a new open enrollment program. The Northeast and Easton Valley districts later entered into a lawsuit as the new Easton Valley district stated that the grade-sharing agreement was no longer in place as it was not the same district; in 2015 a settlement was reached involving Easton Valley paying Northeast $450,000. The leadership of what would become Easton Valley was seeking to close the Sabula school due to potential future upkeep costs and because of how old it was; it was to retain the Miles school. The Sabula school remained vacant until 2015, when the Easton Valley board voted unanimously in favor of demolishing it.

DVOT is commonly used to treat conditions such as cluster headache, which affects up to four in 1000 people (0.4%), and is a recommended first aid procedure for several diving disorders. It is also a recommended prophylactic for decompression sickness in the event of minor omitted decompression without symptoms. Medical uses =Cluster headache= High flow oxygen therapy, delivered at a rate of between 7 and 15 litres per minute, has been recognized as an effective treatment for cluster headache since 1981. Since then, several double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, crossover trials have provided further clinical evidence for its efficacy. When inhaled at 100% at the outset of a cluster headache attack, high flow oxygen therapy has been proven to abort episodes in up to 78% of patients. Inhaling 100% oxygen is recommended by the European Federation of Neurological Societies as the first choice for the treatment of cluster headache attacks. The British Thoracic Society and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, among other organisations, endorse the therapy. =Diving disorders= *Decompresiion sickness, as first aid during transport to recompression facility. *Omitted decompression, with or without symptoms of DCS. As prophylaxis where recompression is not practicable. Equipment A portable administration set will comprise a portable high-pressure oxygen cylinder containing sufficient gas for the expected treatment, with an oxygen service cylinder valve, an oxygen compatible first stage regulator with pressure gauge, intermediate pressure hose, and demand valve with mouthpiece. =Equipment for cluster headache treatment= Demand valves have been proven to be particularly effective at delivering high flow oxygen therapy. Unlike conventional breathing systems, oxygen demand valves only deliver gas when the patient inhales and shut off the flow when they exhale. Exhaled gas is directed to the atmosphere through side vents. This means that almost 100 percent of the oxygen is inhaled, while the amount of exhaled carbon dioxide that the patient rebreathes is minimized. Demand valve function Demand valve exhalation Demand valve inhalation Compared to other mask types, demand valves have been better at achieving pain relief at 15 minutes in the first cluster headache attack. =Equipment for diving first aid= For diving first aid an oxygen compatible diving regulator may be used if a special purpose oxygen treatment demand valve is not available. Technical divers routinely use such equipment for in-water decompression. When used in diving recompression chambers and multi-place medical hyperbaric chambers, a built-in breathing system venting to the exterior is generally used to avoid buildup of oxygen partial pressure in the chamber to dangerous levels which would otherwise require more frequent venting. Procedure Contraindications Hazards and precautions High oxygen concentrations in the surroundings constitute a fire hazard. Oxygen therapy should be accompanied by good ventilation and avoidance of ignition sources, and where reasonably practicable, removal of combustible materials. Oxygen firebreaks are a requirement in some countries for patients using oxygen therapy.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Saginaw Armory in the early 1900s In 1903, the passage of the Dick Act spurred the state of Michigan to revamp its laws covering the state National Guard. By 1907, the new laws in place provided a fund for the construction local armories for the use of National Guard units. In 1908, Saginaw received $20,000 of the available $40,000 in state monies toward the construction of a building to house the local National Guard and Naval Brigade. The city hired architect William T. Cooper to design a building, and approved the expenditure af an additional $10,000 to cover additional construction costs. In 1909, the construction contract was awarded to John H. Qualmann of Saginaw; ground was broken in April of that year. Dirt from the building site was dumped nearby along the river to make a park and parade ground. The building was completed by 1910. The Armory remained occupied by Company B of the Michigan National Guard until 1983, when the unit moved to a new suburban facility. During this time. it was renovated in the 1950s; likely when the crenelations at the top of the building were removed. After the National Guard moved, the building was sold multiple times, and occupied by businesses. It was renovated in 2009. Description The Saginaw Armory is a three-story castellated Late Gothic Revival brick structure with a large raised basement and an attic above. The building is topped with a stone-capped parapet wall (originally crenelated) and five-sided towers on each corner. On the main facade, a central entrance bay extends from the mass of the building, and contains a recessed entrance within a round arch. Above, a segmental arch rises two stories, containing a window in each story. A small corbelled turret is located in one corner of the bay. In the remainder of the facade, stone stringcourses run between the first and second floors, between the third floor and the attic, and at the base of the parapet wall. The windows in the basement and first floor are one-over-one units with square tops and stone sills. The second and third floor windows are two-over-two double-hung wood units with four-pane transoms at the second floor and two-pane transoms at the third floor. The windows are in square top openings on the second floor and segmental-arch openings on the third. The attic level contains a row of oculus windows set within round arches.

Design and construction The Class 745 was designed to meet the need for a low axle-load locomotive capable of providing adequate motive power on the Salerno–Reggio di Calabria railway, a curvy line with some severe inclines, whose importance had increased with the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-2, but whose antiquated infrastructures tolerated only a 14.4 t axle load. Locomotives such as the 2-6-0 Class 600 and Class 625 then used were struggling with the increasing loads even when double heading; the 2-8-0 Class 730 and Class 740 would have had the required tractive effort and moderate axle load, but had a limited top speed, while faster locomotives such as the 2-6-2 Class 680 and Class 685 had an excessive axle load, and not enough tractive effort. Therefore, the design effort focused on a 2-8-0 locomotive with larger driving wheels and a relatively large boiler.Cornolò, p. 398-400Kalla-Bishop, p. 74 The Class 745 sported driving wheels, the same as the Class 625, as well as the Italian bogie; from those, it also borrowed the peculiar engine layout, with two inside cylinders with outside steam chests and valve gear, to keep the weight down. However, this arrangement ended up being the Achilles' heel of the locomotive, as the cramped arrangement (with the driving rod linked to the second coupled axle, being therefore rather short) causing the bearings to often run hot. The tender provided was the standard FS bogie tender, but to avoid problems with the lightweight bridges on the line they would serve the water capacity was reduced to ; in the following years, as the line's infrastructure was improved, the capacity would be raised to the standard .Cornolò, p. 400-2Kalla-Bishop, ibidem The first batch of twelve locomotives was outshopped by Gio. Ansaldo & C. and Ernesto Breda between 1913 and 1914; another 36 locomotives would be built by Ansaldo in 1919, while a final 25 locomotives were built between 1922 and 1923 by the two firms, with the latter batch having left-handed drive as opposed to the previous right-hand drive.Cornolò, p. 401 Operational history The Class 745 helped obviate the need for motive power on the Tyrrhenian railway, especially on the 1-in-43.5 incline between Agropoli and Vallo della Lucania, as well as on the Reggio Calabria- Taranto line, although with time the increased loads on the former eventually forced to resort to double-heading for the heaviest trains; for this reason, the FS electrified the line in 1935. The Class 745 was transferred in sheds such as Ancona, Naples and Udine; the last ones were assigned to Padua till the mid-1960s, when they were scrapped. None survived into preservation.Cornolò, p. 401-2Kalla-Bishop, p. 74-5 Notes Bibliography Category:2-8-0 locomotives 745 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1913 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Italy ","title":"FS Class 745"},{"id":"59693762","text":"Filip Firbacher (born 21 December 2001) is a Czech football player who plays as forward for Hradec Králové in Czech National Football League.

It starts from Khlong Lat Bang Kruai (Khlong Bangkok Noi) near Wat Chaiyaphruek Mala, flows along the border of Nonthaburi's Bang Kruai with Taling Chan and Thawi Watthana of suburban Bangkok, then flows through Phutthamonthon to meet the Tha Chin River at Ngio Rai Subdistrict in Nakhon Pathom's Nakhon Chai Si District. Its length is 28 km (about 17 mi). History Connecting Bangkok Noi Canal and the Tha Chin (Nakhon Chaisi) River, the 28 kilometre-long Maha Sawat Canal was created as a shortcut to Phra Pathom Chedi and to open up land on both banks to agriculture. In 1852, King Rama IV ordered the restoration of Phra Pathom Chedi and assigned Somdej Chao Phraya Maha Prayoonrawong and his son, Chao Phraya Thipakornwong Maha Kosathibodi (Kham Bunnag), to supervise the digging of the Chedi Bucha and Maha Sawat canals.

The cerebellar vermis is either absent or only partially formed, and fusion is seen in varying degree between the cerebellar hemispheres, fusion of the middle cerebellar peduncles, and fusion of the dentate nuclei. Findings range from mild truncal ataxia, to severe cerebral palsy. Rhombencephalosynapsis is a constantly found feature of Gomez-Lopez- Hernandez syndrome. One case of which has shown a co-occurrence with autism- spectrum disorder. Genetics An association with mutations in the MN1 gene has been reported in cases of atypical rhomboencephalosynapsis. Pathology Rhombencephalosynapsis is a rare brain disorder of malformation of the cerebellum that may be detected on ultrasound of the fetus. The vermis is either absent or partially formed. There is dorsal fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, fusion of the dentate nuclei, and fusion of the middle cerebellar peduncles. The degree of severity of this disorder is associated with the degree of maldevelopment of the cerebellar vermis. Aqueductal stenosis commonly exists with the disorder, as does its often resulting hydrocephalus. In some cases additional abnormalities may be present, such as ventriculomegaly (enlarged ventricles), and supratentorial abnormalities. Clinical Clinical indications range from mild truncal ataxia with unaffected cognitive abilities, to severe cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Neuroimaging Rhombencephalosynapsis can be detected on imaging of the fetus. It is one of the triad of features characteristic of Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome. When detected, signs of GLHS ought to be looked for on post-natal review. Signs include partial alopecia and some facial peculiarities. It is thought that due to the co-occurrence of these two disorders they may have a common etiology. As a feature of GLHS one case study has shown GLHS to co-occur with autism spectrum disorder. Epidemiology As of 2018 only 36 cases have been reported. History The first case was reported by Heinrich Obersteiner in 1914.

She is also remembered for establishing Kvindernes hus (the Women's House) which opened in Kolding in 1922. Clay Pedersen was active in the International Alliance of Women, participating in their 1929 conference in Berlin. Biography Born on 27 May 1862 in London, England, Helen Clay was the daughter of the lawyer Samuel Hobbs (1834–1888) and Martha Clay (1838–1916). She met her husband-to-be Anders Simonsen Pedersen (1868–1958) in London where he was studying gardening. She returned to Denmark with him in 1893 and they married that September, settling in Kolding. In 1897, they established Aalykke, their gardening business with a flower and vegetable shop managed by Clay Pedersen. The Kolding branch of the Danish Women's Society was established in 1905. After becoming president in 1908, Clay Petersen set about arranging the 1912 Kvindernes Udstilling i Kolding, a national exhibition of women's achievements in arts and crafts. The exhibition was a great success and a fine introduction to the Women's Society meeting the same year at which Jutta Bojsen-Møller called for rapid progress on women's voting rights. Her next major project was the establishment of the Women's House in Kolding which opened in 1922. It was the first time the Women's Society had built their own facilities, 14 years earlier that Copenhagen's Women's House. In 1929, Clay Petersen attended the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference in Berlin where she was one of those who created Open Door International, designed to support married women's working rights. The following year she headed the Danish version known as Den åbne Dør. After heading Kolding's branch of the Women's Society for 35 years, she retired in 1945, becoming an honorary member for life, as well as an honorary member of Den åbne Dør. Helen Clay Pedersen died on 16 April 1950 in Kolding. The Danish Women's Society placed a remembrance stone on her grave.

Each user hosts their own content and the content of the peers they follow, which provides fault tolerance and eventual consistency. Messages are digitally signed and added to an append-only list of messages published by an author. SSB is primarily used for implementing distributed social networks, and utilizes cryptography to assure that content remains unforged as it is propagated through the network.  History  SSB was created by Dominic Tarr in 2014 as part of experimental development in alternative databases and distributed systems. Dominic lived on a sailboat with unreliable internet connection, and became interested in creating an offline-friendly secure gossip protocol for social networking. The word scuttlebutt is slang for \\"water-cooler gossip\\" among sailors. SSB gained popularity on the wave of privacy controversies raising against the traditional social media.  Protocol  Secure Scuttlebutt operates as a database of immutable append-only feeds, which allows resilient replication over the Internet, local area networks, and sneakernets. Messages are hashed with SHA256 and verified with an Ed25519 signature; this makes it impossible to forge a message without the private key of the author. Users only download messages from peers that they follow (and optionally friends of friends), which prevents harassment and spam. This makes the network invite-only, meaning that new peers who join the network aren't visible until someone follows them. User content in SSB is organized as an append-only sequence of immutable messages, where messages cryptographically sign adjacent messages for the purpose of guaranteeing unforgeabilitity of the sequences as they are replicated to other peers. SSB peers exchange asymmetric keys and establish authenticated connections between each other using an Authenticated Key Exchange protocol, Secret Handshake.  Applications  The reference implementation is written in JavaScript with Node.js. There are also active implementation efforts in Go (github/cryptoscope/ssb), Python (github/pferreir/pyssb), and Rust (github/sunrise-choir/meta). Many independent applications have been implemented on SSB, including a social network, music sharing, chess, a Git subsystem, and an npm registry.

It has specifically been described as an episode of intense anxiety amongst seal hunters fishing on one-man boats. It has additionally been associated with the Iglooik Inuit of Northern Canada who are said to suffer wild hallucinations of mythical spirits including visions of a ‘sea ermine’. History Kayak angst, also known as nangierneq in the Inuit language, has been described since the 1960s and was initially noted as an issue faced by hunters out alone on a calm sea or lake, especially with the sun directly overhead or shining directly into their eyes. Episodes often occur in foggy or overcast conditions as the sky is reflected on the still, mirror-like water surface, making it difficult to distinguish the horizon and determine up from down. In other circumstances, a number of hunters observed in early studies also reported to be equally affected in rough-weather conditions, such as storm or wind. 'Kayak hunter' in the East Greenlandic dialect is synonymous with 'man' and was considered a rigorous but sought after medical and physical test of ones abilities; Kayak angst was said to be experienced by an estimated 10-20% of these seal hunters, although it had no provable cause or cure. Speculation as to why the condition developed have ranged widely, from a possible hereditary defect among the people of Greenland to a form of post- traumatic stress syndrome caused by the constant life-and-death trials involved in solo seal hunting. No satisfactory reasoning from such disparate ideas have been reached within the research community. Symptoms A loss of direction, helpless feelings and psychophysiological responsivity are characteristic of kayak angst. A sensation of cold, rising from below, can make the kayaker feel as if the boat is filling with water. The lone hunter may also feel overcome by an intense fear of drowning, although it has been reported that this particular effect may be diminished upon seeing another hunter or by returning to land. Avoidance behaviours (i.e. becoming reluctant to go on future hunting expeditions) are likely to manifest on subsequent hunting expeditions before such behaviour transitions into a total incapability of hunting in the long-term. It has also been hypothesised that sufferers may be predisposed to other conditions, such as mountain dizziness, and their resistance to such related-afflictions becomes somewhat depleted after a bout of kayak angst. The most successful way for a lone seal hunter to break the effects of kayak angst is reported to be vigorously and strenuously continuing to paddle; this can be initiated by first rocking the boat and then working towards more sizeable thrusts. Those who have survived agree that it is far more beneficial to move than remain stationary if afflicted. With modern changes to the traditions and cultural expectations in Inuit hunting rituals, it is believed that this particular condition is likely to have become far less common than in previous years. Due to the specificity of its characterisation, kayak angst can be considered to be an example of a culture- bound syndrome. Some argue kayak angst is an example of what would now be termed panic disorder with agoraphobia.

She was the first woman elected to state legislature from her district and one of the first in the state. Early life Mary Zeola Hershey was born October 22, 1878 in West Salem, Ohio to John and Carrie Stephenson Hershey. She attended the United Brethren College in Westerville, Ohio and King's School of Oratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Political career Hershey Misener was a feminist and suffragist who helped organize Indiana's League of Women Voters and for several years served as vice-president. She spoke at the League's 1926 regional convention. She was elected to the Indiana General Assembly in 1928, the first woman to be elected from her district and one of the first in the state. She was one of three women in the Indiana State House in the 1928—1930 term. Charles Roll in his 1931 history of Indiana called her \\"one of the prominent Republican women of the state.\\" While in the legislature, Hershey Misener \\"was a leader in several stirring political battles.\\" Hershey Misener first achieved notoriety in March 1929 when, as a freshman member of the General Assembly, she sponsored Indiana's first voter registration law and blocked a Senate effort to kill it. She appeared uninvited on the floor of the Indiana Senate during a \\"midnight session\\" while some senators were claiming the governor had requested they recall the bill.

Bush ruled her out of order. She said, \\"That's all right. I've said everything I want to say anyhow,\\" and left the floor to applause. After her departure, when the lieutenant governor refused to address her comments, a group of senators staged a walkout. When the Senate requested the General Assembly to recall the bill, Hershey Misener told the General Assembly, \\"You can kill this bill if you want to, but if you do the Republican party will be to blame.\\" Personal life Hershey Misener married Michigan City News publisher Herbert Roy Misener in Chicago on February 6, 1906.

A lead video-single 'The Third Arm' was released on 5 October 2018. It is the 4th consecutive Antimatter studio album to be written entirely by Mick Moss, the previous 3 being Leaving Eden, Fear of a Unique Identity and The Judas Table. Background Due to touring fatigue, Mick Moss put the Antimatter live band on semi-hiatus beginning in March 2017, and set to work on the 7th Antimatter album, which was tentatively titled 'Refraction'. Speaking in the 2018 documentary 'Finding Enlightenment', Moss says that he \\"had known for a long time exactly what the 7th Antimatter would be about\\". Speaking in December 2018 to Progressive Music Planet - \\"The concept is about how I used to view LSD and cannabis when I was in my late teens/early twenties, and the irony of how I ended up actually suffering from a deep existential crisis, coupled with psychosis, panic attacks, chronic paranoia, derealisation and agoraphobia, despite the fact that I was convinced those drugs were the path to enlightenment.\\" The writing period lasted for a year, during which time the title was changed from 'Refraction' to 'Black Market Enlightenment'. Speaking with Headbangers Lifestyle - \\"I decided very early on that I would not reach into my archive of unreleased songs whatsoever (something I haven't done since 2003's 'Lights Out'), thus forcing myself to create an entirely new work from a blank canvass. I also decided that I would try and write away from the acoustic guitar as much as possible in order to draw something new out of myself. After that, it was just, get free. Get free. Let the music come and let it be what it wants to be. Let the songs with the strongest identities float up to the top, regardless of what style of music they are.\\" Recording As with the majority of his own Antimatter recordings, Moss elected to perform the core instruments of guitars, bass, synths and e-bows himself. Guest musicians were drafted in in the form of Fab Regmann (drums), Carla Lewis (vocals), Julie Rodaway (flute), Paul Thomas (saxophone) and Vardan Baghdasaryan (qamancha). The song 'Existential' features a posthumously released vocal cameo by the late Aleah Starbridge. Recording began on the first day of May 2018 at Gates Of Dawn Studio, Boos, Germany, where the drums were laid down. The rest of the album was recorded at Moss' Wyresdale Studios, Liverpool, England, except for qamancha, flute and saxophone. Speaking of the latter instruments for Headbangers Lifestyle - \\"I planned to have a sax (on Leaving Eden) and then I ran out of time... and the same thing happened album after album. It almost happened again this time but I forced myself to make the effort to find somebody before the clock struck midnight. Paul Thomas was amazing... As for the qamancha, I was on my way to Armenia to film the promo video to 'The Third Arm' and I asked Andre Simonian (The Beautified Project) if he could find me a session musician who played qamancha. At that point I didn't even know what the instrument was called, I'd just heard in on movie soundtracks like 'Gladiator' and 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'. Vardan Baghdasaryan did an amazing job. Same thing with Julie Rodaway on the flute. I just wanted this album to stand apart from the rest of the discography, and I felt that the whole lead-guitar break, that's been done to death since 'Eden...' and I just wanted to hear something different this time.\\" Recording took five months to complete, and was co-produced between Moss and Daniel Cardoso, who had worked with Moss on his previous five releases (including the Sleeping Pulse album). Artwork The front cover image was created by Mario S. Nevado. The image, similarly to their previous work together 'The Judas Table', was executed by Nevado from a specific concept by Moss, who says he \\"asked for a crash-test dummy in a shitty armchair in a shitty apartment, with the Buddhist 8 arms, each hand holding a different specific item of street drug or street drug paraphernalia ...and in the background, the universe is creeping in...\\". Along with the album's title, the picture reflects the ideological mixing up of spirituality and street drugs. The items in the dummy's 6 outstretched hands are, clockwise L-R, a hash-pipe, a small sheet of 'strawberry' LSD tabs, a rolled up UK £10 banknote, a cheap cigarette lighter, a cannabis joint and a bag of amphetamines. The two lower, central hands are each holding a Rizla cigarette paper, poised to make a 3-paper joint as was common in Liverpool in the 80's and 90's. Release Black Market Enlightenment was released on November 9, 2018, coinciding with the first show on the 'Black Market Tour'.

It was screened in the Premieres category at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. An adaptation of Emma Jane Unsworth's 2014 novel of the same name, the film follows best friends Laura and Tyler whose lifestyle comes under scrutiny just as Laura becomes engaged to a teetotaller. Plot Best friends Laura, a struggling writer working as a barista, and her best friend and flatmate Tyler, an American woman who is estranged from her family, are both heavy partiers living in Dublin. The early part of the film shows their close friendship in their late twenties as they consume large quantities of wine and drugs through the night, sometimes engaging in casual sex with a man but mostly just enjoying each other's company. Tyler is included in Laura's family gatherings, with a pregnant sister (who becomes mother to a baby daughter) playing a part in the plot and character development. Circumstances change when Laura meets and then gets engaged to concert pianist Jim, who shortly afterwards gives up alcohol. Laura continues her partying lifestyle with Tyler, but starts spending nights with Jim. Inevitably the dynamics of the various relationships change, and more so after they become friends with a poet, Marty, to whom Laura is attracted, and his circle of literary friends. Laura struggles to make progress with her novel throughout the film. Various events in each of their lives unfold, with questions about life, and especially women's roles, raised and explored both implicitly and explicitly. With the development of the women's friendship front and centre of the film, it doesn't take the easy route to a typical neat and happily resolved \\"Hollywood ending\\", but ends optimistically with Laura finding her creativity beginning to flow as she finds a way forward. Cast * Holliday Grainger as Laura * Alia Shawkat as Tyler * Fra Fee as Jim * Dermot Murphy as Marty * Amy Molloy as Jean * Kwaku Fortune as Julian * Olwen Fouéré as Maureen * Pat Shortt as Bill Production Hyde said that it was the book which drew her in and inspired her to make the film, giving voice to women's experiences in a way that she hadn't seen very often on screen and in a way that felt connected to her own experience. She and Unsworth worked collaboratively from early in the creative process. The film was made in and around Dublin, whereas the book is set in Manchester. Shawkat said she was drawn to the film owing to its being driven by women, and she was able to bring her life experience into her creation of the character. Both main actors agreed that the personal chemistry between the two worked well on set because they had hit it off in real life. Release After premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2019, where it was well received, the film had its Australian premiere at a \\"pop-up\\" event at the Adelaide Film Festival on 5–6 April 2019. It screened at the Sundance London in June 2019 and opened in UK cinemas in August, attracting good reviews. The release date in Australia is set for 12 September 2019. Reception Sundance said \\"Shawkat’s live-wire performance gives Tyler an anarchic comic edge that perfectly complements Grainger’s soulful turn as the conflicted and creatively blocked Laura\\". The Adelaide Review called it \\"a visually stunning and often surprising film\\". IndieWire’s Kate Erbland said that Grainger and Shawkat are wonderful together, and that the film \\"revels in the messiness of life, and the many love stories it can contain”. Variety’s Guy Lodge hailed the comedy as a commercial leap forward and wrote of its \\"ideally matched stars\\" and said that it compared favourably with the \\"more superficially subversive female leads of comedies like Trainwreck\\". The Hollywood Reporter’s Leslie Felperin found Unsworth’s script \\"insightful in its treatment of the complexity of female friendships\\". In the UK, The Guardian's Benjamin Lee called the film \\"one that attendees should be breathlessly, excitedly discussing around town, urging everyone else to see immediately\\", and Time Out said it \\"should delight anyone who watches it\\".

Javed likes contemporary rock music, which Malik disapproves of. Javed writes poetry and lyrics for his best friend Matt's band, but Matt critiques Javed's work for being depressing. Javed feels out of place at his new school, where he is one of two South Asian students; the other, Roops, is a fan of \\"The Boss\\". In Ms. Clay's writing class, Javed develops a crush on a student activist named Eliza and becomes interested in the writing assignments. Javed talks to Ms. Clay after class about his poetry and diaries. During lunch Roops approaches him and gives him two Bruce Springsteen s, calling Springsteen \\"the direct line to all that is true in this shitty world.\\" Javed faces constant racism from his peers and neighbours, and Malik forbids him to socialise, insisting he \\"follow the Jews\\" in his school because of their success as a people. Javed is rejected as a writer by the school paper. At the same time, Vauxhall Motors lays off Malik. Frustrated by racism and Malik's inability to understand him, Javed discards his poems on the night of the Great Storm of 1987.

Eliza invites Javed to dinner with her conservative and racist parents who imply that she is only with him out of rebellion. At the Herald, Javed gets paid after an article he wrote about racism is chosen for the front page. Javed uses the money to buy tickets for a Springsteen concert on Yasmeen's wedding day. Before his parents arrive at the wedding, National Front members assault Malik. Upset that Javed withheld money from the family, Malik rips up the tickets.

Back home, Noor tells Malik to reconcile with Javed and reminds him that he left his own family and country at a young age. Eliza recruits Javed's family to show up in support when he reads his winning essay. Instead of reading his essay, Javed talks about how \\"Blinded By The Light\\" mirrors his father's troubles.

The film is based on the memoir The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer. It was screened in the Premieres section at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and began streaming in most territories on Netflix on 1 March 2019. It was selected as the British entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.  Plot  Born in Kasungu, Malawi, William Kamkwamba is a young schoolboy who comes from a family of farmers who live in the nearby village of Wimbe. William also dabbles in fixing radios for his friends and neighbors and spends his free time looking through the local junkyard for salvageable electronic components. Although he is soon banned from attending school due to his parents' inability to pay his tuition fees, William blackmails his science teacher (who is in a secret relationship with William's sister) into letting him continue attending his class and have access to the school's library where he learns about electrical engineering and energy production. By the mid-2000s, failing crops due to drought and the resulting famine have devastated William's village, leading to riots over government rationing and William's family being robbed of their already meager grain stores. People soon begin abandoning the village, and William's sister elopes with his former teacher in order to leave her family \\"one less mouth to feed\\". Seeking to save his village from the drought, William devises a plan to build a windmill to power an electric water pump that he had scavenged earlier. William builds a small proof of concept prototype which works successfully, but to build a larger windmill, William requires his father, Trywell, to give permission to dismantle the family bicycle for parts, which is the only bicycle in the village and the family's last major asset. His father believes the exercise futile and destroys the prototype and forces William to toil in the fields. After William's dog dies of starvation and hope seems lost, William's mother, Agnes, intervenes and urges his father to reconsider. William and his father reconcile while William buries his dog. With the help of his friends and the few remaining members of the village, they build a full-size wind turbine which leads to a successful crop being sown. Word of William's windmill spreads and he is awarded a scholarship to attend school, ultimately receiving a degree from Dartmouth University.

Since the 18th century, the secret oath-bound society called the Whiteboys became very prominent in the Doneraile area. After a collapse of prices for agricultural produce after the Napoleonic Wars, and Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, and high rents of agricultural holdings, a rumour that murders of local landlords of the district was being planned. After a number of local people were indicted, and brought to trial to a special commission, Daniel O’Connell, a famous lawyer and parliamentarian became involved, leading to the discharge of many of the accused. O'Connell's victory was seen one of his greatest triumphs, and added to his national and international reputation. Prelude Three Doneraile landlords were particularly hated for treatment of tenant farmers. They were Michael Creagh, Rear Admiral Evans and George Bond Lowe. During January 1829, a dinner party was held at the seat of Rear Admiral Evans at Oldtown near Shanballymore. After the party, the carriage of Dr. Norcott was mistaken for that of Michael Creagh. The carriage was fired upon. Two coachmen were injured. George Bond Lowe was also shot at when at home in Clogher, and in a second incident, his horse was shot on his way home from Mallow Fair. The landlords in the area arrested over 21 Doneraile men from Doneraile in Co. Cork. They were caught up in a conspiracy, when they were alleged to have been heard in a tent at Doneraile Fair conspiring to kill local landlords. Paid informers provided the evidence. The Trial-Part 1 The Trial started on October 22, 1829 at the County Courthouse in Cork City. Rather than been tried by a Petty Jury, which considers the evidence at a trial, and decides on the guilt or innocence of the accused, the accused were tried by a Grand Jury. This was a system of local administration, controlled by landlords and the legal profession. The Commission was opened by Baron Pennefather and Mr. Justice Torrens. They were accompanied by the High Sheriff and the Solicitor General, Mr. John Doherty. Also in attendance were Crown Prosecutors on the Munster circuit, Sergt. Gould and Mr. Bennet K.C. The prosecution alleged that a number of farmers in the neighbourhood of Doneraile in County Cork had assembled in a tent at a fair in Rathclaire allegedly conspired to murder three landlords. They were overheard by Patrick Daly who had attended the fair as a spy for Colonel Richard Hill. Daly (a former Whiteboy), saw that 22 men were arrested and charged They were brought before the Special Commission with a Grand Jury presided over by Baron Pennefather in October 1829 on On Friday 23 October. The trial commenced on Friday, October 23, when four prisoners were put the bar: John Leary (Rossagh), James Roche (Wallstown), James McGrath (Wallstown), and William Shine (Carker). Five informer or approver witnesses gave evidence for the prosecution, including Patrick Daly (the spy), and Owen (Clampar) Daly, cousin of Patrick. The four were found guilty by the jury, and sentenced to death by hanging. The jury had taken twenty minutes. The Trial- Part 2 On the second day, four more prisoners were scheduled to be put on trial. They were Edmund Connors, Michael Wallace, Patrick Lynch, and Timothy Barrett. As it was Saturday, the trial was postponed until the following Monday. The delay provided time for relatives to again seek to retain Daniel O’Connell, a famous lawyer and parliamentarian. The families and friends of the accused men sent William Burke of Ballyhea to Daniel O’Connell, who was in his home in Derrynane in Co. Kerry. William Burke, the brother of one of the prisoners, John Burke. O'Connell had been asked at the start of the summer to defend the men but he had refused. Because the remaining prisoners were so afraid after the first trial, a further attempt was made, and they collected a sum of 100 guineas to retain him. William Burke, left Cork on Saturday evening October 24, 1829 for s night ride on one horse to O'Connell’s residence in Derrynane, a distance of 90 miles. He arrived at Derrynane at 8:30am. Canon Sheehan in his book, Glenanaar It is a wet, warm night, dark as Erebus; and the twain, steed and rider, knew nothing of the road. All they knew was that they should follow for some time the course of the river which they could hear murmuring on the left as it tore over stones and pebbles on its mad rush to the sea. They were soon splashed with mud from head to heel, and the soft, warm rain had penetrated under and through the light garments the rider wore, that his weight might lie easy on the gallant animal, on whose endurance and swiftness so many lives were now depending. But neither animal nor rider felt aught but the stimulus of some mighty force that summoned all their energies, and would make their success a triumph beyond description, and their failure- well, as the thought of its possibility flashed across the young man’s mind, a great lump came into his throat, and he had to gulp down his emotion. O'Connell agreed to defend the prisoners after hearing Burke, who rested and refreshed his horse. He used the same animal, and reached Cork on Monday morning. The round journey of 180 miles had taken 38 hours. O'Connell set out for Cork that day on a coach with two horses. The roads were very bad, and he travelled the greater portion of the night. He used a light country gig, which he drove himself. He had slept at Macroom for three or four hours, and started off in the morning Morning for Cork, which he did not reach until about ten o'clock. And by three changes of horses he arrived in Cork just as the court was resuming. Baron Pennefather refused to adjourn the case until O’Connell’s arrival. The jury deliberated for over 40 hours and the men were acquitted. The length, compared to the first trial, led the deliberation to be called \\"The Forty Hour Jury\\". Eventually, Timothy Barrett was acquitted. One Catholic jury member, Mr. Edward Morrogh, of Glanmire, was the chief obstacle on agreeing about the other three - Connors, Wallace, and Lynch. By Tuesday evening, the jury was discharged without reaching a verdict, and it was agreed that the re-trial of the three men be postponed until the Spring of 1830. On Thursday morning, October 29, two more prisoners were put forward for trial. They were John Burke and John Shine. Shine's brother, William, had been condemned to death at the first trial, while Burke's brother William had ridden to Derrynane. This jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. The Trial-Part 3 The final trial was held at the end of March, 1830. The three men, Lynch, Connors, and Wallace, about whom the jury had disagreed at the Special Commission, were again tried. Daniel O'Connell was not present. Mr. Deane Freeman, defended the prisoners. Connors and Wallace were acquitted, but Lynch was found guilty and transported to New South Wales. Eventually the conspiracy trails wound down. Daniel O’Connell What ensued went down in local and legal history. For O'Connell, this was his last great trial. It was covered by papers worldwide, and is seen as an important part of his national and international legacy. O’Connell’s court career effectively ended in 1830. Transportation The men who had been sentenced to hanging were instead transported to Botany Bay in Australia . On the 23rd of April 1830, the five men, John Leary, James McGrath, James Roche, William Shine and Patrick Lynch were taken with other convicts from the County Gaol in Cork, for transportation to New South Wales.
