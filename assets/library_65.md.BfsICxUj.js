Design The SB-3 was based on the SB-2 training aircraft and differed in having a huge nose and rather stocky or pot-bellied outlines. The wing was supported by Y-shaped struts, which rested on the oil-pneumatic shock absorbers of the chassis designed by Louis B√©chero (Louis Bechereau), a patent for which he received on July 6, 1922 (No.553710). The mechanism was also equipped with cushion cords hidden in these struts. The SB 3bis had a wingspan of 10 m and a larger wing area (19 m¬≤). The center of gravity of the aircraft was located at 35% of the wing chord length. However, the resistance caused by the thick struts of the first configuration, led Beshero to the need to install braces on the SB 3bis above and below the wing. The motor placed in the center of gravity set in motion a four-bladed screw formed by the intersection of two two-bladed screws mounted relative to each other at an angle of 90 degrees and with a shift in length of 60 cm. However, these displacements relative to the axis resulted in vibrations; to fix this in the gap between the screw and the engine a flat cylindrical screen was placed. The sides of this deformable thin sheet absorbed the spontaneous movements of the screws. Racing contests According to the Rules of the race were supposed to be international, the cup was played in France during two competitions, each of which consisted of a flight at maximum speed at a distance of 300 kilometers. The winner received a prize of 200,000 francs, which was to be divided into two parts, 25,000 francs each (the first was intended for the pilot, and the second for the manufacturer of the aircraft, which showed the best speed in both flights) and two annual awards of 75,000 francs. The races in Istra took place on June 23, 1924, on a circular route 50 kilometers long, whose starting point was the center of military aviation (Center d'Aviation militaire). At the end of May 1924, Beshero had not yet found a pilot for the SB 3bis. Thanks to the assistance of the Assistant Secretary of State for Aeronautics (sous-secr√©taire d'Etat √† l'A√©ronautique), a volunteer was found - Lieutenant Georges F√©rigoule, who was directly in Istra at that time. After the test flight, Ferigul discovered a rather limited lateral control, but admitted that the aircraft had some interesting features. The only drawback was the completely insufficient cooling of the \\"forced\\" engine, which developed on takeoff 800 hp. To solve this serious problem, Salmson has installed a new pump to speed up the passage of water in the radiators. But during the flight, thin radiator strips were crushed by a too powerful pump. A tank with cooling engine water, placed in an L-shaped fairing in front of the pilot, depressurized and burned Ferigulu‚Äôs face. Fortunately, his eyes were protected by flying glasses ... Forced to land. the pilot refused to prolong the competition, which was won by Sadi Lecuant (Sadi Lecointe) on the Nieuport 29, equipped with a 450-horsepower V-shaped Hispano engine. The Sadi Lekuant airplane covered a distance of 300 kilometers in 57 minutes 50 seconds with an average speed of 31.239 km / h. Thus, the premium of 75,000 francs was issued by Soci√©t√© Nieuport-Astra.

The Solemn Opening Celebration of the cause was celebrated on August 28, 2019 at Cubao Cathedral (Immaculate Conception Cathedral of Cubao). Darwin Ramos could become the first non-martyr Saint of the Philippines.There are only two saints in the Philippines, Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and Saint Pedro Calungsod, both who were martyred.

Birth Certificate established in Pasay City (Philippines) Darwin spent his early years with his family along P. Villanueva St., Pasay. Their house was in a slum between EDSA and Libertad LRT stations. Darwin was the second child of a very poor family. His mother worked as a laundrywoman to earn some money to provide for her family while his father was an alcoholic. In order to help his family, Darwin became a scavenger (waste picker) in the street, with his sister Marimar who was two years younger. They spent their day going through garbage to recover plastic waste which they sold. The children did not go to school because of grave financial situation. The initial symptoms of what later would be diagnosed as Duchenne muscular dystrophy appeared. This began as weakness in the legs. Then, his mother noticed that Darwin was stumbling increasingly. Progressively, Darwin could no longer stand as his muscles weakened further. Poverty pushed the family to live on the street. His father took advantage of Darwin‚Äôs illness and he would position Darwin every morning at the Libertad station to beg from passers-by who took pity on the boy. In spite of the terrible shame felt by Darwin, hundreds of pesos fell into his hands which he held out painfully. His father frequently took a large portion of the money to buy alcohol. Darwin would not complain as long as a sufficient portion was left to feed his brothers and sisters. In 2006, a group of street educators of the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation, went into contact with Darwin while he was panhandling at the Libertad station, and offered to take him in. Darwin agreed as he no longer could stand up straight, and was using his hands and remained seated.Archives preserved by the Postulation of the Cause of Beatification and Canonization of Darwin Ramos. These fields were established by social workers and street educators of the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation. = 2006‚Äì2012: Life at the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation = At the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation (meaning \\"a bridge for children\\" in Tagalog), Darwin lived with boys and girls with special needs caused by different disabilities.

Darwin increasingly suffered more respiratory distress that required consecutive hospitalizations.Archives preserved by the Postulation of the Cause of Beatification and Canonization of Darwin Ramos. Complete Medical File. He uplifted the staff and the children at the Foundation by the way he lived with his illness. He was constantly repeating \\"Thank you\\" and \\"I love you\\". He never complained and always smiled even during most difficult times. He was attentive to all and showed support to the other children at the Foundation in their trials. He had the habit of offering his sufferings. When he was speaking of his own illness, he did not talk about his myopathy but of what he called as being his \\"mission\\". One day, he said to the priest of the Foundation : \\"You know Father, I think Jesus wants me to hold on until the end, just like he did\\". Darwin developed a deep personal relationship with Christ. Not a day passed that the young boy did not take time out to entrust himself to Jesus. A caregiver from the Foundation testified: \\"One day, when Darwin was feverish, he insisted to be helped in getting out of bed to join the others in the center so that he could lead the evening prayer. It was Jesus before anything else\\". = September 2012: Darwin's final week = On Sunday, September 16, 2012, the nurse of the Foundation decided to bring Darwin to the (Philippine Children's Medical Center (PCMC) in Quezon City) because he had difficulty breathing. When the priest in charge of the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation arrived at his bedside, the first thing that Darwin did was to excuse himself for causing the priest worries. Darwin added as he breathed laboriously: \\"Thank you for everything Father\\". Then began what some would describe as \\"Darwin's Holy Week\\": On Monday, September 17, Darwin was intubated. He was not able to talk anymore. It was only possible to lip-read him, but he was able to write in a notebook. On Thursday, September 20, Darwin experienced a spiritual battle, his Maundy Thursday: * Darwin: ‚ÄúWe must pray.‚Äù * Priest: ‚ÄúOf course Darwin, but why do you need to pray?‚Äù * Darwin: ‚ÄúBecause I am fighting.‚Äù * Priest: ‚ÄúFighting against your disease?‚Äù * Darwin: ‚ÄúI am fighting against the devil.‚Äù Darwin then received the Anointing of the Sick. On Friday, September 21, he looked peaceful and had a big smile. He wrote his two last sentences in a notebook: \\"A huge thank you\\" and \\"I am very happy\\" as a sign of a battle won. Darwin, intimately united with the Lord in his suffering, was already sharing the joy. On Saturday, Darwin entered into a great silence while remaining conscious. He died on Sunday, September 23, 2012, at sunrise, at the PCMC in Quezon City). The funeral mass was celebrated in a full church, attended by all the children of the Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation. Darwin was buried in the Pasay City Cemetery.  Cause for beatification and canonization  In the Philippines, the memory of Darwin's life remains in the minds of many.The Darwin Ramos Association receives a lot of testimonies. People continue to gather at his tomb in Pasay City Cemetery. In France, Father Matthieu Dauchez wrote a book in 2015 entitled Plus fort que les t√©n√®bres [Stronger than Darkness]. In 2016, wrote another book entitled Proph√®tes de la Beaut√© [Prophets of Beauty] with the initial pages dedicated to the life of Darwin Ramos. Many readers were touched by his example of Joy and Love through disease and suffering, throughout his adolescence, and his countless testimonies of the graces received by his intercession: \\"In spite of the disease, it is his joy of living and his luminous glance that will have touched more than one. Darwin has left the image of a young boy edifying with holiness, who despite his young age, quickly realized that his illness, much more than an irreversible ordeal, was none the less a mission... A mission guided by the One he loved so much to call his Friend: Jesus.\\" In 2018, the \\"Darwin Ramos Association\\" requested from His Excellency Honesto Ongtioco, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao (Philippines), to open the Cause for beatification and canonization of Darwin Ramos. The Darwin Ramos Association on March 14, 2018 assigned the Dominican Father Thomas de Gabory as Postulator. His Excellency Honesto Ongtioco confirmed this nomination by Decree of May 25, 2018. The Postulator officially addressed the written request (Supplex Libellus) to open the Cause of beatification and canonization of Darwin Ramos on June 20, 2018. The acceptance letter was signed on November 7, 2018. Father Robert T. Young, a Filipino Canon lawyer, was nominated as vice-postulator. After having obtained the Nihil obstat (on March 29, 2019) of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome, and after the consultation of the faithful by the publication of the Edict during 2 months, the Cause was officially open in public on August 28, 2019 at the Immaculate Conception cathedral of Cubao by His Excellency Honesto Ongtioco. An Ecclesiastical Tribunal was assign to hear witnesses.  Prayer for beatification  The prayer for beatification got the imprimatur (ecclesiastical approval) of Honesto Ongtioco, Bishop of Cubao, on November 22, 2018: \\"O God of all Joy, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you never leave alone those who are in a time of trial. We thank you for giving us, in Darwin Ramos, a street child, an illuminating example of Christian life. During his short life you gave him the grace of simple never-failing faith, of joyful hope in illness, of endless charitable concern for his neighbor. We pray you grant your servant Darwin glorification on earth so that young and sick people may find in him a master of Joy. Through his intercession, hear our prayer, (express it here). We ask this, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen.\\"The Nihil Obstat and the Imprimatur are in the file of the postulation.

Her career began working with Imperial Oil in Calgary in the 1940s. ‚ÄúMadam Curious‚Äù as her father called her, lived an adventurous life, flying her own plane and fixing her own cars. Diane Loranger earned her Bachelors of Science in Geology at the University of Manitoba, and graduated with a doctorate in 1961 from the University of London. Her work in micropaleontology was paramount to the understanding and locating of Western Canadian oil reserves at the beginning of the Western Canadian oil boom. She is widely regarded as the first female geologist to break through the barriers of the male-dominated field of geology in Western Canada. She was the first woman from Red Lake, Ontario to earn a PhD. Loranger lectured all over the world, and published numerous papers. Growing up in Red Lake, she lived around nature and was passionate about the environment and geology. She worked as an oil field consultant from 1961 into the 1970‚Äôs. Diane learned how to code on computers in 1971 and used this skill to make a digital record of her work in paleoecology.  Career  = Imperial Oil = After graduating from the University of Manitoba in 1943 with a Bachelors of Science in Geology - one of the first women to do so - Loranger began her career with Imperial Oil in Calgary. A subsidy of Standard Oil, Imperial Oil's work in the province of Alberta would discover the Leduc Woodbend Devonian oil reef in 1947 - the same year Loranger would be promoted from resident/field geologist to a senior supervisory position at Imperial's sub-surface laboratory. One important finding her work uncovered was the loss of ornamentation on fossil ostracods as the depth of their burial increased. Loranger's innovative method of using microfossils to date sedimentary deposits was used to locate the Leduc Formation. Her work on biostratigraphy in Western Canadian oil reserves gained her international recognition in both the oil and geologic sectors. Loranger would go on to form her own paleontological consulting service, travelling to more than 50 countries for both work and the sake of adventure. In 1961, Loranger earned a Ph.D. in Geology from the University of London, making her the first woman from her home town of Red Lake to earn a post doctorate degree. In 1962, Loranger added to her accomplishments by earning a D.I.C. from the Imperial College of Science & Technology, Royal School of Mines, London. Turner Valley Gas Plant where she worked studying samples. = Turner Valley Gas Plant = Loranger played a significant role in the Turner Valley Gas Plant and quickly rose to a supervisory position. She worked with core sampleshttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/core-samples by studying them under a microscope. This was done to examine the rock sediments for trace minerals, reservoir properties and to collect porosity and perm data that are not found in logs. Existing equipment was adapted to apply new technologies to efficiently and effectively transport petroleum products.  Personal Life  Diane Loranger was born in Edmonton, Alberta, 1920. The daughter of master carpenter, Bruno \\"Bill\\" Loranger, and an English born dancer and competitive swimmer, Daisy Loranger, the family moved to Hudson, Ontario in 1927 during the Gold Rush era. Diane‚Äôs mother, Daisy Loranger was born in London, England. She was a dancer in her youth, who worked for the Shakespearean Theatre Company and performed for the King and Queen. Daisy was also an accomplished medal-winning swimmer, and owned her own dress boutique. The family would relocate to Red Lake where Diane attended Red Lake Continuation School, finding great inspiration in her natural surroundings. > ‚ÄúMany of my memories are auditory‚Äîloons calling, the full moon nights when > the sound of Ojibway drums from across the lake coaxed the spirits to give > them blessings for the coming winter season, howling of wolves when the snow > was crisp underfoot and shadows were purple under the trees. I appreciated > nature in all seasons and aspects and although I had the urge to worship at > the altar of logic (geo-logic), I‚Äôve never forgotten the land. I remember > the winter hikes, hockey games and skating on the rinks (even at -40 degrees > F), the quest (with the help of my one-dog Eskimo sleigh) for the perfect > Christmas tree, the prolonged break-ups and freeze-ups, the great ball games > we played on the less-than-regulation field with its 10‚Äô drop at the far > end, the re-enactment of the 1937 coronation (costumes were thanks to our > mothers‚Äô ingenuity) and the long, lazy summers when we swam, played tennis, > ball and used the canoes to great advantage.‚Äù Diane's adolescence in Red Lake piqued her interest in the natural sciences, athletics, and flying. She was an active member of Red Lake's first Girl Guide group from 1936-37 and would leave the troop with the distinction of lieutenant. By 1938 Red Lake had earned the title of the World's Busiest Airport due to the extensive mining in the area, and Diane's community continued to change as she became Red Lake's first high school graduate. Before leaving Red Lake, Diane joined the Junior Birdmen of America. Her love of flight would continue into her adulthood where she earned her commercial pilots licence, which she used to fly to remote geological job sites. Loranger enrolled in her Bachelor of Science in Geology at the University of Manitoba in 1938. Following her graduation at the University of Manitoba in 1943, Diane went to work for Imperial Oil and by 1947, had risen to a senior supervisory position with the company. A woman of many firsts, Diane had achieved immense success in the face of a male-dominated industry that had a stigma against women geologists, believing they would need 'special comforts' in the field. As a field geologist weighing 125lbs, she regularly walked upwards of 14 miles a day with full gear in the often intense Alberta summers. Her love of science and innovation in her field belied the industry stigma, and the moniker her father gave her, \\"Madam Curious\\", always propelled her over the next hill. > ‚ÄúI stocked tadpoles which I systematically rendered unconscious with alcohol > and then dissected to see how they ticked. The terrible smells and > explosions in my chemistry lab caused my Dad to call me ‚ÄúMadam Curious‚Äù. He > was very supportive, though and let me follow my star which is all one can > hope for.‚Äù Diane's adult hobbies drew from her upbringing in Red Lake. She built a remote cabin to escape into nature with, and her tenacious spirit took matters into its own hands when her second hand car struggled to start. Instead of taking the car to a mechanic, Diane enrolled in mechanics courses and handled maintenance herself. Even after retirement Diane Loranger stayed active, especially in support of disadvantaged women in her community. She regularly volunteered and in a span of just 3 years she donated over 8 tons of clothes and furniture to disadvantaged mothers. Loranger also filled her time leading delegations to city hall on issues surrounding elder and disabled access in the community and participated in the Big Sister community. Diane passed away at the age of 83 in the city of Calgary, Alberta. = Diana Loranger Memorial Scholarship = Diane Loranger's legacy lives on as a scholarship awarded to University of Manitoba students for full-time students who have completed their second or third year of study in the Department of Geological Sciences with high academic standing.

Although many richer land-owning peasants and enterprising merchants had been able to grow rich during the boom, the standard of living fell greatly for poor rural peasants, who were forced to deal with bad harvests at the same time. This led to reduced purchasing power and a decline in manufacturing. The monetary crisis led France to abandon (in 1577) the livre as its money of account, in favor of the √©cu in circulation, and banning most foreign currencies. Meanwhile, France's military ventures in Italy and (later) disastrous civil wars demanded huge sums of cash, which were raised with through the taille and other taxes. The taille, which was levied mainly on the peasantry, increased from 2.5 million livres in 1515 to 6 million after 1551, and by 1589 the taille had reached a record 21 million livres. Financial crises hit the royal household repeatedly, and so in 1523, Francis I established a government bond system in Paris, the \\"rentes sure l'H√¥tel de Ville\\". In the 17th century rich peasants who had ties to the market economy provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The \\"stable\\" core of French society, town guildspeople and village laborers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy, and grossly exaggerated social stability.James B. Collins, \\"Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-Modern France.\\" Journal of Social History 1991 24(3): 563‚Äì577. Fulltext: Ebsco. For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century (1986) excerpt and text search 1789-1945 \\"A Peasant Woman Cooking by a Fireplace\\"; by Vincent van Gogh; 1885 \\"A Peasant Woman and Child Harvesting the Fields\\"; Camille Pissarro; 1882 France faced a series of major economic crises after 1770. Because of very expensive wars, and inadequate financial system, the government was virtually bankrupt. From the point of view of the peasants, rapid population growth, harvest failures, physiocratic calls for modernization of agriculture, and rising seigneurial dues motivated peasants to destroy feudalism in France. They played a major role in starting the French Revolution in 1789. However most quickly retired from active political involvement.Peter Jones, \\"The peasants' revolt? \\" History Today (1989) 39#5 pp 15-19.John Markoff, \\"Peasants help destroy an old regime and defy a new one: some lessons from (and for) the study of social movements.\\" American Journal of Sociology 102.4 (1997): 1113-1142. =19th century modernization of peasants= France was a rural nation as late as 1940, but a major change took place after railways started arriving in the 1850s‚Äì60s. In his seminal book Peasants Into Frenchmen (1976), historian Eugen Weber traced the modernization of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Joseph A. Amato, \\"Eugen Weber's France\\" Journal of Social History, Volume 25, 1992 pp 879‚Äì882. He emphasized the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas. The book was widely praised, but was criticized by some, such as Ted W. Margadant, who argued that a sense of Frenchness already existed in the provinces before 1870.Ted W. Margadant, \\"French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay,\\" Agricultural History, (1979) 53#3 pp 644‚Äì651 =Protectionism= French national policy was protectionist with regard to agricultural sex, to protect the very large agricultural population, especially through the M√©line tariff of 1892. France maintained two forms of agriculture, a modern, mechanized, capitalistic system in the Northeast, and in the rest of the country a reliance on subsistence agriculture on very small farms with low income levels.Eugene Golob, The Meline tariff: French Agriculture and Nationalist Economic Policy (Columbia University Press, 1944) Since 1945 Modernization of the traditional/subsistence farming sector began in the 1940s, and resulted in a rapid depopulation of rural France, although protectionist measures remained national policy.John Ardagh, France in the 1980s (1982) pp 206-57. With government support, younger, more active farmers bought out their neighbors, enlarged their properties, and used the latest in mechanization, new seeds, fertilizers, and new techniques. The result was a revolution in agricultural output, as well as a sharply reduced number of active farmers from 7.4 million in 1946 to only 2 million in 1975. It also resulted in millions of empty old farm houses. They were promptly purchased and upgraded by Frenchmen who wanted a rural retreat away from the frenzy of their primary work in the cities. For many it was in nostalgia for family memories of rural living that drew the city dwellers back to the countryside. By 1978, France was the world leader in per capita ownership of second homes and L‚ÄôExpress reported an \\"irresistible infatuation of the French for the least Norman thatched house, C√©venol sheep barn or the most modest Proven√ßal farmhouse.\\" Sarah Farmer, \\"The Other House,\\" French Politics, Culture & Society (2016) 34#1 pp 104-121, quote p 104. Numerous organizations since the 1930s have emerged to preserve and enhance the position of the small farm in France, with a wide range of ideological approaches from far left to far right. They all seek to honor the tradition and fund the surviving farmers, and mobilize their political support.John T. S. Keeler, \\"The Defense Of Small Farmers In France: Alternative Strategies for the 'Victims of Modernization',\\" Peasant Studies (1979) 8#4 pp 1-18 The media became deeply involved, especially the postwar French film industry. Film depicted the exodus from countryside to city as a threat to France's historic role as a traditional, agrarian society. Documentaries celebrated the enormous power of modern machinery and electrification, while fictional dramas portrayed the joy of city dwellers who returned to the wholesome atmosphere of the country.Pierre Sorlin, \\"‚ÄòStop the rural exodus‚Äô: images of the country in French films of the 1950s.\\" Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television 18.2 (1998): 183-197.

The raid resulted in the deaths of two US Army Rangers from C and D Companies of the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the death of Abdul Haseeb Logari, the leader of ISIL-KP, alongside several leaders, and up to 35 other militants according to The Pentagon.  Background  On January 11, 2015 Hafiz Saeed Khan a former member of Tehrik-i-Taliban and the Afghan Taliban alongside other former Taliban leaders pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, forming the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province and becoming the group's emir. Seven months later the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan pledged allegiance to ISIL and claimed membership in the Khorasan group. Immediately after its formation the United States and Afghanistan targeted the group in airstrikes and raids. The group also suffered major setbacks while fighting the Taliban. In July 2016, Hafiz was killed in a US drone strike, around eight months later the Afghan and US military began its offensive against the militant group in Nangarhar Province in March 2017.https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-07-28/islamic-state- in-afghanistan-us-military Less than two weeks before the raid on April 13, 2017 and less than a mile away from the location of the raid, the US military dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb, a GBU-43/B MOAB on an ISIL-KP tunnel network once used by the Mujahideen during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in the 80s and Osama Bin Laden during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. The strike killed 96 militants according to an Afghan official. At the time of the raid the group had been reduced to an estimated 700 fighters, down from 3,000 fighters at the group's peak, according to US officials.https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/05/isis-afghanistan- abdul-hasib/525807/  Target  The target of the operation was a compound in the Mohmand Valley located less than a mile away from where the US dropped the MOAB bomb. The compound was believed to have housed Abdul Hasib, a former Taliban commander before switching alliances to the Islamic State - Khorasan Province, he would eventually become the group's leader after his predecessor Hafiz Saeed Khan was killed in a US airstrike. Abdul had overseen several attacks against the Afghan Government including the March 2017 Kabul attack on a military hospital that killed nearly 100 people. Commanders decided to conduct a joint US/Afghan special forces raid over an airstrike because woman and children were believed to have been in the compound.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/world/asia/abdul-hasib-isis- leader-killed.htmlhttps://heavy.com/news/2017/05/sheikh-abdul-hasib-dead- death-killed-isis-afghanistan-leader-raid-cameron-thomas-joshua-rodgers/  Raid  At around 10:30 on the night of 26 April, 50 U.S. Army Rangers from 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, alongside 40 Afghan commandos from the Special Security Forces (Kteh Khas), were inserted near the target site by helicopter. Almost immediately after landing the force came under heavy fire from multiple directions by entrenched enemy positions with the firefight being described as \\"close quarters with enemy fire coming at 360 degrees\\". As the joint American/Afghan force pushed through the difficult terrain under fire, they called in airstrikes from AC-130 gunships, F-16 fighter jets, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and drones. Early in the firefight two Army Rangers were critically wounded, possibly as a result of friendly fire, team members later denied the assertion. The two wounded were medevaced by helicopter where they would later die from their injuries. Another Ranger was grazed by a bullet but left the battle on his own choosing.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/least-2-u-s-service-members- killed-anti-isis-raid-n751826 The raid lasted for more than three hours up to about 3:30 a.m. and resulted in the death of the attended target with the Pentagon calling it as a success in degrading the group's ability to fight. = Casualties = Among the dead were two Army Rangers identified as 22 year old Sgt.

She is particularly concerned with women's studies, cultural heritage, and indigenous studies in the archaeological context, specifically in relation to early Australian archaeology. Some of her other focuses include lithic technology and art.  Education  Bird studied archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge University, Deakin University, and the University of Western Australia. She received her BA in archaeology and anthropology (honors) from Cambridge University in 1977, followed by an MA in Science and Technical Studies at Deakin University in 1997. Bird then went on to pursue a PhD in archaeology at the University of Western Australia and was awarded her degree in 1985. During her doctoral studies, Bird was advised by Sylvia Hallam and Charles Amsden. Bird's doctoral thesis is entitled \\"Prehistoric lithic resource utilisation: a case study from the Southwest of Western Australia\\".  Career  Bird has been contributing to the archaeological community for over 40 years in both the public sector and within academia. She has experience in archaeological field work and laboratory research focused in areas such as the UK, Europe, Australia, and Egypt. Bird works on sites dating to various periods, ranging from Neolithic to historical Australia. Bird has taught archaeology and cultural heritage university and technical education (TAFE) classes in Western Australia and Victoria. Bird also developed and oversaw the site officer training program at the Victoria Archaeological Survey, and helped to expand the school curriculum regarding Aboriginal and Intercultural Studies in Western Australia. In February 2013, Bird joined Archae-aus, an organization based in Perth, Western Australia committed to providing specialist historical and maritime heritage consultation and education services. Within the organization, Bird has been involved in public presentations and publication (producing a book pertaining to the Archae-aus project 'Kakutungutanta to Warrie Outcamp - 40,000 Years in Nyiyaparli Country'), and continues to conduct field work as a senior project officer. Bird has also worked as a member of the AACAI (Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologists Inc) in Western Australia.  Scientific contributions  Bird's most widely cited and praised article, \\"Woman the Toolmaker: Evidence for Women's Use and Manufacture of Flaked Stone Tools in Australia and New Guinea,\\" is heralded by the scientific community as a feminist approach to archaeology. In this 1993 publication, Bird confronts and discredits the once commonly held gender-role assumption that \\"women hunt and men gather.\\" This piece helped to inspire feminist archaeological theory and fuel discussion concerning the prevalence of male bias in the research process, inadequate ethnographic accounts, and the discipline of archaeology as a whole. Equally impactful, however, is Bird's work on radiocarbon chronologies. Bird and co-author David Frankel have written extensively on dating sequences in Australia, illuminating new evidence regarding early colonization and population histories and distributions. Most recently, Bird has been involved in heritage and indigenous studies research in connection to her membership with Archae-aus. In her 2016 article, \\"Reflections on CB08-500 Alternative Narratives, Aboriginal Heritage and Significance Assessment in Western Australia,\\" Bird argues for the importance of incorporating indigenous narratives into the archaeological research process. Bird asserts that such inclusivity in archaeological reporting is necessary to progress the discipline and can also aid in engaging a wider audience in discussions concerning heritage and community values.

Databases have adopted a host of techniques to cope.  History  The initial history of database scalability was to provide service on ever smaller computers. The first database management systems such as IMS ran on mainframe computers. The second generation, including Ingres, Informix, Sybase, RDB and Oracle emerged on minicomputers. The third generation, including dBase and Oracle (again), ran on personal computers. During the same period, attention turned to handling more data and more demanding workloads. One key software innovation in the late 1980s was to reduce update locking granularity from tables and disk blocks to individual rows. This eliminated a critical scalability bottleneck, as coarser locks could delay access to rows even though they were not directly involved in a transaction. Earlier systems were completely insensitive to increasing resources. Once software limitations had been addressed, attention turned to hardware. Innovation occurred in many areas. The first was to support multiprocessor computers. This involved allowing multiple processors to handle database requests simultaneously, without blocking each other. This evolved into support for multi-core processors. A much more significant change involved allowing distributed transactions to affect data stored on separate computers, using the two-phase commit protocol, establishing the shared- nothing architecture. Still later, Oracle introduced the shared-everything architecture, which provided full functionality on multi-server clusters. Another innovation was storing copies of tables on multiple computers (database replication), which both improved availability (processing could continue on a copy even if the main system was unavailable) and scalability particularly for query/analysis, in that requests could be routed to the copy if the primary reached its capacity. In the early twenty-first century, NoSQL systems gained favor over relational databases for some workloads. Motivations included still greater scalability and support for documents and other \\"non- relational\\" data types. Often sacrificed was the strict ACID consistency protocols that guaranteed perfect consistency at all times in favor of eventual consistency that ensured that all nodes would eventually return the latest data. Some even allowed for transactions to occasionally be lost, as long as the system could handle sufficiently many requests. The most prominent early system was Google's BigTable/MapReduce, developed in 2004. It achieved near-linear scalability across multiple server farms, at the cost of features such as multi-row transactions and joins. In 2007, the first NewSQL system, H-Store, was developed. NewSQL systems attempt to combine NoSQL scalability with ACID transactions and SQL interfaces.  Dimensions  Database scalability has three basic dimensions: amount of data, volume of requests and size of requests. Requests come in many sizes: transactions generally affect small amounts of data, but may approach thousands per second; analytic queries are generally fewer, but may access more data. A related concept is elasticity, the ability of a system to transparently add and subtract capacity to meet changing workloads. = Vertical = Vertical database scaling implies that the database system can fully exploit maximally configured systems, including typically multiprocessors with large memories and vast storage capacity. Such systems are relatively simple to administer, but may offer reduced availability. However, any single computer has a maximum configuration. If workloads expand beyond that limit, the choices are either to migrate to a different, still larger system, or to rearchitect the system to achieve horizontal scalability. = Horizontal = Horizontal database scaling involves adding more servers to work on a single workload. Most horizontally scalable systems come with functionality compromises. If an application requires more functionality, migration to a vertically scaled system may be preferable.  Techniques  = Hardware = Databases run on individual hardware ranging in capacity from smartwatches to supercomputers to multiple transparently reconfigurable server farms. Databases also scaled vertically to run on 64-bit microprocessors, multi-core CPUs, and large SMP multiprocessors, using multi-threaded implementations. = Contention = Fully exploiting a hardware configuration requires a variety of locking techniques, ranging from locking an entire database to entire tables to disk blocks to individual table rows. The appropriate lock granularity depends on the workload. The smaller the object that is locked, the less the chance of database requests blocking each other, while the hardware idles. Typically row locks are necessary to support high volume transaction processing applications at the cost of processing overhead to manage the larger number of locks. Further, some systems ensure that a query sees a time-consistent view of the database by locking data that a query is examining to prevent an update from modifying it, stalling work. Alternatively, some databases use multi-version read consistency to avoid (blocking) read locks while still providing consistent query results. Another potential bottleneck can occur in some systems when many requests attempt to access the same data at the same time. For example, in OLTP systems, many transactions may attempt to insert data into the same table at the same time. In a shared nothing system, at any given moment, all such inserts are processed by the single server that manages that partition (shard) of the table, possibly overwhelming it, while the rest of the system has little to do. Many such tables use a sequence number as their primary key that increases for each new inserted row. The index for that key can also experience contention (overheat) as it processes those inserts. One solution for this is to reverse the digits of the primary key. This spreads the inserts into both the table and the key across multiple parts of the database. = Partitioning = A basic technique is to split large tables into multiple partitions based on ranges of values in a key field. For example, the data for each year could be held on a separate disk drive or on a separate computer. Partitioning removes limits on the sizes of a single table. = Replication = Replicated databases maintain copies of tables or databases on multiple computers. This scaling technique is particularly convenient for seldom or never-updated data, such as transaction history or tax tables. = Clustered computers = A variety of approaches are used to scale beyond the limits of a single computer. HP Enterprise's NonStop SQL uses the shared nothing architecture in which neither data nor memory are shared across server boundaries. A coordinator routes database requests to the correct server. This architecture provides near-linear scalability. The widely supported X/Open XA standard employs a global transaction monitor to coordinate distributed transactions among semi-autonomous XA-compliant transaction resources. Oracle RAC uses a different model to achieve scalability, based on a \\"shared- everything\\" architecture. This approach incorporates the shared disk approach that allows multiple computers to access any disk in the cluster. Network- attached storage (NAS) and Storage area networks (SANs) coupled with local area networks and Fibre Channel technology enable such configurations. The approach includes a \\"shared\\" logical cache in which data that has been cached in memory on server is made available to other servers without requiring them to again read the data from disk. Each page s moved from server to server to satisfy requests. Updates generally happen very quickly so that a \\"popular\\" page can be updated by multiple transactions with little delay. This approach is claimed to support clusters containing up to 100 servers. Some researchers question the inherent limitations of relational database management systems. GigaSpaces, for example, contends that space-based architecture is required to achieve performance and scalability. Base One makes the case for extreme scalability within mainstream relational database technology.

Plot In 17th-century Netherlands, young Petronella \\"Nella\\" Oortman moves into an Amsterdam home that her new husband, Johannes, shares with his sister, Marin, and their two servants.

Reception The Miniaturist received mixed to strong reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 75% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Handsome set pieces and exceptional performances help make The Miniaturist engaging enough, even if its version of events doesn't quite measure up to its mysterious source material.\\" Caroline Framke for Variety praised the beauty of the series, but criticised it as overly long. \\"It's a shame that the series never quite gels, given how much it has going for it in terms of story, talent, and the truly spectacular production design and costuming that sets off the on location shoots with such style. But just like the dollhouse at its center, The Miniaturist is better at housing facsimiles rather than characters that feel real. Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire, who graded the series a B, criticised the series for weak character development ‚Äî which made it seem as though \\"an episode has gone missing\\" ‚Äî but that the series was still worth watching. \\"Despite Amsterdam thriving during this time, the series examines life in that society from the point of view of the misfits and marginalized. Defiance and bravery are necessary to face the ugliness that is presented, and it's a theme echoed in the characters' actions. The Miniaturist may feel raw and green, sometimes naively so, but in its awkward, otherworldly way champions hope and change, and that's rarely a waste of time.\\" References External links Rotten Tomatoes Category:2017 British television series debuts Category:2017 British television series endings Category:2010s British drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:BBC television dramas Category:2010s British television miniseries ","title":"The Miniaturist (TV series)"},{"id":"59632322","text":"is a set of several groups of kofun burial mounds located in what is now part of the city of Nomi, Ishikawa in the Hokuriku region of Japan.

After the Wende, he was a member of the New Forum who was elected to the first Landtag of Thuringia in 1990. As its senior, he was its Father of the House and opened the inaugural session.  Career  = Composer, conductor and hornist = Born in Dresden, Gei√üler was born the son of a working-class family in Dresden, attended elementary school from 1935 to 1943 and then studied piano and horn at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden until 1946. Already at this time he made some minor appearances as hornist with the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Semperoper and the Dresden Philharmonic. He then worked as principal hornist at the municipal theatre of Cottbus. In 1947, he escaped to the West and became principal hornist in the symphony orchestra of Speyer. During this time he first appeared as a conductor. After his return to the DDR in 1951 he became solo hornist of the Kreiskulturorchester of Sonneberg. From 1953 he was conductor of the Erzgebirgsphilharmonic of Aue, in 1956 of the Th√ºringisches Kreiskulturorchester M√ºhlhausen and from 1958 to 1962 under Heinz Bongartz in the Dresden Philharmonic. With this orchestra, he was the first European orchestra after 1945 to undertake a concert tour to China. Until 1965, he was conductor and Kapellmeister of the Thuringia State Symphony Orchestra Gotha, then chief conductor of the Suhl State Symphony Orchestra based in Hildburghausen, and elevated to Th√ºringen Philharmonie Suhl in 1979. Hhe was involved in the association of the Singakademie and the . In addition to numerous guest tours in Europe and Asia, he formed the Philharmonie into an ensemble of international reputation. In 1980 Gei√üler retired from the position of chief conductor of the Suhl Philharmonic. According to his Stasi documents, his friendship with the painter was no longer tolerated by the cultural policy of the SED.Interview by Dr. Juliane Rauprich in Menschen zur Wendezeit in Th√ºringen (), ISSN 0944-44-8705, publisher Th√ºringer Institut f√ºr Lehrerfortbildung From 1980, Gei√üler worked as a freelance composer and conductor. He created 52 compositions, including eight symphonies, solo concertos, chamber music, choral works and electronic music. In his last creative period, he composed in twelve-tone technique. He dedicated his Sixth Symphony to his friend Streubel. = Art collector and art sponsor = In 1962, the relations between Geissler and the Ministry for State Security (MfS) as well as the (VBK) turned cold. Painter and graphic artist Kurt W. Streubel (1921-2002) supported him from then on. After Streubel's sketches, he created his first joint drafts for \\"Antiopera\\". Conceived as a \\"spoken play with poetry set to music\\", it contained \\"8 more or less political songs\\". In 1969, together with the composer and personal friend Hans-J√ºrgen Thiers (1929), Gei√üler composed the oratorium \\"Der Mensch\\" after texts by the Lithuanian poet . For this purpose Streubel created a title page, the printing of which was prohibited by state authorities. In the mid-1960s, Gei√üler met the painter and graphic artist Karl MeuselKarl Meusel - Digitales Museum (1912‚Äì1986) in whose works he found inspiration for his compositions.  Politics  = Political commitment until 1990 = Already after his return from the Federal Republic to the GDR in 1951, Gei√üler intervened critically and arguably - much to the displeasure of the political leadership. In 1958, Gei√üler joined the SED. However, his attitude to party ideology prompted the MfS to launch a comprehensive surveillance and observation process (OV \\"Antipode\\") on Gei√üler.Aktenlage 14 November 1976, Abt.

After his withdrawal from the SED on 30 September 1989, Gei√üler was co-founder of the Citizens' Committee of Suhl, founder of the Citizens' Committee of the State of Thuringia, co-founder of the New Forum Suhl and South Thuringia and appointed citizen of the Round Table of the City of Thuringia. = Political commitment from 1990 = Gei√üler ran for the on the common of the New Forum, the East German Green Party and Democracy Now and won a mandate. As the oldest elected member of parliament he chaired the constituent session of the first Landtag of Thuringia on 25 October 1990 in the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar. He was also one of the fathers of the current Thuringian constitution. Gei√üler, together with as one of two representatives of the New Forum first belonged to the joint faction New Forum/Greens/Democracy Now. After their exclusion from the faction, which thereupon renamed itself ', Gei√üler and B√ºchner were from 22 December 1992 until the end of the parliamentary term in 1994. Gei√üler and B√ºchner caused a scandal on 25 October 1993 at the Wartburg: The members of the Thuringian parliament voted on Thuringia's new constitution at the solemn state parliament session in the last reading. The necessary two-thirds majority was secured with the votes of the CDU, FDP and SPD deputies. The Council of Elders had stipulated that only the chairmen of the five state parliamentary groups should have speaking time. The two non-attached members of parliament did not agree. Matthias B√ºchner tried during the meeting to make himself heard, but was expelled by the president of the Landtag Gottfried M√ºller after three of the hall. Gei√üler left the meeting as a protest. Gei√üler died in Suhl on 10 July 2014.  Works  Gei√üler composed works in several genres, including: * Eight symphonies and one unfinished symphony * Double Concerto for cello, mezzo-soprano and orchestra * Violin Concerto No. 1 * Violin Concerto No. 2Violin concerto No.2 (1981) * Horn Concerto * Lieder  Legacy  * In 1994 Gei√üler gave the his entire personal registry as a member of the state parliament.

He is also known for his advocacy of human rightsand for being a staunch opponent and outspoken critic of the death penalty in Singapore. As a criminal lawyer in Singapore, he has acted for accused persons in many high profile criminal trials. Doyles Guide has named him as a leading criminal defence lawyer in Singapore. He is currently acting for an oil exploration company in an UNCITRAL arbitration against a middle eastern state-owned company. The dispute involves claims of over USD 126 million and concerns petroleum operations in the South-East Asia. He is also acting for an Indonesian client in an SIAC arbitration arising out of a contractual dispute with the private equity arm of a major international bank incorporated in Hong Kong. The value of the claim is over USD 128 million. In 2016, Thuraisingam defended Roy Ngerng, a blogger who was sued for defamation by Lee Hsien Loong, who is the Prime Minister of Singapore. He also acted for activist and social worker Jolovan Wham and Donald Liew when they were sent letters of demand in relation to comments made by them which were allegedly defamatory of Singapore's Minister of Manpower, Mrs Josephine Teo. In 2016 and 2017, he represented The Online Citizen, an independent online media platform, in successfully protecting its right to free speech against the Singaporean government. He is now representing The Online Citizen and the Singapore Democratic Party in the Singapore Court of Appeal on the issue of whether or not the Singapore government bears the burden of proof in proving that a statement is false when it issues a correction direction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). He also acts in a constitutional law case against the Attorney-General of Singapore in the Singapore Court of Appeal challenging the constitutionality of the law in Singapore which criminalises sex between men.  Education  Thuraisingam attended Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the National University of Singapore, where he was placed on the Dean's List in his final year of study.  Career  After he was admitted to the Singapore Bar in 2001, Thuraisingam practised law at Allen & Gledhill for nine years and at Stamford Law Corporation for another three years before he founded the law firm, Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, in 2012.  Anti-death penalty poem  In 2017, Thuraisingam was brought to court by Lucien Wong, the Attorney-General, for allegedly scandalising the judiciary when he wrote a poem critical of the death penalty hours before the execution of drug trafficker Muhammad Ridzuan Md Ali, whom he had represented. Thuraisingam is said to have intended to bring home the point that the rich and powerful people in Singapore did not care about the unfairness of the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking as most of the people facing the death penalty come from very poor backgrounds. Thuraisingam was fined S$6,000 by the court. Wong also lodged a complaint to the Law Society in relation to the same poem. A disciplinary tribunal appointed by Sundaresh Menon, the Chief Justice, held that Thuraisingam had not intended to attack the judiciary in his poem, which was found to be in contempt of court. They held that the references to judges in the poem 'is more likely to have been an authorial misstep than a deliberate assault upon judicial integrity'. Nevertheless, Thuraisingam was fined a further S$5,000 by the Law Society for penning the poem.  Notable cases  = 2014 = Thuraisingam acted for Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim's ex-wife, Teo Geok Fong, against HSBC Holdings for losses arising out of financial products which she alleged were negligently sold by the bank to her. Since 2014, Thuraisingam has been the personal lawyer for Jannie Chan, co- founder of The Hour Glass, in her various court cases against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and her ex-husband, Henry Tay. He also acted for Chan's daughter, Audrey Tay, who faced charges for drug offences. = 2015 = Thuraisingam represented Chung Khin Chun, a wealthy widow who had been duped into signing over control of her assets worth more than SG$30 million to Yang Yin, a tour guide she met in China. He succeeded in convincing the court to enable Chung to revoke the lasting power of attorney that gave Yang control over her assets. Thuraisingam also acted for one of the defendants in a suit by Credit Suisse to recover US$80 million in damages pursuant to alleged fraudulent loans obtained by REI Agro Limited. Three Hindu Singaporeans instructed Thuraisingam to challenge the government's decision to ban the playing of musical instruments during Thaipusam. Tay Yong Kwang, the judge who heard the case, stated that although the playing of instruments in the course of the procession is a religious practice protected by the Constitution, such a provision is restricted by public order concerns as provided in the same laws. Tay accepted that the playing of instruments is an essential part of the procession, based on a Hindu expert's report and the applicants' submissions, but found it is not a universal practice. He also accepted that the trio had the legal standing to mount the court judicial review application. However, he found that the police had shown there were legitimate concerns based on their ground intelligence and were in a better position than the court to decide what was necessary for public order and safety. = 2017 = Thuraisingam represented an ex-financial services director, Ramesh Krishnan, in successfully claiming damages of more than SG$3 million against AXA Life Insurance Singapore resulting from AXA providing a bad reference that cost Ramesh his new job. Thuraisingam also convinced the Court of Appeal to order a review of its own decision two years ago. The Court of Appeal had overturned a trial judge's acquittal of Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi, a Nigerian convicted of the capital offence of drug trafficking in Singapore. After reviewing its decision to convict Ilechukwu, the Court of Appeal sent the case back to the trial judge who had originally acquitted Ilechukwu for that judge to evaluate new evidence. When the matter came back before the Court of Appeal in 2020, the Court in a historic 4-1 split decision reversed its previous decision to convict Ilechukwu and set him free instead. = 2018 = Thuraisingam represented Jolovan Wham, a Singaporean civil activist who was found guilty of contempt of court and faced a slew of criminal charges in relation to his civil activism. He also acted for Singapore Democratic Party politician John Tan, who was also found guilty of contempt of court. = 2019 = Thuraisingam represented Soh Rui Yong, a national long distance runner, in a dispute with the Singapore National Olympic Council over the Council's nomination of a fellow national teammate, Ashley Liew, for the Pierre de Coubertin World Fair Play Trophy. He was also tasked to petition the President of the Republic of Singapore to grant clemency to Malaysian, Pannir Selvam Pranthanam who had been sentenced to death by the Singapore Court for drug trafficking. He acted on a pro bono basis to petition the President of Singapore as well as to appeal to the Attorney-General's Chambers for a certificate of substantive assistance to be issued to Pannir which would enable the Singapore Court to commute his sentence from death by hanging to life imprisonment instead. He acted for Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam in bringing an application for Judicial Review to the Court of Appeal to challenge the Attorney-General's decision not to grant Nagaenthran a certificate of substantial assistance thus resulting in the mandatory death penalty being applied despite the fact that he was a mere innocent courier. He also represented Boh Soon Ho in the Circuit Road murder trial. = 2020 = Thuraisingam acted for Miya Manik who was accused of murdering the head of a rival illegal cigarette syndicate in the course of a gang clash over turf. Thuraisingam was successful in arguing for Miya Manik to be acquitted of the capital charge of murder. He also acted in the Court of Appeal for Dr Wee Tiong Boo. Dr Wee was acquitted at trial for allegedly raping a patient. He was however convicted by the High Court for digitally penetrating the patient without consent. The Prosecution appealed against the acquittal on the charge of rape, while Dr Wee appealed against his conviction of digital penetration without consent. The Court of Appeal after hearing arguments reserved its Judgment. In its Judgment of 10 June 2020, the Court of Appeal allowed Dr Wee's appeal and dismissed the Prosecution's appeal thereby acquitting him of all criminal charges against him. He defended Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman who was charged together with his wife with killing his 5 year old son. Thuraisingam successfully argued that Ridzuan did not share a common intention with his wife to commit murder. Ridzuan was acquitted of the capital offence of murder by the High Court Judge, Justice Valerie Thean. When Daniel Teo, a member of the Progress Singapore Party, an opposition party in Singapore, falsely accused the Singapore People's Party Chairman, Jose Raymond of accepting foreign funding from persons outside Singapore, Thuraisingam was retained as counsel by Raymond to act against Teo. Teo eventually admitted without reservation that his allegations that Raymond received overseas funding were completely baseless and untrue. He publicly apologised to Raymond and undertook not to repeat the allegations. Raymond out of goodwill and compassion decided to waive the monetary damages that he was entitled to from Teo. Thuraisingam also acted for Chia Sin Lan who was convicted of bribing the general manager of Ang Mo Kio Town Council in his appeal against sentence which was heard by the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon. He is acting for the Singapore Democratic Party in appealing against the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulations Act order issued by the Singapore Government against the SDP during the 2020 General Elections where the SDP had alleged that Singapore's population would increase to 10 million by 2030. He is also representing Ahmed Salim, a Bangladeshi worker in Singapore accused of murdering his girlfriend in a hotel room. The defence in this case is that Ahmed Salim, who was diagnosed from suffering from an adjustment disorder at that time lost control of himself as he was proved by his girlfriend's infidelity and harsh and humiliating words said by her to him at that time. Ahmed Salim faces the mandatory death penalty if he is convicted of the offence. Thuraisingam and his law firm are acting for him on a pro bono basis. Thuraisingam is acting for the animal rights group Exclusively Mongrels in suing a dog owner for euthanizing his pet dog, which was adopted from Exclusively Mongrels.  Awards  In 2016, Thuraisingam received the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences award from Sundaresh Menon, the Chief Justice of Singapore, for his work in defending accused persons in death penalty cases.

Coal-fired power stations emit over 1 kg of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt hour generated,Atilgan et al (2016), p. 177 over twice that of gas-fired power stations, and are the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey. The stations' total capacity is 17 gigawatts (GW). The older power stations emit local air pollution. With a few exceptions stations smaller than 200 MW provide both electricity and heat, often to factories, whereas almost all those larger than 200 MW just generate electricity. Lignite (brown coal) is mined locally, whereas almost all hardcoal is imported; 69 and 22 million tonnes respectively in 2019. To minimize transport costs, power stations burning imported coal are usually located on the coast: there are clusters in √áanakkale and Zonguldak provinces and around Iskenderun Bay, and 31.7 million tonnes of thermal coal was imported in 2019. Those burning lignite tend to be near local coalmines, such as Elbistan, because Turkish lignite's calorific value is less than 12.5 MJ/kg (and Afsin Elbistan lignite less than 5 MJ/kg, which is a quarter of typical thermal coal) so is not worth transporting. Lignite-burning power stations have priority over other types of generation, and in 2019 large lignite-burning stations were subsidized with capacity payments totalling almost 1 billion lira (almost 150 million USD). A 2020 study estimated that fitting carbon capture and storage to a power station burning Turkish lignite would increase the cost of its electricity by over 50%. A 1996 court order to shut 3 polluting power stations was not enforced. Five 20th century power stations were shut down at the end of 2019 because they did not meet new pollution limits, but they were all re-licensed after improvements in 2020. Some licences are only until the end of 2020, and the effectiveness of the improvements is being questioned. Despite overcapacity and abundant sun and wind, Emba Hunutlu is under construction. Unlike neighbouring Greece, which is closing down all its lignite-fired power stations, Turkey has approved building Af≈üin-Elbistan C, which at over 5 kg of CO2 per kWh generated would be less carbon efficient than any power station on the list of least carbon efficient power stations. The Turkey Wealth Fund, the country's sovereign wealth fund, is financing it because, it says, the country needs to maintain energy security by reducing fossil fuel imports. The fund aims to pay dividends to the government, but according to Carbon Tracker, a think tank, new coal power will lose money. The Energy Ministry wants to fully utilize not just renewable energy in Turkey, but also other local energy resources to support the country's development and to reduce dependence on energy imports. The main opposition Republican People's Party says temporary licenses for 2020 for older power stations which exceed sulfur dioxide pollution limits are illegal, and Greenpeace has applied to the government for them to be shut down as a health risk. Larger power stations must measure local pollutants vented into the atmosphere from the smokestack and report them to the Environment Ministry but, unlike the EU, they are not required to publish the data. Because lignite quality varies greatly, to estimate the carbon dioxide emissions from a particular power station, the net calorific value of the lignite it burnt must be reported but is not required to be published. So, unlike some other countries, public information on the carbon- dioxide emissions of individual power stations may not be available until space-based measurements of carbon dioxide become more precise perhaps by GOSAT-GW in 2023. Much of the operational fleet was built in the 21st century. The oversupply of generating capacity, and drop in demand in 2020 may create financial problems for power station operators, as a quarter of power stations are estimated to be cashflow negative and US$ 5 billion owed by 7 plants using local coal is at high risk of default. Moreover the price of natural gas fell in 2020, making Turkey's already existing gas-fired power stations more competitive, so new coal-fired power stations may not in fact be completed, due to public opposition, and the risk of becoming stranded assets. Active coal-fired power stations in Turkey All coal-fired power stations which sent power to the grid in 2020 are listed below. In 2018 there were 300 MW of unlicensed thermal power stations (a licence is not required if no power is sent to the grid) but it is not known whether any of them were coal-fired. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Coal-fired power stations in Turkey - ! scope=col  Station ! scope=col  Operational Capacity (MWe) ! scope=col  Generation to grid in 2019 (GWh) ! scope=col Capacity factor in 2019 (%) ! scope=col  Province and District ! scope=col  Construction or operational start year Where the construction year is not known, the start of the current EDPK operational license is shown ‚Äì nevertheless there may have been \\"pre-licenses\\" before that. ! scope=col  Owner ! scope=col Type ! scope=col Coal type ! scope=col Retirement ! scope=col class=unsortable Notes ! scope=col class=unsortable - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align: left\\"18 Mart √áan a.k.a. √áan style=\\"text-align:right;\\"320 style=\\"text- align:right;\\"2134 style=\\"text-align:right;\\"76 √áanakkale √áan style=\\"text- align:right;\\"2003 E√úA≈û Subcritical Lignite Unknown   - ! scope=row style=\\"text-align: left\\"Adapazarƒ± Sugar Factory a.k.a.

Overview Ancient Mino Province was a major center for the manufacturing of Sue pottery from before the Nara period, and numerous ruins of ancient kilns have been found in the area around the border of the modern cities of Gifu, Toki and Kakamigahara . The Oibora-Asakura site is located on the southern slopes of the Suwa Mountains, near the Nagara River. The site dates from the latter half of the 7th century to the early 8th century and the remains of three kilns have thus far been discovered, along with over 70,000 shards, some of which are stamped or painted with the words \\"Mino\\". Some of the Sue pottery made at this site has been discovered at various locations around Japan, including the site of the Heij≈ç Palace in Nara, Ise Shrine in Mie prefecture and the Mino Kokubun-ji ruins.

Intuitively, it suggests that in a social network described by such a graph, someone will have at least as many friends-of-friends as friends. The problem is also known as the second neighborhood conjecture or Seymour‚Äôs distance two conjecture. Statement An oriented graph is a finite directed graph obtained from a simple undirected graph by assigning an orientation to each edge. Equivalently, it is a directed graph that has no self-loops, no parallel edges, and no two-edge cycles. The first neighborhood of a vertex v (also called its open neighborhood) consists of all vertices at distance one from v, and the second neighborhood of v consists of all vertices at distance two from v. These two neighborhoods form disjoint sets, neither of which contains v itself. In 1990, Paul Seymour conjectured that, in every oriented graph, there always exists at least one vertex v whose second neighborhood is at least as large as its first neighborhood. Equivalently, in the square of the graph, the degree of v is at least doubled. The problem was first published by Nathaniel Dean and Brenda J. Latka in 1995, in a paper that studied the problem on a restricted class of oriented graphs, the tournaments (orientations of complete graphs). Dean had previously conjectured that every tournament obeys the second neighborhood conjecture, and this special case became known as Dean's conjecture. A vertex in a directed graph whose second neighborhood is at least as large as its first neighborhood is called a Seymour vertex. In the second neighborhood conjecture, the condition that the graph have no two-edge cycles is necessary, for in graphs that have such cycles (for instance the complete oriented graph) all second neighborhoods may be empty or small. Partial results proved Dean's conjecture, the special case of the second neighborhood problem for tournaments. For some graphs, a vertex of minimum out-degree will be a Seymour vertex. For instance, if a directed graph has a sink, a vertex of out-degree zero, then the sink is automatically a Seymour vertex, because its first and second neighborhoods both have size zero. In a graph without sinks, a vertex of out-degree one is always a Seymour vertex. In the orientations of triangle- free graphs graphs, any vertex v of minimum out-degree is again a Seymour vertex, because for any edge from v to another vertex w, the out-neighbors of w all belong to the second neighborhood of v. For arbitrary graphs with higher vertex degrees, the vertices of minimum degree might not be Seymour vertices, but the existence of a low-degree vertex can still lead to the existence of a nearby Seymour vertex. Using this sort of reasoning, the second neighborhood conjecture has been proven to be true for any oriented graph that contains at least one vertex of out-degree ‚â§ 6\\\\. Random tournaments and random oriented graphs have many Seymour vertices with high probability. Every oriented graph has a vertex whose second neighborhood is at least \\\\gamma times as big as the first neighborhood, where :\\\\gamma=\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\left(-1+\\\\sqrt[3]{53-6\\\\sqrt{78}}+\\\\sqrt[3]{53+6\\\\sqrt{78}}\\\\right) \\\\approx 0.657 is the real root of the polynomial 2x^3+x^2-1.

Description The park has a hilly terrain and is intersected by streams; the Collie River valley is in the middle of the park, as is Wellington Dam. The park is within the Yilgarn Craton geological province composed of belts of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks, including large areas of granite. Facilities Potter's Gorge has a camping area at the edge of a lake, catering for tents and caravans. There are also barbeques, picnic tables and multi-access toilets. Honeymoon Pool also has a camping area and the river is safe for swimming and canoeing. There are picnic tables, barbeques, fire pits with wood supplied and toilets. A boardwalk and platform are built on the river bank for ease of access and there are several walk trails throughout the area. The area around Wellington Dam has a kiosk and a camping area. History The park increased in size from to under the Labor state government's 2001 \\"Protecting our old-growth forests\\" policy.

He previously played for DPMM FC and made four appearances for the Brunei national football team in 2001. Club career Helme was one of the first players signed to DPMM FC, the club founded by Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, even before the B-League was created. He exclusively played for DPMM throughout their four-year local stint, winning two B-League championships, one FA Cup and two Super Cups, and in addition becoming the B-League Young Player of the Year in 2002. He also briefly captained the side in the absence of Ali Momin before later relinquishing it to Rosmin Kamis. DPMM replaced the Brunei national representative team that competed in the Malaysian Premier League starting from the 2005‚Äì06 season. With former Brunei coach Ranko Buketa favouring the likes of Rosmin Kamis and Yussof Salleh over Helme, he found limited opportunities under the Croatian head coach, mostly appearing from the substitutes' bench. His side gained promotion and was even placed third in their top-flight debut, but Helme had minimal input. It was only when Yordan Stoykov took over in the 2007-08 season that Helme saw more game time. Ultimately, in a tumultuous period for DPMM which saw them move to the Singaporean league and then subject to a FIFA ban, Helme was not retained for the 2009 season, instead being replaced by namesake Helmi Zambin. After a few years away from the game, Helme joined Kasuka FC, a reformed team that were to compete in the Brunei Premier League in 2015. He gained promotion with Kasuka and played with them for another season in the Brunei Super League until transferring to Temburong-based side Lun Bawang FC in 2017. International career Due to eye-catching performances for DPMM FC in local tournaments, Zainuddin Kassim drafted Helme into the national squad for the 2002 World Cup qualifying matches to be held in April‚ÄìMay 2001.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. It was the only known Thacher through truss bridge in Michigan, and one of only a few remaining in the nation. In 1999, the bridge was moved to a new location, and in 2008 was washed off its piers and destroyed. History In 1855, Israel Parshall dammed the Shiawassee River at this location and constructed saw and grist mills located on opposite banks. A hamlet sprang up around the mills, originally called Havana but later known as Parshallville or Parshallburg. It is likely that the first bridge at this location was constructed soon after the mills, and that the original bridge was replaced at a later date, perhaps in the 1870s. An 1889 edition of the Chesaning Argus describes this second bridge as an \\"iron bridge put up on piles only a few years ago.\\" However, by 1889 this bridge had grown dangerous, and the local highway commission decided to replace it. they contracted with the Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio to construct a new iron bridge. New abutments were constructed in the summer of 1889, and assembly of the bridge began soon after. The bridge remained in service until the 1980s. In 1986, it was identified as critically in need of replacement, and in 1992 it was closed to traffic. In 1999, the bridge was relocated to Chesaning, Michigan. However, the piers at the new location were too low for the surrounding area, and in late 2008, the bridge was washed away off its piers by flood and ice, and completely destroyed. Description The Parshallburg Bridge was a single- span, Thacher metal through truss bridge, likely made of wrought and cast iron. The Thacher through truss was invented in 1883 by Edwin Thacher, who was then chief engineer of the Keystone Bridge Company of Pittsburgh. Thacher described the truss design as a \\"combination of the triangular [Pratt/ Warren] and suspension [Bollman/Fink] systems,\\" and was designed to eliminate stresses (and subsequent maintenance issues) due to temperature changes. The Parshallburg Bridge was as eight-panel structure with a length of 140 feet and a deck width of 17.8 feet sitting on rubble fieldstone abutments. The bridge's end and upper chords are constructed from parallel channels riveted to cover plates above and lattice bars below. The vertical posts and struts are constructed from two riveted angles connected by lattice bars. The center ties, inclined suspenders, and the lower chords are constructed from eyebars. The top lateral bracing is made of tie rods with turnbuckles. On each end of the bridge was a cast-iron plaque with the words \\"WROUGHT IRON BRIDGE CO., BUILDERS, CANTON, OHIO.\\" References External links * *Images of bridge from HistoricBridges.org Category:National Register of Historic Places in Saginaw County, Michigan Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Bridges completed in 1889 ","title":"Parshallburg Bridge"},{"id":"59632858","text":"Kafubu River (center right) Kafubu River is a river in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia.

It forms the border between the Ndola Central and Itawa suburbs, heading westwards. After passing under the T3 Road south of Ndola Golf Club, it forms the border between the Masala and Hillcrest suburbs, before forming the border between the Lubuto and Twapia suburbs of Ndola. Just after Twapia, the river goes southwards, becoming the Kafubu Dam, to leave Ndola District. Just after passing under the M6 Road, the Kafubu River turns westwards and forms the border between Luanshya District and Masaiti District up to a point north-west of Masaiti Town. It continues westwards, joined by the Kafulafuta River west of Masaiti Town.

He was associated with the India Office, and publications for which he produced coloured illustrations include many works about India. Early life and career Griggs was born in 1832, son of a lodge-keeper to the Duke of Bedford at Woburn, Bedfordshire. Losing his father in childhood, he was apprenticed at the age of twelve to the carpentering trade; aged 18 he was employed in London as an artisan in the Indian Court of the Great Exhibition of 1851. He improved his scanty education at night classes, and in 1855 was selected to be technical assistant to the reporter on Indian products and director of the India Museum, then in East India House, Leadenhall Street. His artistic tastes and keen interest in photography were encouraged by Dr John Forbes Watson, who became his chief in 1858, and at his instance Griggs was installed at Fife House, Whitehall, pending completion of the India Office, in a studio and workshops for photolithographic work. He had familiarised himself with the processes of photozincography discovered by the director-general of the Ordnance Survey, General Sir Henry James. =Printing method= By careful experiment he found that the use of cold, instead of hot, water in developing the transfer left the gelatine in the whites of the transfer, thus giving firmer adhesion to the stone and serving as a support to the fine lines. He also invented photo-chromo-lithography by first printing from a photolithographic transfer a faint impression on the paper to serve as a \\"key\\", separating the colours on duplicate negatives by varnishes, then photolithographing the dissected portions on stones, finally registering and printing each in its position and particiliar colour, with the texture, light and shade of the original. He greatly cheapened the production of colour work by a simplified form of this discovery: a photolithographic transfer from a negative of the original to stone, printed as a \\"key\\" in a suitable colour, superimposing thereon, in exact register, transparent tints in harmony with the original. Opaque colours, when necessary, were printed first. So far from keeping secret or patenting these improvements, Griggs described and gave practical demonstrations of them to the London Photographic Society (14 April 1868). He was thus a pioneer in the wide diffusion of colour work and halftone block-making, and helped to bring about rapid cylindrical printing. Productions A page from The Textile Manufactures of India (1866) by John Forbes Watson Griggs established photolithographic works at his Peckham residence in 1868, soon after the publication of his first notable achievement: the plates illustrating John Forbes Watson's The Textile Manufactures and the Costumes of the People of India (1866); this was followed by those illustrating Tree and Serpent Worship in India (1868), by James Fergusson. He also reproduced some of the Prince Consort's drawings for Queen Victoria, and was thereafter chromolithographer to her Majesty and subsequently to King Edward VII. Though the contents of the India Museum were dispersed between South Kensington and elsewhere in 1878, he continued to serve the India Office until September 1885, afterwards devoting himself exclusively to his own business. In reproductions of old manuscripts and letterpress texts Griggs was as successful as in chromolithography. His production of fifty copies of the \\"MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya\\" (the standard authority on Sanskrit grammar), consisting of 4674 pages (1871), was carried out for ¬£6000 less than the estimate for a tracing of the original manuscript by hand. His Shakespeare quartos, with critical introductions by Frederick James Furnivall and others, in 43 volumes (1881‚Äì1891), were sold at 6 shillings each; the handtraced facsimiles by E. W. Ashbee had been sold at five guineas each. On the initiative of Sir George Birdwood, who gave him constant encouragement, Griggs secured in 1881 the patronage of the committee of council on education for a series of shilling \\"Portfolios of Industrial Art\\", 200 of which had been issued by 1912, chiefly selected from the Chinese, Persian, Arabian, Sicilian, Italian, Russian, and Spanish specimens at the Victoria and Albert Museum. \\"Lord of Five White Elephants (Ng√°z√≠shin nat)\\" and \\"Lord of the White Elephant of Aung Pinl (Aungbinl√® Sinbyushin nat)\\" from The Thirty-Seven Nats: a phase of spirit worship prevailing in Burma by Richard Carnac Temple (1906) Under an arrangement with the government of India, also negotiated at Sir George's instance, he issued from January 1884 the quarterly Journal of Indian Art and Industry. A notable work in the same field, edited by Colonel T. H. Hendley, was his Asian Carpet Designs (1905) of 150 coloured plates. He was also successful in illustrating such works as Dr James Burgess's reports on the archaeology of Western India through a long series of years, and his Ancient Monuments of India (1897 to 1911); Colonel T. H. Hendley's many works on the art and history of Rajputana; facsimiles of illuminated manuscripts at the British Museum (1889‚Äì1903), and other works for the trustees; Richard Carnac Temple's The Thirty-Seven Nats (1906); and many scientific works, such as M. C. Cooke's Illustrations of British Fungi (2nd edition in 6 volumes, 1884‚Äì1888) and his Handbook thereof (2nd edition 1887). Family and later years Griggs married in 1851 Elizabeth Jane Gill (died 1903), and in his later years was assisted in business by his two sons. The firm of W. Griggs & Sons was formed into a public company on 20 December 1906. He was for a time managing director, but owing to ill health resigned all connection with the company in January 1910. He died in Worthing on 7 December 1911, and was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in London. His second son, Walter, carried on an independent business on his father's lines.

The consortium was founded by Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Aviation and Cyrus Capital Partners through its Luxembourg- based vehicle DLP Holdings. Virgin and Stobart each held 30% of the capital with Cyrus holding the remaining 40%. Cyrus Capital had previously worked with Virgin Group on the launch of its Virgin America airline and its subsequent sale to Alaska Airlines. The purchase of the operating assets of the Flybe Group was completed on 21 February 2019. On 5 March 2020, the consortium was unable to commit further financial support and Flybe entered administration, ceasing all operations. On 18 March 2020, Connect Airways in turn entered administration.  History  On 11 January 2019, Connect Airways made a ¬£2.2 million cash offer to take over the entire share capital of Flybe, subject to shareholder and court approval. The offer also included the acquisition of Stobart Air shortly before the Flybe takeover. On 15 January 2019, Connect Airways increased its offer by ¬£600,000, and set out improved bridging loan conditions, with ¬£10 million to be released immediately to support Flybe's business, and a further ¬£10 million available. Subsequent funding of ¬£80 million was also confirmed. Flybe Group accepted the ¬£2.8 million offer and noted that its shares had been transferred to a standard listing, effective on 17 January, meaning that shareholder approval for the sale of the group's operating assets, i.e. the airline and the website, would no longer be required. The deadline for the deal to close was 22 February 2019. On 21 February 2019, Flybe Group confirmed that its operating assets, i.e. the airline and the website, had indeed been transferred to Connect Airways, despite a last-minute rival bid. The sale of the parent company, Flybe Group plcnow an empty shell was confirmed by its shareholders at a meeting on 4 March and became effective on 11 March. On 5 July 2019, merger clearance from the European Commission was granted, giving Connect Airways full control of the Flybe assets. This was conditional on Connect Airways releasing slot pairs at both Amsterdam‚ÄìSchiphol and Paris‚ÄìCharles de Gaulle. In 2020 the consortium would have rebranded Flybe as Virgin Connect and changed its values to align the airline with the Virgin brand. The aim was to create a \\"fully-fledged UK network carrier\\" with an enhanced presence at Heathrow and Manchester airports. Flybe and Stobart Air would have however retained their own Air Operator Certificates and Stobart Air's franchise/wet lease operations for other airlines would have continued. Virgin Atlantic had previously operated domestic routes from Heathrow under their Virgin Atlantic Little Red subsidiary between 2013 and 2015; these routes were subsequently taken over by Flybe in 2017. , the Virgin Connect website contained some basic information and FAQs about the further plans for the rebranding but would have eventually become the website used to book flights from 2020. The Virgin group also launched a new landing page to avoid confusion with the existing Virgin Connect brand used in Russia for internet and mobile services. In February 2020, the UK government envisaged granting Flybe a ¬£100 million rescue loan, and held talks with the EU Commission to ensure that state aid rules were not broken. In the early morning of 5 March 2020, Flybe filed for administration and ceased all operations with immediate effect after the UK government failed to grant a proposed ¬£100 million ($129 million) loan. Virgin Atlantic stated that Connect Airways could \\"no longer commit to continued financial support\\" despite its investment of over ¬£135 million, and placed part of the blame on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Flybe's trading. On 18 March 2020, Connect Airways in turn entered administration. On 27 April 2020, Stobart Group bought back Stobart Air and Propius Leasing from Connect Airways administrators EY, for an initial payment of ¬£300,000 and deferred consideration that could total ¬£8.25 million.

They are believed to be descended from a German game, Mariagenspiel or Mariage, which dates back to at least 1715. Well-known games in this group include Bezique and the national card games of Austria (Schnapsen), Hungary (Ulti), France (Belote), Switzerland (Jass) and the Netherlands (Klaverjas).  Description  Mariagenspiel (German for game, using the original French word for marriage rather than the German word, Heiraten) is the earliest and most typical representative of the group. It was first described in a 1715 ladies' encyclopedia printed in Leipzig. The game's entry said that the game was popular among ladies, and the entry for playing card listed ' first among nine card games played with the German pack. Despite the marriage theme, the Queen was replaced by the equivalent male character in the German cards. Apart from the standard Queen/Ober, Jack/Unter translation, the game was described precisely as detailed at Mariage.. Games in this family are typically played by 2‚Äì4 players using a pack of 20‚Äì40 cards, with Aces and Tens scoring 11 and 10 points in tricks, respectively, and marriages scoring 40 points in trumps and 20 points in a plain suit.. An elaborated form of Mariagenspiel known under various names including Klaberjass and Bela is especially popular among Jewish communities and spread worldwide. Its offshoots form the Jass group Jack‚ÄìNine card games, characterized by the fact that the Jack and Nine of the trump suit are the highest trumps. According to David Parlett, the modern German/Austrian variant of Mariagenspiel, Sixty-Six, which remains close to the original, is \\"one of the best two-handers ever devised\\". The \\"marriage\\" theme seems to have originated in France in the context of unrelated card games. Two-handed Schnapsen and three-handed Mari√°≈° and Ulti are the most popular card games in the area of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.... Klaberjass, first documented in the Low Countries as a Jewish game, developed into Dutch Klaverjas, Swiss Jass and French Belote. Bezique and its variants, Binokel and Pinochle, are further examples of popular games in the King‚ÄìQueen or marriage family. The Marriage group is further subdivided into three: * King‚ÄìQueen games are the largest group in which the marriage of a King and Queen or pairing of a King and Ober attract a bonus * Queen-Jack games in which there is a special bonus for a certain combinations of Queen and Jack or Ober and Unter * Jack-Nine games, in which the trump Jack and Nine are the top trumps.  Jack‚ÄìNine games  In this subfamily the Jack (\\"jass\\") and Nine (\\"manille\\") of the trump suit are the highest trumps. Games in this family are typically played by four players with the 32 French-suited cards of a piquet pack. The family contains the closely related French (Belote, Belote contr√©e) and Dutch (Klaverjas) national card games. The Swiss national card game (Jass) is also a close relative but features a number of peculiarities, has spawned numerous variants, and is played with 36 cards. The popular South Asian card games Twenty-eight and Twenty-nine are derivatives of this family and share many of its characteristics. The earliest known games of this family were two- handed, such as Klaberjass (also known as Bela) which is still played worldwide  See also  * Ace-Ten games  References  .

The 1948 timetable gives the station name as Kirkton Bridge Halt. History Fraserburgh Golf Course and the sand dunes The line from Fraserburgh to St Combs itself had opened in 1903 and was the last line built by the Great North of Scotland Railway before it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway. The line was closed in 1965 by the Scottish Region of British Railways as part of the Beeching Cuts. The St Combs line was partly unfenced and it was therefore classified as a light railway and as a result the locomotives had cow catchers. The ruins of the old Church or Kirk of Philoth are located nearby, hence the name of the station.NK06, Surveyed: 1938 - 1955, Published: 1957 Infrastructure The short single platformed halt stood on the west of the line just south of Kirkton Bridge with the Fraserburgh golf club house nearby, located between the St Combs branch and the Fraserburgh branch close to the point where the two lines diverged. It was accessed via a path running across the road from the clubhouse and photographs show that it was built of wood with a gravel surface. No shelter or lighting were provided and the station had no sidings or signalling.RailScot - Kirkton Bridge Halt A level crossing was located nearby at the 1.6 km or 1 mile mile post on the running towards St Combs.NK0065 - A - Surveyed/Revised: 1963, Published:1965 White posts beside the track at the halt assisted the train driver in positioning the train in poor light conditions or after dark.

Rogers (n√©e Lela Emogene Owens) (1891‚Äì1977), sometimes known as Lela Liebrand, was an American journalist, film producer, film editor, and screenwriter. She was the mother of actress Ginger Rogers.  Biography  = Beginnings = Born on Christmas Day in 1891 to Walter Winfield Owens and Wilma Saphrona Owens (n√©e Ball) in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Lela was the oldest of four daughters. She attended grade school in Kansas City, Missouri, where her family finally settled down, and then went to business school to become a stenographer. Her first job was at a furniture store in Kansas City when she was 16. In 1909, she married William Eddins McMath, an electrical engineer, and in 1911, the couple moved to Independence, Missouri, where she worked as a newspaper reporter. It was there that she gave birth to her daughter, Virginia, or Ginger for short. She'd eventually become a theater reporter for The Fort Worth Record in Fort Worth, Texas, where Ginger was first raised. = Screenwriting endeavors = After obtaining a divorce when Ginger was 3, Lela eventually moved to Hollywood, and by 1916, she was writing scripts under the name Lela Liebrand. At this time, she wrote stories for child actress Baby Marie Osborne, among other credits. She also traveled to Kansas to write, direct, and produce a tourism film while working for Path√©. = Service with Marines = During World War I, she was one of the first women to enlist in the Marine Corps, where she handled publicity.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History View of bridge after restoration A series of bridges crossing the Cass River were constructed near what is now Bridgeport, starting in about 1841 with a crossing on the federal turnpike a few miles southeast. By the 1870s, a bridge was constructed about a half-mile south of the current location. In about 1886, a timber bridge was constructed at the current location and the road rerouted along the west side of the river to connect to the site of the previous bridge. However, by the turn of the century this timber bridge had deteriorated. In 1906, a portion of the bridge was destroyed by floating debris, and subsequent inspection revealed that the support pilings were rotted through. The township approved a bond issue, and later that year hired the Joliet Bridge and Iron Company to construct a new bridge. The bridge was completed later that year, and served as the only access to Bridgeport from the south until 1958, when a new bridge was constructed to the south. The bridge was abandoned by Saginaw County in 1969 and reverted to Bridgeport Township. It was closed to highway traffic in about 1972 and converted to pedestrian use. By the 2000s, the bridge had deteriorated, and one support pier was in danger of collapsing. In 2010, the bridge was dismantled and completely restored, with the piers replaced, for continued use as a pedestrian bridge. Description The State Street Bridge is a two-span, steel, Pratt Through Truss bridge with pinned connections. Each span is 126 feet long, and is supported by concrete abutments on each end and a steel I-beam on concrete piers in the center of the river. The center I-beam replaced an original large concrete pier which was destroyed by ice in 1927. Each span is identical, and consists of eight panels. The upper chords are made of two channels with cover plates above and lattice below. The vertical posts are made of two channels connected by lattice bracing connecting them on both sides. Struts connecting the posts are made of back-to-hack angles connected by lattice bracing. The bridge deck is of wood plank, and is supported by steel stringers which are in turn supported by I-beam girders. Two sets of channels form a guardrail on each side. At each end of the bridge is a plaque stating: \\"1906 / BUILT BY / THE JOLIET BRIDGE / & / IRON CO / JOLIET ILL\\" References External links *Photo gallery from HistoricBridges.org Category:National Register of Historic Places in Saginaw County, Michigan Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"State Street Bridge (Bridgeport, Michigan)"},{"id":"59633250","title":"Rendezvous (Jacky Terrasson and Cassandra Wilson album)"},{"id":"59633251","text":"Borze≈üti Petrochemical Plant (formerly GIP - Borze≈üti Petrochemical Industrial Group) is an industrial complex consisting of 5 large-scale plants: Synthetic Rubber and Petrochemicals Complex, No. 10 Oil Refinery, Borze»ôti Chemical Plant, Borze»ôti Power Plant and Chemical Equipment Company, being the largest industrial complex in BacƒÉu County and the largest unit of its kind in Romania, which covers an area of 1,038 hectares, with an average length of 9.4 km and a width of 1.8 to 3.4 km. It is located on the Trotu»ô Valley, on the northeastern outskirts of One»ôti (named between 1965 and 1990 Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej). Its construction began in 1952 and the first plants were put into operation in 1956 at the No. 10 Oil Refinery. On April 1, 1969, the three distinct plants on the industrial platform in Borze≈üti merged into the giant \\"Petrochemical Industrial Group Borze≈üti\\" complex, and in 1973 it was renamed the \\"Borze≈üti Petrochemical Plant\\". The abandonment of the centralized management system of the Romanian economy in 1990 determined the reappearance of the distinct entities, thus the Petrochemical Platform was divided into the private companies: Carom One»ôti, Rafo, Chimcomplex, √éntreprinderea Electrocentrale Borze≈üti and Uton.  Emplacement  The space occupied by the petrochemical plant is located in the north-northeast of One»ôti, near the former village of Borze»ôti. It stretches on the lower terraces of the Trotu»ô River in the valley of the confluence area with altitudes of 5‚Äì7 m and 10‚Äì15 m. It has a rectangular shape oriented north-east, southwest with an average length of 9.4 km and a width 1.8 - 3.4 km. The choice of place is motivated by the relatively flat levels of the terraced bridges, with passages dimmed by the colluvius, the presence of the Trotu≈ü River water on the northern and north-eastern side, the existence of the communication ways.  History  The village of Borzesti in 1904. In the foreground Borze»ôti Church and in the far plan the field of the future industrial complex In 1952, a team of geographers and urbanists headed by Mihail Florescu, Minister of Chemical Industry, went to the Trotu≈ü Valley to establish the location of a city and a large industrial compound. In this team was also the geographer VintilƒÉ M. MihƒÉilescu. It was preferred One»ôti because: # is located at the meeting place of Trotu»ô River (158 km) with its most important tributaries: Ca»ôin River (45 km), Oituz River (57 km) and TazlƒÉu River (85 km). # is situated at a convergence of roads in four main directions: towards Bra»ôov via T√¢rgu Secuiesc through the Oituz Pass; towards T√¢rgu Ocna (with a branch to SlƒÉnic- Moldova), ComƒÉne»ôti (with a branch to Moine»ôti) and Miercurea Ciuc through Ghimes-Palanca Pass; towards BacƒÉu, through the TazlƒÉu subcarpathian depression (with a branch pointing to Moine»ôti); towards Adjud, in the lower valley of the Trotu»ô River. # is seated in a well-populated area. # is set in a relief made up of a slab built of sandstone gravel in a thick blanket covered with clay, consisting of two terraces, a taller one and a lower one. However, natural elements were not enough to achieve a medium-sized city (40-60,000 inhabitants). This is consistent with the French geographer Paul Vidal de La Blache in the sense that \\"the elements of the site have elements of fixation, whereas those of the situation (geographical position) are factors of progression, of development. The site receives the city, but it is the situation which vivifies it.\\" Vidal's concept was also verified in the case of One»ôti, the potential regional elements were concentrated in the petrochemical plant: petroleum crude oil from BacƒÉu Region oilfield, sodium chloride from T√¢rgu Ocna mine. The energy base was completed with the methane gas transported through the trans-Carpathian pipeline Nade»ô-Oituz Pass. R10 Oil Refinery construction between 1959-1960 The location between One»ôti and of a large petrochemical industrial complex - approved by H.C.M. (HotƒÉr√¢rea Consiliului de Mini»ôtrii) No. 1638/1952, an integral part of the measures taken by the Romanian Workers' Party for the development of Western Moldavia, proved to be optimal on technical, economical and social criteria, taking into account the amounts of considerable natural resources in the Trotu»ô basin. The same decision stipulated the need for the construction of a thermal power plant in Borze≈üti, which was to supply the new industrial complex in Onesti with electric and thermal energy. The data in 1951 showed that the electricity demand in Moldova amounted to 1,350 million KWh for the year 1955, that is for 5.6 times more than the entire production of the first year of the 1951-1955 Five-Year Plan. By the Decision of the Council of Ministers (H.C.M.) No. 1635/1952, it was envisaged that in the BacƒÉu Region, T√¢rgu Ocna Raion, the construction of Borze»ôti Industrial Group and the related proletarian city, One»ôti. The industrial zone was built northeast of the former village of Borze»ôti, between the railway and the Trotu»ô River, its surface exceeding that of other parts of the city. As a result of this decision, in 1952, the colonies for construction workers began to be built and then the foundations of the first apartment buildings. At the city and industrial sites have worked alongside construction workers assembled in colonies and common law detainees or political prisoners. Soon the city had the highest number of intellectuals per thousand inhabitants, and the average age was 28 years old. The petrochemical plant was built in four stages: First stage (1952-1960), comprises the first works from the Borze»ôti Thermal Power Plant (1952), the No. 10 Oil Refinery (by H.C.M .1683/1952), the Rubber Plant (H.C.M. 1498/1957) grouped on 610 ha; (1961-1965), the phenol, acetone equipments (1961), synthetic rubber (1963) and styrene-polystyrene (1964), the industrial platform exceeds 846 ha. In the third stage (1966-1970), works were started at Refinery II and the Poly-isoprenic factory. In the fourth stage, two industrial objectives were put into operation: Synthetic Rubber Plant II and Refinery II. The surface of the platform has exceeded 1000 hectares and includes the city platform based on the food industry, wood processing and others. At the same time, beginning construction of the electrolytic caustic soda plant (H.C.M. 2068/1954), later became the Borzesti Chemical Plant, whose first capacities were put into operation in 1960, when the salt brought directly from the T√¢rgu Ocna mine or the brine transported through the plants in pipelines began to be transformed into highly demanded products: caustic soda, chlorine, hydrogen. Between June 18‚Äì25, 1962, a Soviet delegation led by Nikita Khrushchev took place in Romania. The Delegation, accompanied by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, visited the town of One»ôti and the industrial group. In the same year, between September 15‚Äì21, a government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Walter Ulbricht, visited Romania. It also visited the town of Onesti and the industrial complex. In September 1966 the Industrial Complex and the city were visited by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and Ion Gheorghe Maurer. Installations commissioned in 1960 were: diaphragm electrolysis, liquid chlorine evaporation-melting, lime chloride, sulfuric acid, monochlorobenzene, detoxane and hexachlorane - commissioning continued in 1961 with chlorination plants and methylene chloride. Featuring chlorine in large quantities, this plant becomes one of the largest chlorinated insecticides producers in the country, managing to cover not only the needs of agriculture, but also to provide products for export. \\"Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej ‚Äì A fortress of labor\\", with the Borze»ôti II Power Station photo in the background and imprinted coat of arms of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej city in Socialist Republic of Romania The operation of the third industrial unit on the current petrochemical complex was carried out in 1962, when the first quantities of Isopropylbenzene, phenol and acetone were produced. For industrial complex and for the national economy, this year was a crucial moment, since the commissioning of the Synthetic Rubber and Petrochemicals Complex has created the premises for a broad economic development for the coming years and a jump in the economic potential of BacƒÉu County. These units continued with new technologies, at the oil refinery the atmospheric and vacuum distillation plants no. 3, thermal cracking, catalytic cracking no. 1 and 2, absorption-fractionation gas, coke calcination, catalytic reforming complex and furfurol gas oil solvent plant, which have created opportunities to capitalize products at a higher level. At the same pace, the electrolytic caustic soda plant increased production. At old plants have been added new ones: fatty alcohols, vinyl compounds, caustic soda. At the rubber plant, new polyisoprene rubber plants were put into operation. On April 1, 1969, the three factories on the Borze»ôti Industrial Complex merged into the giant \\"Petrochemical Industrial Group Borze≈üti\\", and in 1973 it became the \\"Borze≈üti Petrochemical Plant\\", comprising 12,000 of employees, out of which 463 have higher education. In the over 20 years that have passed since the establishment of the first plant, through an organic bonding between technological processes and through superior valorization, it has continuously strengthened its economic power, maintaining itself as the most important industrial unit of BacƒÉu County. In 1970 the chemical production of the Borzesti Petrochemical Industrial Group accounted for 99.9% of the production of the chemical industry of BacƒÉu County and 8% of the chemical industry of the country. At the end of 1979, the value of the fixed assets in the endowment amounted to 7860 million lei, resulting in an industrial production of almost 7 billion lei, representing 26% of the entire industrial production of the county. Value production in 1979 was 3.4 times higher than in 1965, when the average annual growth rate was 9.2%. Significant increases were recorded over 1965 in a series all products such as: caustic soda 1.9 times, synthetic rubber 4.7 times, phenol 2.4 times, polystyrene 3.7 times, gasoline 2.3 times, vinyl polychloride 1.4 times, insecticides 1.5 times. The products manufactured by the petrochemical complex have been exported to more than 40 countries including: The union of Soviet Socialist Rebublics, People's Republic of China, German Democratic Republic, People‚Äôs Republic of Hungary, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, England, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Spain, France Egypt, Israel, Czechoslovakia, Iran, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, India, Polish People's Republic, People's Republic of Bulgaria, Sweden, Turkey and others.Brochure \\"Grupul Industrial de Petrochimie Borze»ôti ‚Äì Uzina de Cauciuc Sintetic CAROM Rom√¢nia\\", page 1 (front) Between 11‚Äì14 October 1976, King Baudouin of Belgium, accompanied by Queen Fabiola, visited Romania, among others by visiting the petrochemical complex. The platform had 12,000 workers in 1980, achieving a productivity of 2.8 times higher than in 1965. The benefits obtained in 1979 by this unit amounted to 520 million lei. The Petrochemical plant Borze≈üti directly influenced the establishment and development of a new city, which became the municipality of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (One»ôti), which ensures conditions for the petrochemical workers of Trotu»ô Valley. The new city is remarkable by the pace of development and specialization, modern architecture and a dynamic influence area. These qualities were synthesized by the French geographer Andr√© Blanc - \\"Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej is the brightest example of the creative transformation of the natural environment based on systematic studies in order to raise the economic level of a region that was underdeveloped until short time ago.\\" File:Combinatul de cauciuc sintetic Onesti ‚Äì Combinatul petro- chimic, instalatii in aer liber.jpgSynthetic Rubber and Petrochemicals Complex File:Combinatul de cauciuc sintetic Onesti ‚Äì Combinat chimic, fabrica, instalatii in aer liber.jpgE1 plant File:Combinatul de cauciuc sintetic Onesti ‚Äì Combinat chimic, fabrica.jpgThe building of the styrene polymerization reactors File:Combinatul chimic Onesti - Borzesti ‚Äì vedere de ansamblu, fragment.jpgOther equipments File:Combinatul petro-chimic, fabrica de polistiren expandat ‚Äì Fabrica polistiren, instala»õii √Æn aer liber, vedere de ansamblu.jpgPolystyrene plant File:Rafinaria Gheorghe Gheorghiu- Dej.jpgNo. 10 Oil Refinery (Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej - 1968) File:Combinatul chimic One»ôti - Borze»ôti ‚Äì vedere de ansamblu, fragment.tifBorze»ôti Chemical Plant and Borze»ôti Power Station File:Carom Onesti, de sus.jpgAerial view of Synthetic Rubber and Petrochemicals Complex  Industrial structure  The Trotu»ô basin had a natural and human potential corresponding to economic and social transformations. After World War II, oversized industrial construction plans were developed that surpassed regional potential, leading to large investments, difficulties in raw materials supply and distribution of products and, in some cases, pollution of the area. In 1986, the workers of the One»ôti industry exceeded 22,000 people and the industrial platform reached 1,038 ha. In the first stage of development, the foundations of an energy industry were established. After 1980 there were significant mutations in the structure of production, in the superior valorization of raw materials in the area. In 1984 over 54% of industrial production was petroleum products, 21,8% synthetic rubber and latex, 5,5% plastics, 4,8% insecticides, fungicides and herbicides for agriculture, 3,7% caustic soda and 9% organic and inorganic chemicals, solvents, chlorinates. = Energy industry = The Borze»ôti Power Station began building in 1956, when the first 25 MW generator was installed. Until 1966 were completed with 25 MW, in 1957, 50 MW in 1960, 25 MW in 1961, 50 MW in 1962 and 1966. The largest increase in capacity was in 1969 with 2x200 MW, the main fuels being oil and the gas flowing from the TazlƒÉu Valley. The installed power of the thermal plant in 1970 exceeded the installed power of existing generating sets throughout the country in 1938. The grid generated electricity over the requirements of the industrial complex and the residential city, with production increasing 63.7 times in 1985 compared to 1956, so 110 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV power lines were built for the industrial centers in Western Moldavia and southeastern Transylvania and the railway networks in the Trotu»ô, Olt and Siret valleys. = Petrochemical industry = No. 10 Oil Refinery √Æn 1964 The No. 10 Oil Refinery is part of the large refinery category with capacity over 1 million tons. It consists of: Refinery I (\\"One»ôti 10\\") with electrical desalination plants (1957-1960), atmospheric distillation (1961) and Refinery II with gas fraction sections (1980), catalytic reforming (1980) hydrofinishing of gasoline (1980). The refinery processes oil from BacƒÉu County and some quantities are transferred from refineries in Muntenia or distributed from export. The transport of regional oil and petroleum products is done through pipelines or the railway network. Products include petrol, fuel oil, diesel fuel and derivatives such as benzene, xylene, orthoxylene, ethylbenzene, liquefied gases, and the like. The Synthetic Rubber and Petrochemicals Complex produced the first quantities of synthetic ethylene-styrene butadiene rubber, being the only enterprise of its kind in the country. The construction took place between 1958 and 1963. Unlike the refinery which primarily processes petroleum into petroleum products (fractions), the rubber plant transforms oil fractions into finished products, such as polystyrene, phenol, acetone, benzene, used in the medicine and paint industry. Since 1976, a second polyisoprene rubber plant has been put into operation and later facilities for the manufacture of latex and butadiene- styrene rubbers. The synthetic rubber output was 30,820 tonnes in 1965 and 155,909 tonnes in 1985, of which the polyisoprene rubber was 57,079 tonnes in 1985. In 1970 the fourth line of rubber was put into operation and 70,000 tons of synthetic rubber was produced in that year. The manufactured rubber products were: CAROM 1500: for automotive tires, tractors, scooters, motorcycles, technical articles, conveyor belts, transmission belts and other items requiring good physical properties and good strength. CAROM 1502: for black and colored technical articles, sanitary ware, rubber cloth, carpets. CAROM 1503: for consumer goods, especially footwear. CAROM 1712: for cable and yarn insulation, technical articles, tires and many other applications. = Chemical industry = The Borzesti Chemical Plant is located in the southeastern part of the industrial platform. It was built between 1956 and 1964 with the following structure: caustic soda plant (1960), toxan plant (1961) and polyvinyl chloride - PVC (1964) plant with acetylene, monomer, polychlorinated vinyl emulsion, vinyl polychloride suspension. Acetylene was obtained from a mixture of methane and propane gas by the arc cracking process developed by Aurel Ionescu (1902-1954). The initial profile included chlorosodic products: caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), hydrochloric acid, aluminum chloride, lime chloride, further diversifying production, adding organic solvents: methyl chloride, methylene chloride, cloroform; plastics: vinyl polychloride, emulsion and suspension, ferric vinyl; fatty alcohols, liquid chlorine, and the like. In addition, installations for the production of ammonium chloride, chlorinated insecticides and others have been put into operation. The chemical plant participated in the national production in the chemical branch by 14% - 25.6%. The production of caustic soda recorded an increase of 48.7 times in 1980 compared to 1960 and the production of insecticides by 30.6 times. = Machine building industry = Borze»ôti Chemical Equipment Company was established between 1973-1976, in the following years, manufacturing products such as: technological equipment for chemical, petrochemical, crude, pulp and paper processing; metal structures and mounting elements. The raw materials used were purchased mainly from the Gala»õi Steel Works, Roman Steel Pipes Works, \\"Republica\\" Bucharest Steel Pipes Works. In 1980, I.U.C. Borze»ôti was the only manufacturer of equipment for pilot plants in the chemical industry in the country. In the same year export activity started in countries such as: Soviet Union, People's Republic of Bulgaria, Austria and Federal Republic of Germany.

Promoted by prison reformers as an alternative to imprisonment, periodic detention drew praise for allowing offenders to continue working, maintain family relationships, and avoid associating with more dangerous criminals in traditional prisons. It was also considerably less expensive to administer.  Implementations  = Australia = Periodic detention was introduced in the Australian State of New South Wales in 1971 and expanded on the recommendation of the Nagle royal commission. The State's first periodic detention centre operated at the Malabar prison complex. Other centres later opened at Bathurst, Broken Hill, Emu Plains, Silverwater, Tamworth, Tomago and Unanderra. A facility for female offenders, the Norma Parker Periodic Detention Centre, operated at Parramatta. High-profile offenders sentenced to periodic detention included actor Diarmid Heidenreich, investment adviser Rene Rivkin and bookmaker Robbie Waterhouse. New South Wales ended its periodic detention program 2010, in favour of non- custodial sentences such as \\"intensive corrections orders\\", a form of mandatory community service possibly combined with other conditions such as drug-testing. Under the new system, a conditional non-custodial sentence is imposed. The offender is not detained if conditions are satisfied, but the sentence may be upgraded to full-time custodial detention if the conditions are violated. The Australian Capital Territory operated a periodic detention centre at Symonston. = New Zealand = Periodic detention operated in New Zealand between 1962 and 2002, although offenders did not always serve on weekends. High-profile offenders sentenced to periodic detention included former Member of parliament John Kirk. In 2002, periodic detention was combined with community service.  Criticism  Referring specifically to the implementation of periodic detention in New South Wales, Jurist James Wood described such sentences as \\"a minor inconvenience\\" for offenders. Although it avoided mixing first-time and petty criminals with more serious offenders, periodic detention nonetheless brought offenders together, potentially reinforcing criminogenic behaviours. Periodic detention also requires dedicated prisons, periodic detention centres, to be built. Despite these initial costs, periodic detention was over 25% less expensive than its replacement in New South Wales.

Gallagher began his career starring in the Nine Network children's series The Saddle Club and later ventured into film playing the titular character in the 2013 horror film Patrick. He gained wider recognition for his role as Josh Barrett in the soap opera Home and Away. He left the series in 2016 and soon secured more television roles including AFL player Connor Marrello in the Network Ten drama series Playing for Keeps. He has also completed additional film roles scheduled for release in 2019. Aside from acting Gallagher has worked as a stills photographer for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation network. Early life Gallagher was born in Melbourne and his family moved to Daylesford, Victoria. They made home on a one-hundred-acre farm which allowed Gallagher to practise horse riding. When he finished school Gallagher went to New York City and found work in a circus and later as a photography assistant. There he developed a liking for photography. He also studied acting at the Stella Adler Conservatory. He secured a pre-med course at Melbourne University which he opted to quit in favour of completing a Bachelor of Arts in film and anthropology. He graduated from university in 2012. In 2014, Gallagher was caught up in two rockfalls while on a climbing expedition at the Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand. He escaped without any injuries. Career Gallagher began his career starring in the Nine Network children's series The Saddle Club as Ashley 'Chewie' Becker. The actor later went onto secure his first film role in the 2013 horror genre film Patrick. He played the titular character, but spent most of the film shoot bedbound. Film director Mark Hartley praised Gallagher's performance for bringing \\"inner menace\\" to the role. In 2013 Gallagher worked as a professional photographer for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation network. He has stated that being a still photographer for the network allowed him to learn on-set technique. That year Gallagher joined the cast of the Australian soap opera Home and Away, playing the role of Josh Barrett. He was joined by Tai Hara who played his on-screen brother Andy Barrett. The two characters appeared in their own stand-alone webisodes titled Home and Away Extras, before making their debuts in the main show. Gallagher was hesitant about auditioning for the role of a sixteen-year-old because he thought he looked too old which could ruin his chances of success. He auditioned for the role on a Friday and was offered the role the following Monday. At the time Gallagher said \\"whatever idea they had in their heads of Josh, I happened to fit that image.\\" The actor relocated to Sydney for filming and recalled being \\"terrified\\" about completing his first day on set. Jackson remained in the role for three years before he was written out in 2016. In 2016, the actor played the part of gay character Kyle in Josh Thomas' comedy series Please Like Me. Gallagher also travelled to refugee camps located in the Middle Eastern country Jordan, where he worked as a photographer for the charity Act of Peace. His next project was a guest role of Tamas Lupei in the ABC drama The Doctor Blake Mysteries. In May 2018, it was announced that he had secured the regular role of Connor Marrello in the Network Ten drama series Playing for Keeps. The show is about a group of AFL players and their wives' personal lives. He also starred as Clay in the comedy series Back In Very Small Business. In 2019, Gallagher will star in the Dee McLachlan directed film The Wheel, playing the role of Matthew Allen Mills. The film focuses on a group of prisoners who are forced to participate in scientific experiments.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History The section of land where Bliss Park is now located was once part of a tract owned by Louis Campau, the first white settler in the area. Campau purchased it in 1822, but in 1826 left the area to become one of the founders of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The property remained in the Campau family and undeveloped for some 80 years. The property became an unofficial common ground for residents of Saginaw, and was used for recreation and other purposes. Notably, it was used during the Civil War as a drilling ground for the 29th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and for various Civil War reunions afterward. In 1903, Aaron T. Bliss (then governor of Michigan) purchased the land for this park from the Campau family and donated it to the city of Saginaw. In 1904, the Saginaw Board of Public Works hired landscape gardener E. C. Foster of Kalamazoo, Michigan to design the landscaping for the park. However, those plans were deemed unsuitable, and in 1906 the newly-created Board of Park and Cemetery Commissioners hired Cottage Gardens Company, Inc., of Queens, New York to complete plans. The company created an open plan that retained many of the natural features that Saginaw residents valued. Much of this plan was implemented that year, with more the next. In the first few years of the 1910s, monuments were placed in the park. In the 1930s, Bliss Park was significantly renovated with assistance from the Work Projects Administration. Renovations included a new shelter house, parking lot, and changes to the landscaping. Bliss Park remained in use through the rest of the century without major changes. Description Bliss Park is a small trapezoidal park, covering about 13 acres. It consists of five distinct areas: a broad open recreation ground, a smaller open playfield, a wooded picnic grove, a ceremonial garden/plaza area, and a parking area. The recreation ground and playfield are open areas lined with trees. The picnic area covers much of the park surface, and has a number of large hardwood trees for shade. Monuments within the park provide focal points. The parking area is to the south, and a semicircular garden/plaza to the west. Te plaza has small trees and flowers.

She lived in Germany until 1933 when Hitler came to power, then escaped to France. In 1939 she emigrated to the United States and lived there until her death in 1981.  Early research  Weiss was one of the first doctoral students at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, joining in 1924. She wrote her thesis on a comparison of the Zeiss optical factory, based on her personal experiences working there, and the Ford Motor Company in Detroit.Garz, D. ed., 2004.

She describes the challenges of working at Zeiss in her autobiography, where she was the only woman in her department. Initially the men there harassed her: > They told obscene jokes and laughed so maliciously when I could not > understand them. But after a little while they found out that I was a member > of the union. Then they no longer treated me as a little girl, but talked > about labor conditions and union meetings.Garz, D. ed., 2004, p. 42.

She familiarized Fromm with Weberian survey > research approaches.Friedman, L.J., 2013. The lives of Erich Fromm, New > York: Columbia University Press.  Escaping Nazi Germany  Hilda Weiss was Jewish, so with the rise of Nazism it was extremely dangerous for her to stay in Germany. She decided to leave for Switzerland in April 1933. Just before she boarded a train, a dining car waiter recognised her and attracted her attention. It turned out that he had also worked at Zeiss. He helped her to escape, concocting cover stories whenever she was approached by German police (which by then were controlled by the Nazis). She arrived safely in Basel. After a brief time in Geneva, she moved onto Paris. Then, in 1939 at the start of World War II, she escaped to the United States.Garz, D. ed., 2004.  Marriages  In October 1935 Weiss married Louis Rigaudias, a French Trotskyist leader. They divorced in 1938. She married Joseph P. Parker, officially on 6 April 1955; however, a number of letters suggest this marriage took place in summer 1950. Parker died in a car accident on 6 February 1958.Garz, D. ed., 2004.

It was in the east of the island in Surrey County Saint David Parish was one of several parishes abolished as part of the administrative reforms introduced following the Morant Bay rebellion. The new Governor, John Peter Grant, arrived in 1866. The colony was losing money and when the arrangements of the existing parishes was looked at, a great disparity in populations and sizes was found. Thus in 1861 St David had a population of 6,452 living in an area of 76.5 square miles, while Saint Elizabeth Parish covered 448 square miles with a population of 37,777. Grant set out to make savings by rationalising the Parishes, reducing their number from 22 to 14. To this end the Jamaican Legislative Council passed A Law to Reduce the Number of Parishes (1867/No.20) under which Saint David Parish was merged with the bulk of Saint Thomas in the East Parish from 1 May 1867 to form Saint Thomas Parish.

The coat of arms on the east face of the castle is \\"d'or √† croix de gueules\\" - gold with a cross of gules (red) - and corresponds to the arms of the Lordats, an ancient chivalric family from the County of Foix.

Architecture The current version of the castle has a rectangular plan comprising four round towers at the corners and presents all of the characteristics of a 14th-century medieval castle, remodelled during the French Renaissance. At the start of the 19th century, it was totally restored by its owners. This castle is a significant testimony of the history of the Toulouse region; indeed it represents the move from the individualist architectural currents of the Hundred Years' War to the advent of the French Renaissance, transforming a stronghold into a place of comfort.

He was a founder member of the bands Mandalaband and Sad Caf√©. He was co-writer of the latter's 1979 No. 3 UK hit single \\"Every Day Hurts\\" and the 1980 No. 14 hit \\"My Oh My\\". He was also a member of the rock band 10cc from 1981 to 1983. Early life and career Emerson was born in Prestwich, which at the time was in Lancashire but is now in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, in Greater Manchester. He was the son of tailor Ben Emerson, and wife Myra. At age four, he had his first piano lessons and attended the Bury Grammar School. In the early 1960s, he bought a Hammond organ for use at home, then became a cinema organist in Stockport after he left school. In the 1960s, Emerson worked on the cabaret circuit, playing keyboards, then became a session musician at Camel Studios, where he met drummer Tony Cresswell, guitarist Ashley Mulford and bass player John Stimpson, all later to become members of Sad Caf√©. The engineer at the studios, David Rohl, was working on an album called Mandalaband and asked Emerson to play keyboards on the album. This was when Mandalaband was formed, with Emerson becoming a member. After the split of Mandalaband in 1976, Emerson moved into a flat with John Stimpson in Manchester, and they looked to form a new band. Needing a singer, they met Paul Young of the band Gyro, and this was when Sad Caf√© was formed. The band had a No. 3 hit single in the UK with \\"Every Day Hurts\\", which was written by Emerson, Stimpson and Young, and produced by Eric Stewart of 10cc. In 1981, Emerson became a member of 10cc. He toured with the band and played on the albums Ten Out of 10 and Windows in the Jungle, as well as on Stewart's second solo album, Frooty Rooties. In 1985, a year after he left Sad Caf√©, Emerson moved to Paris, France. While living there, he worked on various albums of local artists such as on Alain Bashung's Pass√© le Rio Grande and Novice, Zazie's Zen and Emma Shapplin's Carmine Meo. After Paul Young's death in 2000, Emerson contributed on several tracks for the 2011 posthumous Paul Young album, Chronicles.

Because it is intuitive in the splitting of Chinese characters and has theoretical support in Chinese characters, it had once attracted widespread attention at the beginning of the invention and was listed as a key project in China Torch Project. However, there was afterwards no such influence as Wubi method and Zhengma method in terms of popularization and commercialization. Biaoxingma was pre-installed by Microsoft in Chinese Windows 95 and Windows 98 first edition, but was removed from Windows 98 second edition and later Windows versions. Biaoxingma was also installed in IBM AIX.  Basics  The smallest constituent parts of each Chinese character are called strokes. One or more strokes form the components of a character. Characters are divided into several components, which are coded to the English letter resembling them. Due to the resemblance of the letter and the character components it refer to, Biaoxingma is easy to learn and remember compared with Wubi method and Zhengma method. Moreover, the biggest advantage of Biaoxingma is that crossed strokes are never divided into two components. In other words, the character components never cross each other. This makes the way of splitting characters very intuitive.

He coached a number of teams like Kadƒ±k√∂yspor, Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ±, Efes Pilsen, Be≈üikta≈ü, Fenerbah√ße, √áukurova, Dar√º≈ü≈üafaka, Kar≈üƒ±yaka and Galatasaray as well as the youth, junior's university and senior national teams. He was the most successful head coach of the Turkish Super Basketball League. Private life Aydan Siyavu≈ü was born to Ali Nazima and his wife Utarit in Istanbul on 15 May 1947. He belonged to a noble and intellectual family, which descends from the Ottoman Vizier Siyavu≈ü Pasha. His father was a journalist, and served as executive at Galatasaray S.K. and as president at Kadƒ±k√∂yspor. Her mother had also served as executive at Galatasaray S.K. In November 1977, he married to Nevin. He was father of two daughters, ƒ∞pek and Tuƒü√ße Siyavu≈ü. Siyavu≈ü died at the age of 50 on 11 January 1998 in the state hospital in Silivri, Istanbul Province following a heart attack he contracted during a celebration in a hotel after a victorious match. He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul. Sports career =Player= His sports related parents played a significant role in his choice for a sports career, particularly in basketball. Siyavu≈ü played basketball at Kadƒ±k√∂yspor until 1964. At age of 17, as he should move from the youth team to the senior team, he retired from active playing, and decided to enter a coaching career. He said later that \\"he quit playing basketball because he saw no future as a player due to his physical disadvantage caused by his excessive eating habit\\". =Coach= Club During his student years at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Istanbul Technical University, he devoted himself to coaching. He began his career as the coach of his university's basketball youth team. After he made his first success by making his team won the title of the Turkey Youth Basketball Championship, he decided to drop out his engineering study in the third grade. His father was not much disappointed with Siyavu≈ü' decision although he was an engineer's grandson. The only goal of Siyavu≈ü became now to be a coach in the newly established Turkish Basketball League. In the 1970-71 season, Siyavu≈ü coached Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. team. In the early 1970s when the ƒ∞stanbul Teknik √úniversitesi B.K.(ƒ∞T√ú) was the sole team to win the championship title in a row, he complained about his team not exercising enough as he proposed five-day exercise to meet the modern basketball requirements. In a times, when basketball play in Turkey was considered as a hobby, he kept track of the developments in the U.S. believing it was the center of basketball and basketball is a professional sport. Before the 1971-72 season, he left Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. team after disagreements with the team captain and the management. He took over Kadƒ±k√∂yspor team and the youth team of Galatasaray S.K. He made his Second League-team Kadƒ±k√∂yspor became champion and got promoted to the First league at the end of the season. Before the 1973-74 season, he moved to Izmir to coach the Second League-team Kar≈üƒ±yaka Basket. He was again successful to help the team got promoted to the First League at the end of the season. He was able to place his team at the third spot of the First League's 1974-75 season. The same season, the youth team from Izmir became under his coaching also Turkish champion. He was transferred in the 1975-76 season by Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± S.K., which were promoted to the First League once season before, upon advice of its leaving coach Yal√ßƒ±n Granit. The team enjoyed the winning the league champion title in their second season only against the last season's champion Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. It was also Sivayu≈ü' the first champion title in the First League. In that season, Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± S.K. reached also an important statistic by scoring the most points (1,858 points, 84.4 points per game) and conceding the less points (1,449 points, 65.8 points per game). The team gained a significant experience by winning five of the six matches at a tournament in the U.S., where they were invited by the University of Montana before the 1976-77 season. After winning two more consecutive league champion titles in 1976-77 and 1977-78, the team made a \\"three-peat\\" coached by Siyavu≈ü. Eczaba≈üƒ± S.K. took part in the FIBA European Champions Cup. The team finished the 1978-79 season as the runner-up losing in the newly established play-offs to Efes Pisen S.K., which took over Siyavu≈ü' former playing team Kadƒ±k√∂yspor. With the help of coach Siyavu≈ü, Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± S.K. managed to capture the league champion title again in the next season. They repeated their success three successive seasons of 1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82 making their second \\"three-peat\\" in seven years. Before the 1983-84 season, Siyavu≈ü signed with Fenerbah√ße Basketball, which had a big basketball potential. The most important point for his decision to move to Fenerbah√ße S.K. was the very talented player Efe Aydan, he had a 10-year close relationship. However, already in the mid of the season, he left Fenerbah√ße due to disagreements with the management, and transferred to Efes Pilsen. The team became league champion with Siyavu≈ü in the 1983-84 season. This was his seventh and the last league champion title. Although the team missed the play- offs in the 1984-85 season, and became only runner-up in the 1085-86 season, they won the 2nd Turkish Basketball Presidential Cup in 1986. Siyavu≈ü coached Be≈üikta≈ü in the 1986-87 season. He returned, however, the next season to his former club Efes Pilsen signing a league three-year contract. The team were unable to be successful in the next three seasons. Their achievement to play in the quarterfinals of the 1989‚Äì90 FIBA Koraƒá Cup was considered the greatest success of the team in Europe. In the 1990-91 season, he was again with Kar≈üƒ±yaka in Izmir. The team formed by young players reached the play-offs, however, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the 1991-92 season, he moved to Mersin to coach √áukurova Sanayi. The team was eliminated in the semifinals of the play-offs. In the 1993-94 season, Galatasaray offered him 800 million (approx. USD 67,000), a very attractive sum relative to the conditions of that time. Even though the team were unable to become league champion in the following seasons, they won the gold medal at the 1994‚Äì95 Turkish Basketball Cup. Due to health problems, he took a break as coach in the 1996-97 season. However, he remained in basketball sport reassuming the post of a technical coordinator at Dar√º≈ü≈üafaka Basketbol. In the 1997-98 season, he returned to his former club Galatasaray but he could coach only in the first half of the league season. After a victorious match, he suffered a heart attack and died in January 1998. In an interview he gave in November 1997, he had foreboded his deadly end. Siyavu≈ü was the most successful coach of the Turkish Basketball Super League holding seven champion titles, a record unbroken so far since 19 years as of 2018. International Siyavu≈ü was the third Turkish coach obtaining a FIBA head coach license. He coached the Turkey national youth's and the national junior's teams. he made the Turkey junior team Balkan champion in 1976. In 1977, he quit his post as the head coach of the Turkey junior's national team to concentrate on his new team Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ± S.K. In September 1981, he was appointed head coach of the Turkey national basketball team. The national team defeated the teams of Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia and Greece at the 1981 Balkan Championship held in Sofia, Bulgaria, and took the gold medal with Siyavu≈ü. The international success and the subsequent broadcasting of television series The White Shadow in Turkey played a great role in spreading the interest in basketball in the country. The national team won the gold medal at the 1987 Mediterranean Games held in Latakia, Syria with him defeating the strong Spanish team in the final. Siyavu≈ü retired from his post as the head coach of the Turkey national team after ten years to focus on his team Efes Pilsen. In 1992, Siyavu≈ü was persuaded by Yal√ßƒ±n Granit, the technical coordinator of national basketball teams, to take over the head coach post again. He managed the national team qualified to take part at the EuroBasket 1993 in Germany. In 1993, his post was ended by the Turkish Basketball Federation because a new regulation did not allow him to coach the national team while he was the coach of a club at the same time.

Purpose  GM-GH has as its main goal to keep alive the legacy and memory of the Belgian political prisoners and resistance during World War II. The association also favors human rights, and respect for human dignityhttps://www.companyweb.be/company/696962123/free-pub/15410389. The activities of the association include lectures, publications, events, press conferences and educational days.  Historical background  The GM-GH was founded in 1993 by two Belgian resistance fighters and political prisoners of the Second World War, . Baron Arthur Haulot, then-chairman of Vriendenkring Dachau together with his friend Baron , then-chairman of the Auschwitz Foundation. The founding of the association coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi extermination camps in 1945. Their successors were (in chronological order): http://www.yveslouis.com/files/publicaties/NOUVELLE%20BIOGRAPHIE%20NATIONALE%20-%20A%20WYNEN.pdf(former president of the World Medical Association WMA) Pieter-Paul Baeten http://lesresistantsdelamemoire.be/forum/topic-6309+pieter-paul-baeten-etait- entre-en-resistance-a-16-ans.php and Yves Louis. With the death of Philippe Claes and Pieter-Paul Baeten came an end to the era of political prisoners at the helm of the association.http://www.yveslouis.com/files/groep/LLB%2016%2002%202018.pdf The 'children of the second generation' felt there was a need to continue the association's existence and continue the memory of the political prisoners of the Second World War.  Activities  From its inception, the GM-GH has been active in Belgian society at educational and political level. = Educational = In 1995, the GM-GH partnered with the King Baudouin Foundation to set up \\"50 years later\\", a memory project intended for Belgian school-goers, both in the Dutch and French speaking regions of the country. The project was under the auspices of the then GM-GH president Haulot. It consisted of a 5-day educational trip by train from Brussels to Auschwitz organized for European youngsters. The 'Train de la d√©mocratie et de la libert√© - Buchenwald - Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp (Allemagne)' (the Train of Freedom to Buchenwald - Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp (Germany)) was an educational sponsored journey which took place in 2008 for 1000 youngsters (400 Belgians and 600 other Europeans) to meet at and learn about the Buchenwald Nazi camp and what transpired there. From the Belgian side, the trip was organized by the National Institute of War Invalids (l'Institut National des Invalides de Guerre, Anciens Combattants et Victimes de Guerre) and the International Federation of Resistance Fighters. Pieter-Paul Baeten accompanied the youngsters on this trip as president of the Buchenwald association and president of the GM-GH. = Political engagement = In 2007, Wynen, the second president of the GM-GH, filed a motion before the Senate endorsed by Senator Francis Delp√©r√©e stating that in order to be able to stand for democratic elections, all political parties and their candidates must openly declare that their programmes are in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted on 10 December 1948 by the United Nations and that, should this be challenged, they are prepared to answer before the Belgian judicial system (Breendonk Declaration 2007). In 2014 the Belgian interior minister Jan Jambon, member of the N-VA party, stated that in his view it was a mistake for the Belgians to collaborate with the German army occupier during the Second World War although these citizens had their reasons for so doing. The GM-GH disagreed with minister Jan Jambon's remarks concerning German collaboration in the Second World War in an article published in La Libre Belgique on 14 October 2014 stating that 'Mr Jambon ought not turn his back on history'.  Parliamentary inquiries  = The classification of the cellars of the Gestapo - Avenue Louise, Brussels = During World War II, after the invasion of Belgium, the German military occupied Brussels. The Gestapo, which was part of the Nazi security organisation, the Sicherheitspolizei- Sicherheitsdienst (Sipo-SD), set up their Brussels headquarters on Avenue Louise. On 9 January 2014 the Brussels government launched a procedure to classify the cellars of the buildings occupied by the Gestapo, during the Second World War, at 347 and 453 Avenue Louise in Brussels. The interested parties requesting to preserve this heritage site included Auschwitz Foundation President Henri Goldberg, Daniel Weyssow from the same Foundation and for the GM-GH, Roger de Taevernier and historian Claire Pahaut. The provisional classification obliged the owners to open their cellar to expert investigation by the \\"Commission royale des Monuments, Sites et Fouilles\\". Following the favorable report by the \\"Commission royale des Monuments, Sites et Fouilles\\" the cellars in the two buildings were officially classified on 14 January 2016. = Controversial ongoing allocation of pensions to Belgian military collaborators of the Waffen-SS during the Second World War = Research indicates that a number of Belgians who joined the Waffen-SS during the Second World War received and continue to receive a pension from Germany. At the end of the Second World War, 57,000 Belgians were convicted for collaboration, 30,000 were Flemish and the other 27,000 were Walloons and from the Brussels region. The GM-GH played a pivotal role in lobbying the Belgian government to put an end to German pension payments. The GM-GH voiced concern that former Belgian collaborators were still receiving payments from Germany for their wartime activities. The German government for its part stated in 2012 that it could not confirm the exact number of Belgian ex-collaborators receiving German pensions. They did, however, confirm that 57 Belgians were receiving German BVG (\\"Bundesversorgungsgesetz\\") maintenance payments, with no explanation who those Belgians were. Following the work conducted by Alvin de Coninck (son of a resistance fighter) and the GM-GH, deputies from various political parties tabled a motion for a resolution seeking clarification of this issue. As of 2017, 27 people residing in Belgium were receiving this annuity from Germany. A working group will meet under the direction of a representative of the authors of the resolution to submit a proposal to the German authorities.http://www.yveslouis.com/files/groep/Le%20Soir%2028%2003%202017.pdf The Belgian parliament's Foreign relations Committee passed a Resolution on 14 March 2019 calling on its government to ask Germany to stop providing this tax-free annuity, whilst emphasizing the injustice of these payments as victims of \\"Nazism\\" do not receive comparable allowances.http://www.yveslouis.com/files/groep/le%20monde%204%20juin19.pdfhttp://www.yveslouis.com/files/groep/RESOLUTIE%20PARLEMENT.pdf  Historical projects  = Discovery of the Wolvertem Nazi Party M√ºtterheim = A GM-GH member discovered Nazi documents in the war archives in Paris referring to a M√ºtterheim (maternity hospital) in Wolvertem, Belgium. This German establishment in rural Wolvertem in Flemish Brabant situated north-west of Brussels was hitherto kept a secret. This M√ºtterheim was set up by the Germans as a branch of the Brussels Brugmann hospital, which the Germans used as a war hospital (Kriegslazarett). Formerly known as castle Levedale in Wolvertem, referred to also as Neromhof, was converted into a maternity hospital in August 1942. The first admissions were in November of the same year. The M√ºtterheim offered a good level of medical care for both mother and child. Spouses of SS officers benefited from the facilities offered by this maternity hospital. The M√ºtterheim in Wolvertem was by strict definition not a Lebensborn clinic and therefore did not come under the jurisdiction of the SS. A genuine Lebensborn maternity was later established at W√©gimont castle near Li√®ge, the Wolvertem clinic just serving as a stepping stone. Nanna Conti, the mother of the SS minister of public health (Reichsgesundheitsf√ºhrer) Leonardo Conti,https://www.auschwitz.be/images/_bulletin_trimestriel/112_louis_verschooris.pdf oversaw the M√ºtterheim in Wolvertem. She appointed a Norwegian Lebensborn as head midwife. Dr. Frans Daels, a gynecologist from Ghent University, and his assistant Ad√®le Vankerckhove, director of the nursing school in Ghent, saw to the appointment of Flemish midwives to the M√ºtterheim. The clinic was operational for a year before moving its activities to W√©gimont castle, a genuine Lebensborn clinic. An estimated 20 to 30 children were born in Wolvertem.http://www.yveslouis.com/files/intro/MEMOIRE%20LAPREVOTE.pdf  Notes   See also  *Belgium in World War II  References  Category:Prisoners' and ex-prisoners' rights Category:Human rights organisations based in Belgium Category:1993 establishments in Belgium ","title":"Groupe M√©moire - Groep Herinnering"},{"id":"59633930","text":"Russell Allport & Co machine shop, Hobart with the frame for a small electric loco in the far left corner Small electric locomotive built by Russell Allport & Co, Hobart probably for Hopetoun A log hauler at Russell Allport & Co, Hobart Wielangta tram, 1911 (James) Russell Allport (died 5 February 1914 in Suva, Fiji) was an Australian electrical engineer in Hobart, Tasmania.

This low voltage electric power supply station worked on the three wire system with accumulators, supplying an area of two square miles. Russell Allport soon grasped the fundamental principles of the business, and gained valuable experience.

Before returning to Tasmania, Russell Allport visited Germany, France, Italy and other places for the purpose of gaining experience in his profession, bringing back with him a knowledge that was to prove of great benefit to himself, and help in keeping Hobart at pace with the onward march of time. A few weeks after his return he entered the service of the Hobart Electric Tramway Company as assistant engineer under A. C. Parker. In 1895 he set up an establishment in Murray Street, but it was not long before he found that the premises were not nearly large enough for the rapid growth of his business. His first order of any note was to instill the electric light on the S.S. Silver Crown, belonging to Messrs. O'May Bros.S.S. Silver Crown. Extensive Alterations. The Mercury, 3 July 1896, page 2 He purchased subsequently land in Melville Street, on which he erected a brick factory on the most modern lines. Within four years he employed 15 persons. He expanded his premises further comprising front offices and stores, a commodious machinery workshop and engine room, a carpenter's shop, brass and iron foundry, and smithy. The implements used were four lathes, planing, drilling, shaping, and screwing machines. Russell Allport added also the necessary appliances for taking R√∂ntgen X ray photographs, so that a most useful institution, even in this particular alone, has been founded. He has built at this establishment a steam engine of 30 horse power to order. He has been credited for having built the finest manufacturing plant in the southern part of Tasmania. Several steamers have been installed with the electric light machinery and fittings, including the Banks Peninsula, Grafton and Australia. Russell Allport was agent for the Brush Electrical Engineering Co., a company having a world-wide reputation, and he has introduced much of their machinery into Tasmania. His cycle repairing could not be beaten in the colony, the very latest appliances being kept to carry this work out in its entirety. Russell Allport has been engaged in executing intricate machinery for one of the largest companies in the colony, and it is extremely satisfactory to note that experts give it as their opinion that it is equal to imported. All the casting and planing was done on the premises under Russell Allport's personal supervision. Many of the leading Hobart establishments have had their electric light fittings carried out by him. The brackets that hold the arc and incandescent lamps in position over footpaths were wrought at Russell Allport's establishment. They were exceptionally neat and of tasty design, combining that necessary adjunct, strength. The foundry is most complete, while the carpenter's shop contained every requisite for that portion of the business. His premises were lit throughout with the electric light. The workmen employed were well up in their particular line, and with Allport's supervision nothing but the best work was turned out. The trade has extended in many directions, and was not likely to decline in the hands of such a capable manager. He invested wisely, and was subsequently reaping the benefit. Allport's connection with Hobart, brief though it has been so far, has been of immense advantage to the development of the city, as well as to himself. Russell Allort died in the Colonial Hospital, Suva, Fiji, on 7 January 1914 after making the trip to the Fiji's islands in the steamer Tofua, during which he became so ill that he had to be sent to the hospital on the steamer's arrival in Suva.Eastern Australasia.

It was published by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and Prime Minister Theresa May. The plan marked the official abandonment of the policy of competition in the English NHS, which was established by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Integrated care systems are to be created across England by 2021, Clinical Commissioning Groups are to be merged and NHS England with NHS Improvement appear to be merging, unofficially, though this is all to happen without actually repealing the legislation. The plan The plan proposes to shift resources out of hospitals into community services and primary care and in particular to improve mental health support in schools and 24-hour access to mental health crisis teams. The NHS budget is to increase by ¬£20 billion a year by 2023. This is the equivalent of annual rises of just under 3.5%, but this has been widely criticized as below the historic trend of health funding, which in most developed countries has been rising at about 4% a year. The plan is also criticised for its failure to address very significant shortages of clinicians. The main disease priorities are cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, respiratory disease and mental health and some quite detailed targets. There is a specific emphasis on digital access which will be used to redesign services to avoid up to a third of hospital outpatient visits. The particular focus on children's health includes halving the number of stillbirths, maternal mortality and neonatal deaths and serious brain injuries at birth by 2025. There is a considerable stress on preventative work, with claims that this could save up to 500,000 lives a year. Hospitals will run the Diabetes Prevention Programme, smoking cessation programmes and Alcohol Care Teams in the hospitals with the highest rate of alcohol dependence-related admissions. More patients with severe mental health problems will receive physical health checks each year. This has been criticised as secondary prevention, while public health and primary prevention which were transferred to local authorities by the 2012 legislation have suffered reductions in funding. The plan says \\"‚ÄúAction by the NHS is a complement to, but cannot be a substitute for, the important role for local government‚Ä¶ in recent years it has also become responsible for funding and commissioning preventive health services, including smoking cessation, drug and alcohol services, sexual health, and early years support for children such as school nursing and health visitors.\\" The plan includes the proposed repeal of the specific procurement requirements in the Health and Social Care and the NHS (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) (No.2) Regulations 2013.NHS England (2019), The NHS Long Term Plan, p. 114 This would allow NHS commissioners to decide the circumstances in which they should use procurement procedures, subject to statutory guidance and a best value test to secure the best outcomes for patients and the taxpayer.DAC Beechcroft, The NHS Long Term Plan - Procurement and Competition, published 18 January 2019 =NHS Assembly= 56 people were recruited in early 2019 to form a forum which is to advise on the implementation of the plan. The assembly is to be chaired by Dr Clare Gerada and Professor Sir Chris Ham and will meet four times a year. It has a very varied membership including people from the voluntary sector, Rachel Power, the Chief Executive of the Patients Association, Charlotte Pickles, who previously advised Iain Duncan Smith, Polly Toynbee, and the president of the Royal College of Nursing Anne Marie Rafferty. Response The Royal College of Midwives were encouraged to see that maternity care was a key point. They welcomed promises to build on the Maternity Transformation Programme (MTP) and the key pledges around continuity of care for most women by March 2021 and halving the rates of stillbirth and neonatal and maternal deaths by 2025. However, they questioned the lack of clarity on how these changes intend to be implemented and on workforce planning. The Financial Times commented that \\"Nothing much will change until the NHS begins to fill an estimated 100,000 vacancies\\" and urged ministers to \\"take on those interest groups lobbying against the changes needed to promote healthier lifestyles.\\" History and background In the summer of 2018, the government asked the NHS to come up with a 10-year plan for how an increase in funding over the following five years should be used. This budget settlement for the NHS was announced by the Prime Minister that summer as being ¬£20.5 billion. In addition, at this time, Simon Stevens disclosed the five major priorities for the 10 year NHS plan. Following the introduction of competition into the NHS in the 1990s, a number of NHS plans, with varying goals, effects and achievements have included; *\\"The NHS Plan 2000\\", which encouraged outsourcing and public-private partnerships It promised an increase in staff, hospital beds and equipment and modernised premises. In addition, it proposed to reduce waiting lists and bring in new targets and standards. *\\"The NHS improvement plan 2004\\", which also aimed to reduce waiting times for treatment and increase patient choice. It also listed disease prevention, inequalities and chronic conditions as priorities. *\\"Our health, our care, our say 2006\\", that emphasised a move from hospital care to the community, with an accompanying shift in funding. *\\"High quality care for all 2008\\", which focused on improving quality of care and patient safety. *\\"Healthy lives, healthy people 2010\\", which projected a long-term view for public health in England, encouraging prevention measures. *\\"Equity and excellence: liberating the NHS 2010\\", which extended the role of competition.. *\\"The Health and Social Care Act 2012\\" doubled private sector outsourcing and allowed foundation trust hospitals to make up to half their income from private patients. *\\"The NHS five year forward view 2014\\", which lobbied for further disease prevention and tackling inequalities. It also established the foundations of the longterm NHS plan.

Early life Naime Sultan was born on 3 September 1876 in the Dolmabah√ße Palace, four days after her father's accession to the throne. Her father was Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and her mother was Bidar Kadƒ±n, the daughter of Prince Ibrahim Talustan and Princess ≈ûahika ƒ∞ffet Lortkipanidze. She was the fourth child, and third daughter of her father and the eldest child of her mother. She had one brother, ≈ûehzade Mehmed Abd√ºlkadir, two years younger than her. The room where Naime she was born is located on the corridor following the second largest hall (Pink Hall) of the Harm of Dolmabah√ße Palace. She was the granddaughter of Abdulmejid I and Tirim√ºjgan Kadƒ±n. Naime was called \\"My accession daughter\\", by her father because she was born four days after his accession to the throne. She was named after her late aunt, the first and only daughter of Tirim√ºjgan Kadƒ±n, the elder sister of her father Abdul Hamid. =Abdul Hamid's reign= After Abdul Hamid's accession to the throne, the imperial family remained in the Dolmabah√ße Palace. In 1878, Naime along with other members of her family settled in the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. Abbas Hilmi Pasha, the khedive of Egypt asked Naime Sultan's hand in marriage. However, Abdul Hamid did not approved this marriage on the basis of political reasons. =Education= Abdul Hamid enjoyed dealing with music and also wants his children to have a good musical education. She started learning piano from Fran√ßois Lombardi, along with her younger half-sister Ay≈üe Sultan. Naime played the piano at a good level. Naime Sultan learned and played piano when she was only three years old, upon the visit of Empress Augusta of German Empire, Naime played German music on her piano. First marriage =Wedding= In 1898, Abdul Hamid arranged Naime's marriage to Mehmed Kemaleddin Bey, younger son of Gazi Osman Pasha, whose eldest son Nureddin Pasha was husband of her elder sister, Princess Zekiye Sultan. A mansion was built for her in Ortak√∂y next to the household of princess Zekiye, so that the two buildings used to be called \\"The Twin Mansions.\\" The marriage took place on 17 March 1898 in the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. Gazi Osman Pasha sent Princess Naime a tiara, while Abdul Hamid presented her new mother-in-law with the Order of Abdulmejid. No minister's wife had ever received this order. Later on Kemaleddin Bey was made a pasha. The dowry of Naime Sultan was exhibited in the small temple room at Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, and the exhibition was watched by all family members. Dowry gathered a week before the wedding and was taken to the sultan's palace and completed the preparations with the treasury of the treasury. Probably this dowry was transferred to the sultan's palace with a magnificent dowry regiment. Because no dowry regiment is rich enough to be compared to that of the reign. Naime Sultan's dress was white as she wanted to give a European wedding reflect. Quite a few old- fashioned persons criticized the fact that her dress was white, because until that time all princesses had worn red at their weddings. But at Naime's wish and insistence, hers was white. =Issue= The couple had a son, Sultanzade Mehmed Cahid Bey, born in January 1899, Mehmed married the daughter of ≈ûehzade Mehmed Ziyaeddin Durriye Sultan on 26 March 1920, they also had a daughter, Adile Hanƒ±msultan, born on 12 November 1900. Adile married ≈ûehzade Mahmud ≈ûevket on 4 May 1922 in the √úsk√ºdar Palace who was three years her junior, the son of ≈ûehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin, who was himself the son Sultan Abdulaziz and Gevheri Kadƒ±n. =Kemaleddin Pasha and Hatice Sultan affair= Hatice Sultan, daughter of Sultan Murad V, her neighbour in the adjoining villa, had been having an affair for three months with her husband, Kemaleddin Pasha. According to Filizten Kalfa, the two decided to have Naime murdered so they could get married. Many of the sources reveal the same idea about how this love between Kemaleddin Pasha and Hatice Sultan emerged. According to this idea, this love story consists of a trap set by Hatice Sultan. Thus, she want to take revenge from Sultan Abdul Hamid, who has imprisoned her father in √áƒ±raƒüan Palace for years, left her single until the age of thirty and caused her to marry someone she never loved. The perfect way to take revenge was to ruin the marriage of Sultan favourite's daughter. However, Semih M√ºmtaz, whose father, the Governor of Bursa, was charged with guarding Kemaleddin Pasha in his internal exile, mentions nothing whatsoever about a plot to poison Naime, but rather claims that the affair between Hatice Sultan and Kemaleddin Pasha consisted of the exchange of love letters tossed over the garden wall, heated love letters on the part of the impulsive Kemaleddin Pasha. He claims that Hatice Sultan had the Pasha's letters stolen and revealed to Sultan Abdul Hamid on purpose, in revenge for the poor husband the Sultan had chosen for her. =Divorce= The resulting scandal angered Abdul Hamid. First he had Naime Sultan divorce her husband. Then he stripped Kemaleddin Pasha of all his military honors and exiled him to Bursa. Hatice's father, Murad, was a diabetic and when he heard of the affair, the shock of his distress brought on his death a short time later. Second marriage Following her divorce from Kemaleddin Pasha in 1904, Naime married ƒ∞≈ükodralƒ± Celaleddin Pasha on 11 July 1907. Naime Sultan Palace stills exists today but a fire on 13 July 2002 destroyed the half of the palace.

He was also criticized for submitting verdicts in cases after retirement. Career Manik started his legal career in 1978 as a lawyer in the Bangladesh High Court. He was appointed the deputy attorney general of Bangladesh in 1996. On 3 July 2001, he was appointed by the Bangladesh Awami League government to the Bangladesh High Court as an additional judge. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which came to power in 2001, did not confirm his appointment. In 2003, he accused traffic police officers of contempt of court for not saluting his car. The Inspector General of Police of Bangladesh Police, Shahudul Haque, issued a rejoinder that said traffic police are under no obligations to salute anyone and they could do so if it was safe. Bangladesh High Court bench of Justice M A Matin and Justice Syed Refat Ahmed issued a contempt of court charge against Haque which automatically removed him from the post of Inspector General according to the law. The government of Bangladesh secured a presidential pardon that protected Haque's job. On 2 March 2009, Manik was reinstated to the court, along with 11 other additional judges, following a High Court verdict in their favor. On 25 March 2009, he was appointed as a full judge to the Bangladesh High Court by the Bangladesh Awami League government, which came to power in 2009. In 2012, Bangladesh Parliament passed a unanimous resolution condemning Manik and accusing him of violating the constitution. Bangladesh Awami League leader, Tofail Ahmed, called him a sadist. He accused forcing traffic Sergents to do sit up while holding their ears in court for not saluting the car of a high court judge. He also accused Manik of forcefully sitting in business class seats when he bought economy class tickets through the misuse of his position. On 31 March 2013, he was promoted to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. He superseded 21 judges who were his senior. The Mahmudur Rahman. editor of the Amar Desh called for his removal. Manik retired on 1 October 2015. He was removed from the bench on orders from Surendra Kumar Sinha, Chief Justice of Bangladesh. He had secretly recorded a conversation between him and Sinha, and published the conversation in The Daily Janakantha. Supreme Court Bar Association in a vote decided against hosting a farewell for Manik, and the Attorney General Office also decided against a farewell ceremony. It was a departure from the tradition of holding farewell ceremony for retiring senior judges. The Bar accused Manik of not signing judgements or writing them, and sending 14 lawyers to jail. He sought the impeachment of Chief Justice Sinha from President Abdul Hamid after the Chief Justice removed him from the bench. Manik submitted 65 orders and judgements after his retirement on 10 February 2016. According to him, he still had 20 judgements and orders pending. Justice Imman Ali was ordered to examine the judgements and Justice Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah was ordered to scrutinize them. Manik also faced criticism for holding a press conference on the Bangladesh Supreme Court premises on 1 October 2015, against rules of the court, where he asked the Chief Justice to accept pending judgements from him after retirement. The chief justice asked him to send all the judgements and documents to the Supreme Court's registrar general's office and not hold press conferences. On 22 February 2016, SM Zulfiqur Ali, lawyer of the Supreme Court, filled a petition with Bangladesh High Court seeking a media gag order on statements by Manik. He accused Maink of undermining the judiciary of Bangladesh. The petition was rejected by the Bangladesh High Court. =Post retirement= On 28 April 2016, the Bangladesh Supreme Court decided to rehear 161 cases in which judgements were provided by Manik after his retirement. This was done following a judgement by Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, that declared verdicts given after retirement were unconstitutional. He bitterly criticsed Sinha after a dispute developed between the Government of Bangladesh and Sinha. The Sumpreme Court ultimately decided to rehear only few of the 161 cases as necessary. Manik was physically assaulted on Bethnal Green, London, United Kingdom in October 2015. According to his daughter, Nadia Choudhury, the attackers were members of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. On 16 March 2017, a defamation case was filed against him following his criticism of Justice Sinha in the media.

The devotion is primarily a sung reflection and meditation on the Passion of Christ and the sorrows of His Blessed Mother. History Alexandre de Rhodes, a Jesuit missionary to Vietnam, attached to the inculturation of the Catholic faith, developed the Lenten meditations, as he recounts in his Histoire du Royaume du Tonkin., pp. 203-204. His purpose was to \\"enable the Christians to participate in the liturgy of the Holy Week, in particular the Tenebrae, and to obviate their ignorance of Latin\\"., \\"Adaptations of Christian liturgy\\", n. 5. The office was inspired from the classical Vietnamese theater (cheo, tuong). It integrates the Vietnamese poetic form and lament style known as song th·∫•t l·ª•c b√°t (Èõô‰∏ÉÂÖ≠ÂÖ´, literally \\"double seven, six eight\\") with an old Christian tradition of popular lament on the sorrows of Christ, which developed alongside the Via Crucis. The discovery of the original manuscripts of Jesuit missionary Giralamo Maiorica using the Nom script, revealed a continuous conservation of the original text, which was quoted verbatim by an 1865 set of the Passion meditations, still in use up to this day., p.39. Structure The office is written in Vietnamese language and composed of a meditation on the mysteries of the Passion in fifteen ngam (meditations). The meditations are cantillated, according to the rules of ƒê·ªçc kinh, from the foot of the sanctuary by one, three, or up to fifteen cantors. The cantor bows his head at the name of Jesus or Mary and kneels at his death. A drum and gong serve as a rhythmical base, while the faithful stand in prayer. A crucifix is placed atop a platform outside the sanctuary and adorned with a fifteen-branch candelabrum, which is systematically gestured at after every meditation, to turn one candle off, as is done in the office of Tenebrae. After every meditation, the faithful answer by saying one Our Father, seven Hail Marys, and one Glory Be. Popularity The Lenten meditation is celebrated in many parts of Vietnam, and around the world in overseas Vietnamese communities, on every Friday of Lent and each evening of the Holy Week.

In 1979, he was convicted of drug-related charges in the U.S. Back in Mexico in 1985, Garza Rend√≥n joined the Federal Judicial Police; released in 1989, he joined the Gulf Cartel. His roles in the cartel were managing drug shipments from the U.S. to Mexico and serving as bodyguard to former kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n. In 1999, Garza Rend√≥n and his associates threatened two U.S. agents at gunpoint in Matamoros after the agents traveled there with an informant to gather intelligence on the cartel's operations. Although the agents and informant returned to the U.S. unharmed, the incident triggered a manhunt for him and other cartel leaders. Garza Rend√≥n surrendered to U.S. authorities in Texas in 2001, and was convicted of drug trafficking. In the U.S., he became an informant about the cartel's operations. Released and deported to Mexico in 2009, Garza Rend√≥n was re-arrested and imprisoned for additional charges. Early life and career Garza Rend√≥n, also known as \\"La Brocha\\" (\\"The Brush\\"), was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on 7 December 1952. He dropped out of school after sixth grade. In 1979, Garza Rend√≥n was convicted of drug-related charges in the United States. He eventually returned to Mexico, and joined the now-defunct Federal Judicial Police (PJF) agency in 1985. For his first assignment as an agent he was transferred to the state of Sonora, where he worked under former agent Rodolfo Larrazolo Rubio, the brother of former PJF commander Jos√© Luis Larrazolo Rubio. The brothers reportedly collaborated with organized-crime members while they worked for the PJF, and authorities suspect that Garza Rend√≥n gained their support. In the PJF, he was known as a firearms enthusiast. Authorities suspected that Garza Rend√≥n began collaborating with the Gulf Cartel during the late 1980s. In 1989, Garza Rend√≥n returned to Tamaulipas and was released from the PJF; at that time, former Gulf Cartel kingpin Juan Garc√≠a √Åbrego was heading the syndicate. When Garc√≠a √Åbrego was arrested in 1996, the cartel experienced internal strife as several of its factions (and leaders) vied for control. Control of the Gulf Cartel eventually consolidated under Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n in 1998, and Garza Rend√≥n became one of his bodyguards. Garza Rend√≥n also worked closely with Gulf Cartel enforcer Gilberto Garc√≠a Mena (\\"El June\\"), providing support to C√°rdenas. According to his Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) profile, he weighed and had black hair and brown eyes. Garza Rend√≥n's height was unknown, and he had no known identifying scars or marks. He was described as Hispanic, with medium complexion, and \\"armed and dangerous\\". = Manhunt and charges = On 9 November 1999, Garza Rend√≥n and several of his associates (including C√°rdenas) threatened two U.S. agents at gunpoint in Matamoros. The agents traveled there with an informant to gather intelligence on the operations of the Gulf Cartel, and were intercepted by the cartel. Although C√°rdenas threatened to kill the U.S. agents and the informant during the standoff, after a heated discussion they were allowed to return to the U.S. unharmed. The incident led to increased law-enforcement efforts against the Gulf Cartel leadership. Garza Rend√≥n's wife, Ludivina Benavides Fuentes, told investigators that he had not lived in Matamoros since 1999, but eyewitnesses reported that he frequented nightclubs there. Police reported that he did not have family members in Matamoros, and suspected that some of his relatives may have lived in McAllen, Texas. In the U.S., the District Court for the Southern District of Texas (S.D. Tex.) in Brownsville filed a sealed indictment against Garza Rend√≥n on 14 March 2000 for marijuana trafficking and for assaulting the two agents. The drug counts stated that Garza Rend√≥n was involved in conspiracy and possession of and marijuana loads with intent to distribute. Each drug count carried a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years and up to 40 if found guilty, and a US$2 million fine and four years of supervised release. For the assault charges, Garza Rend√≥n faced up to 10 years in prison, up to US$250,000 in fines, and 3 years of supervised release for each count. On 14 December 2000, the U.S. State Department announced a US$2 million bounty for Garza Rend√≥n, C√°rdenas, and Ad√°n Medrano Rodr√≠guez (\\"El Licenciado\\"), and unsealed the March indictment. In Mexico, authorities issued an arrest warrant for Garza Rend√≥n on 13 May 2000 for drug- trafficking, money-laundering, organized-crime involvement and illegal possession of military-exclusive weapons charges. With these charges, the Mexican government was increasing its efforts to crack down on the Gulf Cartel. Other cartel leaders were arrested during the early 2000s, sending Garza Rend√≥n into hiding. A blow was dealt to the cartel on 30 May 2000, when Garc√≠a Garc√≠a disappeared and was later confirmed dead. Garc√≠a Mena was arrested on 10 April 2001. Fearing capture, Garza Rend√≥n changed his name to Jos√© Garza Rodr√≠guez. Between 2 and 6 June 2001, the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO ‚Äì a former branch of the PGR, the Attorney General's Office) cracked down on the cartel in Ciudad Miguel Alem√°n, Ciudad Mier, Camargo, and Reynosa. It was supported by the PJF and the Mexican Army. The UEDO had intelligence confirming the whereabouts of Garza Rend√≥n, Medrano, and C√°rdenas. However, Garza Rend√≥n and his associates escaped capture when security forces experienced delays in gaining approval for search warrants and finalizing details of the raids. The raids were headed by PGR chief Jos√© Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, and the PGR said that security forces were closing in on cartel leaders and the arrest of C√°rdenas and his associates was imminent. Surrender On 5 June 2001, Garza Rend√≥n surrendered to U.S. federal agents at the Pharr‚ÄìReynosa International Bridge. U.S. officials said that they were surprised to learn that Garza Rend√≥n had decided to surrender. They speculated that he feared for his life because he was under pressure from members of the cartel, who wanted him dead for mishandling the drug business while he was addicted to cocaine. Garza Rend√≥n was also being closely tracked by the Mexican government. According to Mexican authorities, he reached out to the U.S. government and asked to become part of the United States Federal Witness Protection Program in exchange for his surrender. An FBI spokesperson based in McAllen said that Garza Rend√≥n telephoned U.S. authorities from Mexico and told them he was going to surrender the following day. Several U.S. agencies coordinated to avoid any issues springing from his arrest, which was made in coordination with the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Customs and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Garza Rend√≥n was held without bail, and was transferred to a prison in Cameron County, Texas. During a S.D. Tex. hearing on 14 June 2001, Garza Rend√≥n pled not guilty to the drug- trafficking and assault charges and said that he had no connection to C√°rdenas or other members of the cartel. He said that he had a legitimate job in Mexico, and was not involved in drug trafficking. Garza Rend√≥n's court- appointed attorney said that he could not afford a private lawyer, which indicated that he was not the cartel leader alleged by the plaintiff. His attorney noted that he turned himself in, saying that if he was involved with the cartel he would not have done that. The prosecutor limited their comments to the indictment charging Garza Rend√≥n with drug trafficking and assault. The defense was asked to provide evidence for their client, and Garza Rend√≥n was held without bail for the remainder of the hearings. During the hearings, U.S. authorities learned they had misidentified him when he was first charged; he was identified as Juan Manuel Garza Rend√≥n in 2000, and his first name was later corrected. Judge John William Black confirmed that a new hearing would be held in the same court on 2 August. If convicted of the two drug charges, Garza Rend√≥n faced up to 40 years in prison and a US$2 million fine. He faced up to 10 years in prison and a US$250,000 fine for each of the two assault charges.  Imprisonment and deportation  On 6 December 2001, Garza Rend√≥n was convicted by S.D. Tex judge Hilda G. Tagle for conspiracy to import of marijuana to the U.S. from Mexico with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to nine years (108 months) in prison. His other pending marijuana count and two assault charges were dropped on a government motion. His fines were waived, and authorities conducted an evaluation to determine if he needed drug treatment while serving his sentence. Garza Rend√≥n was also prohibited from lawfully re-entering the U.S. upon his release. He served his sentence at the Reeves County Detention Complex in Pecos, Texas. According to court records, Garza Rend√≥n struck a deal with U.S. authorities and pled guilty to the drug- trafficking charges. The drug charge stemmed from the failed delivery of nearly a ton of marijuana in Houston, Texas, which Garza Rend√≥n helped to coordinate. It was not officially known if Garza Rend√≥n collaborated with prosecutors by testifying against other cartel members or by giving them inside information about the syndicate, but one unnamed U.S. federal agent said that the information he provided was \\"substantial\\" for their investigations of the cartel. His boss, C√°rdenas, was extradited to the U.S. in 2007 and faced trial on multiple charges in Houston; it is unknown if Garza Rend√≥n gave investigators useful information about him. After serving most of his sentence, he was released from prison on 7 April 2009; it was unknown at the time if Garza Rend√≥n was permitted to stay in the U.S. or if the U.S. government was planning to deport him to Mexico. A former DEA agent said that he would probably have to live the rest of his life in hiding to avoid being killed by members of the cartel for informing on them. \\"Basically, he is going from a safe, secure environment to being a hunted rabbit,\\" the investigator said. A former U.S. official said that Garza Rend√≥n also faced danger in a Mexican prison. Organized-crime groups in Mexico have killed informants and rival gangsters while the victims were incarcerated. \\"They can reach out to him in a Mexican prison almost as easily as they can reach out to him on a Mexican street,\\" the agent said. It was confirmed later on 7 April that Garza Rend√≥n was handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a deportation hearing. He was kept at the El Paso Processing Center, an immigration detention facility in El Paso, Texas, managed by ICE. On 10 April 2009, Garza Rend√≥n was brought to the Stanton Street Bridge in El Paso and deported to Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico. In Ciudad Ju√°rez, Federal Police and PGR officials arrested him for his Mexican charges. In a press release, the PGR said that it would continue to cooperate with international law-enforcement agencies to bring Mexican nationals like Garza Rend√≥n to justice. His charges dated to 2000, and included organized-crime involvement, attempted homicide, drug trafficking, and possession of military-grade firearms. Although Garza Rend√≥n said nothing to U.S. officials during his deportation, he was dismayed to see Mexican officials waiting to arrest him; it was unclear if he thought he would be free in Mexico after his deportation or if he knew that Mexican authorities were waiting to re-arrest him. He was imprisoned at Reclusorio Norte, a Mexico City penitentiary, and federal judge Olga S√°nchez Contreras began legal proceedings on 4 May 2009 for the Mexican charges.

The cast members include Bassam Kousa, Salim Sabri, Amal Arafa, Salim Kallas, Ali Kareem and a number of other Syrian actors. The series was broadcast in the Arab world.  The story  The event in the series dates back to the late Ottoman rule of Syria (late 1890s‚Äìearly 1900s). The series tells the story of a man (Nassar) whose wife died while giving birth because his mother had gone to the home of the noble family of Abu Hashem in the neighborhood to help Umm Hashem with the birth of her baby. When Abu Hashim heard about the birth of the male child, he promised God that he would go on foot to the pilgrimage when his son reaches the age of seven. The years pass and the child becomes seven years old and some of the inhabitants of the neighborhood prepare to go to the pilgrimage, including Nassar and his mother. Nassar who wants to propose to the daughter of Abu Hashim before going for Hajj, believes that her father delays the matter because he refuses Nassar. Nassar enters into a fight with the bakery workers when he intervenes to protect an orphan boy (Rida). He is put in jail for two days during which he is subjected to ill-treatment. On the 7th birthday of Hashim, his father holds a birthday party and invites the majority of the residents of the neighborhood to his home as well as the head of the police department (Yuzbashi Hilmi). When Nassar comes out of prison, he sets his sights on retaliation against the head of the police department. Nassar goes to the celebration where the chief of police is to be shot but the bullet hits Hashem in the chest. Nassar immediately escapes and meets with Sayyah, another wanted man. Sayyah and Nassar goes to the cemetery to hide and they become friends. Hashem is saved by his uncle the doctor. Pilgrims go on their long journey to Mecca as planned despite Hashem's injury. Nassar asks to meet Arafa in order to meet his mother. Karkar, an informer who works for the head of the police, hears that Arafa met Nassar while talking to his friend. Arafa is being detained and he is forced to tell the police station where Nassar is. The police go to the cemetery and heavy gunfire starts. Sayyah is killed but Arafa, who is wounded, and Nassar manage to flee. Nassar and Arafah will end up in an orchard. The events follow and Nassar is sentenced to death and Arafa to five years in prison after fabricating to Nassar a charge of trying to kill the Wali. Days after overnight in the open they come to a gentleman (Abu Jawad) who lives with his family in Douma. Because Nassar wants to meet his mother before going to Palestine. Jawad goes to Shaghour to bring Nassar's mother to Douma but Jawad is caught after suspicion. The trouble continues on Nassar and he begins to search after Jawad. Nassar kidnaps Karkar to testify about Jawad's place and confesses to him but he is killed when Karkar tries to kill the brother of Jawad. Nassar then burns the bakery to distract the police force while he enters the outpost to look for Jawad. He fails to find him and releases some prisoners instead. Nassar and Arafa return to a cave they have stayed in. Some young men join them and it turns out that they are the ones who was released. Nassar seeks help from Talib who works for Abu Hashim in a perfume shop. Talib is asked to enter the prison of the Hakam Dar with the help of the private driver to the deputy governor (Hakam Dar). Talib fails to meet Jawad in prison but receives information that he is still alive. During his departure he gets caught and flees to Nassar's cave to join his group. In the meantime, Hanna informs Nassar about the arrival of a shipment of wheat from Hama. The group then sets up an ambush for the military that will secure the arrival of the shipment. Nassar and his group take most of the wheat after a fierce battle in which Talib get killed. After that, Nassar's uncle went to visit him after he sent him the owner of the orchard (Abu Ali) where he stayed first. Nassar entrusts his uncle with the task of searching for Jawad. An order is issued by the Wali to ban the possess of wheat in houses or shops until the return of the stolen wheat by Nassar. Destitution spreads among the population Shaghour as a result. When Nassar hears that he prepares to distribute the wheat to the neighborhood inhabitants with pillows at day and night. Abu Sulhi, Nassar's uncle is caught that he is smuggling wheat after finding seeds next to his shop. He is imprisoned and severely beaten by the police. Nassar launches a raid on the police station and heavy gunfire ensues. As a result of the harsh beating, Nassar's uncle is killed in prison. Later, two senior police officers are kidnapped to get a confession about Jawad's whereabouts but it appears they do not know where he is. After the pilgrims are about to return, the Wali intends to set up a luncheon on the occasion of their return and a police officer goes to the storeroom to fetch the food but notices that there is a hidden prison inside the store. The policeman then goes to tell the barber Abu Hosni that he suspects that Jawad may be in that prison. The news reaches Nassar and begins preparing to smuggle his friend Jawad. Nassar sets off with Jawad's brothers and they disguises themselves as police. They succeed in finding Jawad and he and his two brothers go back to Douma. But Nassar gets involved in a clash with the police and the policeman who helped him is injured. Nassar is in captivity and preparations begins for his execution the next day to avoid his escape. When Nassar never returns to the cave, his friends start to worry and learn that he has become a prisoner. They gather men from various areas of the Levant to save Nassar from the gallows. Sadness reigns in Shaghour because of the fate of Nassar. However, during the start of the execution, a revolt broke out between locals and police forces in the presence of the Deputy Governor and Chief of Police. The series ends with the death of the deputy governor and police chief Hilmi and the survival of Nassar.

He was born and died in Grindelwald. He was among the first Westerners to visit the mountain ranges of New Zealand and the Himalayas.  Biography  In August 1857, Kaufmann participated in the first ascent of the M√∂nch. In July 1856, the Viennese physician Sigmund Porges had climbed the Jungfrau with the Grindelwald guide Christian Almer. The next year he came back to attempt a first ascent of the notorious Eiger. Christian Almer was Ulrich Kaufmann's brother in law, possibly explaining how Porges included the 17-year old Kaufmann as one of his guides, along with Almer and Christian Kaufmann Sr. They took off on August 13, but conditions were poor. The attempt on Eiger faltered the next day, and the party turned its attention to the neighboring M√∂nch. They had another bivouac an hour below the M√∂nchjoch (pass) and finally summited M√∂nch at 3 pm on August 15, after Kaufmann and his fellow guides had cut 300 steps in ice.F.T. Wethered (1888) The First Ascent of the Monch, The Alpine Journal, Volume 13, pp 365-66.Gotlieb Studer (1869) Ueber Eis und Schnee, Volume 1, p. 144. (in German) The next year, Porges performed the second ascent of Eiger with different guides.Daniel Anker and Rainer Rettner, Chronology of the Eiger from 1252 to 2013 In 1882, Kaufmann undertook the first attempted ascent of Aoraki / Mount Cook with William Spotswood Green (an Irish priest, marine biologist and member of the Alpine Club), and Swiss alpinist and hotelier Emil Boss. On 2 March 1882, they failed just short of the summit because of a storm. The first complete ascent of Aoraki would not take place until nearly 13 years later. In 1883, he and Emil Boss took part in the first climbing expedition in the Himalayas, led by William Woodman Graham. Among others, they claimed a near ascent of Dunagiri (reaching about 6,900 m) and an ascent of Changabang (6,864 m, 22,520 ft) in July in the Garhwal Himalaya. These claims are widely disputed and were probably based on poor maps and a misunderstanding of their location. However, their ascent to 30 feet below the east summit of Kabru south of Kangchenjunga in October of that year is now considered quite likely. Before this time, no one is known to have reached over , though it is possible that Incas reached the summit of Aconcagua (6,962 m, 22,841 ft) in Pre-Columbian times. Kaufmann, Boss and Graham therefore likely broke the world altitude record in mountaineering by 350 m or 550 m and held this record for 26 years, until the Duke of the Abruzzi's expedition to the Karakoram in 1909 reached an altitude of ca. .

An. lanceolata has branching stems, reaching around 8 cm in height. It has smooth, hairless, tapering leaves (2‚Äì3 cm long) with flat upper surfaces and acute-lanceolate tips. It grows relatively few, long bristly hairs between its leaves (axillary hairs).

It has a branched inflorescence with broadly ovate petals, 30-45 stamens per flower and angular seeds. The flowers are pink or white. Distribution This species has an extensive (but narrow) distribution along the western part of South Africa, from the border with Namibia, through the Namaqualand and western Great Karoo, down to the Worcester area in the Robertson Karoo. The subspecies nebrownii occurs in the Overberg region to the south, from Bredasdorp in the west, to Uniondale in the east. This species, of the region's Anacampseros species, tends to favour relatively less arid areas, and is often found in Fynbos or Renosterveld vegetation.

In 2011, UnitedHealth Group formed Optum by merging its existing pharmacy and care delivery services into the single Optum brand, comprising three main businesses: OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx. In 2017, Optum accounted for 44 percent of UnitedHealth Group's profits and as of 2019, Optum's revenues have surpassed $100 billion. Also in early 2019, Optum gained significant media attention regarding a trade secrets lawsuit that the company filed against former executive David William Smith, after Smith left Optum to join Haven, the joint healthcare venture of Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway. Optum's headquarters are located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. On January 15, 2019, Optum said that the revenue of the company has surpassed $100 billion for the first time, growing by 11.1% year over year to $101.3 billion. This also means that Optum will contribute more than 50% of UnitedHealth's 2020 earnings, making Optum UnitedHealth's fastest-growing unit.  Organizational structure and acquisition timeline  = Organization = Optum's three businesses, OptumRx, OptumHealth and OptumInsight focuses on five core capabilities: data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, healthcare delivery and healthcare operations.

A Payment Integrity Institution that has joined the Optum family. This Optum-UnitedHealth model of vertical integration is pointed to as having sparked a pattern of acquisition activity in the healthcare industry; most notably, mega-mergers between CVS-Aetna, Cigna-Express Scripts and Humana-Kindred. \\"Optum's been the leader in showing how a managed care organization with an ambulatory care delivery platform and a pharmacy benefit manager all in house can lower or maintain and bend cost trend and then drive better market share gains in their health insurance business. I think they have been the impetus in the large space for the Aetna- CVS deal,\\" Ana Gupte, managing director of healthcare services at Leerink, said in an interview with Healthcare Dive.  Haven lawsuit  In early 2019, UnitedHealth Group filed a lawsuit asking a U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf to stop former Optum executive, David William Smith, from working at Haven (the Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire-Hathaway joint-healthcare venture). Optum argued that Haven is in direct competition with its business and as such, Smith's employment would be in violation of a noncompete agreement that he signed while with Optum. Smith, meanwhile, asked the judge to send the parties into closed-door arbitration. Wolf rejected Optum's request and allowed Smith's, putting court proceedings on hold until the arbitration process is complete. The case garnered media attention as setting a precedent in trade secret litigation ahead of an anticipated wave of vertical integration in the healthcare industry and for uncovering previously unknown details about Haven. The case has also been referred to as having shed light on the threat that pharmacy benefit managers feel to bottom lines amid mounting bipartisan pressure to control rising healthcare costs. Testimony brought by Haven chief operating officer Jack Stoddard was unsealed after a motion brought by the parent companies of Stat News and The Wall Street Journal.(access to article is restricted) Alleged racial bias A 2019 study published in Science, alleges the \\"algorithm used to manage the healthcare of millions of Americans shows dramatic biases against black patients\\".

They, along with other members Paul Hunt and Vic Finkelstein, of the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS), initiated the ideas that led to the development of the social model of disability. History of Grove Road In September 1972, Maggie and Ken established a cooperative to buy land, commission architects and design their own housing scheme, consisting of six flats three of which are wheelchair accessible. This was to be known as the Grove Road Housing Scheme. After four years, on 13 September 1976 they moved into Grove Road, which was designed specifically to enable them to have independence. In order to find accessible fixtures and fitting for their new home, Maggie and Ken had to source a kitchen sink from Sweden, which had enough room for a wheelchair under the sink, lowered work surfaces and ceiling hoists to enable access from the bed to chair to bathroom. Through working with the architects, they were able to ensure that the building and adaptations met their needs and enabled them to no longer be reliant on non- disabled people helping them. The idea behind the housing was to enable three homes for disabled and three homes for non-disabled residents in the building, with the non-disabled residents providing support and assistance to their disabled neighbours if required. Legacy Information and research on the Grove Road Housing Scheme and Maggie and Ken Davis is now held at the Royal Institute of British Architects(RIBA) Archive, and the 'History of Place' website, a project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Of the region's other Anacampseros species, with which it co-occurs, An. albidiflora tends to favour the most arid habitats. In habitats which are more arid still, a member of a closely related genus, Avonia papyracea, becomes dominant; In slightly less arid habitats, Anacampseros arachnoides takes over.

It detailed Cooper's life with an abandoned, eyeless cat that she rescued when he was three weeks old and subsequently named Homer. Homer‚Äôs Odyssey has been published in twenty-two languages. Following the book's 2009 publication, Homer became a famous cat on the internet and as of 2019 has a social-media following of more than 900,000 people across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter combined. His 2013 death was covered by numerous publications around the world, including People and the New York Times online. Biography In the spring of 1997 in Miami, Florida, veterinarian Dr. Patricia Khuly treated an eyeless, abandoned male kitten. Khuly cared for the kitten's infected eye sockets‚Äîwhich she sewed shut to prevent any further damage‚Äîand provided him with a foster home in her office for the next few days. Khuly estimated him to be approximately three-weeks- old. Khuly subsequently introduced him to her acquaintance Gwen Cooper, a native of Miami, who worked in non-profit administration for a number of national and local organisations. Cooper adopted the kitten on the spot and named him Homer, after the blind ancient Greek poet Homer who wrote the famous epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad. Homer was the third cat to enter Cooper's household, following a tabby and a snow-white Persian mix that Cooper named Scarlett and Vashti, respectively. Over the next five years, Cooper and her three cats lived in three different homes in the greater Miami area. One night in 2000, Homer confronted an armed thief who had broken into their apartment in an attempt to rob Cooper, slashing at the intruder and chasing him out the front door. In 2001 Cooper and her cats moved to the financial district in downtown New York City, seven months before the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Several years later, they moved to Midtown Manhattan to live with Cooper's future husband Laurence Lerman, marking the sixth home Cooper and her cats had lived in over the prior eight years. Homer lived in Midtown with Cooper and Lerman for the rest of his life. Books Homer's Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned About Love and Life With a Blind Wonder Cat (2009) In August 2009, Random House published Cooper's memoir Homer‚Äôs Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned about Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Cat. The memoir has its roots in a story that Cooper published on Salon.com in October 2008. The story, entitled ‚ÄúMucho Gato,‚Äù detailed the tale of Homer taking on the foiled Miami apartment thief. The ‚ÄúMucho Gato‚Äù posting was one of the most popular posts on Salon.com's Open Salon blogging platform that month. Spanning twelve years, the memoir covers Cooper's experiences with Homer, along with Vashti and Scarlett, as she endured a see-sawing professional and personal life. Along with the robbery story, sections of the memoir include Cooper and her cats relocating around Miami and then to New York City, and Cooper's efforts to return home to her cats who were trapped alone in their apartment near the World Trade Center following the terrorist attacks of 9/11. The final third of the memoir focuses on Cooper's attempts to acclimate her cats and the man she would eventually marry to living together in their Manhattan apartment. Homer‚Äôs Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned about Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Cat debuted at the #14 spot on the New York Times Best Seller List upon publication and spent four weeks on the list. A paperback edition of the memoir was published in 2010 and also spent four weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List. Homer‚Äôs Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned about Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Cat has been published in 22 languages in some 32 countries around the world, including the Netherlands (Wonderkat), Germany (Homer und Ich), Italy (Omero Gatto Nero), France (L'odyss√©e d'Hom√®re), Russia (–û–¥–∏—Å—Å–µ—è –ì–æ–º–µ—Ä–∞), Finland (Homer-kissan uskomaton el√§m√§), Poland (Odyseja kota imieniem Homer), England, Korea, China, and Japan. Cooper has said that, ‚Äúultimately a special-needs pet is just like any other pet, and just as capable of loving you and living a wonderful life as any other animal,‚Äù and that she wrote Homer‚Äôs Odyssey in part to promote that message. Homer: The Ninth Life of a Blind Wonder Cat (2015) In 2015, nearly six years after the publication of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey, Cooper published Homer: The Ninth Life of a Blind Wonder Cat, a sequel to the original international bestseller. The Ninth Life of a Blind Wonder Cat details the continuing story of Homer and his family following the 2009 publication of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey, which saw him evolve from beloved house cat to one of the world's most recognizable felines. Cooper reveals Homer's ‚Äúinvolvement‚Äù in the wind-up to the publication of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey, including Homer's photo sessions, encounters with his publisher's team and meeting members of the press. The book also delves into Homer's later years, where he served as a big brother of sorts to a new special-needs kitten who would enter his and Gwen's lives. The Ninth Life of a Blind Wonder Cat also covers his bout with acute liver failure, which veterinarians predicted Homer would die from within a few weeks, a prognosis that proved incorrect when Homer went on to live in relative good health for more than six months. Homer's illness and seemingly miraculous extended life are the subject of Cooper's 2018 short memoir Homer and The Holiday Miracle. Homer's death on August 21, 2013, as well as the passing of Scarlett and Vashti, are also recounted. Homer and The Holiday Miracle (2018) Homer and The Holiday Miracle is a short memoir by Gwen Cooper published by BenBella Books in October 2018. Issued as a pocket-sized hardcover edition, the fifty-page memoir relates the story of how in December 2012, Homer was diagnosed by veterinarians as having acute liver failure and ‚Äúthat he wouldn‚Äôt even make it to Christmas Eve.‚Äù It was a prognosis that mirrored the one that Homer had received fifteen years earlier when doctors warned that a tiny, sightless kitten was unlikely to survive and probably would not have much of a life even if he did. However, Homer went on to live comfortably and with high energy for more than another six months. Homer left behind a rescue community of ‚ÄúHomer‚Äôs Heroes‚Äù that continues to advocate for special-needs animals in his name. My Life in a Cat House: True Tales of Love, Laughter and Living with Five Felines (2018) My Life in a Cat House: True Tales of Love, Laughter and Living with Five Felines is a memoir recounted in eight interconnected stories about Gwen Cooper's life with her well-known cat family, including Homer, Scarlett, Vashti and her two newest additions, Clayton and Fanny. It was published in hardcover by BenBella Books in October 2018. Homer is featured most prominently in two of the tales: ‚Äú‚ÄôCat Lovers Don‚Äôt Read Books‚Äô,‚Äù which takes its title from what a literary agent said to Cooper upon her pitching her idea for a Homer memoir to prospective publishers; and ‚ÄúThe Worm Has Turned,‚Äù an in-depth look at Homer's obsession with his favourite cat toy‚Äîa cloth worm topped with a small jingling bell. Special-Needs Animals Since his introduction to an international audience in 2009, Homer has become known as a symbol and ‚Äúspokes-cat‚Äù for the cause and care of special-needs animals, an area which Cooper actively participates. Homer‚Äôs Odyssey and Homer's story have been credited with contributing directly to a decrease in the number of special-needs animals euthanized in shelters and an increase in the number of adoptions of blind cats. Cooper lends Homer's image to fundraising events serving special-needs animals and donates 10% of her royalties from Homer‚Äôs Odyssey to organisations that serve abused, abandoned, and disabled animals. Notable among her many campaigns to raise awareness and funds for the animal community was a $10,000 donation she made to Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary in Raleigh, North Carolina in Homer's name.

Early life Naile Sultan was born on 9 February 1884 in the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and her mother was Dilpesend Kadƒ±n, the daughter of Maksud Giray Bey. She was the sixth child, and fourth daughter of her father and the only child of her mother. She had been taught to play piano, harm, and cello by Lombardi Bey. She was the granddaughter of Abdulmejid I and Tirim√ºjgan Kadƒ±n. In 1901, Abdul Hamid betrothed her to Cemaleddin Bey, third son of Gazi Osman Pasha, whose elder sons, Nureddin Pasha and Kemaleddin Pasha had been married to Naile's elder sisters, princessess Zekiye Sultan and Naime Sultan respectively. However, in 1904, following Kemaleddin Pasha's affair with her cousin Princess Hatice Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Murad V, the engagement was broken off. Marriage In 1905, Abdul Hamid arranged Naile's marriage to Arif Hikmet Pasha, the son of grand vizier Abdurrahman Nurettin Pasha. The marriage took place on 27 February 1905 in the Kuru√ße≈üme Palace. No children came of this marriage. Her husband was also a very kind and noble person. They never worked with a sense of greed and interest, they lived a very happy life. =Exile= At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, the couple settled in Beirut, Lebanon. Here, Naile Sultan lived in a truly oriental manner. Both she and her husband were wealthy, and had managed to lead the same kind of life they had in Istanbul. They lived a very comfortable life in their home, which was divided into a harem and a selamlik. The pasha would use his office as a selamlik, where he would welcomed his guests. On the other hand, Naile Sultan would not leave the harem, and would not receive any male visitors. The only man that ever entered the harem was the husband of her sister princess Refia Sultan. Later years and death Arif Hikmet Pasha died in 1944, and in 1952, Naile Sultan returned to Istanbul after the revocation of the law of exile for princesses. Here she settled in Erenk√∂y, and died on 25 October 1957 at the age of seventy-three. She was buried in Yahya Efendi Cemetery, Istanbul.

An. retusa has a short, thick caudex. Branching stems are about 4 cm long. They are low or level with the ground. The leaves of this species are not hairy or felted, though they can sometimes have an indistinct tomentum over them. The leaves are dark green, densely-packed, obovate, compact (\\"retuse\\") - over one and a half times wider than they are thick, and up to 17 mm long. Its flowers have pink, thinly-ovate petals and 20-25 stamens, and are born on a short inflorescence. In contrast, similar smooth-leaved species, such as Anacampseros lanceolata or Anacampseros telephiastrum, have leaves over 18 mm long. Their flowers have broadly-ovate petals and 30-45 stamens. Distribution An. retusa has a long, but narrow, distribution range. It occurs in southern Namibia and the western Namaqualand region of South Africa, as far south as the Ceres Karoo, and Worcester in the Robertson Karoo. It also extends slightly into the northern Overberg region. It co-occurs with several related species of Anacampseros, but favours specific conditions. It inhabits spots that are slightly more arid than those in which Anacampseros lanceolata grows. However, in spots that are more arid still, it tends to be replaced by the related Anacampseros telephiastrum.

It has been performed a dozen times at various locations. Description In a typical event score for Make a Salad, Knowles prepares a salad for a large number of people by chopping the vegetables to the beat of live music, mixing the ingredients by tossing it in the air, then serving the salad to the audience. In 2012 Knowles said of her original staging that she was interested in \\"everyone, eating, not only together but...the same thing. And they usually eat the same quantity, the same portions\\" and that \\"The idea of having such a quantity of food served to everyone was...kind of astonishing\\". History The piece was originally performed in 1962 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. The inspiration for the piece came to Knowles during lunch in 1962 when she was asked what she would be presenting at the ICA and she responded \\"Well, maybe I'll make a salad\\". Make a Salad has been performed at numerous venues around the world, including the Tate Modern, the High Line, the Walker Art Center, and most recently at Art Basel 2016. =1962: ICA= For the first performance of Make a Salad, Knowles and her husband Dick Higgins utilised a pickle barrel to mix the ingredients as they lacked a big enough container. Knowles recalled the first Make a Salad as \\"really fine\\". =2008: Tate Modern= A salad was made for 3,000 people at the Tate Modern in London in 2008. =2012: High Line= Make a Salad was performed on Earth Day in April 2012 on the High Line in Manhattan as the first piece in the High Line Art Performances series. A salad was prepared in 90 minutes for up to 1,000 people by Knowles, her daughter Jessica Higgins, and volunteers on the upper level of the Chelsea Market Passage. Special \\"chopping music\\" was played while the salad was prepared. The High Line salad was created from ingredients sourced from farms within a 60 mile radius of New York City. The ingredients included \\"36 heads of escarole, 72 heads of romaine, 36 bunches of carrots, 15 pounds of cucumbers, 25 pounds of onions, 12 heads of celery, 15 pounds of mushrooms, and 72 bunches of radish\\". The chopped ingredients were mixed with a rake by Knowles. In an article about the High Line performance for Politico, journalist Miranda Popkey described that \\"Around noon, High Line staffers began opening a huge green tarp on the lower level of the Passage, and a palpable thrill went through crowd, which had swelled to more than a hundred. Suddenly there was a sense of urgency: cameras shot up in the air; there was a scramble to find standing room on a picnic bench in order to get a better vantage. Knowles and her assistants dumped the produce, then the dressing (a simple vinaigrette of olive oil, vinegar, and tarragon) over the railing, and the volunteers below shook the tarp to mix the salad, to cheers from the audience\\".

Each span is and includes six full panels and two end panels, supported by concrete piers at each end and midway in the river. Laced channel sections with cover plates form the upper chords, with eyebars on the lower chords. Eyebars with turnbuckles form the diagonals. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. With History In 1864 the Board of Commissioners of Boise County, Idaho Territory, granted John McLellan and William Thompson a license to operate a ferry across the Boise River at a point on the Oregon Trail near the current location of the Ninth Street Bridge. The McLellan Ferry operated until 1868, when McLellan and Thompson hired flour mill owner H.P. Isaacs to build the Boise City Bridge. In 1911 the old Ninth Street Bridge was moved approximately 12 miles to span the Boise River along the Boise and Interurban Railway line at what is now Linder Road in Meridian, and the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co. built the new Ninth Street Bridge. The Boise Railroad Company secured rights to operate a streetcar across the Ninth Street Bridge in November, 1911, and the bridge became part of the South Boise Loop. In 1912 a 10-pound box of dynamite was left on a pier under the bridge, but police uncovered no plan for demolition. The middle pier under the bridge was fortified in 1926 with 600 tons of rock to repair damage caused by the Boise River. In 1928 engineers repaired the center pier again after discovering what the Idaho Statesman termed \\"vast caverns and yawning spaces\\" in the center support, when the block of concrete was found to be \\"hanging from the steel work just like a ring from a Spanish dancer's ear lobe.\\" By the 1960s, engineers had concluded that the truss bridge should be replaced. In 1987 a new Ninth Street Bridge was constructed directly west of the truss bridge, and the old bridge became a route for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

Built in 1939, during the early years of Italian rule, Albania's National Theatre worked as a cinema until the end of the Second World War, when a stage replaced the former screen. It is considered by many a historic building. In 2018, due to the lack of maintenance and investments over the years, the government announced a plan to demolish the National Theatre's building and send the artists into an alternative stage until the new theatre would be built in the same territory. In March 2018, Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed Bjarke Ingels's design for the new National Theater, the construction of which would be granted through a special law to a private company. This law was later criticized by the European Union as a violation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement. The government, in return, claimed it had no money for the project.https://exit.al/en/2019/01/17/bjarke-ingels-drops-national- theater-project/ The artists started a petition, firstly signed by more than 90 artists and started to gather daily at the public square in front of the Theatre to protest the demolition. After many citizens joined the protest, it was discovered that the public property where the Theatre stands today, would be sold to a private investor, who planned at that time to build high-rise buildings together with a new theatre. The new theater would cover a much smaller part of the now public property. The then Minister of Culture, Mirela Kumbaro, was accused of trying to destroy heritage and demolish the theatre for private interests of investors with close ties with government officials. The Association of Albanian Architects also made a declaration opposing the demolition of the theatre, stressing the historical and aesthetic value of its Rationalist architecture.https://exit.al/en/2018/09/30/the-alliance-for-the- protection-of-theatre-fights-to-preserve-albanias-cultural-heritage/ Following student protests, PM Edi Rama decided to reshuffle his cabinet and replaced 8 ministers, including the Minister of Culture Mirela Kumbaro, a decision applauded by the artist's community. As of January 2019, Architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, has dropped the construction project of the National Theater. The municipality opened a new tender call, but since then it hasn't made any announcement on how the procedure is going or who is applying for it. https://exit.al/en/2019/01/17/bjarke-ingels-drops-national-theater-project/ Regardless of constant protest by Albanian artists together with the political opposition, the demolition of the National Theatre of Albania started approximately on 4:30 am of 17 May 2020. The area was overrun by the State Police as they forcibly evacuated every person in the area protesting and detained many artists and high members of the Albanian opposition. Soon after the demolition started, people started gathering in the main boulevard just before the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Theatre to protest its demolition. This protest led to numerous other detainments due to the prohibition of gatherings and protests as per COVID-19 restrictions by the Government.https://exit.al/en/2020/05/17/video-demolition-of-albanias- national-theater/ The Case in the Constitutional Court On 24 July 2019, after two days of activists clashing with police forces who surrounded the Theatre and tried to forcibly evict the Alliance activists from the surroundings of the Theatre, the President of Albania Ilir Meta decided to file a case in the Constitutional Court to stop the attempt for the demolition of the National Theatre building. While addressing the media, he considered the special law for the destruction of the theater as a symbol where, like never before, a national cultural constitutional crime is performed in full harmony and all this only in interest what I can call, the opposite of the rule of law, in favor of the rule of oligarchs.http://www.tiranapost.al/en/president-meta-submits-requests-to- constitutional-court-to-stop-demolition-of-national-theater/ On 30 December the Constitutional Court ruled to consider President Meta's request to repeal the special law and asked several institutions involved in the case to send their arguments for drafting and adopting this special law.

It has been used for meditation and in tantric practice. Etymology and origins The pose is named for the sage Gorakhnath, founder of the nath yoga tradition, who is said to have used the pose for meditation. It is accordingly practised by his tantric devotees, the kanphata yogis. It is said to awaken kundalini and to halt the process of aging. The Sanskrit ‡§ó‡•ã‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑ (goraksh) means \\"cowherd\\" (associated with Krishna), and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® (asana) means \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". Gorakshasana is medieval in origin, described in hatha yoga texts including the 14th century Shiva Samhita 3.108-112, the 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika 1.28-29, and the 17th century Gheranda Samhita 2.24. The name Gorakshasana is given to a balancing pose in B. K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga, where the legs are folded as in Padmasana with the knees only on the ground, the hips directly above the knees, and the hands in prayer position. Iyengar describes it as \\"a difficult balancing pose and one is elated even if one can only balance for a few seconds.\\" Description GorakshƒÅsana is a seated pose with the soles of the feet pressed together and the knees on the ground, as in Baddha Konasana (in medieval times known as Bhadrasana), with the difference that the heels are under the body. The pose is sometimes described as having the toes on the ground with the heels directly above them, as in Mulabandhasana. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika directs the yogin to \\"place the ankles under the scrotum on either side of the perineal seam, with the left ankle on the left and the right ankle on the right. Take hold of the sides of the feet firmly and steadily with both hands.\\" It claims that the pose destroys all diseases.

Farmer (February 15, 1794 ‚Äì February 5, 1881)Sources indicate his date of death was either February 5 or February 6, 1881. See: and was an American pioneer preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church and a circuit rider on the Indiana frontier from 1825 to 1839 during the Second Great Awakening. He also served in the Indiana Senate from 1843 to 1845. In addition, the Kentucky native became a Bloomington, Indiana, farmer, editor of the Bloomington Religious Times (later renamed the Western Times), and businessman. Farmer served as a captain in the Kentucky militia during the War of 1812 and as a self-appointed chaplain during the American Civil War. Early life and education Eli P. Farmer, the second of Sarah (Rice) and Joel Farmer's six children, was born on February 15, 1794, at Dr. Emiss Station in Franklin County, Kentucky, about northwest of Frankfort, Kentucky. His father was of Dutch and Welsh ancestry; his mother had Irish and English ancestors. During Farmer's youth his family frequently moved in search of better economic opportunities. He left home in 1811 at the age of seventeen but occasionally returned to live with his family in Kentucky and Virginia.Case, Faith and Fury, p. 11.Shepherd, p. 123. Farmer attended his first school at the age of eighteen. Although he learned to read and write, Farmer had no formal religious training. He became a converted Christian in 1812 at a revival-style camp meeting called Gillbad in present-day West Virginia. The event was a turning point in Farmer's life, but he had trouble maintaining a religious life away from the camp meetings and the encouragement of other Christians. His parents did not allow him to offer prayers in their home.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 70. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 13 and 23. In 1814, during the War of 1812, Farmer served as a captain in the Kentucky militia, but his service ended before his regiment was deployed to defend Washington, D.C.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 71. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 17, 19. Although his formal education was limited, Farmer ran a school for a short time in Morgantown, West Virginia, after completion of his military service. He closed the school around 1816 or 1817 and returned to Kentucky to pursue other vocations such as farming, carpentry, and hauling millstones down the Ohio River while he continued to attend religious services and camp meetings, and preach on occasion.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 27 and 31. See also: Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 72‚Äì73. Farmer crossed the Ohio River into Indiana around 1820 and settled in Monroe County, Indiana, in 1822. Although he initially intended to preach to Native Americans in Indiana, Farmer changed his plans after deciding to marry. He felt that it was necessary to establish a business to support a wife and future family before entering a full-time Christian ministry.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 74. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 53 and 56. Marriage and family Farmer married Matilda H. Allison in October 1822 and settled on land that he had bought near Bloomington, Indiana. They had one child, a son named John Allison Farmer. Matilda Farmer died in 1825. The widowed Farmer married Elizabeth W. McClung in 1828. They were the parents of several children. To supplement the family income, Elizabeth Farmer spun, knitted, weaved, and made shoes.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 84. Career Although Farmer engaged in several occupations during his lifetime, he is best known for his service as a pioneer preacher and Methodist circuit rider on the Indiana frontier. In addition to farming and other business ventures, Farmer became a politician and served in the Indiana Senate in Indianapolis from 1843 to 1845. Farmer was also editor of the Bloomington Religious Times, a local newspaper in Bloomington, Indiana. During the American Civil War Farmer was an unofficial, self-appointed chaplain for the Union army and tended to the needs of the soldiers, mostly in Tennessee. =Methodist circuit rider= Farmer, a converted Christian, was determined to become a preacher in Indiana. Soon after the death of his first wife, Matilda (Allison) Farmer, in 1825, he began preaching in Greene County, Indiana, although he did not serve in an official capacity and was not affiliated with any specific denomination at the time. While working in Greene County in 1825, Farmer established the Bloomfield Circuit and became a circuit-riding preacher. Later that year the Illinois Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church officially licensed him to preach, formally making him a circuit rider for the circuit he had established.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 75 and 77. Methodist preachers on the Indiana frontier, where church buildings had not yet been constructed, were assigned to a circuit within a state or territory and met in settlers' log homes, in nearby woods, or at revival gatherings called camp meetings, which Farmer and other circuit riders helped to organize. Circuit riders such as Farmer could also form new and abandon circuits at will. Farmer officially served as a Methodist circuit rider for nine years. Between 1825 and 1839 he was assigned to Methodist circuits in Indiana that included Bloomfield (1825‚Äì26), Vermillion (1826‚Äì27), Crawfordsville (1827‚Äì28), Washington (1829‚Äì30), White Lick (1830‚Äì31), Franklin (1831‚Äì32), Greencastle (1832‚Äì33), and Brown Mission (1837‚Äì38), although Farmer did not take an assignment due to ill health during some of these years. His final assignment was at Danville (1838‚Äì39) before he returned to his farm in Bloomington, Indiana.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 66, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83‚Äì87. While traveling on the Crawfordsville Circuit in 1827‚Äì28, Farmer married Elizabeth McClung and organized the first church in Lafayette, Indiana. This congregation became the present-day Trinity United Methodist Church.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 82. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 86‚Äì87. Farmer and his wife also spent some time at their rural home near Bloomington, Indiana, due to poor health. During 1828‚Äì29 Farmer was so ill that he did not take an official preaching assignment. Family friends persuaded the Farmers to rent out the farm in Bloomington and reside at Fairplay in Greene County, Indiana. By 1829 Farmer had regained his health and resumed work as an itinerant preacher, although he remained in Bloomington for several more years in order to operate a local store that was struggling. By 1836 Farmer was preaching on a part-time basis in Brown County, Indiana, and in 1837 was formally assigned to the Methodist Church's newly-established Brown Mission in Brown County. During his year of service at Brown Mission, Farmer reported that 300 members joined its Methodist congregation. In 1838 he received his final appointment to the Danville Circuit. Farmer temporarily resided in Danville, Indiana, before permanently returning to Bloomington in 1839.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 82, 84‚Äì87. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, p. 95. During Farmer's years as a circuit rider in the 1820s and 1830s, the Methodist Church experienced significant growth, becoming the dominant religion in Indiana by the 1850s. The Second Great Awakening, which began in the early 1800s, contributed to the significant growth of the Methodist faith and other religious denominations among the early settlers on the frontier, including Presbyterian, Baptist, Christian Church, United Brethren, New Lights, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and the Evangelical Association congregations.Sweet, \\"Early Methodist Circuits in Indiana,\\" pp. 359 and 363. By 1831, the same year that Farmer reported he had received 550 members while traveling the Franklin Circuit, the Methodist Church claimed it had more than 500,000 members.Some of the membership statistics at this time may have been inflated due to lapses in membership because lapsed members who later returned to the church may have been counted more than once. See Riley Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 108‚Äì09. See also: Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 86‚Äì87. After officially serving as a Methodist preacher for nine years, Farmer separated from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1839 to pursue his idea for a Christian Union, a nonsectarian church. Farmer faced opposition from some church leaders for this decision, but found an ally in Indiana University president Andrew Wylie, who offered the use of the university's chapel on its Bloomington campus for nonsectarian revivals. Farmer's plans for a Christian Union faltered as he became more involved in business and farming ventures, as well as politics and other interests. However, around 1863, Reverend James Fowler Given and others formed a Christian Union in Columbus, Ohio.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 66, 87‚Äì89. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, p. 193. This Christian Union movement held religious beliefs similar to those espoused by Farmer. Following his return from the American Civil War, Farmer merged his group with the one in Ohio. Christian Union later became recognized as a religious denomination.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 89. =Businessman= During the 1830s, Farmer was involved in farming and several business ventures. He became an investor in a Bloomington general store in the early 1830s and ran a mill. After selling his interest in the store, Farmer acquired a salt works, but sold a portion of his investment when he returned to preaching. After his break with the Methodist Church in 1839, Farmer gave up full-time preaching and ran a couple of brick-making kilns to earn additional income to support his family.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 117‚Äì19; 131‚Äì32. =Politician= Farmer, a Whig who later became a member of the Republican Party, strongly opposed the Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836. A supporter of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he also opposed slavery and those who sympathized with the South. Although Farmer was an unsuccessful candidate for the Indiana Senate in 1836 and the Indiana House of Representatives in 1840, he won a state senate seat in 1842. Farmer served in the Indiana Senate from 1842 to 1845. Following his service in the state legislature, Farmer tried to extend his political career by running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but he was defeated in 1845 and in 1851.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 142‚Äì44. =Newspaper editor= In 1853 Farmer and two business partners established the Bloomington Religious Times, a weekly newspaper in Bloomington, Indiana. In addition to providing news of the day, it served as a platform for Farmer to describe his religious beliefs and Christian Union plan and was also the official organ of the Republican United Brethren. Its first issue was published on November 11, 1853. Farmer's \\"rambling\\" and \\"sarcastic\\" prose in his newspaper articles quickly attracted critics. In June 1854 the newspaper's name was changed to the Western Times; the enterprise disbanded the following year.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 169 and 176. Later years Early in the American Civil War Farmer helped recruit at least two companies of volunteer soldiers to serve in the Union army. Farmer also traveled south to meet Union troops and assist with the wounded, mostly in Tennessee. In addition, Farmer acted as an unofficial, self-appointed chaplain during the war. Five of his sons and two sons-in-law served in the Union army. One son was wounded in the war; another son, James, died at his post in Memphis, Tennessee, in December 1865.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 185‚Äì91 and 195. Farmer returned to Indiana after the war and established a church near his home in Bloomington. In 1874, at the age of eighty, he completed writing his autobiography.Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" pp. 66‚Äì67. See also: Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 193‚Äì94. Death and legacy Farmer died on February 5, 1881, at his home near Bloomington, Indiana, at the age of eighty-eight.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 194‚Äì95. An obituary described Farmer as \\"the Fighting Preacher\\" because of the strong personality he developed from his life on the frontier and his lack of opposition to participating in physical brawls. However, for much of his life he remained committed to spreading \\"his vision of religious purity.\\"Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 66. One religious writer credited Farmer with inspiring thousands to join the Methodist Episcopal Church before he split with them in 1839.Case, Faith and Fury, pp. 185 and 193. Farmer's lasting legacy includes his autobiography, which documents the details of the Indiana frontier in the 1830s, a time when it was undergoing significant change. He provided descriptions of his daily life as well as his religious conversion and service as an itinerant preacher for the Methodist Episcopal Church during the Second Great Awakening. As the Methodist Episcopal Church underwent dramatic growth and change, Farmer found himself at odds with its leadership, but remained steadfast in his religious beliefs and moved ahead with his plans for a Christian Union of nonsectarian churches.Farmer's unpublished manuscript is part of the Farmer Collection at the Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington. See Case, \\"An Aggressive Warfare,\\" p. 67, note 5. The present-day Christian Union denomination is conservative congregation whose beliefs are based solely on teachings of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. In addition, a Methodist congregation he organized in 1824 was the first church in Lafayette, Indiana. It continues as the present- day Trinity United Methodist Church.Case, Faith and Fury, p. 87.

The show follows Marie Kondo, a Japanese organizing consultant and creator of the KonMari method, as she visits families to help them organize and tidy their homes. Marie Iida acts as Marie Kondo's interpreter throughout the show. The show had a notable cultural impact in the US and UK, where it was reported to have increased donations to charity shops.  Synopsis of season one  The premise of \\"Tidying Up with Marie Kondo\\" is that each episode, Kondo visits a new American family household in need of organizing and de-cluttering. Each family has individual backgrounds and needs, which the show addresses with both hands-on guidance from Kondo and cutaways of Kondo giving additional KonMari explanations.  Episodes   Methodology of the show  Kondo's ideology towards de- cluttering is called the KonMari method. Her process, which she explains in the series, includes having participants go through their homes section by section‚Äî\\"1) Clothing, 2) Books, 3) Paper, 4) Komono (kitchen, bathroom, garage and miscellaneous) 5) Sentimental items. Then, when the items are gathered together, Kondo asks the participants to go through the individual items one by one and only keep what \\"sparks joy\\". While her method to cleaning is effective in organizing people's homes and environments, Kondo came to understand that her method was \\"far more psychological than it was practical.\\" This perspective is supported well by studies done on how people perform and feel in tidy versus messy environments. Research suggests that \\"clean organized environments\\" have a variety of psychologically beneficial effects‚Äîsuch as clearer thought processes, increased confidence, and abilities. Further research shows that an untidy environment can negatively impact many aspects of human health‚Äîsuch as mood and stress levels, memory capabilities, and even the ability to process other people's facial expressions. When people's personal space is \\"de-cluttered,\\" they are better able to sleep, focus, and hold feelings of satisfaction with their lives. The evidence that Kondo's show positively affects the mental health of the people featured in it isn't just seen on the show itself, but in interviews given by participants later on. One couple, seen in Episode 1, \\"Tidying with Toddlers,\\" Kevin and Rachel Friend, said after Kondo's help that, \\"Chaos for us doesn‚Äôt happen anymore. We‚Äôre able to take on things. Nothing overwhelms us anymore. Now, it's just our lifestyle.\\"  Reception  A protester at 2019 Women's March in Washington D.C. holding a sign that reads \\"This administration does not spark joy!\\", derived from Kondo's idea of only keeping things that \\"spark joy\\" Reviews of the show have been generally positive. On the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds a score of 81%, noting that Marie Kondo \\"makes for a delightful instructor\\". On Metacritic, the show has a score of 69 based on eight critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In The Atlantic, Sarah Archer says that the show is about \\"cultivating empathy for the things that surround us\\", noting that Kondo's empathy is the key to her success in helping people. In Vice, Nicole Clark writes that by showcasing the inner workings of family homes, the show has unintentionally highlighted differing gender expectations towards tidying and organizing households. Jack Seale in The Guardian is less positive, noting that the show is simply \\"a show where a woman just tells people to tidy up.\\" He adds that the before and after reveals lack excitement, revealing the same house except tidier. Others have been on the fence, like Kristin van Ogtrop from Time, who wrote about the \\"completely bananas\\" method Kondo employs, suggesting that while necessary items should still be kept around, it is still a worthwhile endeavor to mentally refocus on what brings one joy.  Effect on donations to charity shops  In the immediate wake of the show's release, some charity shops saw an increase in the number of donations received. Donations to Goodwill stores in the Washington D.C. area were up by 66% for the first week of January, an effect attributed to the show encouraging people to tidy their houses. Beacon's Closet in New York also saw similar increases in donations. In western Sydney, charity St Vincent de Paul saw a 38% rise in donations in the first three weeks since the show's premiere. Nationwide, Goodwill reported a 10%-20% increase in donations for the year, as of February 2019, at least part of which it attributed to the show.

The species is endemic to Namibia. This species was first described in 1935 by the British-born, South African zoologist John Hewitt, who gave it the name Rhoptropus bradfieldi in honour of the South African naturalist and collector R.D. Bradfield. Description Rhoptropus bradfieldi has a maximum snout-to-vent length of about , and a total length of about . The dorsal surface is greyish-brown, indistinctly barred and dappled, and the ventral surface is bluish-grey. There are eleven scansors (specialist structures for adhesion) under the middle toe. This gecko is similar in appearance to the Namib day gecko (Rhoptropus afer), but that species is slightly smaller, has bright yellow underparts and only six scansors under the middle digit. The difference in scansor number between the two species, and the much shorter setae from which the scansors are formed in R. afer, are reflected in different lifestyles; R. bradfieldi, with more-adhesive feet, is a crevice-dweller with a slow, climbing lifestyle, while R. afer is much more terrestrial, running rapidly on the ground and jumping from rock to rock. Distribution and habitat Rhoptropus bradfieldi is endemic to Namibia. Its typical habitat is rocks and boulders in arid regions of the Namib Desert. Ecology Rhoptropus bradfieldi is a diurnal lizard and is an ambush predator of small arthropods. Its body is maintained at a high but steady temperature while it is active. It has a low field metabolic rate, about 26% of that of other desert lizards, but a relatively high water intake, which it probably fulfils from the fogs that often occur near the coast.

In July 1932 he was elected a member of the national parliament (Reichststag). By the time democracy was suspended, in March 1933, he had already been arrested and detained by government authorities. He was released at the end of 1933 and spent much of 1934 and early 1935 living \\"underground\\" (unregistered with any city hall) engaged in political resistance. Most of the twelve Nazi years he spent in a succession of jails and concentration camps where opportunities for resistance were more limited. He died at Buchenwald in October 1944, probably from a form of Typhus (\\"Flecktyphus\\"). An illegal funeral service was held for him in the camp on 22 October 1944.  Political biography  Albert Kayser was born in Stettin (as Szczecin was known at that time), a major sea port close to the Baltic coast (\\"Ostsee\\" in German language sources) and, before 1945, part of Germany. Slightly unusually, the family into which he was born was registered as \\"religionslos\\" - neither Protestant, Catholic nor Jewish. He grew up in Berlin. Little is known of his childhood, but by 1919 he was working for Siemens at the city gas works in Berlin. That year he became a work-place trades union representative. He was involved with the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD), and in 1921, as the USPD broke up, he was one of many former members who joined the recently launched Communist Party of Germany. However, he lost his job with Siemens in 1923 because of his involvement in that year's \\"August strike\\". He then took a job with the BVG (Berlin bus and tram operator). Here, towards the end of the 1920s, he was elected to a senior role on the works council. In November 1932, as a member of the strike leadership, he was one of those in large part responsible for organising nationwide support for Berlin's 28,000 striking transport workers. At a time of growing political polarisation the strike powerfully demonstrated the power of organised labour, and it raised Kayser's own public profile. Albert Kayser was elected a member of the national parliament (Reichststag) in July 1932. He represented a Berlin electoral district (Wahlkreis), sitting as one of 89 Communist Party members in a 608 seat parliament. The strong electoral performance of the mutually antagonistic National Socialist and Communist parties, refusing to work either with each other or with the more moderate political parties, meant that the Reichstag was deadlocked. A second 1932 general election, held in November, resulted in the Communists winning a further 11 seats: Albert Kayser was among those re-elected. The National Socialists actually lost 34 seats between July and November 1932, but they remained by far the largest single party in the Reichstag. Kayser was re-elected again early in March 1933, but by this time the constitution had been suspended, and a couple of weeks later the Enabling Act of 23 March 1933 completed the creation of a \\"legally\\" mandated post- democratic German dictatorship. The trigger, ostensibly, had been the Reichstag fire on the night of 27/28 February, which was instantly blamed by the recently formed Hitler government on \\"communists\\". Albert Kayser was one of several thousand Communist Party members - among them all the Communist Reichstag members and trades union leaders the authorities were able to locate - to be arrested on 28 February 1933. He was taken to the Sonnenburg concentration camp, in the marshy countryside between Berlin and Posen, where he was held in \\"protective custody\\" till 23 December 1933. After his release he undertook illegal party work, also appearing as a party instructor in the Erfurt, Hanover and Magdeburg regions, filling a void created by the arrest on 20 January 1934 of Martin Schwantes. Then underground party leadership in Berlin nominated him as chief party instructor for Central Germany (Mitteldeutschland) which gave him direct responsibility for training guidance in the party's Thuringia, Halle-Merseburg and Magdeburg-Anhalt regions. As one of nine senior party officers in the country Kayser lived illegally at W√∂rmlitzerstra√üe 3 in Halle, using the cover name \\"Robert Erdmann\\". Elsewhere it is stated that he was living with his wife and daughter at Groningerstra√üe 22 in Berlin-Wedding. Either way, as one of the most important Communist leaders at large in central Germany, he was almost certainly constantly on the move. On 26 January 1935 Albert Kayser took part in an illegal meeting at a \\"safe house\\" along Th√ºringerstra√üe 26 in Halle. Thanks to a denunciation, the authorities became aware of the meeting and the participants were surprised by the arrival of Gestapo officials. Kayser was arrested along with the others present: Wilhelm K√ºnzler, Helene Glatzer and the owner of the apartment, Hans Lehnert. Grounds for the arrests were \\"treasonable communication\\" (\\"hochverr√§terische Beratung\\"). They were initially taken to the police station in the Merseburgerstra√üe where their personal details were logged. They were then taken to the police facility at the Hallmarkt for investigatory detention, which involved several days of questioning and torture. Helene Glatzer succumbed to the mistreatment and died - effectively murdered - on 31 January 1935. Albert Kayser survived. Early in August 1935 Kayser faced the special People's Court. The charge of \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\") was the usual one under circumstances of this kind: he was sentenced to death. Following sentencing, as he was led away, it was reported that he called out to his co-defendants Minna Herm, Wilhelm K√ºnzler, Franz Urbanski and Josef Pfaff, addressing them as \\"Red front comrades\\" (\\"Rot Front, Genossen!\\").Siehe Leidigkeit, Karl-Heinz (and others), Gegen Faschismus und Krieg. Die KPD im Bezirk Halle-Merseburg 1933 bis 1945, Halle (Saale) 1983, pp.205-233. This was widely reported and discussed in the government press under headlines such as \\"No space for central German rabble- rousers\\" (\\"Kein Platz f√ºr mitteldeutsche Hetzer\\") and \\"Culling hatespeak in central Germany\\" (\\"Ausmerzung mitteldeutscher Hetzer\\"). Publicity given to the case and to the death sentence conferred on Kayser spread internationally. A number of exiled top SPD leaders met together with exiled communist leaders at the H√¥tel Lutetia in Paris and resolved to bury political differences between Germany's moderate and extreme political left, part of a development that would resonate through German politics for decades. Back in Berlin the government was hard at work to ensure the success of the forthcoming Berlin Olympic Games. It was a bad time for disagreeable international press headlines about the \\"judicial\\" execution of government opponents. In the end Kayser's sentence was reduced to lifetime imprisonment. Other former city transport workers, such as Rudolf Claus, were not so lucky, possibly because their sentencing had received less national and international press attention. Claus, whose People's Court trial took place at the same time was Kayser's, was executed on 17 December 1935. He was taken initially to Berlin's Pl√∂tzensee Prison. Between February 1936 and 1943 Albert Kayser was imprisoned at the Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison. International publicity given to his case in 1935 meant that, unlike most prison inmates in Hitler's Germany, Kayser was never completely forgotten in the wider world. Even inside the prison at Brandenburg‚ÄìG√∂rden, he was involved in organising antifascist resistance and solidarity. On 21 December 1943 Kayser was transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Here he fell ill and on 18 October 1944 died, probably from a form of Typhus (\\"Flecktyphus\\"). Three days later, on 22 October 1944, fellow inmates held an illegal funeral service for him.

This church was built in 1875. History Our Lady of Guadalupe Church - San Francisco (2018)The Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, originally completed in 1880 was destroyed in April of 1906 by the high magnitude earthquake and fire. A reconstructed Church was consecrated in 1912. In 1992 Archbishop John R.

The church was officially closed on July 2, 1992. An application for declaring the structure as a historic monumentLandmarks and districts, LM204 was sent to The Office of Historical Monuments (now known as Office Of Historic Preservation) and then to the judgment of the Office of City Planning. About 5000 signatures were collected, which led to the saving of the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe as a historical monument, it took attending five hearings in the course of one year and two months for this.

It is probably the first San Francisco church built of reinforced concrete. Reminiscent of certain Colonial churches in Mexico and South America and earlier precedents in Spain and Portugal, the Church is characterized by a simplicity of form. Round or basket arches, twin towers, topped by gold crosses serve as prominent features of the stucco facades. The Church has a recessed, rectangular main entry surrounded by a round-arched secondary entry on the west, and a rectangular bay with basket arched openings on the east. At the second floor, a central rose window surmounted by a mosaic figure is flanked on both sides by arched niches containing sculpted figures. The entire church, including the ceiling, is covered with paintings in classical style. The illustration of the Last Supper shows a rich variety of facial expressions. The positioning of the figures indicates a superior grouping of frescos seldom seen in this country, according to some critics. The frescos were completed in 1916. The faces of the angels on the ceiling were modeled after members of the children's choir. These paintings are the work of Luigi Brusaton, an Italian immigrant born in 1885.

Our Lady of Guadalupe The Virgin of Guadalupe is the patron saint of Mexico. She is depicted with brown skin, an angel and moon at her feet and rays of sunlight that encircle her. Her image has been used throughout Mexican history, not only as a religious icon but also as a sign of patriotism. To the present day, Our Lady of Guadalupe remains a powerful symbol of Mexican identity and faith, and her image is associated with everything from motherhood to feminism to social justice. December 12th became a national holiday in Mexico in 1859. Pope Pius XII crowned Our Lady of Guadalupe ‚ÄúEmpress of the Americas‚Äù in 1945, and she has long been recognized as the patron saint of Mexico. Each year on this day, thousands gather at Mexico City‚Äôs Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe to celebrate the patron saint‚Äôs birthday singing the famed ‚ÄúLas Ma√±anitas.‚Äù Legend See also: A Temple With Much History, Our Lady of Guadalupe ChurchA Temple With Much History, Our Lady of Guadalupe Church In 1923, a young immigrant couple from Colima, Mexico arrived by boat to the beaches of San Francisco, they were Don Elias and Dona Maria Silva. The lady came already expecting and soon after her arrival gave birth to a girl, whom they named Ramona. The little girl became seriously ill a few months after birth. Don Elias, who was working near the Church of Guadalupe, consternated, promised the Virgin that if she was saved, he would come to bring her a serenade. Ramoncita healed. By the following December 12, Don Elias stood before the Templo Guadalupano at the edge of 4:30. am with a group of mariachis. The Musicians began to play greeting their Queen and Patroness, the Virgin of Guadalupe, with \\"Las Mananitas\\", neighbors not accustomed to noise at such an early hour, reported them to the police. This one came and they all were jailed. The next day, when the priest of the church found out what happened, went to the police station to explain that the serenade in the wee hours of the night was a Mexican tradition. This served to rescue the mariachis, it was then settled that in the future, they could continue bringing serenade to Our Lady at the same time each December I2Dec. 12 is the day to honour Our Lady of Guadalupe, without being detained.

Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, No. 17-647, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a case before the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with compensation for private property owners when the use of that property is taken from them by state or local governments, under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The immediate question asks if private land owners must exhaust all state-offered venues for mediation before seeking action in the federal courts. The case specifically addresses the Court's prior decision from the 1985 case Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, which had previously established that all state court venues must be exhausted first, but which has since resulted in several split decisions among circuit courts. The Supreme Court ruled in June 2019 to overturn part of Williamson County that required state venue action be taken first, allowing taking-compensation cases to be brought directly to federal court.. Background The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment allows federal, state, and local governments to take private property for public use under eminent domain, as long as the private landowners are justly compensated for the taking of their property. In 1985, in Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, the Supreme Court held that in cases claiming just compensation for private property taken by state or local governments, the owner had to demonstrate that the case was ripe for litigation by exhausting state law remedies \\"first.\\" As it turned out, however, courts also took the position that when property owners complied with this rule and sued \\"first\\" in state court, the state court decision would give rise to res judicata or issue preclusion, so the owner's claim of federal constitutional violation could never be heard in federal court under federal law. This decision has come under criticism as it denied property owners, and them alone, access to federal courts and to protection of the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause. In the Knick case, Rose Mary Knick of Pennsylvania had purchased 90 acres of farmland within Scott Township, Lackawanna County in 1970. Around 2008, another resident of the township discovered documentation that suggested one of their relatives may have been buried in a cemetery within Knick's land. In 2008, a dispute arose between Knick, and the township which promulgated public access to the cemetery located on Knick's property. Knick asserted there was no evidence of such, her land title did not include any mention of a cemetery, nor was any cemetery registered with the state. The Township passed an ordinance in 2012 that required any cemetery operated within the Township to have right-of-way access from the nearest public road, and be open to public during daylight hours. After passing the ordinance, a Township official went onto Knick's property without permission, discovered a set of stones he deemed to be a cemetery, and determined Knick to be in violation of the ordinance. Knick eventually sued in federal court which dismissed her action. Knick sought relief from the Pennsylvania court of common pleas, arguing that her land was being taken for public use without compensation, but the court refused to accept the case as the Township had yet to file a civil enforcement action against her. She subsequently appealed to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, citing facial challenges based on the Township's new ordinance violating her Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights in addition to takings claims. By September 2016, the District Court dismissed the case, arguing that it was unripe for federal courts as per Williamson County. Knick appealed to the Third Circuit Appeals Court. While the Third Circuit did consider if the various tests prescribed by Williamson County were applicable to the facial challenges presented by Knick, the Court ultimately deemed that Knick's case was unripe until Knick had prosecuted a state-level lawsuit. Supreme Court Knick petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. Knick's petition pointed out that there was a split in how Williamson County was applied in the Circuit Courts. The Third Circuit's decision agreed with the Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits in prior case law, but was in conflict with the First, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits. Additionally, the petition referred to Justice John Roberts' denial for writ of certiorari in Arrigoni Enterprises, LLC v. Durham (2016), a case that also sought to challenge the Williamson County decision, which had been joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy. In the denial, Roberts suggested that it was necessary for the Supreme Court to review Williamson County, due to the onus it puts on property owners, but required a proper case for that review. The Court granted the petition in March 2018, with the first oral arguments heard on October 3, 2018, before an eight-member Supreme Court, as Justice Brett Kavanaugh had yet to be sworn into office. In November 2018, the Court announced it would hold a second argument before all nine Justices; while the Court did not provide a rationale, analysts believed that this indicated the eight Justices were deadlocked, thus requiring Justice Kavanaugh to take part in the case to break the deadlock. The second oral hearings before the full court was held January 16, 2019. The Court issued its judgment on June 21, 2019. In its 5‚Äì4 decision along ideological lines, it vacated the Third Circuit's judgment and remanded the case to the lower court. The decision overruled the portion of Williamson County decision that required those seeking legal action for takings-compensation to seek state litigation first, finding that the original decision was poorly reasoned. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, writing that \\"A property owner has an actionable Fifth Amendment takings claim when the government takes his property without paying for it.\\" The opinion emphasized that unfair compensation when private land is taken is constitutional violation, and thus ripe for the federal court system. Justice Clarence Thomas joined the majority, and in a separate opinion, wrote \\"Stare decisis does not compel continued adherence to this erroneous precedent.\\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote the dissent and expressed concerns that by eliminating the need to bring such takings-compensation cases to state courts first, it could require federal courts to become involved in understanding complex state law issues. Kagan's decision also expressed concern that Knick along with other recent Court decisions such as Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt shows a trend that the current Court is ready to ignore long-standing precedent and overturn past rulings. Justice Stephen Breyer had expressed similar concern in his dissent with Hyatt.

Phil McNeill of The Daily Telegraph described the gymnasium as appearing \\"like an aircraft hangar\\", and he described that structure and the pre-conversion dormitory blocks as \\"ugly\\". The school owners added a Buddhist temple, which only had low-level windows so occupants could concentrate on religious exercises. Shi-Tennoji School also had an archery court, a teahouse, and a Japanese-style water garden. =Conversion into flats= After the school's closure, the properties were turned into a 57-residence flat complex. The Tudor manor now houses ten residences; its smallest accommodation was a one bedroom unit priced at ¬£215,000 in 2007, and the largest and most expensive was a unit on the first floor priced at ¬£550,000 that year. The coach house is now a three-residence unit. The dormitories were converted into a pair of 15-bedroom flat blocks called The Courtyards. For aesthetic purposes, the developer added dormer windows and changed the roofs to have lighter colours. The Buddhist temple was converted into residences with two- three bedrooms each; McNeill stated that this was possibly the first time a Buddhist temple in Great Britain was converted into flats. The developer added a second storey at the temple roof, sliding glass doors, and dormer windows, as the temple was not listed as a historic site. The ground floor rooms post- conversion still had ceilings, above the standard . In 2007 the Buddhist temple conversion's apartment prices were between ¬£485,000 and ¬£525,000. The developer also converted the archery court and teahouse into new uses. According to McNeill, many of the residences were \\"likely\\" to be utilized as second homes. Some residents of Herringswell tried to prevent the dormitories being converted into apartments, but this failed.

Jean Baptiste Louis Pierre, the French botanist who first formally described the species, using the basionym Unona brandisiana, named it in honor of Sir Dietrich Brandis, the German botanist who Pierre worked for in the Indian Forest Service (then called the Imperial Forestry Service) in Calcutta. Description It is a tree reaching 25 meters in height. Its trunk has grey bark. Its long branches have a round cross-section and are covered in woolly hairs when young, but are hairless when mature. Its petioles are 12-20 millimeters long and covered in woolly hairs. Its hairless, elliptical leaves are 8-16 by 7-11 centimeters. 1-8 fragrant flowers are on peduncles that are 10-20 millimeters long. Subtending the peduncles are oval bracts that are 1.5-2 by 2 centimeters and covered in woolly hairs. About midway along the length of the peduncles is a bracteole that is 8 by 2-5 millimeters and covered in woolly hairs. Its sepals are 5 millimeters long and come to a shallow point. Its oblong, fleshy petals are 4-7 centimeters long and 2 centimeters wide at their widest point. The petals come to a point at their tip and are covered in woolly hairs. The flowers have approximately 240 stamens. The receptacles of the flowers are hairy. Its flowers have 24 carpels that are covered in fine downy hairs. Its styles are hairless. Its ovaries have variable numbers of ovules. Its cylindrical fruit are on pedicels that are 5 millimeters long. The contour of the fruit is constricted around its seeds. The fruit contain 2-3 flattened, brown, shiny seeds that are 6 by 12 millimeters. =Reproductive biology= The pollen of C. brandisiana is shed as permanent tetrads. =Habitat and distribution= Pierre described it in 1881 as growing commonly in the forest areas in China and Cambodia. =Uses= In Cambodia it is called by the common name Chk√® Sra√®ng and is used in traditional medicine to treat fever. Bioactive molecules isolated from its bark, including acetogenins have been reported to have cytotoxic properties in tests with cancer cell lines. Juvenile hormones, which are known to regulate insect development, have also been extracted from its bark. Pierre noted that its soft white wood can be used in woodworking to create vases, boxes and tool handles.

It was returned to the shipyard and extended by in 1939. During the Second World War (1940-1945) the ship was kept and maintained in Copenhagen harbour, but with vital engine parts removed and thus never seized by the German occupation force. The main work from Dana was to conduct marine biological and hydrographical research in the Baltic, North Sea and waters around Faroe Islands and Greenland.

He was one of the seven barons in the early 14th century, who were styled themselves Palatine of Hungary. He was the ancestor of the Jolsvai family. Family Roland II was born into the influential and prestigious gens (clan) R√°t√≥t, as the son of magister Leustach II. His grandfather was Dominic I, who was killed in the Battle of Mohi in 1241. Roland II had a brother Desiderius I (also \\"the Blind\\"),Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus R√°t√≥t 1. main branch) who served as isp√°n of Borsod and G√∂m√∂r Counties, and married a daughter of oligarch Stephen √Åkos, establishing an alliance between the two powerful kindreds. Roland had four sons from his unidentified wife. Through his eldest son, Desiderius II, he was the ancestor of the Jolsvai (previously Gedei) noble family, which became extinct in 1427. His two younger sons, Leustach IV and Roland III held various isp√°nates in the 1330s. Roland's fourth son, Stephen III was mentioned only once in 1321.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus R√°t√≥t 7. Jolsvai branch) Career Roland first appeared in contemporary records in 1275. During the political crisis of 1280, King Ladislaus IV adopted new Cuman laws under the pressure of the Catholic Church. However, many Cumans decided to leave Hungary instead of obeying the papal legate Philip's demands. On their way to the frontier, they ravaged and looted many settlements and estates. Roland, his brother Desiderius and two of his cousins, Rathold II and Nicholas \\"Vecse\\" successfully defended the Cistercian monastery at Egres (present-day Igri»ô in Romania). Thereafter Roland and several other members of the R√°t√≥t clan participated in the royal military campaigns against the Cumans. Roland was present at the siege of Gede Castle (present-day Hodejov, Slovakia), where the rebellious Finta Aba barricaded himself in mid-1281. Later Roland himself owned the castle, but the date of acquisition is unknown. He also fought against the Cumans in the battle at Lake H√≥d (near present-day H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely) in 1282. Remains of the stone wall of Gede Castle (present-day Hodejov in Slovakia), owned by Roland R√°t√≥t For his military service, Roland was made Master of the horse by Ladislaus IV in 1283. It is possible he belonged to that baronial group, which was dominated by the gens Cs√°k during that time. The alliance disintegrated by the following year with the deaths of brothers Matthew II and Peter I Cs√°k. Thus Roland also lost his office. He was replaced by James Borsa, who was first mentioned in that capacity in August 1284. Maintaining the short-lived dual system in the dignity in order to avoid power struggle, which characterized the late reign of Andrew III, Roland R√°t√≥t became Palatine of Hungary for the Transdanubian region () ‚Äì simultaneously Apor P√©c was responsible for Cisdanubia ‚Äì in 1298 and held that office until the next year. In the contemporary context, this meant that Roland had jurisdiction over Eastern Hungary in this capacity (as \\"Transdanubia\\" had a different meaning than present days), while Apor P√©c supervised the counties in Western Hungary. In addition, Roland also bore the title of Judge of the Cumans. Roland held an assembly at G√°va (today part of G√°vavencsell≈ë) in October 1298 and in Borsod County in the following year. Following the death of Andrew III and the extinction of the √Årp√°d dynasty in 1301, Roland presumably supported the claim of Wenceslaus of Bohemia to the Hungarian throne, similarly to his cousins (including Dominic II, the actual head of the family) and brother Desiderius. He attended the wedding of Stephen √Åkos the Younger with a foreign (Bavarian or Czech) princess in early 1303, but this fact does not confirm his affiliation, as pro-Charles oligarch Amadeus Aba was also present. He was first referred to as \\"baron\\" in 1303. He took an oath of allegiance to Charles I by the next year. Within a short time, he rose to prominence in the royal court of Charles, becoming one of the most illustrious domestic partisans of the Anjou prince, alongside Ugrin Cs√°k and Amadeus Aba. Roland was styled as Palatine of Hungary since February 1303, he attended the aforementioned wedding in this capacity. In the first decade of the 14th century, seven barons held the dignity simultaneously. Majority of the historians, including Gyula Krist√≥ and Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs, considered, these barons, Matthew III Cs√°k, Amadeus Aba, Ivan K≈ëszegi, Stephen √Åkos, James Borsa, Apor P√©c and Roland R√°t√≥t himself were arbitrarily took and used the title, which marked its devaluation. However, historian Attila Zsoldos developed a special theory. When Andrew III formed a league against his enemies, a group of powerful lords ‚Äî including the K≈ëszegis, Matthew Cs√°k and Roland Borsa ‚Äî urged Charles II of Naples to send his grandson, the 12-year-old Charles of Anjou, to Hungary in order to become king, according to the Illuminated Chronicle. The young prince disembarked in Split in August 1300, supported by most Croatian and Slavonian lords. However, the K≈ëszegis and Matthew Cs√°k were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Zsoldos argued Andrew III entered into a new feudal contract with the barons in the summer of 1300: Matthew Cs√°k and Ivan K≈ëszegi became \\"perpetual\\" Palatines and Andrew accepted their suzerainty over their provinces, while the king's two most powerful partisans, Amadeus Aba and Stephen √Åkos were also granted this privilege. In addition to them, two co-palatines of the previous year, Roland R√°t√≥t and Apor P√©c also received the title as a counterweight, according to Zsoldos' theory. Therefore the historian considers Roland already bore the dignity of Palatine since the last regnal year of Andrew. Accordingly, the claimants to the Hungarian throne inherited Andrew's last decision, and they were forced to accept the status quo. As Zsoldos emphasized the oligarchs recognized each other's titles, in addition to the monarchs, cathedral chapters and other institutions. One of the basis of Zsoldos' theory is the fact that Roland R√°t√≥t and Apor P√©c were considered as much less important persons than, for instance Matthew Cs√°k or Amadeus Aba. Still, other moderately influential lords did not follow the example of Apor and Roland, and nobody else were styled as palatine beyond two of them. In a royal document from 1307, Charles also referred to Roland as palatine, acknowledging his title. Roland R√°t√≥t was present at the Diet of R√°kos on 10 October 1307, which confirmed Charles' claim to the throne. He used the title of palatine there too. After Charles' third coronation, which was performed in full accordance with customary law, on 27 August 1310, the king recognized only James Borsa as Palatine, who was appointed to the position in 1306 by Charles. Roland R√°t√≥t was deceased by then, as he was never mentioned by contemporary documents after the diet in October 1307.

From 1903 to 1924 he was Professor of Education at King's College, London. He was the most distinguished historian of education of his day.  Early life  Adamson started his professional career as a pupil teacher at a Church school in Marylebone. In 1876 he went to St. Paul's College, Cheltenham. There he obtained his teacher's certificate. He then taught in London and became second master of the Great College Street Board School. During this period he took an Arts course as an evening student at King's College London. He gave most of his attention to a study of Latin and Greek. In 1881 he graduated. In 1890 he returned to King's College as the first head of the training department for teachers., ; see also:  Professor at King's College  Between 1890 and 1924 Adamson held the following positions at King's College: * 1890-1924: Normal Master of King's College School * 1890-1924: Normal Master of Day Training College * 1901-1903: Lecturer on the Theory and Practice of Teaching * 1903-1924: Professor of Education The Department for the Training of Teachers of King's College was established under John William Adamson in October 1890. In 1896 it was split into two sections: the 'Day Training College' for those intending to teach in elementary schools, and the 'Department for Secondary Training'. These were amalgamated in 1922 to form the Education Department, part of the Faculty of Arts. This became the Faculty of Education in 1968, which merged with the Chelsea College Centre for Science and Mathematics Education in 1985 to create the current School of Education. King's College London was one of the first institutions of university rank to open a 'Day Training College.' This became the direct ancestor of the modern university department of education, which still fulfils the double purpose of training teachers, and also to foster the academic study of education and research in this subject. October 1890 one of the former students of King's College London, John William Adamson, was appointed to be head of the training department and 'normal master'. \\"His duties were 'to give lectures on the history and theory of Education, to superintentd the students' work in the practising school, and to give a course of model lessons and preside at the criticism lesson'. There had been forty applications for the post and seven candidates were interviewed. It was a condition of appointment that, in accordance with the charter of King's College, applicants should be members of the Church of England and make a declaration to that effect. The annual salary attached to the post was fixed at ¬£180.\\" The earliest history of the department can be followed in the logbook which Adamson kept and which is still preserved at King's College.The logbook is part of this archive (access-date 2019-01-10). Interesting are the yearly reports of the inspection of the department by His Majesty's Inspectors of Training Colleges. In 1894 the Inspector has \\"nothing but praise for the Normal Master's personal work\\" and in 1897 he says: \\"I think Mr. Adamson is following true educational lines and is keeping in view the needs of the country‚Ä¶ the Normal Master deserves credit for what he does in difficult circumstances.\\" (cited in ) Already in 1897 almost the whole of the Faculty of Arts at King's College was formed by 'Education' students. In 1900 a Board of Studies in Pedagogy was formed, of which Adamson became the secretary, and later chairman. Adamson's role was further recognized by his appointment as lecturer in 1901 and as professor in 1903.  Other functions  Other functions of Adamson were: * 1909-1910: President of the Teachers' Training Association. * 1919-1935: Lecturer in History of Education to the Teachers' Training Syndicate, University of Cambridge. * 1926-1937: Chairman of the Military Education Committee, University of London.

Since the 1950s he has been working on an oeuvre containing paintings, drawings, sculptures, publications, video and his own theory about form. His work has shown itself in different styles over time as lyrical abstraction, constructivism and minimalism. An overall constant is his fascination for the geometric figures such as the circle, the triangle and especially the square.  Career  = Education = Verstockt starts his studies in philosophy and literature at Ghent University. Then he went to the Academy of Antwerp and he finished studying at HISK Antwerp. There he develops as a painter in the trend of lyrical abstraction, a movement growing in Paris at that time. His first works follow this movement with references to nature and the cosmos. During his studies he met Dan Van Severen, they both find their way into constructivism. = 1960‚Äì1980 = From 1963 Verstockt started creating monochrome geometrical structures, mostly based on the square. During the midst of 1960, he attained a geometrical visual language. At the end of 1960 he chose resolutely for the geometrical abstraction, leaving the lyrical tendency behind. Verstockt claimed that for him the geometrical aspect is secondary to the structure. His fascination for the square and cubes is notable in his work from that point onwards. In later works he can be seen as a defender of minimal art. Verstockt always keeps looking for different kinds of experiments to further his structural research. Besides being an independent artist, Verstockt also worked as a graphic designer making posters and books. In 1971 he published his own book after 20 years of research called This is not a book, challenging the essence of what a book should be and how it should be made. He also deepens his research of the geometrical forms in some (monumental) sculptures. His most known sculpture in Belgium is The Signal from 1972 that was situated in Sint-Niklaas. Together with his other sculptures such as Yellow object from 1968 and Plexiglass boxes from 1974, he became a defender of minimal art. He kept on looking for new materials and techniques, exploring new media such as video art. Verstockt wants to reintegrate art into society by letting it meet with current developments. = After 1980 = In 1982 Verstockt published his theory called The Genesis of Form, from Chaos to Geometry. The book is an in-depth study of form after 30 years of working. This shows again how much research Verstockt puts in his work. His exploration of new media was still ongoing and in 1986 he uses one of the first computers available in Belgium to make a series of drawings on the theme of the square. Until 1996 he worked and lived in Antwerp, he even was a teacher at HISK in Antwerp. In 1996 he moved to Fays and lived and worked there. He died in 2014 in Antwerp at the age of 84. = Legacy = Verstockt is most known in Belgium due to his monumental works in public space. For example The signal is a visual recognizable image. Other typical examples are the sculpture Caduceus, which he made for the Flemish Parliament, and the floor drawing which he made in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels.  Works  = This is not a book (1971)= Verstockt described This is not a book as a non-book that searches for the essence of what a book can be. It is a reaction on Marshall MacLuhan saying that the book known by us through Gutenberg standards is dead. Verstockt sees the statement of MacLuhan as a provocation that points out other forms of a book outside of the printed letters exist. The book comes in a white plastic square box with a window, inside are cardboard sheets, plastic, three pop-ups, a vinyl produced by Verstockt, a catalogue, a page in Braille, a package with 6 cardboard plates for 3D construction and a life size poster of Verstockt himself. The non-book is an exercise in looking with a new form of interaction included, the viewer is invited to use the book and participate. = The signal (1972) = The signal was a monumental steel sculpture with a height of 18 meters. It was located at the entrance to Sint-Niklaas, Belgium, along the exit of the highway next to the Waasland Shopping Center. With the expansion of the commercial center in 2004, the sculpture disappeared and got replaced by an advertising column. Verstockt was never officially informed and there is confusion about what happened tot the sculpture. Art platform WARP organized a writing contest to bring attention the disappearance called Without a trace, young writers could submit their own version of events about the missing sculpture. = Five acts on screen (1974)= Five acts on screen was a video Verstockt realized in 1974 published by Continental in Antwerp. It is a registration of himself during a creative proces. In the same year an article called Some Notes on video art in Belgium was written by Jan Debbaut, a critic and curator. Debbaut writes that Verstockt is trying to change the screen into a kind graphic support. One of the aims of the video is to make the spectator let loose of the scheme spectator-screen-actor-support and find different ways. Much as deconstructing the concept book in This is not a book, Verstockt now is looking for the possibilities of video art. = Pyrography (2002)= Verstockt kept on searching for different types of materials and techniques. In 2002 he started using the technique of pyrography on metal and bamboo leaves. It is a slow manual process that does not allow any moment of inattention. The lines created have a whole other appearance than that of ink.  Theory  = The Genesis of the Form (1982)= In 1982 Verstockt's fascination for the geometrical forms and objects gets translated into the book The Genesis of Form, from Chaos to Geometry. He worked 20 years on researching the subject before finishing it in a publication. It became an illustrated source of information about the symbolism, evolution and history of geometrical forms, signs and structures. It is a tool for artists, designers, students, historians, semiotics‚Ä¶ and whoever is interested in visual communication.

His uncle, Benjamin Roebuck (died 1809), of the Madras civil service, found him an appointment with the East India Company, and early in 1801 he left England to enter the 17th regiment of native infantry as a cadet. He became lieutenant-captain on 17 September 1812, and captain on 15 June 1815. Roebuck learned Hindustani, and was asked to use it when his regiment was on active service.

He was a member of the Asiatic Society. Roebuck died of fever at Calcutta on 8 December 1819. Works During his leave, Roebuck spent time in Edinburgh assisting John Borthwick Gilchrist with an English-Hindustani dictionary, and two volumes of the British-Indian Monitor for 1806‚Äì8.

It serves around 200 students age 3 through eighth grade on an 11-acre campus. History Browne Academy was founded in 1941 as the first integrated school in Virginia. At the time, it was named the Brownie School, which continued to be the name of the preschool after the elementary school became Browne Academy in 1975. The Brownie School served preschool through third grade, and fourth and fifth grade were added in 1958. In 1986, a building was acquired to house the new middle school. In 1998, the school built a new lower school in order to accommodate more students. In 2007, Browne Academy students won a NASA contest to name the Harmony module carried by Space Shuttle Discovery. In 2014, Browne Academy added a sustainable garden program with the goal of gardens for each class and a composting system. Demographics The racial makeup of Browne Academy's K-8 student body during the 2017-2018 school year was 38.4% White, 32.1% African American, 22.1% multiracial, 3.7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 2.6% Hispanic, and 1% American Indian/Alaska Native. The students are mostly American citizens, but there is a small amount of foreign students, such as Czechs and Italians. Program In addition to core subjects (Math, Science, History, and English), Browne Academy students study art, music, physical education, and Spanish. Browne Academy decided to end the French program in favor of a single Spanish class, because they felt that having both languages in the lower school would lead to an exposure program rather than one where students could become fluent in the language. Class size is limited to 15 students. Browne Academy offers extracurricular activities, including junior choir, handbells, and taekwondo. Students may join soccer, basketball, cross-country, and ultimate Frisbee teams. The school gives three character awards to students in each graduating class. The school takes many field trips to locations relating to the curriculum. For example, the 6th grade takes a field trip to the Conowingo Dam as they do their unit on dams and water. The 8th grade compete in a yearly competition known as We The People, where they put their constitutional knowledge to the test. Browne Academy created a robust learning program for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The game focuses on providing sandbox gameplay features that give the player freedom to do what they want in its world instead of focusing on a linear story. Kenshi development was primarily led by a single person over the course of twelve years, and was released on December 6, 2018. Kenshi takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting and allows characters to be a thief, a trader, or a myriad of other options. The game has received mostly positive reviews from critics, who have commented on its depth, its MMO-style gameplay, and its difficulty. Gameplay Kenshi has a damage system where players and enemies can lose limbs after battles and have to permanently deal with the consequences Kenshi is an open world role-playing video game with real-time strategy elements that has no linear narrative. It takes place in a post- apocalyptic sword punk fantasy setting, where it is incredibly difficult for life to survive. The player starts out with no skills and struggles to survive in the early stages of the game. Skills are leveled up through doing actions, such as leveling up thievery by stealing items, and the player can recruit other units to grow their squad. The player can recruit characters from numerous different factions and species to join their squad, and can eventually build a town themselves. As part of the damage system, limbs can be severed or damaged individually as well. Kenshi has many non-player locations, of sizes ranging from a single building to large cities. The game includes a world states system which creates reactions to deaths of notable people. These reactions to power vacuums can result in new locations spawning or in towns being taken over by new factions. Zones in Kenshi are not just aesthetic, as they have specific soil types, resource availability, and seasons. These factors come into play when players are constructing outposts. Even without building anything, weather can give players pause as harmful weather effects can occur all across the map. Development Kenshi was primarily developed by a single person, Chris Hunt, who began development around 2006‚Äì2008. Hunt worked as a part-time security guard in order to make ends meet for the first few years of the game's development. After five or so years of working his security job, Hunt was able to leave his part-time job and work on the game full-time after finding initial success with the game. He worked by himself on the project until 2013, when he was able to hire a small team that works with him on the project. Hunt has described the world as \\"sword-punk\\", and was specifically inspired by stories of wandering r≈çnin and the idea of a survivor travelling a wasteland. Hunt has described his impetus for creating the game as his dislike of the \\"hand-holding\\" that other RPGs have when starting out. On his general mantra for designing the game, Hunt stated that he considered himself as the player's enemy. The game's playable area is , which was done to place dangerous and challenging areas in between rewards that players might seek out. Hunt wanted different areas of the map to have different themes or factions that would make them feel unique, such as one that treats female characters differently than males. The game was first released in early access in 2013 before its official release on December 6, 2018. Reception Kenshi received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. PC Gamer Robert Zak praised the game's giant size and scope, but noted that the game could get \\"grindy\\" and that the game's UI \\"can get cumbersome as your group's numbers grow.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun noted the game's depth and compared Kenshi positively to Dwarf Fortress. Sequel In March 2019, a sequel built on the Unreal Engine, Kenshi 2, was announced.

Early life Vale Royal Abbey Cholmondeley was the eldest surviving son of Thomas Cholmondeley of Vale Royal and his wife Anne St John, daughter of Sir Walter St John, 3rd Baronet of Battersea and Lydiard Tregoze, Wilts. In 1702 he succeeded his father to the estates at Vale Royal. He was admitted at St. John‚Äôs College, Cambridge on 13 October. 1701 and at Middle Temple in August 1709. He married Essex Pitt, daughter of Thomas Pitt (governor) of Stratford Wiltshire on 22 July 1714. Career At the 1710 general election Cholmondeley was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Cheshire in a contest. He was a member of the October Club and listed as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô. He increasingly involved himself in the attempts of Tory back-benchers to influence policy. By 1712, he changed his allegiance from the October Club to the March Club. He was returned unopposed in 1713. Some of his Tory supporters in Cheshire abandoned him at the 1715 general election and he was defeated at the poll. When the Duke of Ormonde fled abroad in July 1715, Cholmondeley drank the Jacobite toast with Sir Henry Bunbury and Lord Barrymore. He was returned as MP for Cheshire again in a contest at the 1722 general election. In Parliament, he voted consistently with the opposition. He was elected in a contest again at the 1727 general election. He spoke against the government on the repeal of the Septennial Act on 13 March 1734. At the 1734 general election he was re-elected in a contest again. From then on, he was returned as MP for Cheshire unopposed in 1741, 1747 and 1754 and continued to vote regularly against the government. Death and legacy Cholmondeley died on 30 March 1756. He had three sons and five daughters. Two of his sons predeceased him and he was succeeded in both his estates and his parliamentary sea by his son Thomas.

Production The design was built by Hunter Marine in the United States, starting in 2016 and remained in production through 2019. Design The Marlow-Hunter 47 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of vinylester fiberglass, with a Nida-core sandwich and Kevlar reinforcing, with a hard chine hull. It has a fractional sloop B&R; rig, a nearly plumb stem, a reverse transom with a fold-down swimming platform, telescoping ladder and a dinghy garage, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed deep fin keel or optional wing keel. The deep fin keel model displaces and carries of ballast, while the wing keel version displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the deep fin keel and with the shoal draft wing keel. The steering wheel is hydraulically-canting and can be pivoted though 90¬∞ as desired by the helmsman. This provides the advantages of a dual-wheel configuration, but occupies less cockpit space. The wheel also folds when not in use. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of , while the holding tank has a capacity of . Below decks headroom is . Factory options include roller furling jib and mast-furling mainsail. Operational history Writing for Sailing magazine in May 2016, famed yacht designer Robert Perry wrote, \\"This design is all about the interior and to my eye it looks very good. ... Suffice to say you will be quite comfortable on this 47-footer. ... I can see this new model having a lot of appeal for a lot of people looking for a comfortable ride\\". In an August 2016 review Cruising World, noted \\"The Marlow-Hunter 47 marches to a different beat, with design concepts borrowed from the power side of the company. A raised cabin top features windows all around and provides room below for multilevel accommodations and a raised saloon sole that lets you sit up to enjoy the view.\\" In a March 2017 review in Pacific Yachting Sven Donaldson wrote, \\"The new Marlow Hunter 47 is similar in size to the current MH-50 centre cockpit and aft cockpit models, but there's no question that it's targeting a more exalted market niche. The basic concept is what I'd call a classic deck salon arrangement that situates the \\"great cabin\\" and galley in an elevated central space beneath a tall, traditional-looking coach house. Overhanging \\"eyebrows\\" shield the wrap-around windows, and the clean, flat cabin top serves as an excellent lounging area. Because the main cabin sole is raised, it's only three steps down from the cockpit, so moving between the two principle social areas is comparatively easy.\\" He concluded, \\"The new MH-47 is quite novel both in design and execution‚Äînot at all what one might ordinarily expect from a mass production builder. On the other hand, the Hunter legacy is one of innovation, so it's not entirely surprising to see another unusual yacht emerge from this quarter. This particular Marlow Hunter won't be a mass- market boat, nor is it intended to be.\\" A May 2017 review in Blue Water Sailing noted, \\"The all new Marlow Hunter 47 offers her owners an aft cockpit, raised-deck saloon configuration that optimizes living space and comfort at sea. With the standard B & R rig and small headsail, the 47 will be easy to sail and should be fast off the wind. The accommodations offer a great master cabin forward with a huge head and lots of storage\\". A 2018 write-up in Specialty Yachts wrote of the design, \\"the new Marlow Hunter 47 is the boat of the future.

The Japanese army invaded her home without warning and suddenly took her to Busan forcefully. For the next seven years, the Japanese Army transported her to Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and Indonesia. Chung Seo-woon later became a human rights activist, giving testimony in Japan and the United States and calling for an apology and compensation from Japan.  Biography  Chung Seo-woon was born in Hadong, South Gyeongsang Province. She was the only child of a wealthy family. When she was fourteen years old, her father was arrested. Chung Seo-woon was fooled by the village foreman's advice that her father would be released if she went to work in a Japanese textile factory. The Japanese Army kidnapped her and took her to Busan and then to a warehouse with about one thousand other kidnapped girls in Shimonoseki, Japan. She was later transported to Taiwan, Singapore, and Indonesia. She was allegedly raped by dozens of soldiers every day. Ultimately she spent seven years as a comfort woman. Even though she regained her freedom at the end of World War II, Chung Seo-woon had to spend a year in the prison camp in Singapore before returning to her homeland in 1945. She returned to her old home in 1946, but found that it had been abandoned. As a result, she was forced to live in poverty on the street while selling bread and medicine. When she was almost sixty years old, she met her husband. Chung said, \\"I was never able to have a normal sex life, but I met a kind man who wanted a companion more than anything else.\\" Her husband had been forcibly conscripted by Japan, so he understood and protected her deep wounds. Chung stated, ‚ÄúI do not want to dream nightmare about the harsh experience as a comfort woman anymore.‚Äù Chung Seo-woon died at her home in Jinhae, South Gyeongsang Province, in February 2004.  Activism  Soon after Kim Hak-sun gave the first testimony as a former South Korean comfort woman in 1992. Chung Seo-woon publicly disclosed the fact that she was also a victim of the Japanese military comfort system. In September 1995, at age seventy-five, she spoke at the International Symposium on Violence Against Women War and Armed Conflicts in China, saying \\"The Japanese defiled [my] body but not [my] spirit. Why should I hide? I am not the one who should feel shame; it is Japan who should carry all the shame on its shoulders. Helps me tell this story to American and the whole world.‚Äù Thereafter, she participated in the production of documentaries to testify about the reality of brutality of the Japanese military. She also attended the Wednesday demonstration with Kang Duk-kyung, Kim Bok-dong and Kim Soon-duk. She took the lead in exposing the cruelty of the Japanese military and calling for a proper apology and compensation. As a result, the use of comfort women issue was classified as a war crime by the United Nations. A monument called the \\"Peace Tower in Memory of Sex Slaves of the Japanese Colonial Army\\" has been built at the Seomjin River, near Chung's birthplace.

At the age of twelve he came into possession of a photographic plates folding camera, became engaged in photography and organized a home darkroom. From 1954 to 1956 he studied at the art school, and from 1956 to 1959 ‚Äî at the animation courses under Soyuzmultfilm led by Fyodor Khitruk where he met his future wife and regular collaborator Galina Barinova.Georgy Borodin, Galina Barinova. Two memorial evenings dedicated to Anatoly Petrov recorded at the State Central Museum of Cinema, 22‚Äî23 November 2012 (in Russian) While still a student he was distinguished for his artistic skills and the ability to work in various styles.Georgy Borodin. Anatoly Petrov died article at Gazeta.ru, 5 March 2010 (in Russian) Upon graduation Petrov and Barinova joined Soyuzmultfilm, simultaneously studying at the Moscow Polygraphic Institute (1959‚Äî1964). Very soon Petrov was noticed by the leading directors and became one of the most wanted animators at the studio. In just several years Lev Atamanov, when asked whether he would hire Fyodor Khitruk or Anatoly Petrov, answered \\"Petrov, because he is a universal artist who is capable of everything\\". By the mid-1960s he was already teaching his own students; he developed a unique programme and spent over 40 years as an educator, both at Soyuzmultfilm and VGIK animation courses.Anatoly Petrov (2010). Classic Animation. Drawn movement // Introduction by Stanislav Sokolov. ‚Äî Moscow: VGIK, 197 pages Around the same time he was sent to Zagreb Film (Yugoslavia) for retraining as an animation director. Upon return in 1967 Petrov directed his first experimental short Hippopotamus (also known as The Singing Teacher) which was released as part of the Kaleidoscope-68 almanac in 1968. Drawn with pencil, it featured detailed three-dimensional characters with lifelike movements in an absurdist tale.Irina Margolina, Natalia Lozinskaya (2006). Our Animation. ‚Äî Moscow: Interros, p–∑. 176‚Äî179 From then on he started promoting his original ideas, always working as animator on his films. Petrov studied world art and dreamed of bringing world-famous paintings to life. He developed a theory of the unity of visual arts and the art of animation. According to him, every famous artist required a new unique approach that would lead to stylistically different movements. That's where the idea for his next project came. As a director In 1969 Petrov and Barinova gathered a team of young animators who hadn't been given a chance to direct their own films before and created the Happy Merry-Go-Round \\"newsreel\\" animated anthology. It was conceived as a polygon for experimental animation based on riddles, rhymes, songs, absurd stories and so on.The Wisdom of Fiction: Masters of Animation about Themselves and Their Art // Anatoly Petrov. ‚Äî Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1983, pp. 121-124 The original team included Gennady Sokolsky, Leonid Nosyrev and Valery Ugarov who later made successful individual careers, but also regularly helped each other. The first episode Distracted Giovanni was directed by Petrov himself. Based on the fairy tale by Gianni Rodari about a distracted boy who literally fell apart, it was accused by the head of the State Committee for Cinematography Alexei Romanov for \\"using children's cinema as a polygon for abstract art propaganda\\".Animator Galina Barinova interview by Moscow 24, 29 September 2013 (in Russian) Nevertheless, the project turned very successful, becoming one of the few Soviet animated series that survived the dissolution of the Soviet Union and making it to the 21st century. With the 1975 And Mother Will Forgive Me Petrov went on to implement the animation style he called photographics influenced by hyperrealism. The film won a prize at the 7th Tampere Film Festival in 1977. His next science fiction film Polygon (1977) was two years in production. All characters were drawn and animated after famous Western movie actors such as Jean Gabin, Paul Newman and Mel Ferrer, and the visual effect created through the use of multilayered celluloid, moving virtual camera, the use of light and color came close to the modern-day CGI. The film received Grand Prize at the 11th Yerevan Film Festival in 1978. Petrov was sure that realism could be achieved by traditional methods of animation, without any additional tricks such as filming, photography and technical devices. He despised rotoscoping and always distanced from it. He managed to achieve his old dream ‚Äî the moving paintings ‚Äî through the use of the so-called effect of moving glaze in 3D environment. At the same time, he got interested in Greek mythology and became obsessed with another idea: bringing Greek statues to life. This resulted in five films released from 1986 to 1996. The first of them, Heracles at Admetus (1986), was based on one of the Heracles adventures. It took him four years to finish, and it is considered to be the pick of his craftsmanship by modern film historians. As the film historian Georgy Borodin wrote, \\"for many years film directors who had been working in 3D computer graphics and who owned technical resources incomparable to those of Petrov's couldn't even come close to the screen life of three-dimensional hand-drawn characters created by Petrov using only his golden hands\\". Because it took him so long to finish the cartoon, he wasn't allowed to direct another film for the next several years. His later films featured nudity and were released as adult-themed. Last years After the last film Petrov focused on teaching and illustration. He also prepared a three-volume tutorial on animation which was published posthumously.

Katz (born 1947) is an American entrepreneur who co-founded The Rockport Shoe Company in 1972 and served as its CEO until its sale to Reebok International in 1986. He is currently the founder and CEO of The Samuel Hubbard Shoe Company based in Mill Valley, California. Early life Bruce R. Katz, born in 1947, is a third-generation designer and shoe maker, grandson of Samuel J. Katz who founded The Hubbard Shoe Company in 1930. As the son of a U.S. Navy officer who served at the radiation laboratories at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during World War II, Katz was fascinated with science and technology as a boy in Rochester, New Hampshire, and Newton, Massachusetts. He built his first computer in 1960 when he was thirteen years old. Katz went on to study Engineering Physics at Cornell University. The Rockport Shoe Company The Katz family shoe manufacturing operations in Rochester ceased in 1970, a victim, along with most New England shoe factories of the time, of the growing flood of cheaper foreign shoes sweeping the markets. Katz‚Äôs father, Saul L. Katz, then formed the Highland Import Company and began importing shoes from Brazil for a variety of branded American shoe companies. After college and extensive travel around the United States, the younger Katz spent several years preparing to pursue his dream of sailing around the world. He set up shop in Ithaca, New York, and began building a 65-foot ketch. In order to help his father and to earn money to finish building the boat, the twenty-three-year-old began traveling from town to town selling off closeouts from his father's import business. After a year, father and son decided to develop their own unique brand of shoes engineered for comfort, which they called Rockport, and their business began to grow. Seven years later, after Nike introduced the first lightweight running shoes, Katz moved to develop the first lightweight casual shoe using similar materials and with light orthotics that had never before been offered in conventional leather shoes. RocSports, as they were called, were a huge success and the company‚Äôs annual sales reached nearly US$100 million by 1986. One reason for the success was the public awareness campaign launched by Rockport in 1983 about the aerobic benefits of what became known as Fitness Walking. Rockport sponsored walking clubs, events, films, medical research, and books about walking. In 2013 Footwear Plus inducted the Rockport ‚ÄúProWalker‚Äù into its Style Hall of Fame, noting that the shoe was introduced before ‚Äúwalking shoes‚Äù had even been established as a footwear category. The WELL Following the sale of Rockport to Reebok International, Bruce Katz moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1987, where he involved himself with early online communities, which were then merely individual ‚ÄúBulletin Boards‚Äù into which users would dial on phone lines through modems. Founded by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant in 1985, The WELL (Whole Earth ‚ÄòLectronic‚Äô Link) had over 5,000 members by 1990. They gathered and conversed electronically around 270 different topic areas in what became known as a ‚Äúvirtual community.‚Äù Katz acquired The WELL in 1994, and, when the Internet began to emerge from the early ARPA net, he moved to connect it to the early network, enabling users to log in from anywhere and access anything on the Net, not just The WELL‚Äôs discussion lists and servers. According to Smart Computing Encyclopedia, The WELL was ‚Äúone of the first major, worldwide online communities available on the Internet.‚Äù Around the same time, Katz also created a new company called Whole Earth Networks, one of the largest regional Internet service providers, that provided dial-up Internet access with a suite of tools, including e-mail and the new Mosaic web browser. In 1995 The WELL became the first online service to offer its members direct self-publishing on the web. These pages, which allowed each member to present materials and links that interested them as well as their own discussion areas, were the forerunner of what became known as blogs. In 1999 The WELL was sold to Salon. =Well Engaged= Katz‚Äôs experience with The WELL convinced him of the need for web sites to support conversations between users. As a consequence, he created Well Engaged, a service bureau providing discussion-group capability within a web browser and on web pages, and he served as its CEO until the company was spun off and merged to become Prospero Technologies. Well Engaged has served Washingtonpost.com, Fox Entertainment, Ziff-Davis Media, E-Trade, Tribune Interactive, About.com, Business Week, Major League Baseball, and other leading Internet news and commerce sites. Philanthropy and board service Katz joined with his friends Mel and Patricia Ziegler and Bill Rosensweig to help create The Republic of Tea in 1992. He supplied the capital for the business and served on the board until 1994, when the company was sold to New Age Beverages. Katz created the Springhouse Foundation in 1986, which later became the Katz Family Foundation. It supports a variety of environmental and educational organizations. In 1994 the Foundation provided early seed capital for the creation of Business for Social Responsibility, a global nonprofit organization that works with its network of more than 250 member companies to build a just and sustainable world. In addition to having served on the boards of directors of The WELL, Whole Earth Networks, Well Engaged, and The Republic of Tea, Bruce Katz has served as a director of E-Greetings Network, Zing, GetMedia, Paradise Bay Salmon Farms, Esprit de Corps, and the Northern California Film Institute.

It was written for the series by Cory Lerios and George Gabriel. In the song, Kim Possible (the main character of the series) tells listeners to \\"call\\" or \\"beep\\" her if \\"there's trouble\\", no \\"matter if it's day or night\\", and promises she will not fail them and will rush to help. Thus, it reflects the use of modern-day mobile technologies. The original version, played over the opening sequence of the 2002 series, was recorded by Christina Milian and is a catchy punchy Motown- flavored R&B; number. Since then, the song has been covered by many artists, notably by Priscilla (2006) in French, by the groups Preluders (2004) and Banaroo (2006) in English, Beni in Japanese, and by Kiki Ting in Taiwanese. In 2015, Christina Milian's original claimed the number one spot in the ranking of the \\"Disney Channel Theme Songs of Yesteryear\\" The song is also used as the theme song for the 2019 live- action film adaptation.

From 1998 to 2001 he worked as staff member at the UNFCCC secretariat. In 2001 he joined Ecofys, a leading climate and energy consultancy. In 2005 he received his PhD from Department of Science, Technology and Society, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands, for the dissertation on ‚ÄúWhat is next after the Kyoto Protocol ‚Äì Assessment of options for international climate policy post 2012‚Ä≥. In 2009 he became Director of Energy and Climate Policy at Ecofys. Together with colleagues he founded in 2014 the NewClimate Institute, a non-profit research organization for climate policy. In 2017 he was appointed Special Professor ‚ÄúMitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions‚Äù at Wageningen University.  Research  Already in his master's thesis \\"Photothermal deflection spectroscopy as a method to characterize solar cells based on amorphous silicon\\" H√∂hne was devoted to the promotion of renewable energy. As programme officer at the UNFCCC secretariat from 1998 on he supported the negotiations on reporting under the Kyoto Protocol, projections of greenhouse gas emissions, fluorinated greenhouse gases and emissions from international transport. H√∂hne led studies related to the international climate change negotiations and national climate policies. H√∂hne is author of the chapter on climate policies and international cooperation in the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Report from the IPCC. The IPCC received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He is also author of the UNEP Emissions Gap reports from 2010 to 2018. He created the Climate Action Tracker that tracks commitments and actions of countries on climate change. His work with the Climate Action Tracker, the UNEP emissions gap reports and in two publications in Nature significantly contributed to the understanding that all national targets taken together are not yet compatible with the goal of the Paris Agreement. His PhD thesis work on sharing the effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions between countries contains the statement that developed countries would need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% to 40% in 2020 compared to 1990 and 80% to 95% by 2050 to be compatible with limiting global temperature increase to 2 ¬∞C.

Early life Lister was baptized on 18 October 1688, the eldest son. of Thomas Lister of Arnoldsbigging and Westby, Yorkshire and his wife Elizabeth Parker, daughter of John Parker of Extwisle, Lancashire. He was educated at Eton College from 1698 to 1706 and matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford on 1 February 1706, aged 17, although he claimed to have learnt very little in two and a half years there. He succeeded his father in 1706. In 1709 he was admitted at Middle Temple. He married Catherine Assheton, (died 1728), daughter of Sir Ralph Assheton, 2nd Baronet of Middleton and Whalley, Lancashire on 27 November 1716. Career Lister's family held an electoral interest at Clitheroe, having owned property there since the 14th century. When he stood at a by-election on 23 April 1713, he was described as a ‚Äòvery puisne young gentleman‚Äô, as well as being ‚Äòhonest‚Äô. After being returned as Member of Parliament for Clitheroe in 1713, he made little impact in Parliament. He was classed as a Tory but in spite of Tory leanings, he voted on 18 June 1713 against the French commerce bill. Gisburne Park At the 1715 general election, Lister was elected MP for Clitheroe again in a contest. He improved his local interest by his marriage in 1716, and after he was elected in a contest at the 1722 general election he was able to turn this into control of one seat. He consistently voted against the Government, and spoke on 7 May 1728 against a vote of credit. He moved the family seat from Arnoldsbigging to Lower Hall in Gisburn, which his father had acquired from Sir John Assheton in 1697. He rebuilt Lower Hall as Gisburne Park between 1726 and 1736. The hall is of two storeys on an H-shaped floor plane, with nine bays on the south front, the central three being recessed, pebbledashed with sandstone dressings and with a hipped slate roof. The park was also developed and designs were produced by Lord Robert Petre. Lister was returned unopposed on his own interest at the general elections of 1727, 1734 and 1741. Death and legacy Lister died on 15 May 1745 and was buried at Gisburn on 22 May 1745. He had two sons and three daughters, one of whom predeceased him. Both his sons, Thomas and Nathaniel Lister, sat for Clitheroe, as did his grandson Thomas, who was raised to the peerage as Baron Ribblesdale.

It proved hard to fly and a crash led to its abandonment after only a few months of limited testing. Design and development Jaros≈Çaw Naleszkiewicz's Naleszkiewicz JN 1, nicknamed ≈ªabu≈õ II (Froggy II; the Jach ≈ªabu≈õ was an earlier, unrelated Polish glider) was an experimental tailless glider which was intended to test the behaviour of a proposed twin-engined aircraft of the same configuration. It was preceded by a series of rubber- powered models which proved flight stability and suggested good performance. In essence the wooden JN 1 was a high aspect ratio, cantilever wing with a short, bulbous central nacelle and wingtip vertical surfaces. Its two part wing was trapezoidal in plan, with most of the sweep on the leading edge. Each part was built around a single spar with plywood covering ahead of it, forming a torsion resistant D-box, and fabric covering behind. Control surfaces filled the whole trailing edge, with elevators inboard and ailerons outboard. The cockpit was within a ply-covered nacelle which reached forward from the trailing edge to well ahead of the leading edge. Its glazing provided good sideways, but limited forward, vision. A pneumatically-sprung skid under the nacelle provided the JN 2's landing gear. At the wingtips endplate fins carried balanced rudders. Together these vertical surfaces had an elliptical profile, cropped and reinforced below the wing to protect it on the ground. The rudders could be used conventionally in unison or in opposition as airbrakes. Operational history The JN 1 first flew on 23 July, catapult- launched and flown by Francizek Jach in Gummistart. It proved to be hard to control, being oversensitive in pitch both via elevator control and centre of gravity position. Car-towed flights follows but the control difficulties persisted and in the autumn the JN 1 was damaged in a crash. It was not repaired because of a mixture of funding problems, a lack of official interest and Naleszkiewicz's absence due to a new job in Warsaw. With its differentially operating rudders it may have the first glider fitted with air- brakes, though of a very different type to the spoilers used a few years later on German sailplanes.

She is interested in the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare.  Early life and education  Arbel was born in Montreal. Arbel's father was an electrical engineer. As a child Arbel was given a TRS-80 computer, which she used to play video games like pong. Alongside her computer, Arbel's father encouraged her to play with model planes and Lego. She studied science at CEGEP, before joining McGill University for her undergraduate degree in electrical engineering. She completed her Bachelor's (1992), Master's (1995) and PhD (2000) at McGill University. Her PhD considered object recognition using entropy maps. Her PhD thesis was awarded the D.W. Ambridge Prize for the best dissertation in Physical Sciences and Engineering at McGill University. After completing her PhD, Arbel worked at the Montreal Neurological Hospital, where she developed computer vision methods for neurology and neurosurgery. She became interested in using software to detect tumours and lesions in brain images.  Career  She works on algorithms to interpret medical images, which are used to assist in drug discovery and diagnostics. She is particularly interested in graphical models for pathology in large datasets of patient images. Her software can be used for image-guided neurosurgery. She was appointed to McGill University as a Research associate in 2000 and made an Assistant Professor in 2001. She has worked on facial attribute classification and labelling in real-world videos.

She is interested in the biomarkers that can be used to improve medical care for people who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis. This project is a collaboration with Dr. Arnold at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital and looks to identify Multiple Sclerosis lesions from magnetic resonance images. She created an Adaptive Multi-level Conditional Random Field (AMCRF) framework that can leverage spatial and temporal information. She demonstrated that cortical folding patterns in the brain vary over the population. Her recent work looks to use deep learning in medical image analysis. For MS diagnostics, including a 3D MS lesion segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN). In an effort for to understand brain morphometry, Arbel has developed models for computational neuroanatomy. Arbel is the first woman to be made a Full Professor of Electrical Engineering at McGill University.

The Irish Catholic criticised what they called the \\"nasty nuns\\" subplot; in the historical event that the adoption storyline was based on, Josephine Marchment Brown, a widow working in Victoria Barracks, Cork lost custody of her son to her in-laws who took the boy to Wales. The IRA kidnapped the boy back for her in return for her passing information to them. Foreign adoptions from mother-and-baby homes, of the kind depicted in Resistance, did not begin until the 1940s. Chris Wasser of the Irish Independent awarded the first episode three stars, saying \\"What we have here is a reasonably capable and competent drama that, though rough around the edges, suggests we may be in for a stronger and tighter run than last time. [‚Ä¶] It isn‚Äôt nearly as vital or as thrilling as it needs to be, and Catherine Morshead‚Äôs flat direction doesn‚Äôt help. But there is something here.\\" Website IrishCentral was more positive, saying \\"The first episode of Resistance is deliciously plotted with loyalty, betrayal, irony, but most of all, the bravery of ordinary Dubliners taking on the greatest intelligence service in the world and, as history tells us, eventually winning. Resistance is not to be missed.\\" References External links * Category:2019 Irish television series debuts Category:2019 Irish television series endings Category:RT√â original programming Category:Irish television miniseries Category:Television shows set in Dublin (city) Category:Television shows set in Ireland Category:Television series set in the 1920s Category:Cultural depictions of Michael Collins (Irish leader) Category:Works about the Irish War of Independence ","title":"Resistance (miniseries)"},{"id":"59637770","text":"ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá may refer to: *ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá (basketball) (born 1980), Serbian basketballer *ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá (footballer) (born 1999), Serbian footballer *ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá (sculptor) (born 1861), Serbian sculptor **ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá House (born 1861), ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá (sculptor) house ","title":"ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá"},{"id":"59637779","text":"Gilfedder is a surname.

She is the founder of the National Directorate of the Popular Women's Organization (; OFP), an entity created in 1972 in the Diocese's Pastoral Ministry, which in 1988 became an autonomous organization based in Barrancabermeja to support women in peaceful resistance against violence and defend peaceful dialogue. She is currently putting her efforts into establishing entities for women such as the construction of a Museum of Memory and Human Rights for Women. During more than four decades in defense of women victims of the conflict in Barrancabermeja and Magdalena Medio, she has suffered persecution and siege by paramilitary groups and has been threatened with death on several occasions. The Office of the Attorney General itself denounced the plan of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia to assassinate her. The Popular Women's Organization and other social groups that opposed the violence were declared military targets and obligated to take forceful protection measures. Biography Yolanda Becerra is the oldest of seven siblings and belongs to a working-class family from the northeastern part of Barrancabermeja. Her father Gustavo Becerra died when she was 17 years old. Her social conscience began to develop at Camilo Torres School, and she became part of the student movement and the literacy initiatives of Se√±or de los Milagros parish. At age 20, when she finished high school, she began working as secretary of the parish of the northeastern sector of her hometown, and two years later she began to work in the Diocese's Social Pastoral Ministry, an environment especially influenced by liberation theology, and began on her path into the OFP. Becerra explained in an interview that she did not understand why women had to organize separately when strong social movements already existed. \\"It seemed like a waste and I had a big tantrum. Later I understood why it was important to have a women's organization,\\" she said. Popular Women's Organization In 1988 Yolanda Becerra and Rosalba Meri√±o committed themselves to the autonomy of the OFP with regard to the Pastoral Ministry. On 23 December 2000, paramilitaries entered the city and imposed their law on the civilian population. It was then that the OFP adopted a position of resistance in the defense of civil and political rights and sought national and international support. Several of its members have been killed: Esperanza Amaris in October 2003, Diafanol Sierra Vargas in 2002, and Yamile Agudelo was tortured and murdered in March 2006. Yolanda Becerra herself was attacked, threatened, and tortured in her own home in 2007. In 2005, Yolanda Becerra was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize along with 1,000 other women from 155 countries. In 2007 shortly after the Swedish government's announcement that she was being awarded the Per Anger Prize, she suffered an attack in her own home. Years later, Becerra continues to fight to defend dialogue and peace.

McGowan predominantly worked in Heard Island, off the coast of Antarctica and Tasmania,  Cultural heritage archaeology and advocacy  McGowan has spent over thirty years working in Tasmania in the cultural heritage management sector. More specifically for Heritage Tasmania, the Parks and Wildlife Service, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and in private practice. She joined the Executive Committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) in February 2010, having previously served on the Tasmanian Heritage Council and is also a member of the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology, the National Trust of Australia (TAS) and Cultural Heritage Practitioners of Tasmania. She has spoken directly to the gaps in legislation regarding consultation, involvement, and representation of aboriginal communities. Her paper titled ‚ÄúBackground to Changing Cultural Heritage Legislation in Tasmania‚Äù clearly and methodically covers the National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1970, Aboriginal Relics Act of 1975, and the Forestry Act of 1920, to name a few, revealing the imbalance in representation on each committee. McGowan brings to our attention that out of the twelve members under the National Parks and Wildlife Act only one representative is allocated historic structures, history, and anthropology while others are natural science based, and out of five on the Aboriginal Relics Advisory Council one member was a representative of Aboriginal interests while the rest were academic.  Select archaeological investigations of Tasmania  = Risdon Cove (1978-1980) = Risdon Cove, Tasmania is historically recognized as the initial site of Hobart, the capital of Tasmania. Risdon Cove was established as a military base of the New South Wales military forces in September 1803, in order to prevent French explorers and militant forces from gaining access to settlement on Tasmania. This site is primarily remembered for the massacre of aboriginal people on 3 May 1804 by British forces. Risdon Cove was abandoned in July 1804. Angela Gowan excavated the site of Risdon Cove. After the abandonment of the site, the area had remained in its pre- industrialized state when McGowan conducted the excavations. McGowan discovered twenty-nine archaeological features on the site, but she determined there to be only six key features dating back to the initial settlement of 1803. Features made out of stone were the only ones structurally sound enough to last two hundred years. The six key features are as follows: \\"the storehouse, the storekeeper's house, the Governor's new house, Mountgarrett's house, a hut platform, and an enclosed clearing\\". Of the six items determined to be dated back to 1803, the storehouse, the Governor's new house, and the Mountgarett's house provide the most information on the building patterns and culture of the first settlement. The storehouse was an essential part of the initial settlement, because it displayed an intention of residing on the settlement for an extended amount of time. The Governor's new house, due to the high status of Lieutenant John Bowen, was intended to be the \\"largest and most dominant building of the settlement.\\" McGowan's excavation revealed the house to have never been completed. In terms of the Mountgarett's house, McGowan determined the house to built for the naval surgeon, and it was the first residential building to have been built on the settlement. = Denison River Valley (1989) = This was a long-term study done into human activity during the late Pleistocene era in the Denison River Valley. McGowan, along with a team of other archaeologists, was able to find 23 different rock shelters across the valley. In order to determine if humans had once lived in these rock shelters, the team would look on the walls for paintings and the floors for artifacts. If nothing was discovered then they would create speed pits, which are holes dug into the ground that are less than 15 cm wide. Six of these rock shelters, as well as one location in the open, showed evidence of human activity. Two of these sites were excavated in detail to determine the extent of human activity. In total from all of these sites, they found 218 artifacts that are greater than 0.5 cm in size. This provided extensive information about stone artifact technology and how it related to human activity throughout the late Pleistocene era.  Survey of Sealing Sites on Heard Island (1986-1987)  One excavation that Angela McGowan has worked on are the sealer sites on Heard Island. She worked on this site in 1986 and 1987. The main reason that she wanted to shine a spotlight here is because the archaeological information at this site is being threatened by the wildlife and erosion of the coastline. This site gives a very unique perspective into the lives of European sealers in the 19th century and so she wanted to save all of this information. She excavated the sites that were the most damaged sites first so that they could get the most amount of data as possible.  Kerry Lodge Convict site (2015-2018)  The Kerry Lodge Convict project is located near Laucenston, Tasmania and is the site of a 19th century British penal colony. McGowan was part of a small team made up of archaeologists, surveyors, and curators who invested time uncovering details of the relatively unknown site, their interests lay in the archaeology of incarceration and unfree labor. The main focus of the project is to excavate and analyze the \\"remains of a collapsed stone structure associated with the convict probation station.\\"  Further publications  * Archaeological investigations at Risdon Cove Historic Site: 1978-1980 * Excavations at Lithend, Port Arthur Historic Site * Photogrammetric recording of Aboriginal Paintings in Keyhole Cavern * Report of Radiocarbon Dating Analyses  References  Category:Australian archaeologists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women archaeologists Category:20th-century Australian non- fiction writers Category:20th-century Australian women writers ","title":"Angela McGowan"},{"id":"59638145","text":"Oscar T√∂rn√•, from the Svenskt Portr√§ttgalleri XX Summer Landscape in Ljuster√∂ (1892) Summer Landscape near Fontainebleau (1876) Oscar Emil T√∂rn√• (18 October 1842 - 3 June 1894) was a Swedish landscape painter, illustrator and graphic artist.  Biography  T√∂rn√• was born at K√§ttilstads Parish in √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden. Of French ancestry, he was the son of Gudmund Teurneau and Anna Maja Persdotter. He began receiving an education in the trades when he was fourteen, but eventually displayed an aptitude for art. Thanks to the support of some well-to-do neighbors, he was able to enroll at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and participated in the Academy's exhibition of 1868. He was awarded a medal in 1870 for one of his first landscape paintings. Impatient to receive a travel scholarship, he took off on his own in 1873 and went to D√ºsseldorf, but was not pleased with their teaching methods and later felt that he had wasted his time there. Finally, in 1874, he obtained a trave scholarship and went to Paris via Brussels. His feelings about his studies in Germany were confirmed when he visited the Salon and was exposed to the more Naturalistic styles prevalent there.Nationalmuseum During his first summer in France, he lived in Montigny-sur-Loing and Marlotte, painting forest and river scenes. In 1877, he exhibited two landscape paintings at the Salon and they received praise from the critic, Louis Edmond Duranty. One was purchased by Adolphe Goupil. He made further painting trips to Marlotte, Nemours and Grez, but his showing at the 1878 Salon was not as successful. Upon returning to Sweden, he immediately organized an exhibition. This time, he made an impression, as most Swedish landscape painters were still making sketches outdoors and completing their paintings in their studios, rather than working en plein aire. Several of his works were purchased by the Royal Academy to be used for study material in their landscape classes. The Stockholm archipelago, S√∂dermanland and √ñsterg√∂tland were his favorite places to paint. In 1885, he joined a group known as the opponents (Opponenterna) which was protesting what they felt were the outmoded methods of teaching at the Royal Academy. However, after participating in one of their exhibitions, he left the group because he felt it was counterproductive. By the late 1880s, a combination of ill-health and resistance to new methods or styles eventually reduced the quality of his workmanship. He died at Stockholm during 1894 and was buried at Solna Church. Small selections of his work may be seen at the G√∂teborgs konstmuseumG√∂teborgs konstmuseum,Nationalmuseum and the Nordiska museet.

The process and results of the 20 May 2018 presidential election were widely disputed. The opposition-majority National Assembly declared Maduro a \\"usurper\\" of the presidency on the day of his second inauguration and disclosed a plan to set forth its president Guaid√≥ as the succeeding acting president of the country under article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution. A week later, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice declared that the presidency of the National Assembly was the \\"usurper\\" of authority and declared the body to be unconstitutional. Minutes after Maduro took the oath as president, the Organization of American States (OAS) approved a resolution in a special session of its Permanent Council declaring Maduro's presidency illegitimate and urging new elections. Special meetings of the OAS on 24 January and in the United Nations Security Council on 26 January were held but no consensus was reached. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres called for dialogue. During the 49th General Assembly of the Organization of American States, on 27 June, Guaid√≥'s presidency was recognized by the organization. Guaid√≥ declared himself acting president and swore himself in on 23 January. Maduro's government has accused the United States of organizing a coup d'√©tat to remove him and take control of the country's oil reserves. Guaid√≥ rejects the characterization of his actions as a coup, saying that his movement is backed by peaceful volunteers. Guaid√≥ has been recognized as legitimate by about 60 countries; Maduro by about 20 countries. Internationally, support has followed traditional geopolitical lines, with allies China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey supporting Maduro; while the majority of Western and Latin American countries support Guaid√≥ as acting president. Support for Guaid√≥ has declined since a failed military uprising attempt in April 2019. As of January 2020, efforts led by Guaid√≥ to create a transitional government have been described as unsuccessful by various analysts and media networks, with Maduro continuing to control Venezuela's state institutions. On 5 January 2020, the National Assembly Delegated Committee election resulted in claimed victories by both Guaido and legislator Luis Parra as the president of National Assembly, starting another crisis in the legislative body, in addition to the presidential crisis.  Background  Since 2010, Venezuela has been suffering a socioeconomic crisis under Nicol√°s Maduro (and briefly under his predecessor, Hugo Ch√°vez), as rampant crime, hyperinflation and shortages diminish the quality of life.  * As a result of discontent with the government, the opposition was elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 parliamentary election. After the election, the lame duck National Assembly‚Äîconsisting of Bolivarian officials‚Äîfilled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the highest court in Venezuela, with Maduro allies. The tribunal stripped three opposition lawmakers of their National Assembly seats in early 2016, citing alleged \\"irregularities\\" in their elections, thereby preventing an opposition supermajority which would have been able to challenge President Maduro. In January 2016, the National Assembly declared a \\"health humanitarian crisis\\" given the \\"serious shortage of medicines, medical supplies and deterioration of humanitarian infrastructure\\", asking Maduro's government to \\"guarantee immediate access to the list of essential medicines that are basic and indispensable and that must be accessible at all times\\". The tribunal approved several actions by Maduro and granted him more powers in 2017. As protests mounted against Maduro, he called for a constituent assembly that would draft a new constitution to replace the 1999 Venezuela Constitution created under Ch√°vez. Many countries considered these actions a bid by Maduro to stay in power indefinitely, and over 40 countries stated that they would not recognize the 2017 Constituent National Assembly (ANC). The Democratic Unity Roundtable--the opposition to the incumbent ruling party --boycotted the election, saying that the ANC was \\"a trick to keep [the incumbent ruling party] in power\\". Since the opposition did not participate in the election, the Great Patriotic Pole coalition and its supporters, including the incumbent United Socialist Party of Venezuela, won all seats in the assembly by default. On 8 August 2017, the ANC declared itself to be the government branch with supreme power in Venezuela, banning the opposition-led National Assembly from performing actions that would interfere with the assembly while continuing to pass measures in \\"support and solidarity\\" with President Maduro, effectively stripping the National Assembly of all its powers. Maduro disavowed the National Assembly in 2017; as of 2018, some considered the National Assembly the only \\"legitimate\\" institution left in the country, and human rights organizations said there were no independent institutional checks on presidential power. = 2018 election and calls for transitional government = In February 2018, Maduro called for presidential elections four months before the prescribed date. He was declared the winner in May 2018 after multiple major opposition parties were banned from participating, among other irregularities; many said the elections were invalid.  Some politicians both internally and internationally said Maduro was not legitimately elected, and considered him an ineffective dictator. In the months leading up to his 10 January 2019 inauguration, Maduro was pressured to step down by nations and bodies including the Lima Group (excluding Mexico), the United States, and the OAS; this pressure was increased after the new National Assembly of Venezuela was sworn in on 5 January 2019. * Between the May 2018 presidential election and Maduro's inauguration, there were calls to establish a transitional government. In December 2018, Guaid√≥ had traveled to Washington D.C. and met with OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, and then on 14 January 2019 to Colombia for a Lima Group meeting, in which Maduro's mandate was rejected. According to an article in El Pa√≠s, the January Lima Group meeting and the stance taken by Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland were key. El Pa√≠s describes Donald Trump's election‚Äîcoinciding with the election of conservative presidents in Colombia and Brazil, along with deteriorating conditions in Venezuela‚Äîas \\"a perfect storm\\", with decisions influenced by U.S. officials including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton, and legislators Mario D√≠az-Balart and Marco Rubio. Venezuelans Carlos Vecchio, Julio Borges and Gustavo Tarre were consulted, and the Trump administration decision to back Guaid√≥ formed on 22 January, according to El Pa√≠s. D√≠az-Balart said that the decision was the result of two years of planning. = Justification for the challenge = United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein discussing the crisis in Venezuela The Venezuelan opposition says its actions are based on the 1999 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, specifically Articles 233, 333 and 350. The first paragraph of Article 233 states: \\"when the president-elect is absolutely absent before taking office, a new election shall take place (...) And while the president is elected and takes office, the interim president shall be the president of the National Assembly\\". Article 333 calls for citizens to restore and enforce the Constitution if it is not followed. Article 350 calls for citizens to \\"disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights‚Äù. Article 233 was invoked after the death of Hugo Ch√°vez in 2013, which took place soon after his inauguration, and extraordinary elections were called within thirty days. Invoked by the National Assembly, Guaid√≥ was declared acting president until elections could be held; Diego A. Zambrano, an assistant professor of law at Stanford Law School, says that \\"Venezuelan lawyers disagree on the best reading of this provision. Some argue Guaid√≥ can serve longer if the electoral process is scheduled within a reasonable time\\". The National Assembly announced that it will designate a committee to appoint a new National Electoral Council, in anticipation of free elections.  2019 events  = Inauguration of Maduro = Presidents of Cuba, Bolivia and El Salvador greet Maduro at Maduro's second inauguration on 10 January 2019 Signs of impending crisis showed when a Supreme Court Justice and Electoral Justice seen as close to Maduro defected to the United States just a few days before the 10 January 2019 second inauguration of Nicol√°s Maduro. The justice, , said that Maduro was \\"incompetent\\" and \\"illegitimate\\". Minutes after Maduro took the oath as president of Venezuela, the OAS approved a resolution in a special session of its Permanent Council declaring Maduro's presidency illegitimate and urging new elections. Maduro's election was supported by Turkey, Russia, China, and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA). Juan Guaid√≥ surrounded by members of the opposition during the public assembly on 11 January 2019 Juan Guaid√≥, the newly appointed president of the National Assembly of Venezuela, began motions to form a provisional government shortly after assuming his new role on 5 January 2019, stating that whether or not Maduro began his new term on the 10th, the country would not have a legitimately elected president in either case. On behalf of the National Assembly, he stated that the country had fallen into a de facto dictatorship and had no leader, declaring that the nation faced a state of emergency. He called for \\"soldiers who wear their uniforms with honor to step forward and enforce the Constitution\\", and asked \\"citizens for confidence, strength, and to accompany us on this path\\". Guaid√≥ announced a public assembly, referred to as an open cabildo, on 11 January‚Äîa rally in the streets of Caracas, where the National Assembly announced that Guaid√≥ was assuming the role of the acting president under the Constitution of Venezuela and announcing plans to remove Maduro. Leaders of other political parties, trade unions, women, and the students of Venezuela were given a voice at the rally; other parties did not speak of a divide, but of what they saw as a failed Bolivarian Revolution that needed to end. Maduro's response was to call the opposition a group of \\"little boys\\", describing Guaid√≥ as \\"immature\\". The Minister for Prison Services, Iris Varela, threatened that she had picked out a prison cell for Guaid√≥ and asked him to be quick in naming his cabinet so she could prepare prison cells for them as well. On 21 January, over two dozen National Guardsmen participated in a mutiny against Maduro with the assistance of residents in the area during the early morning hours. Government forces repressed the protestors tear gas and the officers were later captured. During the night, over thirty communities in Caracas and surrounding areas participated in strong protests against the Maduro government. The strongest protests occurred in San Jos√© de Cotiza, where the rebel National Guardsmen were arrested, with demonstrations spreading throughout nearby communities, with cacerolazos heard throughout Caracas. One woman who was confused for a protester was killed in San Jos√© de Cotiza by members of a colectivo, who stole her phone. = Guaid√≥ declared acting president = Agreement approved by the National Assembly to declare the usurpation of the presidency by Nicol√°s Maduro on 15 January 2019. Following Guaid√≥'s speech, the National Assembly released a press statement saying that Guaid√≥ had assumed the role of acting president. A later statement clarified the position of Guaid√≥ as \\"willing to assume command ... only possible with the help of Venezuelans\\". The opposition considered this legitimate based on the acknowledged \\"illegitimacy\\" of Maduro by many governments, and the constitutional processes that the National Assembly said they were following, specifically invoking Articles 233, 333, and 350 of the Constitution. The president of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile, based in Panama, wrote to Guaid√≥, requesting him to become acting president of Venezuela. On 15 January 2019, the National Assembly approved legislation to work with dozens of foreign countries to request that these nations freeze Maduro administration bank accounts. Guaid√≥ wrote a 15 January 2019 opinion piece in The Washington Post entitled \\"Maduro is a usurper. It's time to restore democracy in Venezuela\\"; he outlined Venezuela's erosion of democracy and his reasoning for the need to replace Maduro on an interim basis according to Venezuela's constitution. Guaid√≥ announced nationwide protests to be held on 23 January‚Äîthe same day as the removal of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez in 1958‚Äîusing a slogan chant of ¬°S√≠ se puede!. The National Assembly worked with the coalition Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre to create a plan for the demonstrations, organizing a unified national force. On 11 January, plans to offer incentives for the armed forces to disavow Maduro were announced. OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro was the first to give official support to this action, tweeting \\"We welcome the assumption of Juan Guaid√≥ as interim president of Venezuela in accordance with Article 233 of the Political Constitution. You have our support, that of the international community and of the people of Venezuela.\\" Later that day, Brazil and Colombia gave their support to Guaid√≥ as acting president of Venezuela. Guaid√≥ was detained on 13 January by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and released 45 minutes later. The SEBIN agents who intercepted his car and took him into custody were fired. The Information Minister, Jorge Rodr√≠guez, said the agents did not have instructions and the arrest was orchestrated by Guaid√≥ as a \\"media stunt\\" to gain popularity; BBC News correspondents said that it appeared to be a genuine ambush to send a message to the opposition. Almagro condemned the arrest, which he called a \\"kidnapping\\", while Pompeo referred to it as an \\"arbitrary detention\\". After his detention, Guaid√≥ said that Rodr√≠guez's admission that the SEBIN agents acted independently showed that the government had lost control of its security forces; he called Miraflores (the presidential palace) \\"desperate\\", and stated: \\"There is one legitimate president of the National Assembly and of all Venezuela.\\"  Guaid√≥ swears oath as acting president  23 January 2019 march in Caracas On 23 January, Guaid√≥ swore to serve as acting president. On that morning, Guaid√≥ tweeted, \\"The world's eyes are on our homeland today.\\" On that day, millions of Venezuelans demonstrated across the country and world in support of Guaid√≥, with a few hundred supporting Maduro outside Miraflores. At one end of the blocked street was a stage where Guaid√≥ spoke and took an oath to serve as interim president. The Venezuelan National Guard used tear gas on gathering crowds at other locations, and blocked protesters from arriving. Some protests grew violent, and at least 13 people were killed. Michelle Bachelet of the United Nations requested a UN investigation into the security forces' use of violence. Mike Pence meets with Carlos Vecchio, Julio Borges, and other Washington-based Venezuelan representatives on 29 January 2019 Guaid√≥ began to appoint individuals in late January to serve as aides or diplomats, including Carlos Vecchio as the Guaid√≥ administration's diplomatic envoy to the US, Gustavo Tarre to the OAS, and Julio Borges to represent Venezuela in the Lima Group. He announced that the National Assembly had approved a commission to implement a plan for the reconstruction of Venezuela, called Plan Pa√≠s (Plan for the Country), and he offered an Amnesty law, approved by the National Assembly, for military personnel and authorities who help to \\"restore constitutional order\\". The Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy was approved by the National Assembly on 5 February.  Maduro response  Maduro accused the US of backing a coup and said he would cut ties with them. He said Guaid√≥'s actions were part of a \\"well-written script from Washington\\" to create a puppet state of the United States, and appealed to the American people in a 31 January video, asking them not to \\"convert Venezuela into another Vietnam\\". Maduro asked for dialogue with Guaid√≥, saying \\"if I have to go meet this boy in the Pico Humboldt at three in the morning I am going, [...] if I have to go naked, I am going, [I believe] that today, sooner rather than later, the way is open for a reasonable, sincere dialogue\\". He stated he would not leave the presidential office, saying that he was elected in compliance with the Venezuelan constitution. With the two giving speeches to supporters at the same time, Guaid√≥ replied to Maduro's call for dialogue, saying he would not initiate diplomatic talks with Maduro because he believed it would be a farce and fake diplomacy that could not achieve anything. On 18 February, Maduro's government expelled a group of Members of the European Parliament that planned to meet Guaid√≥. The expulsion was condemned by Guaid√≥ as well as Pablo Casado, president of the Spanish People's Party, and the Colombian government. Maduro's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza defended the expulsions, saying that the constitutional government of Venezuela \\"will not allow the European extreme right to disturb the peace and stability of the country with another of its gross interventionist actions.\\" = Humanitarian aid crisis = Shortages in Venezuela have been present since 2007 during the presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez. In 2016, the National Assembly of Venezuela declared a humanitarian crisis, asking Maduro's government to provide access to essential medicines and medical supplies. Before the presidential crisis, the Maduro government denied several offers of aid, stating that there was not a humanitarian crisis and that such claims were used to justify foreign intervention.  Maduro's refusal of aid worsened the effects of Venezuela's crisis. During the presidential crisis, Maduro initially refused aid, stating that Venezuela is not a country of \\"beggars\\". Guaid√≥ made bringing humanitarian aid to the country a priority. In early February, Maduro prevented the American-sponsored aid from entering Venezuela via Colombia, and Venezuela's communications minister, Jorge Rodriguez, said there was a plot between Colombia, the CIA and exiled Venezuelan politician Julio Borges to oust Maduro. Humanitarian aid intended for Venezuela was also stockpiled on the Brazilian border, and two indigenous Pemon people were killed as they attempted to block military vehicles from entering the area, when members of armed forces loyal to Maduro fired upon them with live ammunition. Guaid√≥ issued an ultimatum to the Venezuelan Armed Forces, stating that humanitarian aid would enter Venezuela on 23 February and that the armed forces \\"will have to decide if it will be on the side of the Venezuelans and the Constitution or the usurper\\". Guaid√≥ defied the restriction imposed by the Maduro administration on him leaving Venezuela, secretly crossed the border, saying that with the help of the Venezuelan military, and appeared at the Venezuela Aid Live concert in C√∫cuta, Colombia on 22 February, also to be present for the planned delivery of humanitarian aid. Testing Maduro's authority, he was met by presidents Iv√°n Duque of Colombia, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era from Chile, and Mario Abdo Ben√≠tez from Paraguay, as well as the OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro. On 23 February, trucks with humanitarian aid attempted to enter Venezuela from Brazil and Colombia; the attempts failed, with only one truck able to deliver aid. At the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border, the caravans were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets by Venezuelan personnel. The National Guard repressed demonstrations on the Brazilian border and colectivos attacked protesters near the Colombian border, leaving at least four dead, and more than 285 injured.  Lima Group meeting and Latin American tour  Guaid√≥, Colombia president Duque, and US vice president Pence during the February 2019 Lima Group meeting in Colombia Guaid√≥ traveled from C√∫cuta to Bogot√° for a 24 February meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence, and a 25 February meeting of the Lima Group. The group urged the International Criminal Court to pursue charges of crimes against humanity for the Maduro administration's use of violence against civilians and blockade of humanitarian aid. Pence did not rule out the use of US military force. The Venezuelan government responded saying that Pence was trying to order others to take the country's assets, and saying that its basic rights were being disregarded in a campaign to unseat Maduro. Brazil's vice president said it would not permit its territory to be used to invade Venezuela, and the European Union cautioned against the use of military force. The Lima Group rejected the use of force as well. The US FAA warned pilots not to fly below 26,000 feet over Venezuela, and US military officials said they had flown reconnaissance flights off the coast of Venezuela to gather classified intelligence about Maduro. From Bogot√°, Guaid√≥ embarked on a regional tour to meet with the presidents of Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Ecuador, to discuss ways to rebuild Venezuela and defeat Maduro. Guaid√≥'s trip was approved by Venezuela's National Assembly, as required by the Constitution of Venezuela, but he faced the possibility of being imprisoned when returning to Venezuela because of the travel restriction placed upon him by the Maduro administration. * He re-entered Venezuela on 4 March, via Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport in Maiquet√≠a, and was received at the airport by diplomats and in Caracas by a crowd of supporters. German ambassador Daniel Kriener was accused of interference in internal affairs and expelled from Venezuela because of his role in helping Guaid√≥ re-enter. * =Blackouts = Guri Dam supplies 80% of Venezuela's electrical power. In March 2019, Venezuela experienced a near total electrical blackout, and lost 150,000 barrels per day in crude oil production during the blackout. Full recovery of oil production was expected to take months, but by April, Venezuela's exports were steady at a million barrels daily, \\"partially due to inventory drains\\". Experts and state-run Corpoelec (Corporaci√≥n El√©ctrica Nacional) sources attribute the electricity shortages to lack of maintenance, underinvestment, corruption and to a lack of technical expertise in the country resulting from a brain drain; and * as analyzed at * Nicol√°s Maduro's administration attributes them to sabotage. Guaid√≥ said that Venezuela's largest-ever power outage was \\"the product of the inefficiency, the incapability, the corruption of a regime that doesn't care about the lives of Venezuelans\\", Maduro's Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, called for an investigation of Guaid√≥, alleging that he had \\"sabotaged\\" the electric sector. While Maduro visited hydroelectric facilities in Ciudad Guayana on 16 March, promising to restructure the state-run power company Corpoelec, his Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez announced that Maduro would restructure his administration, asking the \\"entire executive Cabinet to put their roles up for review\\". Guaid√≥ announced he would embark on a tour of the country beginning 16 March, to organize committees for Operation Freedom with the goal to claim the presidential residence, Miraflores Palace. From the first rally in Carabobo state, he said, \\"We will be in each state of Venezuela and for each state we have visited the responsibility will be yours, the leaders, the united, [to] organize ourselves in freedom commands.\\" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) commissioner Michelle Bachelet's office sent a five-person delegation to Venezuela in March. On 20 March, Bachelet delivered a preliminary oral report before the UN Human Rights Council, in which she outlined a \\"devastating and deteriorating\\" human rights situation in Venezuela, expressed concern that sanctions would worsen the situation, and called on authorities to show a true commitment to recognizing and resolving the situation. Elvis Amoroso, Maduro's comptroller, alleged in March that Guaid√≥ had not explained how he paid for his February 2019 Latin American trip, and said Guaid√≥ would be barred from running for public office for fifteen years. The comptroller general is not a judicial body; according to constitutional lawyer Jos√© Vicente Haro, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in 2011 that an administrative body cannot disallow a public servant from running. Constitutional law expert Juan Manuel Raffalli stated that Article 65 of Venezuela's Constitution provides that such determinations may only be made by criminal courts, after judgment of criminal activity. = Red Cross aid effort = U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kimberly Breier, Juan Guaid√≥'s wife Fabiana Rosales, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams, and Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S. Carlos Vecchio, and diplomat in Washington, D.C. on 27 March 2019 Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, announced in March that the Red Cross was preparing to bring humanitarian aid to the country in April to help ease both the chronic hunger and the medical crisis. The Wall Street Journal said that the acceptance of humanitarian shipments by Maduro was his first acknowledgement that Venezuela is \\"suffering from an economic collapse\\". Also available online. Also available online. After a 9 April meeting with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Maduro indicated, for the first time, that he was prepared to accept international aid. Guaid√≥ called on Venezuelans to \\"stay vigilant to make sure incoming aid is not diverted for 'corrupt' purposes\\". Following the joint report from Human Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins in April 2019, increasing announcements from the United Nations about the scale of the humanitarian crisis, and the softening of Maduro's position on receiving aid, the ICRC tripled its budget for aid to Venezuela. The first Red Cross delivery of supplies for hospitals arrived on 16 April, offering an encouraging sign that the Maduro administration would allow more aid to enter. According to The New York Times, \\"armed pro-government paramilitaries\\" fired weapons to disrupt the first Red Cross delivery, and officials associated with Maduro's party told the Red Cross to leave. According to the Associated Press, having long denied that there was a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, Maduro positioned the delivery \\"as a necessary measure to confront punishing U.S. economic sanctions\\". Having \\"rallied the international community\\", Guaid√≥ \\"quickly claimed credit for the effort\\". = Revocation of Guaid√≥'s parliamentary immunity = Chief justice Maikel Moreno asked that the Constituent Assembly (ANC), controlled by Maduro loyalists, remove Guaid√≥'s parliamentary immunity as president of the National Assembly, moving the Maduro administration a step closer towards prosecuting Guaid√≥. Guaid√≥ supporters disagree that the Maduro-backed institutions have the authority to ban Guaid√≥ from leaving the country, and consider acts of the ANC \\"null and void\\". The Venezuelan Constitution provides that only the National Assembly can bring the president to trial by approving the legal proceeding in a \\"merit hearing\\". On 2 April, after the ANC voted to remove his parliamentary immunity, Guaid√≥ promised to continue fighting \\"Maduro‚Äôs 'cowardly, miserable and murderous' regime\\". = Military uprising attempt = Juan Guaid√≥ speaks to supporters on 30 April 2019 On 19 April, Guaid√≥ called for a \\"definite end of the usurpation\\" and the \\"largest march in history\\" on 1 May. Coinciding with his speech, NetBlocks stated that state-run CANTV again blocked access to social media in Venezuela. On 30 April 2019, Leopoldo L√≥pez‚Äîheld under house arrest by the Maduro administration‚Äîwas freed on orders from Guaid√≥. The two men, flanked by members of the Venezuelan armed forces near La Carlota Air Force Base in Caracas, announced an uprising, stating that this was the final phase of \\"Operation Freedom\\". Maduro was not seen during the day, but he appeared with his Defense Minister Padrino on that evening's televised broadcast, and announced he would replace Manuel Cristopher Figuera, Director General of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN), who had broken with Maduro during the uprising, saying it was time to \\"rebuild the country\\" and that \\"scoundrels were plundering the country\\". The United States said Maduro had prepared to leave Venezuela that morning, but Russia and Cuba helped convince him to stay. Both Russia and Maduro denied that he had plans to leave Venezuela. Guaid√≥'s supporters were forced to retreat by security forces using tear gas. Colectivos fired on protesters with live ammunition, and one protester was shot in the head and killed. Human Rights Watch \\"said it believed that security forces fired shotgun pellets at demonstrators and journalists\\". By the end of the day, one protester had died, and L√≥pez was at the Spanish embassy, while 25 military personnel sought asylum in the Brazilian embassy in Caracas. Guaid√≥ acknowledged he had received insufficient military backing, but added that \\"Maduro did not have the support nor the respect of the Armed Forces\\", and called for strikes beginning on 2 May, with the aim of a general strike later in the month. Russia and the U.S. each charged the other with interference in another country's affairs. = Negotiations = Following the failed military uprising, momentum surrounding Guaid√≥ had subsided and fewer supporters gathered at demonstrations, with Guaid√≥ resorting to negotiations with Maduro. Guaid√≥'s deputy chief Rafael Del Rosario acknowledged that the debacle on 30 April made the prospect of removing Maduro more difficult. Beginning negotiations was a setback for Guaid√≥'s movement, with the Associated Press stating, \\"Participation in the mediation effort is a reversal for the opposition, which has accused Maduro of using negotiations between 2016 and 2018 to play for time\\". According to the New York Times, years of difficulties has made Maduro \\"adept at managing, if not solving, cascading crises\\", while Phil Gunson of the International Crisis Group stated that despite facing issues, Maduro \\"must be very pleased that he is now in the driving seat\\", with the ability to use the actions of Guaid√≥ and international actors for propaganda purposes. Representatives of Guaid√≥ and Maduro began mediation with the assistance of the Norwegian Centre for Conflict Resolution (NOREF), with Jorge Rodr√≠guez and H√©ctor Rodr√≠guez serving as representatives for Maduro while and Stalin Gonz√°lez were representatives for Guaid√≥. Guaid√≥ confirmed that there was an envoy in Norway, but assured that the opposition would not take part in \\"any kind of false negotiation\\" and that talks must lead to Maduro's resignation, a transitional administration and free and fair elections. In July 2019, Norway's commission carried out a third round of discussions between Guaid√≥'s and Maduro's representatives in Barbados. By August 2019, the Maduro administration decided to halt talks with Guaid√≥'s commission after Trump administration imposed new additional sanctions on Venezuela, ordering a freeze on all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and barred transactions with US citizens and companies. = Second visit of the OHCHR = Ahead of a three-week session of the UN Human Rights Council, the OHCHR chief, Michelle Bachelet, visited Venezuela from 19 to 21 June. The Human Rights Commissioner met separately with both Maduro and Guaid√≥ during her visit, as well as with Maduro's Attorney General Tarek William Saab, several human right activists, and families of victims who experienced torture and state repression. Protests occurred in front of the UN office in Caracas during the last day of the visit, denouncing rights abuses carried out by Maduro's administration. Gilber Caro, who was released two days before the visit, joined the protest. Bachelet announced the creation of a delegation maintained by two UN officials that will remain in Venezuela to monitor the humanitarian situation. Bachelet expressed concern that the recent sanctions on oil exports and gold trade could worsen the crisis that has increased since 2013, calling the measures ‚Äúextremely broad‚Äù and that they are capable of exacerbating the suffering of the Venezuelan people. She also called for the release of political prisoners in Venezuela. This was the first time a United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights visited Venezuela. The final published report addressed the extrajudicial executions, torture, forced disappearances and other human rights violations reportedly committed by Venezuelan security forces in the recent years. Bachelet expressed her concerns for the \\"shockingly high\\" number of extrajudicial killings and urged for the dissolution of the Special Action Forces (FAES). According to the report, 1,569 cases of executions as consequence as a result of \\"resistance to authority\\" were registered by the Venezuelan authorities from 1 January to 19 March. Other 52 deaths that occurred during 2019 protests were attributed to colectivos. The report also details how the Venezuelan government \\"aimed at neutralising, repressing and criminalising political opponents and people critical of the government\\" since 2016. Guaid√≥ supported the investigation, stating \\"the systematic violation of human rights, the repression, the torture... is clearly identified in the (UN) report\\". Maduro administration described the report as a \\"biased vision\\" and demanded it be \\"corrected\\". In the words of his foreign minister, \\"It‚Äôs a text lacking in scientific rigor, with serious errors in methodology and which seems like a carbon copy of previous reports\\". Maduro would later state that the OHCHR \\"has declared itself an enemy\\" to Maduro and the Bolivarian Revolution. Speaking to reporters after the UN Human Rights Council, Bachelet announced the release of 22 Venezuelan prisoners, including 20 students, judge Maria Lourdes Afiuni, in her second house arrest since March, and journalist Braulio Jatar, arrested in 2016. Bachelet welcomed the conditional releases and the acceptance of the two officers delegation as \\"the beginning of positive engagement on the country‚Äôs many human rights issues\\". In October 2019, Venezuela competed for one of the two seats to the United Nations Human Rights Council, along with Brazil and Costa Rica, and was elected with 105 votes in a secret ballot by the 193-member United Nations General Assembly. Brazil was re-elected with 153 votes, while Costa Rica was not having garnered 96 votes and entering the month of the election as competition to Venezuela. The United States, Lima Group and human rights groups lobbied against Venezuela's election. On 16 Sep. 2020, UN, In a scathing, in-depth report published on Wednesday, accuses Maduro government of crimes against humanity. = Alleged coup plot and death of Acosta Ar√©valo = On 26 June, Maduro said that his government had arrested several defecting military, thus foiling a plot to remove him from power and to assassinate him, his wife and Diosdado Cabello. The alleged plan also included the rescue of Ra√∫l Baduel, a retired general imprisoned for a second time in 2017, to install him as president. Maduro accused Israel, Colombia, Chile and the United States of involvement in the plot. Jorge Rodr√≠guez said that the foiled plan involved the bombing of a government building, the seizing of La Carlota air base, and a bank robbery. Guaid√≥ dismissed the allegations as lies; opposition members have frequently accused Maduro of coercion of arrested suspects and fabrication of plots for political gain. In the wake of the coup allegations, an alleged kidnapping attempt directed at members of Guaid√≥'s entourage occurred on a Caracas highway. Eight armed men on motorcycles dressed as civilians allegedly surrounded a vehicle containing two of Guaid√≥'s aides. Guaid√≥, who was in a car further ahead, spoke with the armed civilians, according to photos and a video released by his press team and published by Infobae. According to Guaid√≥, the group received orders from the Venezuelan Military Counter-intelligence agency DGCIM, but were not \\"hostile\\". Navy captain Rafael Acosta Ar√©valo, who had been arrested on charges related to the alleged foiled coup attempt and transferred to a military hospital, died during detention on 28 June. Maduro administration did not provide a cause of death but announced an investigation on the matter. Acosta Arevalo's wife, human rights advocates, Juan Guaid√≥ and the US Department of State accused Maduro's administration of torturing the captain to death. The Lima Group and the European Union called for an independent investigation. The preliminary autopsy determined that Acosta Ar√©valo's cause of death was \\"severe cerebral edema [brain swelling] caused by acute respiratory failure caused by a pulmonary embolism caused by rhabdomyolysis [a potentially life-threatening breakdown of muscle fibers] by multiple trauma\\". = Guaid√≥ loses support and Operaci√≥n Alacr√°n= By the end of 2019, support for Guaid√≥ dropped, with protests organized by his movement resulting with low participation. Pollster Datan√°lisis published figures showing that support for Guaid√≥ decreased from 61% in February to 42% in November 2019. According to Jes√∫s Segu√≠as, the head of the Venezuelan analysis firm Datincorp, \\"For years Washington and the Venezuelan opposition have said that Nicol√°s Maduro, and before him Hugo Ch√°vez, were weak and about to fall ... but it‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs not the case\\". Analyst Carlos Pina stated \\"The military support to President Maduro remains intact ... the opposition will need to rethink its strategy\\" and that \\"Guaido has also been very limited in suggesting or proposing a strategy that could change the current [status quo]\\". An investigation led by Armando.info reported that nine members of the National Assembly defended individuals sanctioned by the United States for their involvement in the controversial Local Committees for Supply and Production (CLAP) program. The investigation reported that the implicated lawmakers had written letters of support to the United States Treasury and others to a Colombian man named Carlos Lizcano, who authorities were investigating over his possible links to Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman associated with the food distribution program and under United States sanctions. According to Armando.info, the lawmakers wrote the letters despite being aware of evidence that tied Lizcano to Saab. Guaid√≥ condemned the actions of the nine legislators, suspending them from their positions and stating that it was \\"unacceptable to use a state institution to attempt to whitewash the reputation of thieves\\". The scandal damaged Guaid√≥'s reputation among his supporters in Venezuela, with some members of the opposition beginning to call for new leadership, according to analysts and those involved. Into December 2019, Venezuelan pollster Megan√°lisis surveys showed that 10% of respondents approved of Guaid√≥, compared to 9% who supported Maduro. In a 4 December 2019 interview with Vox, Guaid√≥ stated \\"We sense a firm commitment from the United States. ... I think they‚Äôre doing everything they could be doing under these circumstances, as are Colombia and Brazil.\\" When asked if he was nearer from removing Maduro from power than in January 2019, Guaid√≥ replied \\"Absolutely. Back then we didn‚Äôt have multiple countries recognizing and supporting us. ... Today, we have way more tools at our disposal than we did one year ago\\". Bloomberg reported two days later that the Trump administration began to doubt that an opposition led by Guaid√≥ would remove Maduro from office. The United States reportedly had no military option regarding Venezuela, though it began to debate on whether to partner with Russia to encourage Maduro to leave office or to increase pressure on Cuba, which is the Maduro government's main supporter. As support for Guaid√≥ decreased, the Maduro government increased its pressure by allegedly \\"deploying bribes, intimidation and repression\\", according to The Washington Post, attempting to divide the opposition to maintain power. = Economy rebounds = Following increased sanctions throughout 2019, the Maduro government abandoned policies established by Ch√°vez such as price and currency controls which resulted in the country seeing a rebound from economic decline. In a November 2019 interview with Jos√© Vicente Rangel, President Maduro described dollarization as an \\"escape valve\\" that helps the recovery of the country, the spread of productive forces in the country and the economy. However, Maduro said that the Venezuelan bol√≠var would still remain as the national currency. The Economist wrote that Venezuela had also obtained \\"extra money from selling gold, both from illegal mines and from its reserves, and narcotics\\". Its article continues to explain that the improving economy led to more difficulties for Guaid√≥ as Venezuelans who had a better situation were less likely to protest against Maduro.  2020 events  =Internal parliamentary election disrupted = The 2020 Venezuelan National Assembly Delegated Committee election of 5 January, to elect the Board of Directors of the National Assembly was disrupted. The events resulted in two competing claims for the Presidency of the National Assembly: one by Luis Parra and one by Juan Guaid√≥. Parra was formerly a member of Justice First, but was expelled from the party on 20 December 2019 based on the Operaci√≥n Alacr√°n corruption allegations, which he denied. From inside the legislature, Parra declared himself president of the National Assembly, a move that was welcomed by the Maduro administration. The opposition disputed this outcome, saying that quorum had not been achieved and that no votes were counted. Police forces had blocked access to parliament to some opposition members, including Guaid√≥ and journalists. Later in the day, a separate session was carried out at the headquarters of El Nacional newspaper, where 100 of the 167 deputies voted to re-elect Guaid√≥ as president of the parliament. Guaid√≥ was sworn in a session on 7 January after forcing his way in through police barricades. On the same day, Parra reiterated his claim to the parliament's presidency. Russia is the only foreign government to have officially recognized Luis Parra's investiture, while the European Union, the United States, Canada, and most Latin American countries recognized Guaido's re-election. = Guaid√≥ second international tour = On 19 January, Guaid√≥ once again exited Venezuela and arrived in Colombia, planning to meet with Mike Pompeo, as well as traveling to Europe and the United States later, defying his exit prohibition for a second time. Guaid√≥ travelled to Brussels, Belgium, and on 22 January met with Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the European Commission, and Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs. On 23 January, Guaid√≥ participated in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. During his trip in Europe, Guaid√≥ also met with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, and Angela Merkel. Afterwards, Guaid√≥ travelled to Canada and met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On February 4, he was invited to President Donald Trump's 2020 State of the Union address to Congress, and was applauded by the crowd, which was composed of members of both Democratic and Republican parties. Diosdado Cabello declared that \\"nothing\\" would happen to Guaid√≥ when he returned to Venezuela. After meeting with Donald Trump in the White House, Constituent Assembly member Pedro Carre√±o said that if Guaid√≥ wanted to come back as \\"commander-in-chief\\", \\"we will receive him with this peinilla\\", hitting his podium with a machete. Guaid√≥ was allowed back into Venezuela by officials through Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport on 12 February, despite the travel ban imposed by Maduro's government. Security forces installed an anti-aircraft gun in the Caracas-La Guaira highway and blocked the highway; opposition deputies had to reach the airport on foot to receive Guaid√≥. Due to the block, several ambassadors were also unable to go to the airport. Upon Guaid√≥'s arrival at the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport, around two hundred Maduro supporters surrounded and jostled Guaid√≥, his wife Fabiana Rosales and several opposition deputies that waited for him at the airport. Some journalists were also attacked and had their equipment stolen by the group. Tens of military and police officials were present and did not intervene to prevent the attack. Several passengers declared to local outlets that Maduro's administration sent a group of pro-government activists to insult and harass the opposition members with impunity, including employees of the recently sanctioned Conviasa airline. The Inter American Press Association condemned the attacks on the journalists. The following day, the opposition and relatives denounced that Guaid√≥'s uncle, Juan Jos√© M√°rquez, had been missing for 24 hours after receiving his nephew in the airport, blaming Maduro's government. His wife declared that M√°rquez was detained in the migration area and that his whereabouts were unknown. Afterwards, in his television talk show Con El Mazo Dando, Diosdado Cabello accused M√°rquez of carrying explosives when he landed in Venezuela. Hours later, a court formalized M√°rquez's detention, copying Cabello's accusations. M√°rquez was detained in the Caracas headquarters of the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence, despite him being a civilian. = COVID-19 pandemic, transitional government proposals and US Department of Justice indictment = The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Venezuela on 13 March, when the Maduro administration announced the first two cases. On 16 March, Maduro reversed the country's official position against the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking the institution for US$5 billion to combat the pandemic, a first during Maduro's presidency, being a critic of the institution. The IMF rejected the deal as it was not clear, among its member states, on who it recognizes as Venezuela's president. According to a report by Bloomberg, the Maduro administration also tried to request aid of $1 billion from the IMF after the first request was denied. Guaid√≥ called for the creation of a \\"national emergency government\\", not lead by Maduro, on 28 March. According to Guaid√≥, a loan of US$1.2 billion was ready to be given in support of a power-sharing coalition between pro-Maduro officials, the military and the opposition in order to fight the pandemic in Venezuela. If accepted, the money would go to assist families affected by the disease and its economic consequences. The \\"Corrupt Venezuelan Regime\\" according to the United States Department of Justice The U.S. Department of State, on 26 March, offered $15 million on Nicol√°s Maduro, and $10 million each on Diosdado Cabello, Hugo Carvajal, Cl√≠ver Alcal√° Cordones and Tareck El Aissami, for information leading to their arrest in relation to charges of drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. Maduro had been offering to hold talks with the opposition about handling the outbreak in the country shortly before the indictment and then called them off. After being indicted, retired general Cl√≠ver Alcal√° in Colombia published a video claiming responsibility for a stockpile of weapons and military equipment seized in Colombia. According to Alcal√°, he had made a contract with Guaid√≥ and \\"American advisers\\" in order to buy weapons to remove Maduro. Alcal√° did not present any evidence and Guaid√≥ rejected the allegations. After wishing farewell to his family, Alcal√° surrendered to US authorities on 27 March. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on 31 March that sanctions did not apply to humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela and that the United States would lift all sanctions if Maduro agreed to organize elections that did not include himself in a period of six to twelve months. Pompeo reiterated U.S. support for Juan Guaid√≥. The United States proposed a transitional government that would exclude both Maduro and Guaid√≥ from the presidency. The deal would enforce a power-sharing scenario between the different government factions. Elections would have to be held within the year, and all foreign militaries, particularly Cuba and Russia, would have to leave the country. The US were still seeking Maduro's arrest at the time of the announcement. Other aspects of the US deal would include releasing all political prisoners and setting up a five-person council to lead the country; two members each chosen by Maduro and Guaid√≥ would sit on the council, with the last member selected by the four. The European Union also agreed to remove sanctions if the deal went ahead. Experts have noted that the deal is similar to earlier proposals but explicitly mentions who would lead a transitional government, something which stalled previous discussions, and comes shortly after the US indicted Maduro, which might pressure him to peacefully leave power. Guaid√≥ accepted the proposal, while Venezuela's foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, rejected it and declared that only parliamentary elections would take place in 2020. Arreaza said that \\"decisions about Venezuela would be made in Caracas and not in Washington or other capitals\\" and that \\"the most important transition for Venezuela was the one started many years ago from capitalism to socialism.\\" After various members of Guaid√≥'s team were arrested on 30 March, Guaid√≥ denounced a new wave of attacks against him. Following that, Attorney General Tarek William Saab called Juan Guaid√≥ to appear before the Public Ministry on 2 April based on Alcal√°'s accusations. Guaid√≥ did not accept to appear before the public prosecutor. The day of the citation, two more members of Guaid√≥'s office were arrested, charged for alleged \\"attempted coup d'etat\\" and \\"magnicide.\\" Guaid√≥'s team reported that \\"With this new assault by the dictatorship, there are now 10 [of its] members that have been detained by security forces. Five of them in the last 72 hours.\\" Reuters reported that during the pandemic, allies of both Nicol√°s Maduro and Juan Guaid√≥ had secretly begun exploratory talks, according to sources on both sides. Guaid√≥ and U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams have denied that negotiations have taken place. The Associated Press reported that the National Assembly agreed to establish a monthly $5,000 salary for the lawmakers funded from an $80 million ‚ÄúLiberation Fund‚Äù made up of Venezuelan assets seized by the Trump administration. Guaid√≥‚Äôs communications team issued a statement denying that such salary had been approved, saying that lawmakers have gone unpaid since Maduro cut off funding after the opposition won the legislature in 2015 and that the deputies would determine an appropriate, as well as communicating it transparently. It also said that the $14 million in funding destined for the National Assembly would cover not only the deputies' personal income, but also office expenses, staff costs, travel and other related legislative expenses. =Operation Gideon= Eight former Venezuelan soldiers were killed and seventeen rebels were captured on 3 May, including two American security contractors, after approximately 60 men landed in Macuto and tried to invade Venezuela. The members of the naval attack force were employed as private military contractors by Silvercorp USA and the operation aimed to depose Maduro from power.  Recognition, reactions, and public opinion  thumb350pxNations recognizing presidential legitimacy as of March 2020: alt= As of November 2019, Guaid√≥ is recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by 57 countries, \\"including the US, Canada and most Latin American and European countries\\". Other countries are divided between a neutral position, support for the National Assembly in general without endorsing Guaid√≥, and support for Maduro's presidency; internationally, support has followed traditional geopolitical lines, with Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Cuba, and Turkey supporting Maduro, and the US, Canada, and most of Western Europe supporting Guaid√≥. Moreover, the United Nations has continued to recognize the Maduro government as the legal representative of Venezuela as of December 2019. The European Parliament recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president. The European Union unanimously recognized the National Assembly, but Italy dissented on recognizing Guaid√≥. The OAS approved a resolution on 10 January 2019 \\"to not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term\\". In a 24 January special OAS session, sixteen countries including the US recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president, but they did not achieve the majority needed for a resolution. The United Nations called for dialogue and deescalation of tension, but could not agree on any other path for resolving the crisis. Twelve of the fourteen members of the Lima Group recognize Guaid√≥; Beatriz Becerra‚Äîon the day after she retired as head of the human rights subcommittee for the European Parliament‚Äîsaid that the International Contact Group, jointly sponsored by Uruguay and Mexico, had been of no use and \\"has been an artifact that has served no purpose since it was created\\". She said there had been no progress on the 90-day deadline for elections that the group established when it was formed, and she considered that the Contact Group should be terminated and efforts coordinated through the Lima Group. During the 49th General Assembly of the Organization of American States, on 27 June, Guaid√≥'s presidency was recognized by the organization. The Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflictivity stated that there were on average 69 protests daily in Venezuela during the first three months of 2019, for a total of 6,211 protests, representing a significant increase over previous years (157% of protests for the same period in 2018, and 395% relative to the number in 2017). Following the failed uprising on 30 April, support for Guaid√≥ declined, attendance to his demonstrations subsided and participants in committees organized by Guaid√≥ stated that there has been little progress. Reuters reported in June that analysts have predicted that Maduro would maintain his position as he gains confidence that his actions against the opposition go \\"relatively unpunished\\". = Defections = The Miami Herald reported that dozens of arrests were made in anticipation of a military uprising, and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez ordered a counterintelligence effort to locate conspirators or possible defectors. According to France 24, Maduro declared \\"military deserters who fled to Colombia have become mercenaries\\" as part of a \\"US-backed coup\\". Guaid√≥ declared that the opposition had held secret meetings with military officials to discuss the Amnesty Law. Hugo Carvajal, the head of Venezuela's military intelligence for ten years during Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency and \\"one of the government's most prominent figures\\", Also available online. publicly broke with Maduro and endorsed Guaid√≥ as acting president. Also available online. During the 30 April 2019 uprising attempt, Manuel Cristopher Figuera, the Director General of Venezuela's National Intelligence Service, SEBIN, broke with Maduro. Certain top military figures recognized Guaid√≥,  and around 1,400 military personnel have defected to Colombia, but the top military command stays loyal to the government. Following the 23 January events, some Venezuelan diplomats in the United States supported Guaid√≥; the majority returned to Venezuela on Maduro's orders. = Foreign military involvement = On 18 February 2019, President Donald Trump advised Venezuelan soldiers to renounce loyalty to Nicol√°s Maduro. In early 2019, with Cuban and Russian-backed security forces in the country, United States military involvement became the subject of speculation. Senior U.S. officials have declared that \\"all options are on the table\\", but have also said that \\"our objective is a peaceful transfer of power\\". Colombian guerrillas from National Liberation Army (ELN) have vowed to defend Maduro, with ELN leaders in Cuba stating that they have been drafting plans to provide military assistance to Maduro. Article 187 of the Venezuelan Constitution provides that \\"It shall be the function of the National Assembly: (11) To authorize the operation of Venezuelan military missions abroad or foreign military missions within the country.\\" In every demonstration summoned by Guaid√≥, there have been numerous signs demanding the application of Article 187, and a March poll showed 87.5% support for foreign intervention. Venezuelan politicians such Mar√≠a Corina Machado and Antonio Ledezma, former mayor of Caracas, have also demanded the application of the article. According to Giancarlo Fiorella, writing in Foreign Affairs, the \\"loudest calls for intervention are coming not from the White House and its media mouthpieces but from some members of the Venezuelan opposition and from residents of the country desperate for a solution‚Äîany solution‚Äîto their years-long plight.\\" Fiorella states that \\"talk of invoking article 187(11) has become commonplace\\" in Venezuela, adding that \\"the push for a military intervention in Venezuela is most intense not among hawks in Washington but inside the country itself\\". Guaid√≥ has said he will call for intervention \\"when the time comes\\", but in media interviews, he has not stated he supports removing Maduro by force. The National Assembly approved in July 2019 the reincorporation of Venezuela to the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, a mutual defense pact signed in 1947 that has never been enacted and from which Venezuela retired in 2013. Venezuela's reincorporation to the pact \\"can be used to request military assistance against foreign troops inside the country\\".  Cuban presence  According to professor Erick Langer of Georgetown University, \\"Cuba and Russia have already intervened\\". A Cuban military presence of at least 15,000 personnel was in Venezuela in early 2018, while estimates ranging from hundreds to thousands of Cuban security forces were reported in 2019. In April 2019, Trump threatened a \\"full and complete embargo, together with highest-level sanctions\\" on Cuba if its troops do not cease operations in Venezuela.  Russian presence  Two nuclear weapon-capable Russian planes landed in Venezuela in December 2018 in what Reuters called a \\"show of support for Maduro's socialist government\\". According to the Kremlin, there are about 100 Russian military personnel in Venezuela \\"to repair equipment and provide technical co-operation\\". On 23 March 2019, two Russian planes landed in Venezuela carrying 99 troops and 35 tonnes of mat√©riel. Alexey Seredin from the Russian Embassy in Caracas said the two planes were \\"part of an effort to maintain Maduro's defense apparatus, which includes Sukhoi fighter jets and anti-aircraft systems purchased from Russia\\". National Assembly deputy Williams D√°vila said the National Assembly would investigate the \\"penetration of foreign forces in Venezuela\\". = Assets and reserves = Venezuela's third-largest export (after crude oil and refined petroleum products) is gold. The World Gold Council reported in January 2019 that Venezuela's foreign-held gold reserves had fallen by 69% to US$8.4 billion during Maduro's presidency. In 2018, Maduro's government exported $900 million worth of gold out of Venezuela into Erdoƒüan's Turkey. In April 2019, Rubio warned the United Arab Emirates and Turkey not be \\"accomplices\\" in the \\"outrageous crime\\" of exporting Venezuela's gold. In mid-December 2018, a Venezuelan delegation went to London to arrange for the Bank of England to return the $1.2 billion in gold bullion that Venezuela stores at the bank. Unnamed sources told Bloomberg that the Bank of England declined the transfer due to a request from US Secretary of State Pompeo and National Security Adviser Bolton, who wanted to \\"cut off the regime from its overseas assets\\". In an interview with the BBC, Maduro asked Britain to return the gold instead of sending humanitarian aid, saying that the gold was \\"legally Venezuela's, it belongs to the Central Bank of Venezuela\\" and could be used to solve the country's problems. Guaid√≥ asked the British government to ensure that the Bank of England does not provide the gold to the Maduro government. Maduro also said that US sanctions have frozen $10 billion in Venezuelan overseas accounts. In mid-February 2019, a National Assembly legislator Angel Alvarado said that eight tonnes of gold worth over US$340 million had been taken from the vault while the head of the Central Bank was abroad. In March, Ugandan investigators reported that the gold could have been smuggled into that country. Government sources said another eight tonnes of gold was taken out of the Central Bank in the first week of April 2019; the government source said that there were 100 tonnes left. The gold was removed while minimal staff was present and the bank was not fully operational because of the ongoing, widespread power outages; the destination of the gold was not known. In 2009, Venezuela's foreign reserves peaked at US$43 billion; by July 2017, they had fallen below $10 billion \\"for the first time in 15 years\\", and as of March 2019, they had dropped to US$8 billion. About two-thirds of Venezuela's reserves are in gold. Part of Venezuela's remaining reserves are held by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in financial instruments called SDRs. In 2018, Venezuela had almost $1 billion in IMF SDRs, but it had drawn US$600 million in one year. To access SDR reserves, IMF rules require than a government be recognized by a majority of IMF members, and there is no majority recognition for either man claiming the Venezuelan presidency; the IMF denied Maduro access to the remaining US$400 million‚Äî\\"one of the regime‚Äôs last remaining sources of cash\\" according to Bloomberg. The IMF has not recognized Guaid√≥; Ricardo Hausmann‚ÄîGuaid√≥'s representative recognized by the Inter-American Development Bank‚Äîsaid the \\"IMF is safeguarding the assets until a new government takes over. 'Those funds will be available when this usurpation ends.'\\" The US has given Guaid√≥ control of \\"key Venezuelan bank accounts\\", and has said it will give Guaid√≥ control of US assets once his administration is in power. The Portuguese bank Novo Banco stopped Maduro's attempt to transfer over US$1 billion through BANDES subsidiary, Banco Bandes Uruguay, in early 2019. Over two months later, Maduro responded that Portugal had illegally blocked the money, and asked that it be returned to buy food and medicine. In 2020, the English High Court ruled in favor of Juan Guaid√≥ in a hearing over whether Guaid√≥ or Nicolas Maduro should control $1 billion of its gold stored in the Bank of London. = Sanctions = A map of countries that have introduced sanctions against Venezuela in response to the outgoing crisis in Venezuela During the crisis in Venezuela, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Switzerland individually, and the countries of the European Union collectively, have applied sanctions against people associated with Maduro's administration, including government officials, members of the military and security forces, and private individuals. As of 27 March 2018, the Washington Office on Latin America said 78 Venezuelans associated with Maduro had been sanctioned by several countries. Through April 2019, the U.S. sanctioned more than 150 companies, vessels and individuals, in addition to revoking visas of 718 individuals associated with Maduro. Christian Kr√ºger Sarmiento, director of Colombia Migration, announced on 30 January 2019 that the Colombian government maintained a list of people banned from entering Colombia or subject to expulsion. As of January 2019, the list had 200 people with a \\"close relationship and support for the Nicol√°s Maduro regime\\", but Kr√ºger said the initial list could increase or decrease. As the humanitarian crisis deepened and expanded, the Trump administration levied more serious economic sanctions against Venezuela. In January 2019, during the presidential crisis, the United States imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA to pressure Maduro to resign. On 15 April 2019, Canada announced that another round of sanctions on 43 individuals were applied on 12 April based on the Special Economic Measures Act. The government statement said those sanctioned are \\"high ranking officials of the Maduro regime, regional governors and/or directly implicated in activities undermining democratic institutions\\". The United States Department of the Treasury has also placed restrictions on transactions with digital currency emitted by or in the name of the government of Venezuela, referencing \\"Petro\\", a DIGITAL token. and on Venezuela's gold industry. After the detention of Guaid√≥'s chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, in March 2019, the US also sanctioned the Venezuelan bank BANDES and its subsidiaries. The Treasury Department sanctioned seven additional individuals for their involvement in the disputed internal parliamentary elections of the National Assembly in January 2020.  Censorship and media control  Univision anchor Jorge Ramos was detained by the Maduro administration in February 2019 after a live interview. The Venezuelan press workers union denounced that in 2019, 40 journalists had been illegally detained as of 12 March; the National Assembly Parliamentary Commission for Media declared that there had been 173 aggressions against press workers as of 13 March. As of June 2019, journalists have been denied access to seven sessions of the National Assembly by the National Guard. Between 12 January and 18 January, Internet access to Wikipedia (in all languages) was blocked in Venezuela after Guaid√≥'s page on the Spanish Wikipedia was edited to show him as president. Later on 21 January, the day of the National Guard mutiny in Cotiza, Internet access to some social media was reported blocked for CANTV users. The Venezuelan government denied it had engaged in blocking. During the 23 January protests, widespread Internet outages for CANTV users were reported. Live streams of the National Assembly sessions and Guaid√≥'s speeches have been regularly disrupted for CANTV users.  * Since 22 January, some radio programs have been ordered off air; other programs have been temporarily canceled or received censorship warnings, including a threat to close private television and radio stations if they recognized Guaid√≥ as acting president or interim president of Venezuela. The website \\"Voluntarios X Venezuela\\" was promoted by Guaid√≥ and the National Assembly to gather volunteers for humanitarian aid. Between 12 and 13 February, CANTV users that tried to access were redirected to a mirror site with a different URL address. The mirror site asked for personal information, including names, ID, address and telephone numbers. The phishing website used the .ve domain controlled by Conatel. This manipulation was denounced as a technique to identify dissidents to the government.  Following the phishing incident, the official site was completely blocked for CANTV users on 16 February. During the 2020 election to choose the president of the National Assembly, independent journalists were also impeded from covering the event. Maduro's Ministry of Information, which has no relationship to the National Assembly, allowed reporters from state-run media to enter the legislative palace. Other reporters were not allowed in and told to watch it on a live feed from outside. State communications service CANTV reportedly blocked access to social media sites Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube on the day of the election. Block tracking website NetBlocks reported that the block began as the National Assembly session did. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Venezuela, the National Assembly created a webpage to provide information on the coronavirus disease 2019 to the public. The access to the site was restricted for CANTV users. During Juan Guaid√≥'s return to Venezuela in February 2020, after his second international tour, various media workers were insulted, harassed, robbed and physically aggressed by a group of supporters and pro-Maduro agitators thatreceived him in the airport. According to the Venezuelan Press Working Union (SNTP), Venezuelan security forces were present and witnessed the attacks, but did not intervene.} When journalists were going to file the complaint to the authorities, security forces impeded their access to the prosecutor office. =Twitter suspensions= In September 2020, Facebook closed 55 accounts, 42 pages and 36 Instagram accounts linked to CLS Strategies, a Washington-based public relation firm. Facebook said these were fake accounts used to secretly manipulate politics in Bolivia, Venezuela and Mexico in violation of Facebook‚Äôs prohibition on foreign interference. The Stanford Internet Observatory, a disinformation research group, reported that CLS Strategies employees had previous professional ties to opposition political leaders in Venezuela.  Arrests and detentions  Multiple individuals associated with Guaid√≥ were arrested or detained by the Maduro government. Roberto Marrero‚ÄîGuaid√≥'s chief of staff and Leopoldo L√≥pez's attorney‚Äîwas arrested by SEBIN during a raid on his home on 21 March. Gilber Caro, an alternate deputy and member of Guaido's party, Popular Will, was re-arrested by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service on 26 April 2019.Eleven other members of Guaido's team have been summoned to appear before SEBIN.Vice president of the National Assembly, Edgar Zambrano, arrested in May 2019.Most of the individuals who were seen with Guaid√≥ during the attempted uprising and many legislators were either arrested or in hiding. In May 2019, the TSJ ordered the prosecution of seven National Assembly members for their actions on 30 April. The rival Constituent Assembly stripped the members of their parliamentary immunity. The National Assembly dismissed the sentence, holding that the members of the Tribunal are illegitimate and that their ruling violates the parliamentary immunity of the deputies. As of 2 May 2019, there were 205 arrests related to protests. National Assembly Vice President Edgar Zambrano was arrested on 8 May 2019. With the seven deputies charged several crimes, an El Pa√≠s article stated that the Venezuelan parliament, elected to a majority in the 2015 elections, has been \\"systematically blocked\\" and dismembered by \\"political persecution\\" of 60% of its elected members. There was no preliminary merit hearing as required by law; an additional three deputies were indicted without a preliminary merit hearing. Three of the recently sanctioned members sought temporary refuge in foreign embassies. On 13 July 2019, two of Guaid√≥'s security guards were arrested in Caracas. According to Information Minister Jorge Rodr√≠guez, the two guards had attempted to sell rifles that had been taken from a National Guard armory ahead of the failed uprising on 30 April 2019. Guaid√≥ said that the guards were arrested while protecting his family during his tour around the country. He dismissed the weapon sale allegations and speculated that the authorities would torture and frame the two men by planting weapons on them. Rodr√≠guez announced that evidence would be presented during the next round of talks.

Coleman was a record scorer at Kentucky Wesleyan College and Wayland High School (Kentucky). Coleman was the #11 overall pick of the New York Knicks in the 1960 NBA Draft, after averaging 30.3 points per game as a senior at Kentucky Wesleyan. He played two seasons in the American Basketball League. Coleman is the All-time Kentucky High School career scorer, with 4,337 points. Early life Kelly was one of eleven children of Guy and Rusha Coleman. Guy Coleman supported the family by working in the local coal mines. Kelly attended Wayland High School in Wayland, Kentucky. High school career (1953‚Äì1956) Coleman had a record setting career at Wayland High School. Coleman scored 4,337 points from 1953 to 1956, which was the national record at the time and remains the Kentucky High School scoring record. In 1956, \\"King Kelly\\" Coleman was named Kentucky Mr. Basketball. In 1956, he was considered by many as the best high school basketball player in the nation, ranking with Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. As a Senior in the 1955-1956 season, Coleman scored 1,919 points, an average of 46.8 points per game. His 4,337 career points in high school broke Wilt Chamberlain's national record for most points scored in a career. In the recruiting process, Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and University of Kentucky Head Coach Adolph Rupp publicly called Coleman the best high school basketball player of all-time. Rupp said, \\"the greatest high school player who ever lived...A combination of Cliff Hagan, Frank Ramsey, and all of the other great stars who have played at Kentucky.\\" Today, he is still considered \\"without question the greatest Kentucky high school prepster of all time.\\" As a junior at Wayland High School, Coleman scored 1,174 points (32.6 average), in his sophomore year, 784 points (26.13), and as a 14-year-old freshman he scored 386, averaging 19.3 points. These totals were accumulated without the addition of the 3-point line. At the 1956 Kentucky State High School tournament, Coleman was so popular that his arrival in Lexington, Kentucky for the tournament was marked by flyers dropped from a plane that said: ‚ÄúKing Kelly‚Äôs coming to town.‚Äù In the State Tournament, Coleman scored 68 points against Bell County High School and then had 28 rebounds against Carr Creek High School. Both performances are still Kentucky state tournament records. Said Coleman, who had indicated his intentions to attend West Virginia (along with Jerry West) for college, bypassing Kentucky: \\"The crowd there was booing me for all the three games I had played. And they were still booing until I broke Johnny Cox‚Äôs record for most points in a tournament in the first quarter. Then they started rooting for me. And when Bell County was trying to freeze the ball, the crowd started booing them.\\" Coleman's four-game individual total of 185 points and point-per-game average of 46.25 set Kentucky State Tournament records. Coleman's 27 field goals in a game, 14 field goals in one half, 69 field goals in a tournament, 47 free throws in a tournament and 28 rebounds in a game are still tournament records as well.http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/moments18rs/web/legislative%20moment%2030.pdfhttps://khsaa.org/records/basketball/bbk- recordbook_indivteams.pdf Wayland High School (2014), Gym is on the left. Coleman led Wayland to the State Final Four in 1956 College career (1956‚Äì1960) In 1955‚Äì56, as a high school senior, as Coleman averaged 46.8 points per game, he was recruited by heavily by colleges, as he had been throughout his high school career. He was being most heavily recruited by both the University of Kentucky and West Virginia University. After a recruiting battle between the two, Coleman committed to West Virginia, along with Jerry West. However, he was eventually banned from playing for West Virginia University after the NCAA determined that Coleman received major gifts, including the use of a car, clothes and money. Coleman eventually played for Kentucky Wesleyan after short stints at Eastern Kentucky University and Marshall University and a steel mill job. After the recruiting penalties from West Virginia, Coleman enrolled and played at Kentucky Wesleyan from 1956 to 1960. At Kentucky Wesleyan, Coleman was a two-time All-American. He finished third in career points with 2,077 and sixth in rebounding with 904. He led the nation (University and College Divisions) as a freshman with a 26.6 points per game and holds the record for highest scoring average for a career (27.7 ppg) and most points in a season (848). Coleman ranks third in career points (2,077, 27.7 ppg) and sixth in career rebounds (904, 12.1 rpg). As a freshman, in 1956‚Äì57, Coleman led Kentucky Wesleyan to a national runner-up in the 1957 NCAA College Division Basketball Tournament. As a senior in 1959‚Äì60, Coleman was third in the nation in scoring with 30.3 points per game, behind Robertson at the University of Cincinnati (33.7).

Professional career (1960‚Äì1964) On April 11, 1960, the New York Knicks selected Kelly Coleman in Round 2 with Pick 3 (#11 overall) in the 1960 NBA Draft. Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Roberston (#1), West (#2) Lenny Wilkins (#7) and Satch Sanders (#9) were taken just ahead of him. On May 23, 1960, Coleman signed a contract with the New York Knicks. On Oct 1, 1960, Knicks placed the contract of Kelly Coleman on waivers and he became a free agent. It was said that Colemen had \\"little to no interest in the NBA\\" due to the low salaries at the time. Coleman then played professionally for the Baltimore Bullets (1960‚Äì61) of the Eastern Professional Basketball League]. He followed that by playint two seasons (1961‚Äì63), for the Chicago Majors of the American Basketball League, averaging 14.2 points and 7.2 rebounds in 1961‚Äì62.

He became a teacher and worked for the Detroit Free Press. After retiring in Michigan, Coleman returned home to live in Wayland, Kentucky. At a Wayland homecoming event in 2018, Coleman reflected on his career. \\"All I did was play,\\" he said. \\"It came natural, I guess. I started playing when I was in the eighth grade and it grew from there.\\" Coleman died on June 16, 2019, at the Noreen and Greg Wells Hospice Care Center in Hazard, Kentucky.http://www.kentucky.com/sports/high- school/prep-basketball/article231614368.html Honors * 1956 Kentucky Mr. Basketball * Kentucky's All-Time High school Career scoring record 4,337 points *2√ó NCAA All-American * Number 45 Retired by Kentucky Wesleyan (2005). * Number 66 Retired by Wayland High School. * Coleman was elected to the Kentucky High School State Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1989, but declined the honor. * In November, 2005, Coleman was honored at Kentucky Wesleyan during the \\"King Kelly Coleman Homecoming Weekend\\" on November 18‚Äì19, 2005. * On April 2, 2008, Coleman was honored with a resolution on the floor of the Kentucky State Senate. * Coleman was voted to Kentucky Wesleyan's All- Century Team in 2010. * On May 25, 2018, an oversight was repaired when Coleman received his 1956 Kentucky Mr. Basketball award after speaking to players at a youth camp. * A portion of highway leading out of Wayland, Kentucky is named the \\"Kelly Coleman Highway.\\" * Coleman was a charter inductee of the Kentucky Association of Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2012.

These features may be the result of a merger of gas-rich disk galaxies or by the accretion of gas-rich material. In ether scenario, the gas would have lost momentum and fallen to the center of the galaxy to produce the disk and current star formation. However, Vlasyuk et al. suggests that the disk and the smaller circumnuclear molecular gas ring with star formation inside the main disk formed from a tidal encounter between NGC 759 and a large spiral galaxy which was accompanied by a substantial gas accretion. The dust disk in NGC 759 as imaged by the 250x250px Molecular Gas NGC 759 contains 2.4 √ó 109 M‚òâ of Molecular Gas. Most of the gas is concentrated in a circumnuclear molecular gas ring with a diameter of . The gas may be the result of the same merger event that produced the circumnuclear molecular gas ring and the main disk. SN 2002fb NGC 759 has had one supernova, SN 2002fb which was discovered on September 6, 2002. It was classified as a type Ia supernova.

According to David Priestland, the concept of \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" developed within the Stalinist period of the Soviet Union as a way to publicly interrogate intellectuals who were suspected of possessing counter-revolutionary positions. The concept would play a major component of the political philosophy of Chinese Marxist leader Mao Zedong.  History  = Soviet Union = According to David Priestland, the concept of \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" originated during the 1921‚Äì1924 purges of academia within the Soviet Union. This would eventually develop into the practise of \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" campaigns in which intellectuals suspected of possessing counter-revolutionary tendencies were publicly interrogated as part of a policy of \\"proletariatization.\\" This policy would be expanded past academia into the economic spheres of Russia with managers and party-bosses coerced to undergo campaigns of popular criticism. Joseph Stalin introduced the concept of self- criticism in his 1924 work The Foundations of Leninism. He would later expand this concept in his 1928 article \\"Against Vulgarising the Slogan of Self- Criticism\\". Stalin wrote in 1928 \\"I think, comrades, that self-criticism is as necessary to us as air or water. I think that without it, without self- criticism, our Party could not make any headway, could not disclose our ulcers, could not eliminate our shortcomings. And shortcomings we have in plenty. That must be admitted frankly and honestly.\\"Stalin, Joseph. Works. Moscow: Foreign Languages Pub. House, 1952, Vol. 11, p. 32 However, Stalin posited that self-criticism \\"date[s] back to the first appearance of Bolshevism in our country\\". Stalin stated that self-criticism was needed even after obtaining power as failing to observe weaknesses \\"make things easier for their enemies\\" and that \\"without self-criticism there can be no proper education of the Party, the class, and the masses\\". Vladimir Lenin wrote in One Step Forward, Two Steps Back (1904) that the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party engages in \\"self-criticism and ruthless exposure of their own shortcomings\\". Lenin further discussed the idea in \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder (1920), \\"Frankly admitting a mistake, ascertaining the reasons for it, analysing the circumstances which gave rise to it, and thoroughly discussing the means of correcting it‚Äîthat is the earmark of a serious party\\".https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1928/06/26.html Lenin again further elaborated at a later date (1922) that revolutionaries \\"grew conceited, failed to see where their strength lay, and feared to speak of their weaknesses. But we shall not perish, for we do not fear to speak of our weaknesses and shall learn to overcome them\\". According to the official history of the October Revolution and Soviet Union produced under Stalin, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the concept is described briefly in the twelfth chapter, > In order to be fully prepared for this turn, the Party had to be its moving > spirit, and the leading role of the Party in the forthcoming elections had > to be fully ensured. But this could be done only if the Party organizations > themselves became thoroughly democratic in their everyday work, only if they > fully observed the principles of democratic centralism in their inner-Party > life, as the Party Rules demanded, only if all organs of the Party were > elected, only if criticism and self-criticism in the Party were developed to > the full, only if the responsibility of the Party bodies to the members of > the Party were complete, and if the members of the Party themselves became > thoroughly active. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, successor to Soviet premiership Nikita Khrushchev would reaffirm the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's ideological dedication to the concepts of \\"criticism and self criticism\\" in the conclusion to the 1956 speech before the 20th Party Congress, while also denouncing the policies and actions of Stalin. = People's Republic of China = Mao provides a significant focus on the idea of self-criticism, dedicating a whole chapter of the Little Red Book to the issue. Mao saw \\"conscientious practice\\" of self-criticism as a quality that distinguished the Communist Party of China from other parties. Mao championed self-criticism saying \\"dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will get dirty if they are not washed regularly. Our comrades' minds and our Party's work may also collect dust, and also need sweeping and washing.\\" = Vietnam = Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh made numerous references to the importance of self-criticism within the Vietnamese Communist Party. = Outside the Communist Bloc = French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser wrote a work titled Essays in Self-Criticism. The American New Left revolutionary organization Weather Underground dedicated a chapter of their work Prairie Fire to self-criticism of their prior revolutionary strategies. Likewise, the German Red Army Faction discuss the issues of self criticism in their publication The Urban Guerrilla Concept.

Biography Shoshana Shababo was born in Zikhron Ya'akov to a Sephardic Jewish family originally from Safed. Her father, Shlomo Shababo, taught Arabic at Al-Azhar University and moved to Zikhron Ya'akov after being invited to teach there. As a teenager, Shababo attended a local school whose director was the writer Yehuda Burla. She was a gifted student and read a lot of Hebrew and foreign literature. At the age of 15, with the help of a letter of recommendation from Burla, she was accepted to study at the Levinsky College of Education in Tel Aviv. While she was at Levinsky, she began writing short stories and newspaper articles. At 16, she began writing her first book \\"Maria,\\" which was published in 1932. After the death of her mother, she moved to Paris and spent time with her brother in London. After her return in 1942, she published her second book, \\"Ahava be-tsfat\\" (Love in Safed). That same year at the age of 32, she married David Karsanti. The couple moved to Hadar HaCarmel in Haifa where they opened a wool store. Despite her short stories being successful and popular among readers, the literary establishment heavily criticized her work. This alongside the death of her sister at 22, and her nephew being killed in the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war led to her distancing herself from writing. Shababo died on July 4, 1992 in Haifa. She was buried in Zikhron Ya'akov.

The side were runners-up in the Papua New Guinea National Club Championship in 2002, a feat which is still their best achievement to date. They have also won the Port Moresby Premier Division on three occasions, in 2000, 2005 and 2019. From 2015 to 2017, the side competed in two editions of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League. Their best result came in 2017, when they finished fourth after withdrawing from the playoffs.  History  = Foundation and early years = The club was founded in 1992 as PS United, but records of their competitive history do not begin until 1998, when they took part in the Port Moresby Premier League, a regional competition for clubs based in the country's capital. After finishing 5th in the league table, they went on to claim fourth place overall via the playoffs. The following season, they finished second both in the regular season table and in the playoffs, losing in the Grand Final to Defence, who had only finished 6th in the league table, on penalties. As a result, they qualified for the 2000 National Club Championship, but failed to get out of their group. However, on 22 October 2000, they claimed their first Port Moresby Premier League title after winning 1‚Äì0 against Rapatona, despite only finishing 6th in the regular season standings. For unknown reasons, however, the side did not take part in the 2001 National Club Championship. = National runners-up = The side reached their third successive regional final in 2001, after finishing second in the league to ANZ University, who narrowly defeated them 1‚Äì0 in the decisive match. This allowed them qualification to the 2002 National Club Championship, where they topped their group and defeated Newtown in the semi-finals, before facing Sobou, one of the most successful sides in domestic history, in the final. They lost 1‚Äì0. Later that season, the side completed a disappointing regional campaign by finishing 5th in the Port Moresby Premier League. They would repeat that feat the following year. Ahead of the 2004 season, the side were re-named as PS Rutz, and finished runners-up in the 2004 Port Moresby Premier League despite finishing top of the regular season table. They qualified for the 2005 National Club Championship as a result, but failed to get out of their group. That season, they finished second in the Port Moresby Premier League regular season table and beat University and Hekari United to the title after defeating both sides en route to a 2‚Äì0 Grand Final win against the former in the final. The side finished 4th in the 2006 National Club Championship after losing to Blue Kumuls Lae in the third-place playoff, before finishing fifth in that season's edition of the Port Moresby Premier League. The club slowly began to decline, with a third place finish in 2012 the highlight of the next few years, before the side entered the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League for the 2015‚Äì16 season. = National Soccer League = The side entered the 2015‚Äì16 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League under new sponsorship from Huawei, thus changing their name to PS Huawei. The club were drawn into the Southern Conference, but had a poor season, finishing bottom of the regional pool despite an opening day 3‚Äì2 victory over former runners-up FC Port Moresby. The side won just one more game across the season and lost six, including conceding six to both Port Moresby and Hekari United. The side remained in the National Soccer League after the domestic league split and finished third in the regular season table. However, they eventually pulled out of the playoffs, citing 'poor management of the competition.' This led to the complete cancellation of the playoffs that season. = Return to regional competition = After dropping out of the National Soccer League and retaining their previous name PS Rutz, the team took part in the 2017 Port Moresby Premier Division, finishing outside the top five and failing to qualify for the playoffs. The following season, they likely finished 5th. In the 2019 season, they picked up their third regional championship after topping the table ahead of University Inter.

It is distinctively served in cone-shaped banana leaves. Sayongsong is a type of puto. Sayongsong is can be time-consuming to make. It is made with equal parts of glutinous rice and regular rice. It traditionally uses pirurotong, a native deep purple glutinous rice, which gives it a striking blue to purple color, but other types of glutinous rice can also be used. The rice mixture is soaked for around 20 minutes. Roasted peanuts (surigao version) or grated young coconut (Visayas version) are then added and the whole mixture is ground into a smooth paste known as galap√≥ng. Coconut milk sweetened with sugar is boiled separately for around 10 minutes then filtered and mixed with the galap√≥ng. The galap√≥ng is then cooked in a pan while constantly stirring. When it becomes very thick in consistency, a bit of calamansi juice is spritzed on the mixture. It is then allowed to cool and then poured into greased banana leaves shaped into a cone. The cones are then steamed for an additional 20 minutes. The dish can be modified by adding other ingredients, like chocolate or strips of young coconut meat. The texture of sayongsong is very soft, reminiscent of both kalamay and puto. Sayongsong has a short shelf life and spoils after around a day, though it can be preserved for another day if chilled and placed in an airtight container. In Samar, sarungsong can also be cooked in shaved bamboo tubes that are then peeled open to eat.

It is owned and operated by Scottish Southern Electricity Network (SSEN). Covering an area the size of 24 football pitches, it is as of January 2019, the UK's largest substation and Europe's second biggest. Construction began in early 2015 to upgrade the existing substation so it could accommodate the new Caithness - Moray Link. The ¬£1bn construction project had four main elements: 400kV and 232kV gas-insulated substations, one 275kV air-insulated substation, a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converter for the Caithness - Moray subsea link and a HVDC underground cable from the substation to Portgordon. In January 2019 construction and commissioning were completed making it the UK's largest operating substation. It is seen as integral to the UK electricity grid as the north of Scotland generates much renewable energy via windfarms. The upgrade was primarily done to accommodate the Beatrice Windfarm.
