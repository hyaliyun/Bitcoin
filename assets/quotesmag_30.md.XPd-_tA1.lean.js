The start-and-finish straight runs on one of the major highways ‚Äì Persiaran Perdana, or Putrajaya Boulevard ‚Äì and just north of the circuit is the Perdana Putra housing the Prime Minister's Office. The track is 2.56 km in length and features 12 turns. It was designed by British architect Simon Gibbons, who brought experience of nine years with FOM as circuit planning manager and more recently played a significant role in the rowing and canoeing venue for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Driver comments Daniel Abt, Audi Sport ABT: \\"The track layout looks very interesting and has a lot of different corners. You have a chicane at Turn 1 after the main straight which gives a good first opportunity for overtaking and slipstream battles. Then you have a mix of slow and medium speed corners which is good for keeping the field very tight and will ensure close racing. I think the next very good overtaking spot will be T6 which is in front of the Fan Zone and should give the spectators a great view of the action. T9 meanwhile reminds me of the very tight hairpin at Macau. All in all the layout looks really promising and will for sure provide great racing.\\" Sam Bird, Virgin Racing: \\"The track is quite a bit shorter than Beijing. I think it‚Äôll be higher in terms of energy output for the distance than we saw in Beijing. It‚Äôs a little bit more high speed and there‚Äôs some long straights. (...) Looking for overtaking zones, you have to say Turn 3, possibly T4, possibly T7 and T12 and maybe T10 down the inside will be the main overtaking zones. I can‚Äôt really see anyone making a lunge into 1 ‚Äì it‚Äôs not enough of a brake really.\\" See also * Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit References External links * Map and circuit history at RacingCircuits.info Category:Putrajaya ePrix Category:Formula E circuits Category:Motorsport venues in Malaysia ","title":"Putrajaya Street Circuit"},{"id":"43642663","text":"A Message Through Flames is a 1915 American short silent drama film, directed by Jack Harvey for the Thanhouser Company.

School Syro-Malabar religious houses in the parish *SABS Convent History History of Christians here starts from the arrival of St. Thomas the Apostle. The apostle reached Nilakkal at 52 AD and started a Christian Community here. At that time, Nilackal was a 'Trade City' having trade relations with \\"Pandi-chola\\" states and 'Venadu'. There were 'Palace Roads' from their countries to 'Nilackal Thavalam' which were illumined by great lights (ex. Keralachaitram : K.P. Padmanabhan P. 145. Thiruvithamcore State mannel Vol. 1-p. 665 Vol. 2-p. 128) Since Nilackal was a vast region, there were many Christian churches here. Place here were known after the churches there. Even now places in the forests are called Plappally, Thulappally etc. The head Church of all these small churches was called 'Thalappally and later as Thulappally. (cfr. History of Christianity in Kerala by Nagamayyas P. 136). Old tombs of Christians are seen even now in the forest area near the present church unfortunately the invasion of some alien force called 'Vakkrippali attack' the inhabitants of Nilackal fled to other places such as Kanjirappally, Aruvithura, and other parts of the Meenachil . Nilackal is also called 'Chayal' since the place slopes towards the River 'Pampa'. After a long time migration started to these remote places. It started as early as 1938. The recession felt in the socio-economic spheres after the first world war stimulated the migration to the hilly regions from the places. The majority of the immigrants were Nasranis of Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian church (One of the St Thomas Christian Church) and non ‚Äì Christians, a substantial number of Catholics also came to those Hillocks. They soon felt the strong need for a Church to meet their spiritual as well as social needs. A Catholic parish was set up under the leadership of Fr. George Ponnadathukallel. This church was actually dedicated for St George. They offered the first Qurbana in a temporary chapel on 12 February 1955. In 1960 it was officially given the status of a parish and Fr. Joseph Kalayil was appointed as the first Vicar. =New church= The old church The name of the church was St. George from 1956 to 2007. The new church was blessed on 17 January 2007 along with new Name Mar Thoma Sleeha Church, Nilackal Thulappally.

The townsite is located near the intersection of the Powder River Trail and the Cheyenne & Black Hills Stage Road and is now a part of the Oglala National Grassland. All that remains of the town is the historic Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, built there in 1887. History During the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, Buffalo Bill Cody shot, killed, and scalped a Cheyenne warrior near the townsite-to-be, which he later often celebrated during his Wild West shows in a reenactment he entitled \\"The Red Right Hand, or, Buffalo Bill's First Scalp for Custer\\". Montrose was established in 1887 on a ford across Hat Creek by immigrants from Austria, Germany, and Luxembourg. It was named from its lofty elevation (mont) and native rose bushes (rose). A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. That year, the settlers built Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. In 1890, fear of the Ghost Dance cult led the settlers to construct a fortified bunker. Omaha Bishop Richard Scannell confirmed 46 Catholics at the church in June 1899. By 1904, the settlement had a school, a blacksmith, and a general store. In 1910, the settlement's population peaked at 24 inhabitants. Montrose had a post office from 1887 to 1948.

It was settled by immigrants in the mid-1880s and established as a town by the railroad in 1906. Orella was last inhabited in the 1960s, and its former site is now private property. History The area was first settled in the mid-1880s with the arrival of the Rosenberg and Wasserberger families. They established homesteads and ranching operations as a means of income along Cottonwood Creek and named the settlement Adelia. In 1889, the railroad crested Crawford Hill and entered the area and established a water station and telegraph office in Adelia. However, the grade westbound was steep from the stop in Adelia, and in spring 1906, the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad moved the water station and telegraph office from Adelia, several miles to the north higher on the grade. Adelia would be renamed Joder, and the new railroad office location became known as Orella, named in honor of a local woman. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. With land patents being granted by the U.S. Government, and its importance to the railroad, Orella would become a thriving town. There were multiple streets with a typical suburban block and lot plan. There were multiple goods stores, a stable, and a church. A post office was established in 1910 and remained in operation until being discontinued in 1957, along with railroad passenger service to the town. Orella served as a railhead for local ranchers to ship cattle, and once had a small railyard. The town would also become home to the railroad track gang until 1960, when their base was moved to the south in Crawford. Orella's population began to decline with the depression in the 1930s. After World War II, the economic boom allowed many to leave rural Orella for population centers. The final blows came as the U.S. Army began scaling back employment and operations at the Black Hills Ordnance Depot in the 1950s. The last permanent residents of Orella were John and Mable Carnahan, who lived in a home they built on the east side of the tracks in 1923. John worked for the railroad on the track gang, while Mable worked in a store and eventually became postmistress. In 1968, they left Orella and moved to Edgemont, South Dakota due to John's health, and would never return. The town would officially disappear from the railroad rule books and employee timetables in 1992. As of June 2016, the only remaining structures are the Carnahan house, railroad section foreman's house, and train station. The section foreman's house and station have been moved away from the tracks into a private corral. All of the structures are located on private property, and are not for public visitation. Trespassers will be prosecuted.

Its neighbouring places include Outapi, Elim and Oshikuku. Before independence Up to the early 1990s life in Ogongo was determined by manual subsistence farming. There were no tarred roads and the village was not connected to the national electricity or warter supply systems. Inhabitants of Ogongo collected water by foot from nearby dams and wells or from the neighbouring town of Oshakati. There were no shops except for shebeens (bars) at Ogongo village, people used to go to Oshakati to buy their goods and necessities, although it was not easy because transport to Oshakati was rare and expensive. There were hardly jobs available for the people, so people used to rely on their mahangu fields and livestock for maintenance and survival. There were no proper church buildings that time, so people gathered under a tree for their services. The same applies to schools and due to the lack of secondary schools in Ogongo learners used to go to schools in neighbouring towns after completing their grade seven.

Overview Issued by The Aquabats' then labels Goldenvoice and Time Bomb Recordings, \\"Super Rad!\\" was the band's first widely distributed single, and what AbsolutePunk called \\"single-handedly the gem responsible for putting [The Aquabats] on the map\\". Musically, the song follows in the ska-influenced style The Aquabats were then known for, featuring a heavily brass-driven melody as well as the surf-inspired lead guitar lines which characterized much of the band's early material. \\"Super Rad!\\"s lyrics have been described by reviewers as an introductory \\"mission statement\\" of sorts in reference to the band's superhero-themed persona, exemplified in the chorus \\"We're on our way/Here we go/We're gonna take over\\". Despite not attaining any chart success, \\"Super Rad!\\" nevertheless received heavy airplay on college radio and stations such as Los Angeles' influential KROQ-FM during the short-lived American ska revival of the late 1990s, bringing The Aquabats their first taste of moderate mainstream exposure. As such, it is considered to be one of the band's most popular songs, and is almost always performed at every one of their concerts. Music video The Bat Commander fights the Cyclopfenstein in a shot from the \\"Super Rad!\\" music video. As The Aquabats started to attract mainstream attention in late 1997, singer Christian Jacobs (The Bat Commander) began to conceptualize adapting the band's superhero mythology for television. In a 2013 interview with the Nerdist, Jacobs mentioned that the video for \\"Super Rad!\\" was one of his attempts to show studios that The Aquabats could be \\"appealing comedic characters in addition to a good band\\". The video was directed by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, who also worked with the band in developing and directing their 1998 unaired television pilot The Aquabats! for Buena Vista Television. Like most of The Aquabats' video projects, the music video for \\"Super Rad!\\" features a deliberately campy and brightly colored aesthetic reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons and 1970s television such as the works of Sid and Marty Krofft. The video's loose plot follows The Aquabats as they're dispatched individually by \\"The Professor\\" (Parker Jacobs) to rescue a young Aquacadet being menaced by a duo of thugs. Featuring heavy slapstick humor, each of The Aquabats endures various physical beatings and pratfalls before collectively saving the day. Actor Ed Begley, Jr. makes a brief cameo appearance in the video, driving a General Motors EV1 to which a jogging Jaime the Robot is attached via extension cord. In one scene, The Bat Commander fights with a costumed monster then known as the \\"Cyclopfenstein\\" (a portmanteau of cyclops and Scott Klopfenstein, trumpeter for the ska punk band Reel Big Fish, who frequently toured with The Aquabats); the design for this creature would later be used to develop the character of Muno for the children's television series Yo Gabba Gabba!, of which Jacobs co-created. Cultural references *\\"Super Rad!\\" is featured on the soundtrack for the 1999 family film Soccer Dog: The Movie, where it's played both during a montage of the film's principle soccer team on a winning streak and over the ending credits.

Duplication The Freeway, a 96.6 km stretch that connects Porto Alegre to Os√≥rio, was inaugurated on the morning of September 26, 1973, as an alternative to RS-030 for the coast, now known as Estrada Velha. The nickname was given in reference to California expressways. It was the first Brazilian highway, with a limit of 120 km/h at the time of the opening of its double lanes, separated by a wide central construction site. Subsequently, the Federal Government lowered the Freeway's speed limit to 80 km/h, due to the oil crisis in the 1970s, to save fuel. Today, the limit is 110 km/h. Freeway also received a 3rd track in both directions, after some time.

The song was issued as a single in December 2010, the second single released from Hi-Five Soup! following \\"Radio Down!\\" in November 2010. Overview Like a good number of The Aquabats' songs such as \\"Captain Hampton and the Midget Pirates!\\" or \\"Tiger Rider vs. the Time Sprinkler!\\", \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" is a humorous narrative centered on the outlandish adventures of a fictional character. In this instance, the song pertains to the eponymous Shark Fighter, a wavy-haired ocean vigilante who dedicates his life to avenging the implied shark-related death of his past lover by single-handedly fighting the sea's shark population, with the song noting \\"He will not die/Until all sharks cry\\". Musically, the song follows in the same guitar-driven pop rock direction as most of Hi-Five Soup!, featuring The Aquabats' characteristic new wave- influenced synthesizer melodies, a type of sound which Punknews.org specifically described as being like \\"Devo on a sugar high\\". The instrumentation of the song additionally features an introductory timpani roll and a simulated choir to lend the track a grand and pseudo-orchestral feel. Release and reception On December 14, The Aquabats released \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" as an exclusive stream on their official Facebook page. On January 4, 2011, two weeks before the release of Hi-Five Soup!, \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" was released to iTunes as a downloadable single. While critical response to Hi-Five Soup! was generally mixed, \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" received almost unanimous praise as one of the album's standout tracks and one of The Aquabats' overall best songs. Punk publication DyingScene listed \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" as one of the album's tracks which \\"definitely hold up to the sound of their past albums\\", sentiments echoed by the likes of Geekscape, who called the \\"wackiness\\" of the song's concept \\"classic 'Bats\\", and the OC Weekly newspaper, who opened their review with the first line of the song, writing \\"And with those words...The Aquabats are once again at it\\". The Aquabats! Super Show! Though no music video for \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" was ever filmed, the narrative of the song was later adapted into an episode of the same name for The Aquabats' live-action television series The Aquabats! Super Show! and aired as the twentieth episode of the series on December 28, 2013. Written by bassist Chad Larson (Crash McLarson), the episode centers on The Aquabats encountering the mythical Shark Fighter, played by guest star Rhys Darby, after he saves them from a roving gang of \\"land sharks\\". The band become endeared to the Shark Fighter, in particular Crash, who views him as a brotherly figure after he's selected to train as the Shark Fighter's apprentice. As Crash begins to distance himself from the rest of The Aquabats to study under the Shark Fighter, he's ultimately forced to decide between his loyalty to his new mentor or to his friends when another group of land sharks attack the city. The studio version of \\"The Shark Fighter!\\" is played during a training montage in the episode depicting Crash training under the Shark Fighter, while an orchestral sting derived from the song's melody is played several times throughout the episode.

Overview \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" was the first single released from The Aquabats' 2005 album Charge!!, which itself was the first album the band had released after a nearly six-year quasi-hiatus from studio recording, during which they had experienced several major changes in their line-up which resulted in a significant shift in musical style. Musically, the song matches the stylistic direction of the rest of the album, featuring a guitar and keyboard-driven rock sound which Johnny Loftus of Allmusic described as a \\"concise [slice] of new wave-inspired pop that retain[s] that particular Aquabatian flair for the totally wiggy\\". Lyrically, the song satirizes social fads and popular fashion, in particular that of the goth and emo subcultures, likening people who adhere to such scenes as \\"zombies\\". In the documentary How About Charge!!? on the album's \\"Special One-Year Anniversary\\" DVD, singer Christian Jacobs explained that the song was written as the band's reaction towards the newest trend in what he called \\"fashion rock\\", popular music that was merely a \\"soundtrack to the clothes that you wear\\". The bridge of the song parodies the bridge of Michael Jacksons \\"Thriller\\", repeating Vincent Prices narration of \\"Darkness falls across the land/The midnight hour is close at hand/Creatures crawling in search of blood...\\" verbatim, though finishes with \\"to accessorize their black zipper hoods\\" in place of the original's \\"to terrorize your neighborhood\\". Release and reception On April 1, 2005, The Aquabats posted an update on their website where they revealed the release date, title, track listing and cover art for Charge!! along with an MP3 download of \\"Fashion Zombies!\\", describing it as one of their \\"favorite songs from the new record\\" rather than a single. On June 1, less than a week before the release of Charge!!, the band offered a contest that whomever could help get the song airplay on local radio would be treated to an all-expenses paid meal with The Aquabats. The prize was claimed after a fan got \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" played on Los Angeles' KROQ-FM and was taken to a T.G.I. Friday's. After the moderate success of Charge!! and the band's extensive, well-hyped touring schedule, The Aquabats appeared as musical guests on the September 23, 2005 episode of the G4 news and variety program Attack of the Show! where they performed \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" and \\"Nerd Alert!\\". Along with Charge!! as a whole, \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" received a very positive response from critics, with most praising the band's effective shift in style and the song's clever lyricism. AbsolutePunk complimented the song's \\"catchy keyboard harmonies\\", writing \\"'Fashion Zombies!' alone confirms that the Bats are progressing in their own unique way, regardless of what's going on in the rest of the music industry\\". Music video A music video for \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" was directed by singer Christian Jacobs and Justin Lyon and shot in Los Angeles over the course of two nights during the first week of June 2005. The video was released on The Aquabats' website on July 12, 2005, later receiving an official home media release on the Charge!! \\"Special One-Year Anniversary Edition\\" CD/DVD on June 10, 2006. The first half of the video depicts four groups of varying subcultures - specifically, what appear to be goths, New Romantics, preppies and hipsters - as they square off in a dark alleyway and start fighting each other, intercut with footage of The Aquabats performing the song on a soundstage. In the audio commentary for the music video featured on the DVD of the Charge!! \\"Special One-Year Anniversary Edition\\", Jacobs explained that these parts of the video were inspired by the 1979 film The Warriors and Michael Jackson's video for \\"Beat It\\".\\"Fashion Zombies!\\" audio commentary, Charge!!

The band is cornered into a dilapidated shack where they try to fight back with their instruments, but at the end of the video are ultimately overpowered and given fashionable makeovers, turning into zombies themselves. Within the canon of the band, the \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" music video is notable as the only official Aquabats media to feature guitarist Popeye (Michael Vogelsang), who toured with the band as an additional guitarist in the summer of 2005 though was ultimately never promoted to full-time member status or appeared on any recorded material.

Engraving by Heinrich Friedrich M√ºller, showing festive decorations on the occasion of the anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig. The Lusthaus is a historic building in Prater park in the Leopoldstadt district of Vienna, Austria. It is located at the southeastern end of Prater Avenue, near the Freudenau racecourse. First mentioned in 1560 as Casa Verde, the green summer house served as a hunting lodge in Vienna's Prater, which was then a hunting ground. It was built in 1538, at the location where Prater Avenue met the Danube Canal. The Lusthaus was on the water until 1834, when the Danube Canal was moved. After the Prater was opened to the public in 1766, the summer house was rebuilt from 1781 to 1783. It served as the location for large celebrations and festivities, such as the imperial celebrations to mark the first anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, in which Napoleon was defeated. In the 19th century, the Lusthaus, as well as the entire Prater, was a popular meeting place for the nobility and bourgeoisie. During the First World War, the military bridge guard tasked with protecting the Danube bridge from sabotage was stationed in the summer house. In the inter-war period marked by economic instability and poverty, the composition of its patrons shifted; the Lusthaus then served as a bar with dance and music. During the Second World War, the Lusthaus was almost completely destroyed by bombings in 1944 and 1945. However, by 1948, a decision was taken to rebuild the building, and the city of Vienna earmarked a sum of 350,000 shillings for its repair. During reconstruction, the building was restored to its 18th-century shape. In October 1949, the Lusthaus was reopened. Today, the Lusthaus houses a coffeehouse and a restaurant.

He was taken 8th overall by Barako Bull in the 2014 PBA draft. Amateur career Pascual initially attended his high school education at St. Rose Catholic School in Paniqui, Tarlac until 2004, when his brother brought him to Manila and encouraged him to apply for a basketball scholarship with Philippine Christian University. On his own will, he personally came to PCU with the intent to join its seniors basketball team, as he was, at that time, a graduating high school student. Yet, he was advised by Bong Sales, then head coach of the PCU Baby Dolphins, to repeat his third year of high school to gain experience and be familiar with Manila basketball. Furthermore, he was then instructed to officially drop out from his fourth year high school studies in St. Rose Catholic School in Tarlac, and to bring with him his second year high school report card to officially enrol as a third year high school student at PCU. Mr. Sales facilitated his enrolment in PCU High School, enabling him to serve a one-year residency and play for a year with the Baby Dolphins. In his only playing year at PCU, he was awarded both NCAA Juniors Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player of the NCAA Season 82, however, both awards were returned after it was found out that PCU High School falsified his documents to extend his high school eligibility, which resulted to the school's suspension from the NCAA that following season.http://www.inboundpass.com/2007/06/20/highlights-of-the-pcu- investigation/ After he graduated at PCU, he transferred to San Beda College where he was supposed to play out his rookie season for the Red Lions in 2008, but the NCAA Management Committee (ManCom) decided to ban him due to the same eligibility issue he was involved in two years before.http://www.inboundpass.com/2008/06/20/ncaa-bans-san-bedas-pascual/ A week after, he was cleared to play for NCAA Season 84 by the league after an appeal by then-San Beda president Fr. Mateo De Jesus to the NCAA Policy Board, saying he did not knowingly violate league rules on misrepresentation. At San Beda, he became a member of multiple Red Lions championship teams of 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. He was also awarded as Most Improved Player in 2009. He was also a Gilas Cadet, and was invited to the Sinag Pilipinas national team pool that competed in the 2013 SEA Games.

The paper is owned by Kristeligt Dagblad A/S and is based in Copenhagen. Full text. It is published six times per week from Monday to Saturday. Initially Kristeligt Dagblad was an Evangelical newspaper. The paper was apolitical, publishing articles on religious and moral topics as well as on cultural topics. In 1909 it published anti-evolutionary articles, strongly opposing to the views of Charles Darwin. From 1914 the paper took a wider approach and in 1935 broke away from the Inner Mission, presenting general news but without any political association. It gained popularity under the leadership of Gunnar Helweg- Larsen, but lost ground in the 1950s. From 1950 it adopted a new approach, adopting a more lively style with more emphasis on foreign news. The paper does not have any sports section and covers sports-related news occasionally. The editor of Kristeligt Dagblad is Erik Bjerager. Circulation In 1908 Kristeligt Dagblad sold 8,000 copies. During the last six months of 1957 the paper had a circulation of 16,582 copies on weekdays. During the second half of 1997 the circulation of Kristeligt Dagblad was 16,000 copies on weekdays.

Garrick said this to Rolling Stone Magazine in relation to the group's sound: > \\"The thought of recreating the past with music is not interesting to us, > it's probably been the biggest misconception of our music and what we're > about thus far. The reality is, we're much more interested in creating > things for the future than things from the past. We are nostalgic people, > not in the sense that we long for a different time, because we love the > present, but how could we not be reminded of the past when every day, we see > the person we had a crush on since 7th grade?\\" In late 2013 Electric Youth signed with Last Gang Records and Secretly Canadian. On September 30, 2014 the band released their debut album \\"Innerworld\\" through Last Gang Records in Canada and Secretly Canadian in the rest of the world, debuting at #13 on the Billboard Top Dance Electronic Albums chart. \\"Innerworld\\" was produced by Electric Youth. Vince Clarke (Erasure/Yazoo/Depeche Mode) and Peter Mayes (PNAU/Empire of the Sun) provided additional production, and the album was mixed by Mayes. \\"Innerworld\\" includes previously released tracks 'The Best Thing' and 'A Real Hero (feat College)' It received wide critical acclaim including NME and NPR First Listen. Rolling Stone declared Electric Youth one of the Ten Artists You Need To Know in 2014. Electric Youth carried out their first headlining tour across the US and Canada in November, 2014.

It is adjacent to Winchester Road and surrounded by housing, some of it dating from the mid Victorian Period. It is supported by The Friends Of St James' Park (FOSJP) who run a cafe and organise community events. The land now occupied by the park was gradually surrounded by housing as the suburb of Shirley, Southampton developed in the mid 1800s. At first it remained grazing land but eventually became a nursery and then a gravel pit. This last use has resulted in the park having a pleasant sunken appearance. In 1907 the land was purchased by the local authority and became a public park after landscaping in 1911. A popular story grew up in Southampton that the park was to have been the site of a railway station on the unbuilt section of the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway but plans deposited with Hampshire Record Office for this scheme show this not to have been the case. The planned route actually ran down from a tunnel in Chilworth near the current Chilworth Arms pub, through Lordswood and the site of the current Sports Centre, along the East Side of Dale Valley before turning under Winchester Road. It then passed to the North East of the park through land now occupied by Shirley Junior School before continuing along a course close to the present Wilton Road.Deposited Plans Hampshire Record Office Collection DP/384/1 Didcot Newbury and Southampton Junction Railway: deposited plan 1881 Some land was purchased and work undertaken to the East of Hill Lane South of Archers Road,Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway\\", Sands, T.B. where The Dell (Southampton) was later built and an unused embankment still exists running towards Commercial Road Archival research by the Shirley Local History Group, notably among the records of a local landowner revealed that a later revival of this scheme, the Southampton and Winchester Great Western Junction Railway, intended to use the park as the original route at this location had by then been developed. Plans and sections dated 1901 show the intended route of the railway as passing through the park from East to West.Hampshire Industrial Archaeology Jountal, Number 28 (2020), pp31-32 Records indicted that property sales were discussed for this scheme, which would have followed a slightly different route to the previous scheme in some areas without a tunnel at Chilworth. South of St James's Park at this time Didcot, Newbury and Station (now Stratton) Roads were named. Station Road also contain a Police Station.https://fosjp.org.uk/category/shirley-heritage- project/ Nothing ultimately came of any of the railway scehemes in this araea, which finally petered out prior to World War One.

The Kharta valley starts at the col at Lhakpa La at the head of the Kharta Glacier from which the Kharta Chu river flows east to join the Phung Chu just beyond Khata village. Nearby to the south, the Kama valley starts at the Kangshung Glacier at the foot of Everest's Kangshung Face, and the Kama Chu flows southeast to the Phung Chu. The 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition discovered Kharta when reconnoitring ways to climb Mount Everest and managed to reach the North Col via the Lhakpa La. Since that time Kharta has not been used as a way to approach the summit of Everest but the two valleys have become a popular area for trekking. Geography alt= Starting at at Lhakpa La the Kharta Glacier descends about over a distance of some to its snout. The mountain Khartaphu is on the north of the col with Lakpa Ri () and Kartse () to the south. A second glacier descends from Kharta Changri () to the north, converging into the main glacier. Beyond and below the Lhakpa La to the west is the East Rongbuk Glacier, the traditional route for ascending Everest from the north. The glacial river Kharta Chu\\"Chu\\" is Tibetan for river goes east for the length of the valley and then flows into the Phung Chu at a height of . The Phung Chu (called the Arun river in Nepal) descends a deep gorge as it cuts through Himalaya to join the Kosi River above Chatra Gorge. The Kama valley lies to the south, at its head being the Kangshung Glacier at the foot of the Kangshung Face of Everest. Kama Chu descends the valley southeast and somewhat parallel with Kharta Chu. Several passes cross north-south between the two valleys, the main ones being Karpo La, Langma La and Shao La.\\"La\\" means col or pass in Tibetan Kharta and Kama lie in the Mahalangur Himal region of Himalaya in Tingri in Xigaz√™ prefecture of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. The region is in what was the traditional Tibetan province of √ú-Tsang. 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition alt=Eight men by two tents. Members of the expedition at the 5200-metre advanced base camp in the Kharta valley 1921 expedition photograph of Kama valley The expedition was initially based at Tingri to the north of Everest from where the northern and western approaches were explored. While the surveyors and climbers carried out this work, the leader of the expedition, Charles Howard-Bury headed back east to find a suitable base for exploration from the east of the mountain. Knowing by this time that the North Col was a likely good route, Howard-Bury found the glacial Kharta Chu which he guessed might originate from the North Col. He returned to Tingri and then the whole expedition moved to Kharta. From there various parties explored the Kharta and Kama valleys (see maps) eventually discovering that the Kama Chu came from the unscalable Kangshung Face. It turned out that the Kharta Chu came not from the North Col but from the Lhakpa La. Reaching this col they found that the only way from there to the North Col was to descend some 1200 feet to the upper East Rongbuk Glacier and climb back up to the North Col. This climb was achieved by George Mallory, Guy Bullock and Oliver Wheeler on 24 September 1921 but they could get no further and had an arduous return. They found that, compared with the cold barrenness of the Rongbuk valley north of Everest, the Kharta and, even more noticeably, the Kama valleys were warm and verdant. Rhododendron, and scrub birch and juniper cover the valley slopes and willow borders the lower streams. On a practical level they were well afforested with plenty of wood for fuel - at Rongbuk the only fuel had been yak dung. Possible childhood home of Tenzing Norgay Tenzing Norgay, 1953 In his autobiography, Nepali Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, one of the first two people to climb Everest, has said he was born in the Nepalese village of Thame near Namche Bazaar. However, according to some commentators starting with Ed Webster and including Tenzing's grandson, he was actually born in Tibet at Tse ChuTse Chu is marked on the map at the head of the article. in the Kama valley near Makalu, his mother having been visiting the monastery of Namdag Lhe Phodang at Ghang La also in the Kama valley. As a young child he lived at Moyun, in the Kharta valley, where his father herded yaks. The herd succumbed to disease and as a child Tenzing went to Nepal to work for a Sherpa family in Khumbu. . Trekking The Kharta and Kama valleys are within the Qomolangma National Nature Preserve and provide a quieter area for trekking than Everest Base Camp in the Rongbuk valley. The Kama valley and the Kangshung Face tend to be the focus of the treks but the approach is from the Kharta valley which is returned to after a round tour. Many organisations offer trekking holidays and these are often part bookings on a larger organised expedition. A track passable by four-wheeled drives leaves the Friendship Highway at Tingri from where tickets are available for the guarded Nature Preserve. The track leads to the village of Kharta. The trek may either be by backpacking or after hiring yaks at the villageMany yaks used for trekking are dzo - a cross with a cow. Most yaks are now domesticated and few wild yaks, drong, remain. A route typically taken (see map) goes up the valley via Yuluk and Yulba and then heads south over Shao La and descends to Kama Chu. The trail ascends the Kama valley with Chomolonzo and Makalu to the south and eventually reaching the Kangshung Glacier to see the Kangshung Face - the glacier has retreated considerably since the 1921 expedition. The return is made over Langma La back to Kharta Chu and then, passing through Lhundrubling, heads eastwards to the start. A local guide is essential (required by the authorities except for organised tours) and the journey on foot or yak takes about 10 days.

He was the son of Eelke Tabes Hinxt, a merchant captain from the city of Dokkum. Hinxt died on the ship of war , due to the wounds he received during the battle of Camperdown.  Merchant captain  Dooitze Eelkes Hinxt was born in a Roman Catholic family.Dirk Hendrik Kolff, Driftig van spraak, levendig van gang: herinneringen van marineofficier Dirk Hendrik Kolff (1761‚Äì1835), ed. V. A. J. Klooster (Zutphen: Walburg Pers, 2011), 190. His father was a merchant captain, who sailed in Europe, often to the Baltic countries. Dooitze Hinxt probably learned navigation skills aboard the ship of his father. In the years 1764‚Äì1780 Hinxt sailed on his own koff, the Aemelia Dorothea.  In the service of the Frisian Admiralty  The cutter Snelheid In 1782, Hinxt joined the Admiralty of Friesland. He became a lieutenant and was given command of the cutter Snelheid. This was a small ship, with copper sheathing, 12 guns and a crew of 60 men. The Snelheid was indeed a fast ship, and Hinxt often organized matches for speed with other ships.Thea Roodhuyzen, De Amdiraliteit van Friesland (Franeker: Van Wijnen, 2003), 39. In the years 1783‚Äì1785, Hinxt sailed for the Dutch colony of Essequibo in Latin-America. In the years 1787‚Äì1789, he sailed to the Mediterranean Sea, where he visited the Aegean Islands, among other places. On 23 December 1789, Hinxt was promoted to Captain. In the years 1792‚Äì1794, he visited Essequibo and the Mediterranean a second time. In September 1794, Hinxt joined a fleet near Flushing to await the French forces from the South. Hinxt was known to be a good navigator, but he wasn't a good military man. Yet in 1794, he collided with the ship of war Walcheren (capt. Marinus J. Haringman). The side of the Snelheid became badly damaged. Captain Haringman (and other officers with him) acted arrogantly towards Hinxt and his small cutter and refused to pay the repair costs. In the end, the issue was solved when Admiral Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen got involved. Meanwhile, Hinxt was ready for a new ship. In a letter he complained because he was wet all the time, with wet clothes in a wet cabin, and the decks were never dry. =Marriages= Hinxt married Anna Gerrits from the city of Leeuwarden in 1763. After her death he married Elisabeth Annes de Haan in 1769. She also died young, due to complications of childbirth. Hinxt married again in 1790, with Catharina Joris de Haan (Elisabeth's sister?), who was also born in Leeuwarden. The couple moved to the city of Harlingen. Hinxt had three children, but in 1797 only his daughter Anna Maria survived.Dirk Hendrik Kolff, Driftig van spraak, levendig van gang: herinneringen van marineofficier Dirk Hendrik Kolff (1761‚Äì1835), ed. V.A.J. Klooster (Zutphen: Walburg Pers, 2011), 190.  In the service of the Batavian Navy  When hostilities broke out between the Dutch Patriots party and the Orangist party in 1787, Hinxt had not openly supported a cause. Old letters reveal that he did have contacts with the Patriot party. So when the patriots seized power in 1795, it was clear to Hinxt that he would join the Batavian Navy.Thea Roodhuyzen, Thea Roodhuyzen, De Amdiraliteit van Friesland (Franeker: Van Wijnen, 2003), 40. In 1796 Hinxt was given command of the ship Beschermer. This was a ship of war with 56 guns, and a crew of 350 men. The ship became part of a fleet under Admiral Jan Willem de Winter, which was made ready for an invasion of Ireland. The fleet was meant to sail for Brest first, to combine with a French fleet.

Deramas, starring Iza Calzado, Zanjoe Marudo and Jodi Sta. Maria. The film was named after the Guy and Pip's doll of the same name. Plot The film opens with the spiritual blessing of the new building of Little Magnolia School. The city mayor, one of the guests, warned the school's owner, Stanley Pardo (Dante Ponce), of the school's past incident where a student died. Stanley's wife, Faith (Iza Calzado), is in the school's restroom when a ghost of a boy appeared. On the next day, three parents, Faith, one of the school teachers Julio (Zanjoe Marudo), and Stella (Jodi Sta. Maria) mourned the deaths of their respective daughters: Maria (Rhed Bustamante), Leonora (JC Movido), and Teresa (Juvy Lyn Bison) after a tragic accident happened during the school's field trip. To help cope with their loss, a psychiatrist named Manolo Apacible (Cris Villanueva) offers life-sized talking dolls to look after. At first, Faith and Stella immediately refused the dolls for bearing such physical resemblance to their daughters the similar speech patterns and voices disturbed them and causing further grief. Julio, on the other hand, accepts the offer. Julio starts to see the effect of his doll to him. He shares his fast recovery to Stella and Faith. Faith took Julio's advice and takes her the \\"Maria\\" doll. Stella still refused to take her doll but eventually accepts it when her cheating husband, Don (Joem Bascon), took the doll when Manolo offered it to him. The three grieving parents start to recover with the dolls but hauntings starts to happen around them. The hauntings start with one of Faith's housemaids, Don and Stella's housemaid, Don himself, and one of Julio's students. The school's principal reprimands Julio for bringing his doll to class, scaring students and concerning their parents. Faith reveals to Stanley that she is pregnant. Stanley suggests to dispose Faith's doll. The dolls becomes more sinister when they start to kill people. It begins when Leonora kills the school principal, and Maria planting pencils to the stairs and luring Faith that could cause her to fall and miscarry her baby. Maria's plan failed when one of the housemaids, intercepts Faith and cleaned the pencils. Teresa starts a killing frenzy with Don and her mistress. She failed to kill Don and his mistress' son when authorities heard the screaming and starts entering the crime scene. Don is in critical condition and eventually dies. Maria targets the housemaid who foiled her plan and starts stabbing her, causing 27 stab wounds. The housemaid manage to take pictures before losing consciousness. Faith and Stella blame Julio for offering the dolls and past incidents. Julio is in denial of the dolls' involvement. Faith opens up the past school incident where the three of them are involved; Julio storms off claiming he is not involved in the incident. Teresa kills her grandmother by impaling a sword from a St. Michael statue to her forehead. Faith's other housemaid also noticed the hauntings and refers Faith to her cousin, Augusto, who is a witch doctor. Augusto diagnosed that the dolls are controlled by a person with knowledge in powerful witchcraft. Stella and her brother start packing their things and prepare to leave but Teresa starts another killing frenzy but failed to kill Stella. Faith asks Stella to come and meet her in Augusto's place. Augusto conducts a seance and found out the name of the ghost that haunted Faith in the beginning of the film. The ghost is revealed to be Eldon Jacinto, the student who died during the past incident in the school. It is revealed that Eldon is the son of Manolo and Manolo is the one controlling the dolls. Leonora lures Julio to Manolo's place and knocks him out. The three dolls meet and kill Stanley. Augusto suggests to battle Manolo and end his spell. When they arrive, they are shocked to see Julio tied. They were knocked out by the dolls. When they wake up, Manolo shared his plan to deliver vengeance for the death of his son. Manolo plotted his revenge against the three parents who are involved in the death of Eldon and depriving him of justice. Eldon has an ability to see the future and one of his visions is the school incident. He shared his vision to his classmates causing panic. Julio punished Eldon for spreading the rumor by locking him to a classroom next to a science laboratory. The science laboratory was reported to have a gas leak and a janitor recklessly lights a cigarette causing an explosion. Before the explosion, Eldon warned the alive Teresa to stay away from the classroom. Teresa told this to Stella but dismisses it since Stella made a lot of favors to the school because of Teresa's failing marks. Stanley and Faith attempt to cover up the incident by bribing the police investigating the incident and attempts to silence Eldon's guardian. Manolo was abroad when his son died. Manolo tries to finish his ritual to turn the parents into dolls but Julio managed to untie himself and disrupt the ritual. Julio unties the others. Manolo recovers and orders the dolls to attack them. The three parents fight their dolls and Augusto battles Manolo. Faith and Stella successfully destroyed their dolls but Julio let Leonora escape. Manolo overpowers Augusto and impales Julio with a spear. Faith and Stella took Eldon's body and give him a proper burial and blessing. Manolo appears before the two and attempts to kill them but Julio appears and delivers a killing blow to Manolo before dying. The film ends when Stella and Faith visit Julio's grave. Faith successfully gave birth and Stella adopted Don's illegitimate son. In the mid-credits scene, another parent is grieving from the death of her child from the field trip incident. She is approached by Julio the same way how Manolo approached them. The scene shifts to black when the doll box contains the Leonora doll. Cast =Main cast= Jodi Sta.

Other languages in the region include New Mexican Spanish, Navajo, and numerous other Native American (mostly Puebloan) languages. History After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, all of New Mexico's inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next 100 years, the number of English speakers increased, especially because of trade routes: Old Spanish Trail and the Santa Fe Trail. New Mexico was culturally isolated after the New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War. Aside from the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, the isolation was similar to the time that New Mexico was culturally isolated from the rest of Spanish America. In 1910, English became the most-widely spoken language in New Mexico, but New Mexican Spanish remains throughout the state and so is given a special status of recognition. After statehood, the Spanish dialect continued to evolve, alongside newcomers, because of increases in travel, for example, along U.S. Route 66. Some words, such as coyote, have become loanwords into American English after they had been so prevalent in New Mexican English.  Phonology  According to 2006 dialect research, Albuquerque and Santa Fe natives speak Western American English but with a local development: a full‚Äìfool merger (or near-merger) in which pool, for example, merges with pull. In this north-central region of the state, studies have also documented a local type of Chicano English, Northern New Mexico Chicano English, primarily spoken by rural Hispanic New Mexicans and characterized by a unique vowel shift. Such studies show that the English of bilingual New Mexican Chicanos has been found to have a lower/shorter/weaker voice-onset time than that of typical monolingual New Mexicans and that the former are more likely to show monophthongization of . Vocabulary Scholarship on the English of New Mexico mentions mostly the region's unique vocabulary. The vocabulary of the Spanish and Native American languages has mixed with the English of New Mexico, leading to unique loanwords and interjections. Multiple places across New Mexico also have names originating from various language other than English, including New Mexican Spanish, Navajo, and Tiwa; thus, some places have multiple names. =Words and phrases= Some characteristic usage in English (often borrowed from Spanish): Spanish arroyo ('gulch', 'creek') is frequently used in the English of New Mexico, as on this sign, for a drainage ditch whether natural or paved. * a la m√°quina (literally \\"to the machine\\" in Spanish): usually used as a startled expression, sometimes shortened to a la * acequia : the word for ditch in Spanish, common within the entire Rio Grande Valley * canales : Spanish for rain and street gutters, heard in the northern parts of the state * coke: any generic carbonated soft drink, as also commonly is used in Southern American English; in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, however, it is often soda * coraz√≥n : the word for heart in Spanish, can be connotative of sweetheart, darling, courage, or spirit * howdy (contraction of \\"how do you do?\\"): used as a greeting in Southern American English and throughout rural New Mexico * nana: a term for one's grandmother, much more widely common that elsewhere in the U.S.Grieve, Jack et al. (2013). \\"Site-restricted web searches for data collection in regional dialectology\\". American Speech 88: 413-440. Draft pp. 40, 42. * o s√≠ (seguro) : literally \\"oh yeah (sure)\\" in Spanish, is used either as an ironic reaction or as a sincere questioning of a statement * ombers : an interjection commonly used to express playful disapproval or shaming of another, similar to tsk tsk * sick to the stomach: from Northern American English, a term to describe feeling very upset, worried, or angry * vigas: Spanish for rafters, especially common in the north of the state =Miscellaneous features= * Or what and or no are added to ends of sentences to emphasize or seek confirmation of the prior question, as in \\"Can you see, or no?\\" or \\"Are we late, or what?\\" * New Mexico chile has had such a large impact on New Mexico's cultural heritage that it has even been entered into the Congressional Record, spelled chile, not chili.

But then two samaritans Captain Paritosh Chauhan and Akhilesh Agarwal approached the administration to allow them to repair it so that the mechanical clock is not replaced with an electronic one. It was Captain Chauhan's passion and love for his city that he requested the then DM, Amit Ghosh to give him a chance to repair it.

Information security  Like many other former \\"black hat\\" hackers, such as Kevin Mitnick, Tunney has participated in both sides of cybersecurity (\\"black hat\\" and \\"white hat\\"). In Tunney's case, this was first as a computer hacker, and then later in life, as a volunteer fixing security vulnerabilities in open source software. = Oogle and Rampage Toolz = In 1999, at the age of 14, then operating under the online name \\"Oogle\\", Note: Tunney was known as Justin at the time she developed Rampage Toolz. Tunney built \\"Rampage Toolz 2.o\\" for exploiting security vulnerabilities in AOL and sending spam. Tunney said Rampage Toolz was the most popular third-party AOL \\"prog\\" at the time. She ran ads on her site, and at the height of the dot-com boom earned hundreds of dollars a month from them, which as a teenager she did not know what to do with. Tunney has stated that she had never heard of Google at the time, and the similar name \\"Oogle\\" was just a coincidence. Tunney published screenshots of Rampage Toolz and its Oogle.net website, and source code for the tool, after the statute of limitations had expired. = Operation Rosehub = In 2016, then an employee of Google, Tunney discovered that some open source projects on GitHub were vulnerable to a security vulnerability that had been discovered five months previously, in a software library those projects used called Apache Commons Collections. She started raising pull requests on GitHub to fix the problems and recruiting more volunteers, and as the scale of the problem became apparent, the team of volunteers swelled to 50 Google employees, working on their 20% time. Ultimately Tunney and her coworkers used BigQuery to discover all vulnerable GitHub software projects, and discovered that 2,600 projects were at that time directly or indirectly vulnerable, and sent out pull requests to them to close the security holes. She also raised public awareness of the severe cybersecurity threat posed by continued use of the vulnerable versions of the libraries in a subsequent post on the Google Open Source blog about the effort, noting that the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency had recently been hacked with ransomware due to their usage of a vulnerable version of Apache Commons Collections.  Activities around political and social issues  = Occupy Wall Street = In 2011, Kalle Lasn, founder of the left-wing magazine Adbusters, put out a call to activists to occupy Wall Street, in response to the perceived political corruption of American democracy by Wall Street, in the context of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Tunney was one of the first individuals to respond to Lasn's call, quickly creating the @occupywallst Twitter handle and occupywallst.org web site on July 14, 2011, which became the main online hub for the Occupy movement.  2014 - Tunney locks down Occupy Wall Street Twitter account In February 2014, Tunney took back exclusive control of the Occupy Wall Street Twitter account, which she had originally created, removing posting access to most of the activists who previously had access. She stated that she was a \\"founding organizer\\" of the movement. She wrote that she locked down the Twitter account partly in order to keep it from being just a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party. She also said that a large number of Twitter users were being misogynist and transphobic against her.  Tunney's subsequent statements about Occupy Wall Street activists  Tunney has described Occupy Wall Street as a far-left movement. Her former comrades have described her as a technocratic fascist. She has written that she viewed those activists within Occupy Wall Street who disagreed with her \\"taking initiative\\" in the OWS movement, and who sat in meetings \\"trying to devise ways to boss [her] around\\", as \\"unskilled unintelligent parasites\\". =Support for the Gamergate movement= Tunney has been a vocal supporter of the Gamergate movement. She contributed to an unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign to create a Gamergate movement website, and has posted in support of the Gamergate movement on the Occupy Wall Street Twitter account. = Political writing = Tunney is a prolific blogger and Twitter user who often writes about political topics on Twitter, on her personal blogs, and on other websites. Her political writing is sometimes controversial or extreme - to such a degree that The Daily Dot, Vice and various Twitter users, have speculated that she might be trolling, or performing online performance art, and might not be expressing sincerely held views. The Daily Dot cited Tunney saying that \\"free speech rights should only be respected for techies\\", and not for progressives; and \\"Hopefully, I'll live to see a day when all the muckraking progressive reporters/bloggers are sent to prisons\\". Tunney has characterised some of her activities as \\"trolling\\" multiple times since March 2014. In response to a question put to her on ASKfm in regards to the asker's suspicion that Tunney was trying to \\"deliberately piss off liberals\\", Tunney wrote an answer that included the sentence \\"My favorite tactic for trolling progressives, is simply to not use their newspeak.\\" Tunney has also said that \\"Trolling is the only way to get away with saying certain things under the current regime\\". Tunney has said that she is \\"an entirely different person offline\\".  Petition to install a \\"CEO of America\\"  In 2014, Tunney petitioned the US government on We the People to hold a referendum asking for support to retire all government employees with full pensions, transfer administrative authority to the technology industry, and appoint Google chairman, Eric Schmidt as CEO of America. Tunney worked as a software engineer at Google until December 2018, according to her Linkedin.https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtunney The petition expired because it failed to meet We The People's signature threshold.

Nato Thompson, ‚ÄúBas Jan Ader Please Don't Leave Me‚Äù, Bomb (magazine), Summer 2007 The work includes a three-minute black-and-white silent film, still photographs and a post card all related to him crying for an unknown reason. The photographs include both a short hair version and a long hair version. The post cards were mailed to his friends with the inscription ‚ÄúI'm too sad to tell you‚Äù.Cindy Loehr, ‚ÄúBas Jan Ader: Retrospective‚Äù, New Art Examiner, March 2000 There was an original, now lost, version of the film called Cry Claremont. It was shown in the Pomona College Gallery in Claremont, California in 1971-72.Christophe Cherix, In & Out of Amsterdam: Travels in Conceptual Art, 1960-1976, MOMA, 2009, In conjunction with the title of the work, the reason for his sadness was never stated. Composition and history The work's original form was a silent black and white movie that was filmed outdoors in 1970, apparently in front of Ader's house. The movie was shown in Claremont college, but has since been lost. A still from the movie, however, was extracted and made into a post card. It shows Ader with his head in his hand crying. The back of the post card had the written inscription ‚ÄúI'm too sad to tell you‚Äù. It was dated September 13, 1970. The card was mailed to a number of Ader's friends. The image has also been reproduced in a photographic version with the inscription written in the lower right hand corner. The post card and photograph have become iconic of the work and a symbol that many artists have emulated (see Influence below). A second version of the film was made in Amsterdam in 1971. This was more of a performance with Ader appearing to be calm before the shooting and rubbing his eyes during the filming to produce tears and build emotional intensity. Ten minutes of film was shot with the final version edited to about three and a half minutes. The edited version captures Ader at his most anguished. His face is framed closely. There is no introduction or conclusion, no reason given and no relief from the anguish that is presented. Critics have said that it is hard not to be affected by the film, with its offering of ‚Äúraw passion to anyone willing to watch‚Äù. Critical interpretation The work has inspired many critical interpretations and analysis. There seems to be an overall tension between the sincerity of the artist's captured emotions and performance aspects of the works. Artists James Roberts and Collier Schorr, for example, feel the works are at once intensely personal and yet very arbitrary. There was a true reason for Ader's sadness, but that is not shared with us.James Roberts and Collier Schorr, ‚ÄúBas Jan Ader‚Äù, frieze (magazine), June 1994 Bruce Hainley, contributing editor to Artforum, thinks the reasons for his sadness are beside the point. In his view, Ader walks a fine line between sincerity (the sadness is real) and melodrama (the work is staged multiple times). J√∂rg Heiser, coeditor of Frieze, views the work as an ironic statement of the artist taking on all of the embarrassment of the expressed emotion while leaving it open as to whether or not the viewer takes on the embarrassment as well. Women reviewers have been more critical. Jennifer Doyle in her book Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art feels the work may be seen as real due to the tradition of the ‚Äúmelancholy white male artist‚Äù. She sees this in contrast to how a woman would have been perceived as either acting or in hysterics.Jennifer Doyle, Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art, Duke University Press, 12 March 2013 Journalist Betty van Garrel goes so far as to say (in translation) \\"Ader is a sentimental loser, a romantic softie, a problem case and not even original in that.\\"Samuel Klaus, \\"Bas Jan Ader, Lost at Sea\\", LAS Magazine, 7 September 2007 Influence I'm too sad to tell you has influenced a large number of artists, with many composing interpretations and homages to the work.

Sources written by German people (for example Hitler) are also prioritised over those by Native American peoples themselves. Since the 18th century, this fascination with imaginary Native Americans has had specific influences on German popular culture, environmentalism, literature, art, historical reenactment, theatrical and film depictions of Indigenous Americans. Hartmut Lutz coined the term, Indianthusiasm, for this phenomenon.German professor lectures on his country's \\"Indianthusiasm\\", by Darlene Chrapko Sweetgrass Writer, Volume: 19 Issue: 12 Year: 2012, Aboriginal Multi-Media Society AMMSA CanadaLutz, Hartmut: \\"German Indianthusiasm: A Socially Constructed German National(ist) Myth\\" in: Germans and Indians: Fantasies, Encounters, Projections, ed. Colin Gordon Calloway, Gerd Gemnden, Susanne Zantop, Lincoln, Nebraska: U of Nebraska Press, 2002, . After the Second World War, Indianthusisam served as a way of coping with the guilt, and avoiding taking responsibility for, the Holocaust, through both escapism into a fantasy past and blame-shifting the burden of genocidal qualities onto the victors of World War II. In 1985, Lutz invented the term Deutsche Indianert√ºmelei (\\"German Indian Enthusiasm\\") for the phenomenon.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.12 The phrase Indianert√ºmelei is a reference to the German term Deutschet√ºmelei (\\"German Enthusiasm\\") which mockingly describes the phenomenon of celebrating in an excessively nationalistic and romanticized manner Deutschtum (\\"Germanness\\"). It has been connected with German ideas of tribalism, nationalism and Kulturkampf. Background  Indianer by August Macke = Projections of sentiments = East Germans at an Indianistikmeeting in Schwerin, 1982 H. Glenn Penny states a striking sense, for over two centuries, of affinity among Germans for their ideas of what American Indians are like. According to him, those affinities stem from German polycentrism, notions of tribalism, longing for freedom, and a melancholy sense of \\"shared fate.\\"University of Iowa entry Penny, H. Glenn, Kindred by Choice: Germans and American Indians since 1800, Chapel Hill, North Carolina: U of North Carolina, 2013, . In the 17th and 18th centuries, German intellectuals' image of Native American was based on earlier heroes such as those of the Greeks, the Scythians, or the Polish struggle for independence (as in Polenschw√§rmerei) as a base for their projections. The then popular recapitulation theory on the evolution of ideas was also involved.Saul, Nicholas, Schwellen: germanistische Erkundungen einer Metapher, W√ºrzburg: K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 1999, . Such sentiments underwent ups and downs. Philhellenism, rather strong around 1830, faced a setback when the actual Greeks did not fulfill the classic ideals.Zimmermann, Tanja, Der Balkan zwischen Ost und West: Mediale Bilder und kulturpolitische Pr√§gungen, Cologne/Weimar: B√∂hlau, 2013, , p. 29 Antisemitism and pro-Indian stances did not necessarily exclude each other in Germany. In the 1920s, Anton Kuh's mockery of a contrast between Asphalt und Scholle (asphalt and clod), urban literature referred to metropolitan Jews and rural- inspired Heimatschutz writings. Much of German nationalism glorified ideas of \\"tribalism\\", using heroes of Germanic mythology and folklore such as Sigurd and Arminius, and attempting to position itself as an alternative role model to the colonial empires of the time (and the Roman past) by trying to convey the ideal of a colonizer loved by the colonized. After 1880, Catholic publishers had a specific role in publicizing Karl May's fictional Indian stories. The way May described Native Americans was seen as helpful to better integrate German Catholics, which were \\"a tribe on their own\\" and faced Kulturkampf controversies with the Protestant dominated authorities and elite. H. Glenn Penny's Kindred By Choice treats the image and changing role of masculinity connected to Indians in Germany besides a (mutually assumed) longing for freedom and a melancholy sense of shared doom. Johann Gottfried Seume (1763-1810) was among the Hessian mercenaries contracted by the British government for military service in Canada and wrote about his encounters with Native Americans in his autobiography. His admiration for naturality and a description of a Huron as a noble but sort of frank man is part of his poem \\"Der Wilde\\" (the savage) which became well known in Germany.Germany and the Americas: O-Z, Thomas Adam, ABC-CLIO, 01.01.2005, p. 968 Seume is also among the first to use the words \\"Canada\\" and Kultur (culture) in today's meaning in German. Seume's Huron has stereotypical characteristics used as well for Germanic people of old ‚Äì he drinks mead and wears a bear skin and uses a sort of blunt didactic on an unfriendly European settler.Puszkar, Norbert, \\"Johann Gottfried Seume's 'Der Wilde'. Homely/Unhomely Encounters in the Wilderness\\", Lessing Yearbook 2008/2009, American Lessing Society Seume had actually met some Micmac, but in his poems he used tribe names with symbolic significance. Hurons (Wyandot people) stood in the contemporary poetry for the noble savage, Mohawks for the brute. = Wandervogel and youth movement = A group photo of Circus Sarrasani Sioux on board the steamship Westphalia The German Empire saw the rise of the German youth movement, especially the Wandervogel, as an antimodern culture criticism.Howard Paul Becker.

OCLC 761549797 The German image of Indians again projected German beliefs and dreams about a bucolic past onto them. Authenticity, living free and close to nature, was among those aims. It closely interacted with outdoor meetings, games, songs and even commercial Wild West shows, as by Buffalo Bill and other various media. Austrian Christian Feest attributes the popularity of the Indian in the German youth movement to the then all-European impact of late-19th-century human zoos.Feest, Christian, ed. (1989). Indians and Europe. An Interdisciplinary Collection of Essays. Aachen: Rader Verlag / Edition Herodot. . The first actual Indians came to Germany in the 19th century.

The image of the warrior turned Christian went down well with the public and Conway became a media star in Germany. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recommended him to the leftist poet Ferdinand Freiligrath. Villa B√§renfett Radebeul, entrance to the Indian collection Other Native Americans arrived with human zoos and took part in shows in zoological gardens and circuses.

Painter and author Rudolf Cronau, a personal friend of Sitting Bull,Museum of Nebraska Art, Rudolf Daniel Ludwig Cronau (1855‚Äì1939) invited members of the Hunkpapa Lakota, who came to Europe in 1886. Buffalo Bill's European shows in 1890 and between 1903 and 1907 involved several hundred Indians and were quite popular in Germany. Edward Two-Two, a Lakota-Sioux, worked at the Sarrasani circus in Dresden in 1913/14 and was buried there in 1914 according to his wishes.

August 2006. - Info page , about 200 million copies of May's novels have been sold, half of them in Germany.According to Karl-May-Gesellschaft e. V. He is among the most popular authors of formula fiction in the German language.Stoehn, Ingo Roland: German Literature of the Twentieth Century: From Aestheticism to Postmodernism, Boydell & Brewer, 2001, p.19 These specifically German fantasies and projectionsColin Gordon Calloway, Gerd Gem√ºnden, Susanne Zantop (ed.): Germans and Indians. Fantasies, encounters, projections. Lincoln, Nebraska: U of Nebraska Press, 2002, . about Indianer have influenced generations of Germans. Indianer refers to Native Americans in the United States, and also to natives of the Pacific, Central and Latin America, and \\"Red Indians\\" in the stereotypical sense. Karl May found admirers among such different personalities as Ernst Bloch, Peter Handke and Adolf Hitler, but has almost no presence in English-speaking countries. His most famous books, mainly about the Wild West with a fictional Apache, Winnetou, among the main characters, were at first deemed 19th-century pulp fiction. Winnetou was described by some as \\"an apple Indian\\" (outside red, inside white). However, Karl May never visited America, or had any direct contact with Native American people, before he wrote these influential works. May drew his inspiration among other sources from Balduin M√∂llhausen, who had traveled in the Rocky Mountains in 1850 with Duke Paul Wilhelm of W√ºrttemberg, and George Catlin's reports, which were popular in Germany.. Gojko Mitiƒá became famous playing Red Indians in various films for the East German company DEFA, such as The Sons of Great Bear, and was popular in the Eastern bloc. The Karl May festivals (in East and West Germany) gain interest by real Indian guests and partners in the meanwhile. In 2006 the cultural authority of the Mescalero Apaches and the Karl-May-Haus in Hohenstein-Ernstthal made an agreement to cooperate. Films based on May's Winnetou novels were shot from 1962 to 1968, starring Pierre Brice. A parodistic adaptation of the genre, the comedy Der Schuh des Manitu, was among the biggest box office hits in Germany.InsideKino: Die Wahrheit √ºber \\"Der Schuh des Manitu\\" Bravo, Germany's largest teen magazine, awards an annual prize, the Bravo-Otto, in the form of a classic Karl May Indian. = Spiritual and esoteric aspects = At the end of the 19th century, there was a widespread notion of a coming new humanity, building on then-current esoteric myths such as those of Helena Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner as well as on popularly accepted philosophy such as Nietzsche's √úbermensch. May was no esoteric, but a devout (Protestant) Christian, published by Catholic publishing houses. He used Winnetou and other protagonists (Winnetou's mentor Klekih-Petra, a former German 48er, became a member of the Apache tribe) less as 'apple Indians' than as personifications of his dream of a German-Native American synthesis based on shared Christian faith. According to Mays' vision \\"in place of the Yankees, a new man will emerge whose soul is German-Indian\\". This approach is found both in his later novels, such as Winnetou IV, and in public speeches, such as his last speech, given in 1912 and titled \\"Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen\\" (Ascend to the empire of noble men). Austrian novelist Robert M√ºller's 1915 Tropen. Der Mythos der Reise. Urkunden eines deutschen Ingenieurs (Tropics, The myth of travel) is an important early example of a German exotic novel. Here, as in May, the Indians are not just projections of what white Europeans had been (in a mere racist outline of unilineal evolution), but also of what they should be in the future, on a higher level.Tropen. Der Mythos der Reise. Urkunden eines deutschen Ingenieurs. Herausgegeben von Robert M√ºller anno 1915. Hugo Schmidt, M√ºnchen 1915. Reprints 2007: , Reclam 1993 Igel-Verlag 1991 & 1992  Role of the noble warrior image  See also Indian brave Karl Bodmer, Horse Racing of the Sioux (c. 1836) Stereotypical plains Indian warrior at the 1896 (Wilheminian) main post office in Strasbourg Prior to European contact, the Native American population is estimated to have been in the millions. But 1880, the population had been severely impacted by genocide, warfare and disease brought by the colonists. The destruction of communities and culture gave rise to the idea of the \\"Vanishing Indian\\". Theories about the rise and fall of human \\"races\\" (in and beyond Germany) were rather popular in the late 19th century, as a part of science and the eugenics movement, and in esoteric writings by authors such as Helena Blavatsky. Friedrich Nietzsche's popular, The Gay Science praised endurance of pain as a prerequisite of true philosophy. Nietzsche drew parallels between his ideas of contemporary Indians and his preference for Pre-Socratic philosophy and \\"pre-civilized\\", \\"pre-rational\\" thinking. The romantic image of the noble savage or \\"seasoned warrior\\" took hold on Wilhelminian Germany; phrases that originated in this period, such as \\"An Indian knows no pain\\" (Ein Indianer kennt keinen Schmerz), are still in use today, for example to console children at the dentist's. Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and his brothers were members of the Georgekreis The German approach was somewhat different from the Social Darwinism taking place in the majority of American society at the time, as the German stereotypes were more idealized than denigrating. However, Americans have also perpetrated the same, problematic idealization in a parallel tradition of Playing Indian - simultaneously mimicking stereotypical ideas and imagery of \\"Indians\\" and \\"Indianness\\", while also dismissing, and making invisible real, contemporary Indian people. In Germany and America, these hobbyists idealize these archaic and \\"back to the roots\\" stereotypes of Native Americans. Stefan George, a charismatic networker and author, saw (and studied) Indians as role models of his own cosmogony, using ecstatic and unmediated experiences to provide a sacred space for himself and his disciples.Erlebnisdruck: Philosophie und Kunst in einem Bereich des √úbergangs und Untergangs Gerard Visser K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 2005, p. 14ff The Munich Cosmic Circle, an enlarged (compare Fanny zu Reventlow) circle of followers beyond the all-male Georgekreis, became (and made Munich) famous for its lavish parties and happenings ante litteram. George has been quoted with \\"Nietzsche may have known the Greek philosophers, but I am aware about the (Red) Indians\\". In World War I, about 15,000 Native Americans served in the Allied Forces as members of the United States and Canadian armies. Both their own comrades and the enemy shared the stereotypical image of them as a \\"vanishing race\\" but with a strong warrior spirit. German soldiers feared Indian snipers, messengers and shock troops and the Allied troops were already using Indian languages via \\"windtalkers\\" to encode open communication.Thomas A. Britten: American Indians in World War I: at home and at war. Part 570, UNM Press, 1999 World War I propaganda claimed to be quoting a Cherokee soldier, Jo Fixum, with stereotypical, improbable, and offensive language features. By 1940, the Indigenous population in the USA had risen to about 350,000. Because the German government was aware of the Indian communications specialists' abilities, their agents tried to use anthropologists as spies on reservations to subvert the cultures of some Indian tribes and learn their languages. The pro-Nazi German American Bund tried to persuade Indians not to register for the draft, for example using the swastika with some Native Americans as a symbol depicting good luck in order to gain sympathy. The attempts may have backfired. During World War II, more than 44,000 Native Americans joined the military service, e.g. the 45th Infantry Division (United States), and had all Americans enlisted in similar numbers and with such fervor, conscription would have not been necessary. Indian participation in World War II was extensive, and became part of American folklore and popular culture.American Indians in World War II defense.gov entry Johnny Cash's recording of The Ballad of Ira Hayes, which commemorates the Pima soldier of the title who was one of the six men who raised the American flag on Iwo Jima, also became popular in Germany. Like Cash himself, who had been a GI in Bavaria, soldiers formerly or currently based in Germany played a role in German-Native American relations. Veterans are highly honored in most Native American communities, and many who serve in tribal government are veterans.  \\"Indianthusiasm\\", hobbyists and politics Rathen Open Air Stage had a v√∂lkisch origin Willy Michl, who calls himself an \\"Isar Indian\\", Munich, 2010 Czech people portraying Indians in a kohte, 30th anniversary of the Triptis Indianistik meeting, 1988 There was a widespread cultural passion for Native Americans in Germany throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. \\"Indianthusiasm\\" contributed to the evolution of German national identity.Usbeck, Frank, Fellow Tribesmen: The Image of Native Americans, National Identity, and Nazi Ideology in Germany, forthcoming 2015, . Long before German unification in 1871, it had been widely assumed in German nationalists that an unified Reich would also have a colonial empire, and many of the debates at the proto-parliament in Frankfurt in 1848-49 concerned colonialist ambitions.Grewling, Nicole \\"Blood Brothers? Indians and the Construction of a German Colonial Self in Friedrich Gerst√§cker's Fiction\\" from The Arkansas Historical Quarterly Vol. 73, Issue 1, Spring 2014 p.91 In the late 19th century, a recurring complaint in Germany was that the Reich had a relatively small colonial empire compared to other nations, especially Great Britain.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.14 As a result, \\"Indianthusiasm\\" served as a sort of Handlungsersatz-an untranslatable term meaning a surrogate for an action that substitutes for real power. Many of the colonial adventure stories in 19th century Germany had as their theme \\"stories of sexual conquest and surrender, love and blissful domestic relations between colonizer and colonized, set in colonial territory, stories that made the strange familiar and the familiar 'familial'\\".Grewling, Nicole \\"Blood Brothers? Indians and the Construction of a German Colonial Self in Friedrich Gerst√§cker's Fiction\\" from The Arkansas Historical Quarterly Vol. 73, Issue 1, Spring 2014 p.92 The theme of \\"Indianthusiasm\\" suggested that Germans would be better and more kinder imperialists because they genuinely cared about and were interested in the cultures of non-white peoples unlike the \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" powers of Great Britain, Canada, and the United States who mistreated the Indians of North America. A popular theme of Indianthusiasm novels under the Second Reich were stories of German immigrants settling in rugged places such as the wilderness of Canada, where Auslandsdeutschtum (\\"Germanness abroad\\") served as a civilizing force that tamed the wilderness while also simultaneously offered up a very romanticized picture of the First Nations of Canada as \\"noble savages\\".Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.15 The idealized picture of the Indians of Canada as having an innate moral nobility served as a critique of modernity. Most notably, the image of the Canadian Indians as a \\"noble, but dying races\\" suffering from the cruel misrule of the British Empire not only allowed the authors of these books to paint the Germans as better imperialists than the British, but also allowed them to resolve the dilemma that the \\"civilizing process\\" began by German immigrants that is celebrated in these novels also meant the end of the traditional lifestyles of the First Nations by putting the latter down to the British. Imagery of Native Americans was appropriated in Nazi propaganda and used both against the US and to promote a \\"holistic understanding of Nature\\" among Germans, which gained widespread support from various segments of the political spectrum in Germany.Usbeck, Frank, \\"Learning from 'Tribal Ancestors': How the Nazis Used Indian Imagery to Promote a 'Holistic' Understanding of Nature among Germans\\", Elohi. Peuples Indig√®nes et Environnement, Vol. 4. 2014. 45-60.Usbeck, Frank, \\"Clash of Cultures? 'Noble Savages' in Germany and America\\", in: Iris Edenheiser and Astrid Nielsen (eds.), Tecumseh, Keokuk, Black Hawk. Portrayals of Native Americans in Times of Treaties and Removal. Stuttgart/Dresden: Arnoldsche, 2013, , pp. 177-84. The connection between anti-American sentiment and sympathetic feelings toward the underprivileged but authentic Indians is common in Germany, and it was to be found among both Nazi propagandists such as Goebbels and left-leaning writers such as Nikolaus Lenau as well. During the German Autumn in 1977, an anonymous text by a leftist G√∂ttinger Mescalero spoke positively of the murder of German attorney general Siegfried Buback and used the positive image of Stadtindianer (Urban Indians) within the radical left.\\"Warum Klaus H√ºlbrock in Weimar 'Goethes Gurkentruppe' etablieren will\\".Paul, Reimar, \\"68er-Debatte: Streit der H√§uptlinge\\" Tagesspiegel, 30 January 2001. After the Second World War, Indianthusisam served as a surrogate for guilt about the Holocaust. After 1945, the \\"Wild West\\" of the 19th century became a historical zone in German popular imagination where it was the victors in World War II who were committing genocide. The 19th century \\"Wild West\\" became for Germans in the 1950s-1960s a \\"distant, vaguely defined past\\" where it was the Americans who were perpetuating genocide while German immigrants to the United States like May's cowboy hero Old Shatterhand became the ones who were trying to stop the genocide. There was an implicit tu quoque argument to Indianthusisam in West Germany that nations on the Allied side such as the United States had also committed genocide in the 19th century with the obvious conclusion that therefore there was no reason for the Germans to feel especially guilty about the Holocaust. In East Germany, this message was made explicit where policies of the United States government towards Indians in the 19th century were linked to capitalism, and therefore the treatment of American Indians showed the brutal, rapacious and genocidal nature of American capitalistic imperialism. In East Germany, there were so many films devoted to the subject of the Indians that the term Indianerfilme was coined to describe the genre. In the East German Indianerfilme, the Americans were always the villains while the Indians were always the heroes. More recently, Indianthusiasm has been linked to the rise of environmentalism in Germany, where the traditional lifestyles of the Indians is portrayed in a romantic manner as superior to modern industrial civilization of the West.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.17-19 = Karl May festivals during the Nazi period = In 1938 the first outdoor Karl May festivals took place at the Rathen Open Air Stage. The open-air theatre was laid out in 1936, inspired by the ideas of the Thingspiele movement, which was active in the early stages of the Nazi period. The Thingspiele movement failed in staging neopagan and Nordic mythical aspects of the v√∂lkisch movement, while May's all-Christian legends found more approval with the mainstream. = Communist interpretations = The Communist East German government had major problems with the mixed heritage of May's works: his strong Christian leanings and his broad support, including on the political right. His books were not available for a long time, and \\"indianistic\\" reenactors were closely monitored by the security forces.von Borries, Friedrich; Fischer, Jens-Uwe, Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands, Frankfurt/ Main: Suhrkamp, 2008, , pp. 35-39. The Communist authorities tried to integrate the movement into the socialist world view. Some prominent communist philosophers, such as Karl Marx' friend and sponsor Friedrich Engels, had used Native American tribal structures as examples for theories on family, private property, and the state.Friedrich Engel, Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State, The Iroquois Gens. Engels contributed to the controversy about whether the Native American tribes actually had a notion of private property before the Columbian age.Krech, Shepard, The Ecological Indian: Myth and History, Norton, 1999, . Indianerenthusiasm is now also being found in Russia. In West Germany May's heritage was less problematic; both the books and the festivals were soon copied and reprinted. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg overtook its predecessor in Rathen, as the GDR officials discontinued the tradition there. The Federal Republic experienced some aspects of an idealized Indian image during the Protests of 1968 and the related generation and in the founding phase of Die Gr√ºnen and NGOs like Greenpeace, which have a strong influence in Germany. Cultural critics tended to depict Indians positively to criticize Western society while conflicts of and with actual Native Americans over issues such as fur hunting, slavery, forest fire triggering, non-sustainable practices such as buffalo jumps, seal clubbing and whaling were neglected. The positive image, however, also influenced the self-image of actual Indians. =Hobbyists= Native American hobbyism in Germany, also called Indian Hobbyism, or Indianism, is the performance and attempt at historical reenactment of the American Indian culture of the early contact period, rather than the way contemporary Indigenous peoples of the Americas live.Hagengruber, James (2002). ‚ÄúSitting Bull: Bush-hating Germans might not sing ‚ÄòHail to the Chief,‚Äô but they‚Äôre infatuated with the first Americans‚Äù. Salon.Haircrow, Red (2014). ‚ÄúA Star Trek Convention for Native Enthusiasts: Inside a German Pow Wow‚Äù. Indian Country Today Media Network. The cultures imitated are usually a romantic stereotype of Plains Indian cultures, with widely varying degrees of accuracy; influenced by the stereotypes seen in Hollywood Westerns.Lopinto, Noemi (2009). \\"Der Indianer: Why Do 40,000 Germans spend their weekends dressed as Native Americans?\\". Utne.com . Some of the early to mid 20th century hobbyists gained widespread acclaim as selftaught experts in anything pertaining to the subjects of Native Americana, particularly the Zurich, Switzerland based accountant, Joseph Balmer'The Indian Hobbyist Movement in Europe', inWilcomb E.Washburn (ed.) Handbook of American Indians Vol.4: History of Indian White Relations, Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pp. 562‚Äì569. ‚Äî‚Äî. 1986. This is done by non-Natives as a hobby and pastime, such as for a weekend retreat, hobbyist pow wow, or summer camp.Sieg, Katrin (2002). Ethnic Drag. University of Michigan Press. . It exists in several European countries, but is prominent in Germany, where it has approximately 40,000 practitioners, known as hobbyists, participate. Response to this by actual Native Americans has been largely negative.Deloria, Philip J. (1998). Playing Indian. Yale University Press. .Eddy, Melissa (2014). ‚ÄúLost in Translation: Germany‚Äôs Fascination With the American Old West‚Äù. The New York Times. Background According to the history laid out in H. Glenn Penny's Kindred By Choice,Penny, H. Glenn (2013). Kindred By Choice . The University of North Carolina Press. . many Germans identify their roots as tribes that lived independently of one another that were colonized by Romans and forced to become Christians. Because of this distant tribal background and history of colonization, and in fact all ancient Europeans lived tribally at some point in their history, many of these Germans identify with Native Americans more than European nations in contemporary times.Gilders, Adam (2003). \\"Ich Bin Ein Indianer: Germany's Obsession with a past it never had\\". The Walrus . This belief in kindred lifestyle is detailed in Penny's in-depth study of German fascination with and performances as their ideas of historical Native American peoples. These Germans are also interested in depiction of Native Americans in art and anthropology. Penny covers this history in Kindred By Choice and other published writings, chronicling German artists such as Rudolf Cronau, Max Ernst, Georg Grosz, Otto Dix, and Rudolf Schlichter's portrayals of Native Americans.Penny, H. Glenn (2011). \\"The German Love Affair with American Indians: Rudolf Cronau's Epiphany\\". Common-Place.org. German academics such as Alexander von Humboldt, Karl von den Steinen, Paul Ehrenreich, and Carl Jung all traveled to the United States to learn more about Native Americans. Their documentation of their journeys were regarded positively by the German public and assisted in fostering German fascination with Native Americans. Penny also details how Germans often denounced the violence inflicted upon Native peoples by the United States government. Another factor in the popularity of Hobbyism in Germany can be attributed to the many Wild West shows that toured throughout Germany and featured real Native Americans in stereotypical \\"cowboy and Indian\\" performances.Stetler, Julia Simone (2012). \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West in Germany. A Transnational History\\". University of Nevada, Las Vegas Theses/Dissertations/Professional Papers/Capstones. Paper 1634. One of the most popular Wild West shows was organized by William Frederick \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody. German Hobbyism is generally believed to have been largely popularized by the dime-store novelist Karl May, whose fictional Apache warrior character, Winnetou, and his German blood-brother, Old Shatterhand, adventure throughout the Wild West. In one of the many novels, Winnetou is murdered and Old Shatterhand avenges him and ultimately becomes an Apache chief. The Winnetou novels were first published in the 1890s.Taylor, Colin F.[Dr.]'The Indian Hobbyist Movement in Europe', inWilcomb E.Washburn (ed.) Handbook of American Indians Vol.4: History of Indian White Relations, Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pp. 562‚Äì569. ‚Äî‚Äî. 1986. In the 20th century The first such hobbyist club was the Cowboy Club founded in Munich in 1913.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.16 As part of the phenomenon of Indianert√ºmelei a number of Western and Indian theme parks operate in Germany, the most popular of which are the Pullman City theme park outside of Munich and El Dorado theme park outside of Berlin. Hobbyism was greatly affected by the separation of Germany after World War II. Katrin Sieg's Ethnic Drag discusses the differences between West German Hobbyism and East German Hobbyism, saying that while West Germany could continue to openly participate in the hobby, East Germans had to go underground for fear of being targeted as rebels. This translated to a difference in opinion between East and West in how they interacted with real Native Americans; East German hobbyist clubs often interacted with Native Americans and supported them in their issues financially. On the other hand, West Germans often avoided contact with real Native Americans, which Sieg surmises is because they feared being told they are not truly Native American. These patterns continue to be true today. Dakota academic Philip Deloria theorizes in his book Playing Indian that there are two types of Hobbyism‚Äîpeople Hobbyism and item Hobbyism.Deloria, Philip J. (1998). Playing Indian. Yale University Press. West Germans would be considered, according to Deloria, as item hobbyists who focus on the objects, and the East Germans would be considered people hobbyists, who also include objects but want to interact with real Native Americans and issues facing Native communities. The East German interest in having hobbyists start engaging with living Native Americans may be partially attributable to the fact that the East German government began to recognize the propaganda value; criticism of the historical treatment of American Indians could be used as an example of why East Germans citizens should criticize US policies in general.von Borries, Friedrich, Jens-Uwe Fischer (2008). Cowboys Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands. Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp. May's novels featuring Winnetou and Old Shatterhand have been adapted into both theatrical and film productions in German-speaking countries. It is believed that film adaptations of Karl May's characters in the 1960s may have saved the West German film industry.Galchen, Rivka (2012). ‚ÄúWild West Germany: Why do cowboys and Indians so captivate the country?‚Äù. The New Yorker. Each summer in Bad Segeberg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, the Karl May Festival (Karl-May-Spiele) hosts stage productions weekly and particularly during the Karl May Festival. The Karl May Festival is an annual event purported to bring the Wild West to northern Germany In the 21st century German Hobbyism continues today in the form of festivals, museums, pow wows, theater, and clubs. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg continues each year and is a popular attraction to families from all over Germany and Europe. Additionally, there are multiple Wild West Amusement Parks all throughout Germany. The Karl May Museum in Radebeul and other museums that host Native American exhibits continue to be wildly popular. Hobbyists that organize through the means of a club host pow wows and teach each other and communities about Native American culture. The topic of German Hobbyism has become more recently documented by mainstream news sources New York Times, the Huffington Post, and independent filmmakers such as Howie Summers, who created a short documentary titled Indianer that explores German Hobbyists and their fascinations.Levine, Carole Quattro (2008). \\"'Indianer': A glimpse inside the world of German Hobby Indians\\". Scene4 Magazine. Writer, psychologist and filmmaker Red Haircrow attended the Winter Pow-wow 2014 in Berlin on 15 February. He described the participants as wearing as many \\"breastplates, bear claw necklaces, feathers and bone jewelry as they seemed able to physically support,\\" and that the attendees also wore Native American costumes in addition to the hobbyist dancers. In 2019, it was estimated that between 40,000-100,000 Germans are involved in Indianer hobbyist clubs at any given moment. Interviewed in 2007, one member of an Indianer club stated: \\"Our camp is always in summer, in July for two weeks. During this time, we live in tipis, we wear only Indian clothes. We don't use technology and we try to follow Indian traditions. We have those [pretending to be] Lakota, Oglala, Blackfeet, Blood, Siksika, Pawneee...and we go on the warpath against each other day and night, anytime at all. In two weeks, every tribe can fight each other. We don't know when somebody will attack or when they will come to steal our horses. And the battles are always exciting, too. I really enjoy them\\".Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.16-17 Criticism The main criticism of German Hobbyism by Native American journalists and academics argues on the basis of cultural appropriation and misrepresentation of Native American cultures and identities.Chandler, Daniel and Rod Munday (2011). A Dictionary of Media and Communication. Oxford University Press. When it comes to the borrowing of American Indian culture, Philip J. Deloria dubs it \\"playing Indian,\\" which he defines as the adoption or portrayal of being Native by Anglo-American individuals. These actions are often motivated by hobby and sometimes financial gain. Further, Deloria writes that these individuals and groups who play Indian build a collectivity in their performance of otherness, which in turn defines their own identity through the distinction of playing the national \\"other.\\" Katrin Sieg applies the thoughts and ideas of Deloria to the performance studies field in Germany. Her book Ethnic Drag discusses the ways in which Germans have historically dressed up as \\"othered\\" peoples, which includes Jews, Native Americans, and Turks. While the portrayals of Jews and Turks were largely negative stereotypes, the portrayal of Native Americans differed in that they were seen as heroic and noble. The first Native American women's theater troupe known as Spiderwoman Theater traveled to Germany and Europe in order to perform a satire of the European and particularly German fascination with Native Americans. According to Spiderwoman Theater, it was an act of resistance meant to reclaim their identity as real Native Americans. Their show is titled Winnetou's Snake Oil Show from Wigwam City, and parodied Karl May's characters, New Ageism, and individuals who pretend to be Native American.Spiderwoman Theatre (1999). ‚ÄúWinnetou‚Äôs snake oil show from Wigwam City‚Äù. Hemispheric Institute Digital Video Library. In 1982, a Canadian Ojibwe painter Ahmoo Allen Angeconeb visited West Germany where he discovered his paintings were selling better than in Canada, looking for a chance to exhibit his work.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.25 Angeconeb soon discovered that most Germans were interested in the traditional culture of the Plains Indian peoples and had no interest in the Eastern Woodslands peoples such as the Ojibewe or in the modern First Nations peoples. His attempts to argue that there was more to the Indians of North America than the lifestyle of the Plains Indians in the 18th and 19th centuries did not meet with much success as he recalled in an interview: \\"Actually most of these Indian clubs were interested in Plains Indians. So when they found out I was Ojibewe they had no idea who the Ojibewe were. We weren't Plains Indians, so therefore we weren't \\"real Indians\\"...And then, they seem to have this romantic view that they didn't want to have altered. I was too \\"real\\" an Indian for them. They wanted to keep their romantic view; they didn't want to hear about the modern way of living for Ojibewe people here. That we lived in wooden-structure homes, that we drove cars\\".Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.36 Red Haircrow has written articles from Berlin, where he resides, regarding the controversial aspects of Hobbyism from the perspective of a real Native American. Haircrow has traveled to pow wows and reported to Indian Country Today Media Network about his experience as a Native American at an event in which Germans performed Native American identity. He reported the premiere of the blockbuster remake The Lone Ranger, in which Hobbyists were hired to perform as Native Americans in Berlin.Haircrow, Red (2013). \\"Ich Bin Ein Tonto: Johnny Depp at 'Lone Ranger' Premiere in Berlin\\". Indian Country Today Media Network. Haircrow also covered a controversy at the Karl May Museum, when the owners of the museum in Radebeul refused to return Native American scalps to the tribes from which they are claimed to have come.Haircrow, Red (2014). ‚ÄúTribes Demand Return of Native Scalps From Karl May Museum in Germany‚Äù. Indian Country Today Media Network. As an act of protest, Native American singer Jana Mashonee chose not to perform at the Karl May Fest in Radebeul, Saxony and released an official statement denigrating the refusal of the Karl May Museum to return the Native American scalps. The scalps were not returned to the Ojibwe nation as requested, but they were removed from display. Haircrow also notes that not every Native American has a negative view of the German fascination with their culture. Comanche Laura Kerchee, who was stationed in Germany with the U.S. Air Force, told him that \\"she was impressed with how enthralled the Germans there were by Native Americans.\\" Haircrow adds that \\"some tribes in North America [are] reaching out to their fans in Europe. They realize that this is an opportunity to promote understanding and education and a way to market Native culture to a highly sympathetic audience.\\" Red Haircrow's 2018 documentary \\"Forget Winnetou! Loving in the Wrong Way\\" focuses more Native perspectives on Indian hobbyism, cultural appropriation and the connection to racism and continuing colonial practices in Germany,Chua, June (2017). \\"'Film 'Forget Winnetou!' studies German idealization of Indigenous culture\\".

In the United States, there is a widespread criticism from Native Americans about the misappropriation and misrepresentation of Native American identity and culture. Examples include the Native American mascot controversy, backlash against artists such as Gwen Stefani and Lana Del Rey who have performed in feather war bonnets, and campaigns to educate the public about not wearing Native American costumes for Halloween and themed parties, such as My Culture Is Not a Costume. This same sentiment was expressed by Haircrow's son, who claimed that \\"they are stealing from others, but don't want to admit it. That's why they didn't want us there, because they know we know what they are doing is wrong.\\" In a New York Times short documentary titled Lost in Translation: Germany's Fascination with the American Old West, the actor portraying Winnetou, Jan Sosniok, is asked if he thinks that real Native Americans would take offense to the portrayal of Native Americans. The actor responds that he does not believe they would be offended. The video also portrays a German man who studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts in New Mexico. This person shares his discomfort with seeing a burial dance take place in the Bad Segeberg performance, and calls it grotesque and claims that it perpetuates a stereotypical image of the Native American. Journalist James Hagengruber discussed German hobbyists in an article for Salon's website, describing the occasional clashes between the German fantasists and actual Native Americans. Visiting Native American dancers were shocked when German hobbyists protested their use of microphones and details of their costumes (to which they counter-protested). A hobbyist profiled in the article defended the German tendency to focus on Indian culture before 1880, instead of engaging with issues that affect contemporary tribes, comparing it to studying \\"the [ancient] Romans.\\" Some Germans have been surprised and irritated when real Native Americans don't act the way they do in the German imagination. On the other hand, Hagengruber comments that \\"some dying Indian languages may end up being preserved by German hobbyists.\\" Dick Littlebear, \\"a member of the Northern Cheyenne Nation and the president of Chief Dull Knife College in Lame Deer, MT,\\" told Hagengruber \\"he doesn't worry about Germans fixating on his culture,\\" as long as they do not copy sacred ceremonies, and pointed out that he had learned \\"lost Northern Cheyenne stitching methods from the 1850s\\" from German hobbyists. Journalist Noemi Lopinto in her article for UTNE reports that an Ojibwe man named David Redbird Baker found the performance of sacred ceremonies in Germany to be offensive: \\"They take the social and religious ceremonies and change them beyond recognition.\\" Lopinto paraphrases Baker as adding, \\"They've held dances where anyone in modern dress is barred from attending‚Äîeven visiting Natives.\\" Both Lopinto and Hagengruber quote Carmen Kwasny, who works with the Native American Association of Germany, as saying the Germans need to learn to view Native Americans as people, rather than idealized cultural fantasy characters.  Literature and art  German-American painter Albert Bierstadt's Sketch for The Last of the Buffalo 1888 Louis Maurer, 1895 Great Royal Buffalo Hunt The specific image of Indians originated earlier than May's writings. Already in the 18th century a specific German view on the fate of Native Americans can be found in various travel reports and scientific excursions. Philipp Georg Friedrich von Reck (1710-1798) traveled to Massachusetts and Georgia in 1733/34 and saw the Muskogee nation. \\"Philip Georg Friedrich von Reck: 18th Century German Artist in Georgia\\", Ahalenia, 30 April 2012 James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales were admired by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and still are among the German youth literature classics. In 1815‚Äì18, the poet Adelbert von Chamisso took part in a tour around the world led by Otto von Kotzebue and met native people in Latin and Northern America. Christian Gottlieb Prieber, a lawyer and political utopian from Zittau, emigrated to North America in 1735 and lived with the Cherokee in Tennessee.Naumann, Ursula, Pribers Paradies. Ein deutscher Utopist in der amerikanischen Wildnis, Die Andere Bibliothek 193, Frankfurt am Main: Eichborn, 2001, . He tried to build a society based on his ideals but was imprisoned in 1743 and died in prison in 1745. Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied, a nobleman and scientist, traveled from 1815 to 1817 to Brazil and from 1832 to 1834 to North America, accompanied by the Swiss painter Karl Bodmer. Bodmer's portraits of North Dakota, Ohio River and Missouri River Indians includes among others Blackfoot, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Chickasaw. Karl Postl (1793‚Äì1864) wrote various novels about his experiences in the US between 1823 and 1831, using the pseudonym Charles Sealsfield. Similarly to Friedrich Gerst√§cker, he wrote about Tecumseh and provided a more realistic picture than previous authors. Fritz Steuben's Tecumseh novels were bestsellers in the 1930s. After some Nazi allegations had been erased, the novels were reprinted - and sold well again - in the 1950s.Thomas Kramer: Tecumseh und Toka-itho: Edle Wilde unter roten Br√ºdern. Zur Rezeption der Indianerb√ºcher von Fritz Steuben und Liselotte Welskopf- Henrich in der DDR. In: Berliner Bl√§tter. Ethnographische und Ethnologische Beitr√§ge Painter and ice skater Julius Seyler (1873-1955) lived in Montana and depicted Blackfeet (Three Bear, Eagle Calf, Bear Pipe Man, etc.) and sacred locations such as the Chief Mountain. Early modern painters inspired by Native Americans include August Macke, George Grosz, Max Slevogt and Rudolf Schlichter. Klaus Dill (1922-2000)Klaus Dill, with Eberhard Urban et al., WesternArt. Bergisch Gladbach: Heider, 1997, was a well known illustrator of German books about Native Americans. Bavarian musician Willy Michl describes himself as an \\"Isar Indian\\".Ruhland, Michael, \\"Bluess√§nger Willy Michl. Ein urbayerischer Indianer\\", S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 8 July 2010. Franz Kafka's short short story (just one sentence) \\"Wish to become an Indian\\" (\\"Wunsch, Indianer zu werden\\") was published in 1913:Wish to become an Indian in Betrachtung, Leipzig: Rowohlt 1913:  Common German proverbs referring to \\"Indianer\\"  In a 1999 speech delivered in the United States in English, Lutz declared: \\"For over two hundred years Germans have found Indianer so fascinating that even today an Indian iconography is used in advertising. The most popular image of the Indianer is provided by Karl May's fictional Apache chief Winnetou...Indian lore is profitable and marketable, as some Native Americans travelling in Germany may arrest...There is a marked Indian presence in German everyday culture, even down to the linguistic level, where sentences like ein Indianer weint nicht (an Indian doesn't cry), ein Indianer kennt keinen Schmerz (an Indian braves pain) or figures such as der letzte Mohikaner (the Last of the Mohicans) have become part of the everyday speech\\".Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.13 Other examples include:  German-American heritage  Grave of Edward Two-Two in Dresden The descendants of the founders of New Braunfels and Fredericksburg in Texas claim that their peace treaty with the local natives, the Meusebach‚ÄìComanche Treaty of 1847, has never been broken.Emmerich, Alexander, Die Geschichte der Deutschen in Amerika, Fackeltr√§ger, 2010, . However, German immigrants underwent less of a close synthesis and interaction than, for example, Scottish Americans,Hunter, James, A Dance Called America: Scottish Highlands, the United States and Canada, Mainstream Publishing, 1995, . with some notable exceptions such as Ben Reifel. Prominent German-Americans with a certain role in the image-building of Native Americans include the painters Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) and Louis Maurer (1832-1932). Important contribution in the humanities include anthropologist Franz Boas (1858-1942) and Native American Renaissance writer Louise Erdrich (born 1954).Louise Erdrich b. 1954 at poetryfoundation.org. Germans still have an easygoing approach to using blackface or redface; there is a varied and continuing tradition of temporarily immersing oneself in different customs that is part of Carnival. Indianerhobby reenactment or living history is in effect part of German folklore. The \\"cult\\" goes beyond Karl May and aims at a high level of authenticity.Grade, Ananda, \\"Zu Besuch bei deutschen 'Indianern'\\", Deutsche Welle, 7 May 2013 This sort of \\"second- hand folklore\\" is an alternative way of dealing with Americanization, \\"anti- Imperialism\\", and popular ethnology.Wilczek, Gabriele, \\"Volkskultur aus fremder Hand - Indianer- und Westernhobby in Deutschland zwischen Amerikanisierung, 'Anti-Imperialismus' und popularisierter Ethnologie\\", doctoral dissertation, University of Freiburg, 1997 The background in human zoos (V√∂lkerschau in German) and the first Western movies is still vivid as well in \\"Cowboy and Indianer\\" children games. Americans have harshly criticized e.g. Heidi Klum's Germany's Next Topmodel show's German photoshoot of (predominantly white) candidates dressed in Native American garb. The harsh condemnation by Marta Carlson, a Native American activist, of Germans for getting pleasure from \\"something their whiteness has participated in destroying\\", is not shared by others.Boeck, Brian J., review of her short essay in Colin G. Calloway et al., Germans and Indians: Fantasies, Encounters, Projections. As with Irish or Scottish immigrants, the \\"whiteness\\" of German immigrants was not a given for WASP Americans. Both Germans and Native Americans had to regain some of their customs, as a direct heritage tradition was no longer in place. It is however still somewhat disturbing for both sides when German hobby Indians meet Native German enthusiasts.Marty Two Bulls, \\"A German Native Enthusiast Meets a Native German Enthusiast\\", cartoon, Indian Country Today Media Network, 23 March 2013.Gerson, Jen, \\"'Indianthusiasm': Romanticized ideas about First Nations life offer escapism for Germans\\", CDN Nationalpost, 17 October 2012.

The various pieces of legislation used for legally protecting heritage assets from damage and destruction are grouped under the term ‚Äòdesignation‚Äô. The protection given to scheduled monuments is given under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which is a different law from that used for listed buildings (which fall within the town and country planning system). A heritage asset is a part of the historic environment that is valued because of its historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest. These are judged to be important enough to have extra legal protection through designation. There are about 20,000 scheduled monuments in England representing about 37,000 heritage assets. Of the tens of thousands of scheduled monuments in the UK, most are inconspicuous archaeological sites, but some are large ruins. According to the 1979 Act, a monument cannot be a structure which is occupied as a dwelling, used as a place of worship or protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. A protected historic asset that is occupied would be designated as a listed building.

It lies close to sea level south of the Polden Hills, forming a large part of the Somerset Levels and Moors, a wetland area between the Mendips and the Blackdown Hills. The Neolithic people exploited the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways, including the world's oldest known timber trackway, the Post Track, dating to the 3800s BC. The Levels were the location of the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two lake villages at Meare Lake. Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural \\"islands\\" of slightly raised land, including Brent Knoll and Glastonbury. In the Roman period sea salt was extracted and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \\"schedule\\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \\"monument\\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War. There are 79 scheduled monuments in Sedgemoor. The oldest are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hill forts, bowl barrows and occupied caves including several in Cheddar Gorge. Cannington Camp (which is also known as Cynwit Castle) dates from the Bronze Age, while Brent Knoll Camp between the Somerset Levels and Brean Down is Iron Age (although there are some Bronze Age artefacts) and it was reused in the Roman period. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites. Medieval sites include several motte-and-bailey castles and church or village crosses. Industrial development, particularly in Bridgwater, are represented by brick and tile kilns and a telescopic railway bridge. The most recent monuments are World War II bunkers and bombing decoys on Black Down. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.

It received Royal Assent on 17 July 2014, after being introduced on 14 July 2014. The purpose of the legislation was to allow security services to continue to have access to phone and internet records of individuals following a previous repeal of these rights by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The act was criticised by some Members of Parliament for the speed at which the act was passed through parliament, by some groups (such as the Open Rights Group and Liberty) as being an infringement of privacy. Following legal action, in July 2015, the High Court issued an order that sections 1 and 2 of the Act were unlawful, and to be disapplied, suspended until 31 March 2016, thereby giving the government a deadline to come up with alternative legislation which would be compatible with EU law. an investigatory powers parliamentary bill was being drafted providing new surveillance powers, requiring records to be kept by Internet Service Providers tracking use of the internet from the UK, accessible by the police and security services without judicial oversight.The Guardian newspaper: Theresa May unveils surveillance measures in wake of Snowden claims, 4 November 2015 The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 was repealed on 31 December 2016 and replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Revocation On 1 August 2014, the Data Retention Regulations 2014 came into force, completing the framework introduced by the DRIP. They provide that a communications service provider can be required to retain data only when target of a notice of the Secretary of State. In December 2014, in R (on the application of David Davis MP and Tom Watson MP) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Mr Justice Lewis (High Court) granted the Claimants permission to proceed to a substantive hearing, thus agreeing that the DRIP can be challenged by judicial review. As a reaction, the Government proposed using the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill (CTSB) to extend their remit to cover data generated as a result of internet communications. On 4 June 2015 a legal challenge against the law was brought to the High Court by two MPs, Labour's Tom Watson and the Conservative David Davis represented by the civil liberties organisation Liberty (advocacy group). They claimed that the act was rushed through parliament and was incompatible with the Human Rights Act and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. On 17 July 2015 the High Court upheld the challenge, finding sections 1 and 2 of the Act to be unlawful. The court issued an order that sections 1 and 2 be disapplied, suspended until 31 March 2016, thereby giving the government a deadline to come up with alternative legislation which is compatible with EU law. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal began hearing the Home Secretary's appeal against the ruling. On 21 December 2016 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in joined cases that the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 was unlawful C203/15 and C698/15 The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIPA) was repealed on 31 December 2016 and replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. Overview The main provisions of the act were:gov.uk: \\"Collection: Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014\\", 25 Jul 2014 *To allow the security services through the Secretary of State to retain the powers to require a public telecommunications operator to retain communications data in line with the purposes of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 - Section 1 *The creation of a new privacy and civil liberties board to act as an independent watchdog overseeing the security services' use of these powers. *To enforce the annual publication of a report of the amount of data intercepted under the regulations *To restrict the length of time such data can be held to 12 months *To ensure that the relevance of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 is reviewed biennially *To reduce the number of public bodies that can access the data collected under the legislation *To limit the data which can be accessed under the regulations to only data that is relevant *To provide for fresh legislation to supersede this legislation in 2016 *To ensure that such data can no longer be gathered solely for the interest of the UK economic wellbeing *To appoint a diplomat to negotiate data transfers of such information with the United States.

It was at one time also a parish with its own parish church, but was later merged into the parish of West Worlington. The manor house was almost entirely demolished in the Civil War, the only part left standing was the gatehouse, which fell into ruin. A large farmhouse known as \\"Affeton Barton\\" was soon after built over the foundations and cellars of the manor house. The ruinous gatehouse was converted in 1868‚Äì9 to a shooting box for the use of the Stucley family of Hartland Abbey and Moreton House, Bideford, and became known thereafter as \\"Affeton Castle\\".

The Stucley family of Affeton was almost ruined during the Civil War for its adherence to the Royalist cause, and sold much of its landholdings, amounting to several thousand acres. The Stucley family of Affeton died out in the male line on the death, unmarried and without children, of Dennis Stucley (died 1755), Sheriff of Devon in 1748. The marriage of his aunt Sarah Stucley (died 1742), to George Buck (1674‚Äì1743) of Bideford, brought Affeton to her grandson George Buck (1731‚Äì1791), who became the heir on the death of Dennis Stucley in 1755. The descent of Affeton in the Stucley family was as follows: Hugh Stucley (c. 1398 ‚Äì before 1457) Hugh Stucley (c. 1398 ‚Äì before 1457),Frederick Lewis Weis, Walter Lee Sheppard, William Ryland Beall, The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215: The Barons Named in the Magna Charta, 1215, 5th Edition, Baltimore, USA, 1999, p.114; 13 December 1457 administration of his estate granted to his widow Sheriff of Devon in 1448, who married Catherine de Affeton (died 1467), heiress of Affeton also heiress of East Worlington, West Worlington, Bradford Tracy, Bridgerule, Meshaw, Stoodleigh and Thelbridge, all in Devon; of Trent and Chilton Cantelowe in Somerset; and of Preston, Halfhyde and St Mary Blanford in Dorset.Magna Charta Sureties, p.114 He was the second son of Richard Stucley (died 1441) of Trent, and of Chewton Mendip both in Somerset, and of Merston in Sussex, three times Member of Parliament for Sussex, in 1415, March 1416 and 1417.Woodger, L.S., biography of Styuecle, Richard (died 1440/1), of Merston and Chewton Mendip, Som., published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1386-1421, ed.

Her son by her first marriage was the Devonshire magnate William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville (c. 1393 ‚Äì 1461), KG, of Shute, a staunch Yorkist during the Wars of the Roses, and chief opponent of the Lancastrian Courtenay Earls of Devon, who was executed following the Lancastrian victory at the Second Battle of St Albans by order of King Henry VI's Queen Consort, Margaret of Anjou.

The family of Buck were Bideford ship owners and merchants who from the 17th century traded with the American Colonies and owned tobacco plantations in Virginia and a saw-mill in Bideford, Maine. Bideford was the leading tobacco trading port in England. From their profits they acquired much land near Bideford and eventually by the end of the 18th century their estates almost surrounded the north side of the town from Westleigh to Northam. Their arms are: Per fess embattled argent and sable three buck's attires each fixed to the scalp counterchanged. These arms are quartered with the ancient arms of Stucley by the present Stucley Baronets, with the Stucley arms in the 1st and 4th quarters of greatest honour.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.769, Stucley Baronets *John Buck (died 1745), 3rd son and heir, who in 1729 married Judith Pawley (died 1739), sole heiress of William Pawley of Bideford Buck of Affeton *George Buck (1731‚Äì1794), eldest son and heir, JP for Devon. In 1755 he inherited the estate of Affeton and other lands from his great-uncle Dennis Stucley (died 1755), Sheriff of Devon in 1748, who died unmarried. In 1754 he married Anne Orchard (1730‚Äì1820), daughter of Paul Orchard (died 1740), MP, of Hartland Abbey, near Bideford, and sister of Paul Orchard (1739‚Äì1812) of Hartland Abbey, who died childless and bequeathed it to his other sister Charlotte Hooper Morrison of Yeo Vale House.Vivian, p.723 The Orchards had made their wealth through their involvement with the Customs and Excise in Exeter, Barnstaple and Bideford. George Buck rebuilt Daddon House in about 1760,Listed buildings text which he made his residence. The irregular plan indicates that some of the fabric of the older structure was retained. The Buck family, which in the late 18th century lived alternately at two large houses in North Devon, namely Hartland Abbey, and Moreton House, Bideford, still on occasion visited the estate of Affeton for sporting purposes and to inspect the tenant farms, but had nowhere to stay other than to lodge with the farmer at Affeton Barton farmhouse, although the family had lived for a time at Cobley Farm on the Affeton estate.

Bideford, Devon\\", published in The History of Parliament: House of Commons 1820‚Äì1832, ed. D.R. Fisher, 2009 He was educated at Blundells School in Tiverton and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He inherited Hartland Abbey under the will of his great-aunt Charlotte Hooper Morrison. He thus possessed the paternal Buck estate of Daddon and other lands, the Stucley inheritance of Affeton and other lands and also Hartland Abbey and other lands. In 1808 he married Ann Robbins daughter of Thomas Robbins of Roundhams, Berkshire. Lewis is believed in 1821 to have undertaken further building work at Daddon House and to have changed the name to Moreton House. He entertained Benjamin Disraeli at Moreton House, but before he became Prime Minister in 1868, thus after Lewis's death. He had a distinguished political career and it is believed that had he lived long enough to serve under Disraeli's premiership he would have been made a minister and peer, and thus the honour of a baronetcy awarded to his son was in some way a recompense. =Buck (Stucley)= *Sir George Stucley Buck Stucley, 1st Baronet (1812‚Äì1900), son and heir, who in 1858 assumed by royal licence the name and arms of Stucley and was created a baronet in 1859. He served as MP for Barnstaple twice, but retired from politics in 1868 and later served as Sheriff of Devon.Lauder, p.147 He married firstly Lady Elizabeth O'Bryan, 4th daughter and co-heiress of William O'Brien, 2nd Marquess of Thomond (1765‚Äì1846), by whom he had children. He had a keen interest in family history, heraldry and his ancestors. He redecorated Hartland Abbey and in 1868-9 reconstructed the ruinous Gatehouse at Affeton, the only part of the fortified manor house of the Stucleys which had been left standing since the destruction of the house during the Civil War, which he renamed \\"Affeton Castle\\" and used as a shooting lodge for the grouse shooting season on Affeton Moor. He lived at Hartland Abbey from 1840 to 1870, when following the death of his first wife he handed ownership of Hartland Abbey to his son Lewis. He married secondly in 1872 to Louisa Granville, daughter of Sir Beville Granville of Wellesbourne, Warwickshire. He moved to Exbury House on the Solent, which he rented to pursue his pastime of yacht-sailing. He died in 1900 aged 88 at Moreton House.Lauder, p.148 *Lt.-Col. Sir William Lewis Stucley, 2nd Baronet (1836‚Äì1911), eldest son by his father's first wife, died without children. He was survived by his 2nd wife Marion, who lived on at Hartland Abbey until 1932. *Sir Edward Arthur George Stucley, 3rd Baronet (1852‚Äì1927), younger brother, died without children. In 1913 he combined three of the first floor rooms of Moreton House overlooking the gardens to create a ballroom. *Sir Hugh Nicholas Granville Stucley, 4th Baronet (1873‚Äì1956), eldest half-brother, son of Louisa Granville. He had moved to Moreton House in 1913 and made substantial alterations.Stucley Sir Dennis, bt: \\"History of Moreton House\\" \\"(newspaper/magazine cutting) source unknown)\\", quoted in listed building text Sir Hugh served as a Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Navy. He was elected to the Bideford Town Council and served as Mayor of the Borough. It was the thirty-seventh time that a member of his family had served the Borough as Mayor. He was also elected to Devon County Council in 1906 and was a county alderman in 1908. His main interests were County Finance and Education. His personal interests were fishing, shooting and landscape gardening. It was he who designed the beautiful gardens which Moreton House was formerly well known for. From 1939 to 1945 during World War II Moreton House became the temporary home of King's Mead Preparatory School, which moved from its premises in Seaford in Sussex. Sir Hugh moved to the lodge house and looked after those boys who were too young to be boarders at the school. *Sir Dennis Frederic Bankes Stucley, 5th Baronet (1907‚Äì1983). He spent his early childhood at Pillhead, East-the-Water, Bideford, and his adolescence at Moreton House. Like his father he served as mayor of Bideford. In 1947 he was given by his father the estate of Affeton, when it comprised the manor and parish of West Worlington, with the exception of the glebe land, Burridge Farm and woods in Chawleigh parish with further land in the parishes of Chulmleigh, Cheldon and Meshaw. He made substantial improvements to the tenanted farms to which he brought mains electricity and piped water supply, with \\"modern amenities\\" for every house on the estate. He installed two bathrooms in the castle (where previously there were none) and planted over 300 acres of trees and reclaimed much moorland. In 1932 he married Hon. Sheila Bampfylde, daughter and (following the death of her brother in 1936) eventual sole heiress of George Wentworth Warwick Bampfylde, 4th Baron Poltimore (1882‚Äì1965) of Poltimore and North Molton and other estates in Devon and elsewhere. The 4th Baron sold off most of his English estates and moved to Rhodesia where he died in 1965. Sheila however inherited the manor of North Molton, with Court Hall (the manor house) and Court House, another large house in the village. The 5th Baronet and his wife lived partly at Court Hall, North Molton, where he followed his enthusiasm for pheasant shooting, and at Hartland Abbey, where his wife created a new garden. In 1956 he sold Moreton House.Lauder, p.149 *Sir Hugh George Copplestone Bampfylde Stucley, 6th Baronet (born 1945). In 1976 he was resident with his wife and young family in the ancient gatehouse of Affeton, which he had extended to form a nursery wing and additional bedrooms, and personally managed the farm enterprise there of 1,000 acres, which in 2002 he \\"managed himself down to the last nut and bolt\\". The 6th Baronet's residence marked the first time a Stucley family had been raised at Affeton since the Civil War, and he added an extension housing a nursery wing and additional bedrooms. He regards Affeton as the family's main seat, which unlike Hartland Abbey is a private house, not open to the paying public. The heir apparent to the baronetcy is George Dennis Bampfylde Stucley (born 1970), eldest son of the 6th Baronet. Notes References Sources *Lauder, Rosemary.

He came from a family which produced three generations of eminent lawyers, with the father, son and grandson each bearing the name Gerald FitzGibbon. Background and early career He was the elder of the two sons of Gerald FitzGibbon, QC, Master in Chancery (1793-1882), and his wife Ellen Patterson (died 1885), daughter of John Patterson of Belfast; his younger brother Henry (died 1912) was a distinguished doctor.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol. 2 p.372 The younger Gerald was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a Scholar. He retained deep feelings of affection and loyalty towards Trinity College throughout his life, and gave evidence on its behalf before a Royal Commission in 1906.David Fitzgerald, \\"Gerald FitzGibbon\\" Dictionary of National Biography, 1912 Supplement, p.30 He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1857. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1860 and to the English Bar the following year. He went on the Munster Circuit, where he quickly acquired a large practice. He was a fine lawyer and an eloquent public speaker. Maurice Healy recalled his \\"beautiful voice\\", which was sometimes compared to that of the great Russian singer Feodor Chaliapin: this, combined with a certain natural acting ability, made his arguments extraordinarily persuasive. His courtroom victories included the libel action O'Keeffe v Cardinal Cullen, an unprecedented legal victory by a Catholic priest against Cardinal Paul Cullen (although the verdict was reversed on appeal).(1873) I.R. 7 C.L. 319; the alleged libel was in fact a sentence of suspension. Another triumph was in the disputed will case of Bagot v Bagot, where he appeared for Mrs. Alice Bagot (ne Verner), daughter of Sir William Verner, 2nd Baronet and Mary Pakenham, and widow of Christopher Nevile Bagot, of Aughrane Castle, Justice of the Peace for County Galway. Her husband had denied paternity of her son, William, and disinherited him in favour of Christopher's brother John. Fitzgibbon's eloquence, in the teeth of formidable medical evidence on the paternity issue produced by John Bagot, who was the beneficiary under his brother's will, persuaded the jury that Christopher Bagot was under a temporary mental delusion when he wrote his will, and that the child was his.The Spectator Archive 25 May 1878 Having initially declined to take silk in 1868, he became Queen's Counsel in 1872.Fitzgerald p.30 He was a Bencher of the King's Inns, and his portrait hangs in the Dining Hall there. In 1876 he became Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the following year he became Solicitor General for Ireland.Ball p.372 Lord Justice of Appeal In 1878 he was appointed to the Bench as Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal in Ireland, with the general approval of the legal profession, and also the Press, who praised both his political moderation and his legal ability. He served on that Court with immense distinction for more than thirty years. =Reputation= The old Court of Appeal has been described as probably the strongest judicial tribunal ever to exist in Ireland, due to the presence of such exceptional judges as Fitzgibbon himself, Hugh Holmes, Christopher Palles and Lord Ashbourne. While Palles is usually regarded as the greatest of the Irish judges of his time, some contemporaries thought that FitzGibbon was at least his equal: it is noteworthy that when the House of Lords heard appeals from decisions where FitzGibbon had dissented, they almost always preferred his view to that of his colleagues.Fitzgerald p.30 Maurice Healy believed that FitzGibbon as a judge fell short of true greatness due to a certain lack of judicial impartiality, in that if he had a strong sympathy for one party to the appeal, he always found a way of deciding the case in their favour.Maurice Healy, The Old Munster Circuit (1939), Mecier Press edition, pp. 260‚Äì1 On the other hand, Healy thought that the courtesy with which he conducted every appeal, and the deep interest he took in the legal arguments, made appearing in front of him \\"an intellectual treat\\".Healy p.260 Delaney praises Fitzgibbon both for his profound erudition and his innate sense of justice.V.T.H. Delaney, Christopher Palles, Allen Figgis and Co Dublin (1960) p.138 However he agrees with Healy that FitzGibbon, like Lord Ashbourne, was a pragmatist, who would always try to find in favour of the party he believed to have justice on their side, even if the precedents pointed the other way. Palles and Holmes, by contrast, although they were no less anxious to do justice between the parties, went strictly by the precedents.Delaney p.158 =Quinn v Leathem= Fitzgibbon went regularly on assizes, most often to Belfast. It was there in 1896 that he sat as the trial judge, with a jury, in the controversial case of Quinn v Leathem.[1901] A.C 495 The House of Lords subsequently found that for several members of a trade union to ask a businessman only to deal with customers who employ union labour amounts to a conspiracy to injure him, even though such a request, when made by an individual, had previously been found by the same tribunal in Allen v Flood[1898] A.C. 1 to be perfectly lawful. While the judgment on appeal aroused great indignation among trade unions, FitzGibbon, from the report of his summing up to the jury, seems to have stated the law (as it stood at the time) correctly. =Judicial style= His judgments were written in a clear, sharp and decisive style, often with an abrupt opening sentence such as: \\"I doubt that the [Court of] King's Bench can have been conscious of the consequences of its decision in this case\\".Antrim County Land, Building and Investment Co. v Stewart [1904] 2 I.R 357 A good example of his judicial style can be found in Aaron's Reefs v Twiss,[1895] 2 1R 207 where the Court of Appeal divided on the question of whether certain statements in a company's prospectus were simply \\"optimistic\\" or actually fraudulent. FitzGibbon found that there is no legal difference between a company which omits crucial facts from its prospectus and one which deliberately misrepresents the facts, remarking that: \\"if a company cannot be floated if the whole truth be disclosed by its prospectus, it cannot be honestly launched at all\\". To the argument that the application of this standard of commercial honesty would be fatal to most company prospectuses, he observed drily: \\"So much the better\\".[1895] 2 IR 207, at 269 Political and social life He was a Conservative in politics, and a close friend of Lord Randolph Churchill;Roy Jenkins, Churchill Macmillan London 2001, p.13 it was in a letter to FitzGibbon in 1886 that Churchill remarked that to effectively oppose the support of Liberal Party Prime Minister Gladstone for Irish Home Rule, \\"the Orange card would be the one to play\\".Kenneth Ferguson, King's Inns Barristers 1868‚Äì2004, Dublin 2005 p.48 Yet FitzGibbon was noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone. His house, Kilrock,Kilrock House still exists and is now operated by the Health Services Executive. on the Hill of Howth, was one of the centres of Dublin social life: here he entertained not only his legal colleagues, but many of the leading Irish and British politicians of the day.Ferguson p.48 His Christmas parties at Kilrock were for many years one of the high points of the Dublin social calendar.Ball p.322 He was a man of great erudition, and had numerous interests outside the law. He was a devoted member of the Church of Ireland, and spoke eloquently in 1904 of his confidence in the future of \\"the Church which I love\\".Ferguson p.47 He was a member of the General Synod of the Church: he was called the most influential Protestant laymen of his time, and was rewarded with a statue in St. Patrick's Cathedral.Ferguson p.47 At the same time he was an active Freemason, and contributed much of his time and money to Masonic causes and charities.Fitzgerald p.31 He took a deep interest in the future of Irish education, and chaired a committee on educational endowments from 1885 to 1897. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the future of Trinity College Dublin, and the University of Dublin in 1906.Delaney p.23 He strongly defended the University's policy on the admission of Catholics, pointing out that Chief Baron Palles - one of his most distinguished colleagues on the Bench - was a Catholic graduate of the same University, and shared FitzGibbon's deep attachment to it.Delaney p.23 He generously praised Clongowes Wood College, Palles' old school, as an example of the best of Roman Catholic education.Delaney p.23 He was a member of both the Privy Council of Ireland and from 1900 of the British Privy Council.Ball p.372 Death and tributes He died rather suddenly at Kilrock on 14 October 1909. The next day the Lord Chief Justice of England in open court paid tribute to \\"that great judge, profound lawyer and man of wide and varied learning\\". This is apparently the only time an Irish judge has been honoured in this way.Fitzgerald p.31 The Times paid him an equally glowing tribute, describing him as a man whose gifts could have easily seen him rise to the top of the political rather than the judicial sphere. He is buried in old St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton, near the ruined church. His statue (picture above) stands in the North Aisle of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.FitzGerald p.31 Family He married in 1864 Margaret Ann FitzGerald, daughter of Francis Alexander FitzGerald, Baron of the Court of Exchequer and his wife Janet Burton. They had seven children, including Gerald Fitzgibbon the third, who represented the University of Dublin from 1921 to 1923 and served as a judge of the Supreme Court of Ireland from 1924 to 1938.Ball p.372 Of his daughters Janet married General Sir William Shone, and Anne married John Gladstone, great-nephew of the celebrated statesman.Ferguson p.48 The family were members of the Church of Ireland.

The cause of her death is not known, but it was considered to be suspicious by the authorities. Her name is still not known, despite efforts to identify her. She is the only unidentified decedent in the county. Description The badly decomposed remains were found by a \\"stonemason\\" alongside a river, near a highway in Perry County, Pennsylvania, near Watts Township. The remains were mostly skeletonized and the estimated time of death was months before, perhaps as early as Autumn of 1978. The decedent is believed to have been 15 and 30 years old when she died, although she may have been as old as 38. She was white, had straight or possibly curly, shoulder-length blond or light brown hair. She was between and tall. She weighed between and . She had received dental care during her life, as a back tooth had been removed four or five years prior to her death. She also had teeth fillings. One tooth, which was a molar, had not yet erupted. Her teeth showed no evidence of crowding. Despite that her teeth appeared to have had some dental work, it is not known if she had ever had braces. Prior to her death, she had suffered a fractured rib, which had healed. Just before her death, she may have returned to Pennsylvania after having spent several months in the southwestern United States. Recent analysis of the decedent's bones indicated that she had spent a long time living in the Midwest or in Southern Canada, near the Great Lakes, when she was an adolescent. Belongings Jewelry worn by Perry County Jane Doe. Perry County Jane Doe wore several pieces of jewelry. She was wearing two sterling silver rings with turquoise stones, one of which also contained onyx pieces that are believed to have originated in the Southwest, possibly having been made by Navajo or Zuni Indians inhabiting that area. She also had a chain bracelet on her right arm and a turquoise necklace and earrings. The jewelry led authorities to believe the victim had ties to Arizona, New Mexico or a similar region. She wore a tan jacket, white boots with silver buckles, green and white socks, and blue slacks. The slacks were described as having been made from knitted wool which contained strands of red thread. She was wearing two tops, which consisted of a white shirt and a blue tank top. Investigation The victim had been buried shortly after her discovery, but was exhumed in 2008, following the reopening of her case. Her DNA and dental records were recorded and are on file. Because of the condition of her remains, no fingerprints and no cause of death could be confirmed. An initial examination of her teeth indicated that she had had three teeth extracted, but this was later disproved. Despite the fact that these characteristics have been entered into national databases, there have been no matches with missing persons. About sixty possible identities for her have been ruled out. Her face was reconstructed twice by professionals. A sketch by Barbara Martin-Bailey was drawn in 2009, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a three-dimensional rendering by digitally adding layers of muscles and skin to a CT scan of her skull, which was released in 2013. A revised image was later released in 2018.

This is an emerging method for delivering styled web maps, combining certain benefits of pre-rendered raster map tiles with vector map data. As with the widely used raster tiled web maps, map data is requested by a client as a set of \\"tiles\\" corresponding to square areas of land of a pre-defined size and location. Unlike raster tiled web maps, however, the server returns vector map data, which has been clipped to the boundaries of each tile, instead of a pre-rendered map image. There are several major advantages of this hybrid approach. Compared to an un-tiled vector map, the data transfer is reduced, because only data within the current viewport, and at the current zoom level needs to be transferred. The GIS clipping operations can all be performed in advance, as the tile boundaries are pre-defined. This in turn means that tiled vector data can be packaged up and distributed, without needing any kind of GIS system available to serve data. Compared to a tiled raster map, data transfer is also greatly reduced, as vector data is typically much smaller than a rendered bitmap. Also, styling can be applied later in the process, or even in the browser itself, allowing much greater flexibility in how data is presented. It is also easy to provide interactivity with map features, as their vector representation already exists within the client. Yet another benefit is that less centralised server processing power is required, since rasterisation can be performed directly in the client. This has been described as making \\"rendering ... a last-mile problem, with fast, high- quality GPU[s] in everyone‚Äôs pocket\\".  History  There is a long history of the use of vector tile schemes in GIS. A very early GIS (circa 1966), the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS), used a vector tile storage scheme that allowed limited resource computers to efficiently access and process vector map data. CGIS used the term \\"frame\\" instead of vector tiles. In 1975, the US Wildlife Service initiated a national program to map and digitize all the wetlands in the US. In 1976 they awarded a contract to Autometric to develop a software application that allowed stereo imagery to be digitized using an analytical stereo plotter. Later support for 2d digitization from single photos (aka single photo resection) on a digitizing table was added. The software was called WAMS (Wetlands Analytical Mapping System). The WAMS data store used a tiled vector structure. Each tile was called a ‚Äúgeounit‚Äù. A geounit corresponded to one of the USGS quadrangle scales, typically 1:24000. As the data were digitized, they were immediately stored in the tiled data store and topologically structured. Lines crossing geounit boundaries were automatically split. The storage Coordinate Reference System (CRS) was WGS 72 lat/long. WAMS is described in detail in ‚ÄúThe wetlands analytical mapping system: WAMS\\" [Pywell and Niedzwiadek, 1980] Building on the operational experience gained in implementing and using WAMS as well as from the Map Overlay and Statistical System (MOSS),Moss: A Historical Perspective https://www.scribd.com/document/4606038/2004-Article-by-Carl-Reed-MOSS-A- Historical-perspective in 1986 Autometric released a UNIX based commercial GIS that implemented an enhanced vector tile storage and access structure: DeltaMap (later GenaMap). The vector tile structure and capability is described in \\"DeltaMap: Not just another GIS\\".Reed C N (1986) DELTAMAP: Not just another new GIS- Proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling. IGU Commission on Geographical Data Sensing and Processing, Williamsville NY, pp. 375-83 Where WAMS implemented a fixed tile system based on latitude/longitude 1:24000 quadrangles, DeltaMap allowed the user to define any size tile in any coordinate reference system (CRS). In this way, sparse data required only a few tiles whereas dense data could use much smaller tiles. R-trees were used as the indexing scheme for the vector tiles. In the late 1980s, Genasys further enhanced GenaMap to allow \\"Continuous, seamless\\" processing of the tiled layers. Basically, from the end user perspective, the tiles became invisible. This capability was true regardless of whether the user were editing, visualizing, querying, or analyzing the data.  Standards and approaches  As of early 2015, there is no dominant standard for vector tiles. Approaches can differ in their URL format, data serialisation format, packaging of styling information, and support for projections other than Web Mercator. = Protocol buffers (Mapbox) = Mapbox has defined an open standard for vector map tiles called \\"vector-tile-spec\\" which uses Google protocol buffers for space-efficient data serialisation. Web Mercator is the projection of reference, but vector tiles may be used to represent data with any projection and tile extent scheme. It is also tied to the Mapnik rendering engine, using a \\"serialized version of the internal data that Mapnik uses\\". In March 2015, Esri, the dominant geospatial software maker, announced that they would be supporting Mapbox's vector tiles standard in both server and client platforms. = Mapnik Vector Tile = This was an early format developed for the Mapnik renderer1. = Other formats = The approach followed by TileStache is to allow multiple data serialisation formats; as of early 2015, it supports GeoJSON, ArcJSON, GeoBSON, Arc GeoServices BSON, GeoAMF and Arc GeoServices BSON. The requested format is given in the URL (e.g., \`http://example.com/tiles/mylayer/2/1/3.json\`) Support = Services and applications = Vector tiles have been used by the Google Maps Android client since December 2010 and on the desktop client since 2013. Vector tiles for rendering OpenStreetMap data were first proposed in March 2013 and are supported by Mapnik, the most widely used renderer of OpenStreetMap data. Mapbox, a commercial provider of custom cartography tools and hosting, has focused its cartography tool, Mapbox Studio, around vector tiles. The popular, and very powerful, Android client for OpenStreetMap data, osmAnd supports vector tiles, which it calls \\"vector maps\\". = Servers = The tile server pipeline TileStache supports several flavours of JSON natively. There is also a plugin vector tile provider called VecTiles which converts PostGIS data into vector tiles in Mapnik Vector Tile format (incompatible with the Mapbox specification) or TopoJSON. PGRestAPI (also known as Chubbs Spatial Server) is a standalone NodeJS server which can also generate vector tiles on the fly from a PostGIS data source, as well as serving pre-generated vector tiles from sources such as Mapbox Studio. ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.4https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/02/18/arcgis-10-4-is-here/ and ArcGIS Pro 1.2https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/whats-new-in- arcgis-pro-1-2.htm released in February 2016 added support for vector tiles. = Client libraries = The Leaflet JavaScript library does not directly support vector tiles, but there are third-party plugin for vector tiles, Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile for Leaflet 0.7.x and Leaflet.VectorGrid for Leaflet 1.0.x. Mapbox's own JavaScript library, Mapbox GL JS, can be used. OpenLayers supports vector tiles through the ol.source.VectorTile object, as of version 3.

Silanones are of some interest to academic research, with their reactivity being of some relevance to the double bond rule. Silanones are unstable and favor oligomerisation to siloxanes. The reason for this instability is the weak pi bond with a small HOMO‚ÄìLUMO energy gap caused by an unfavorable overlap between the p-orbitals of silicon and oxygen. A second reason for the observed instability is the strongly polarized Si√∞+ \\\\- O√∞‚àí bond.

Early years and background William Neville Harding was born in Sydney, Colony of New South Wales, on 4 January 1893, the son of William and Agnes Harding. Harding was educated at the University of Sydney and became a public accountant specialising in taxation, and a company director. On 3 August 1918 he married Constance Agilvie and had two sons and one daughter. From 1911 he was employed as a manager in his father's accountancy firm, but was dismissed in 1928 and later sued his father for unlawful dismissal. In 1929 a jury found in favour of Harding and awarded him ¬£2000 in damages; however, his father appealed and the case was later settled out of court. Political career A prominent member of the Sydney business community, later rising to be president of the Electrical and Radio Development Association of NSW in 1941 and 1942, Harding joined the conservative, business-oriented Citizens' Reform Association. He first stood for the Sydney City Council at the municipal elections in December 1934 for Phillip Ward but was unsuccessful against Labor Party candidates Paddy Stokes and Ernest Charles O'Dea. However, when Alderman Richard Hagon retired from the council in July 1935 Harding stood as the Reform Association candidate at the resulting by-election in Macquarie Ward. Elected on 29 July, Harding was a member of the Works and the Health and by-laws committees but dedicated most of his time towards the Finance Committee, serving in 1937, 1942‚Äì45 and 1946‚Äì48 and was the committee Vice-Chairman in 1942‚Äì44. Working on the consolidation at development of Sydney's electrivity supplies, Harding served as a Councillor on the recently established Sydney County Council from 1938 to 1944 and was its Chairman in 1942. In 1937, aware of the inadequate facilities of the City of Sydney Library located in the Queen Victoria Building, Alderman Harding put forward an ambitious proposal to council for the construction and development of a new city library building, complete with a museum and civic theatre. His plan however was not carried out due to the outbreak of war. During World War II he served on Sydney City Council's National Emergency Services committee from 1942 to 1945, advocating the construction of underground air-raid shelters and other measures preparing for possible attack. His son, Private David Bruce Harding (who attended Sydney Church of England Grammar School, 1930-1935) of 2/17th Battalion died on active service in the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign on 10 October 1943. At the May 1944 state election Harding stood as the Democratic Party candidate for the seat of North Sydney but was unsuccessful against Labor's James Geraghty. On 12 December 1944 Harding was elected by the council to serve as Lord Mayor from 1 January 1945 receiving 12 votes against Labor candidate Alderman O'Dea who received 8 votes. On his election Harding acknowledged his opponent and pledged to keep the council free of party politics while affirming the Reform Association's commitment to keep rates low while maintaining effective municipal services. On 29 January 1945, Harding as Lord Mayor welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester to Sydney and Australia in anticipation of the Duke's appointment as Governor General of Australia. Later life In 1946 Harding attempted gain Liberal Party of Australia preselection for the seat of Parramatta at the 1946 federal election but later withdrew. He served as an Alderman until his retirement in December 1948. In 1949 Harding was fined ¬£40 for failure to file a tax return for 1947 and while he was described by a Taxation Office official as having \\"caused the department a great deal of trouble\\", Harding's solicitor noted in court that \\"Harding had been at death's door and was more than five months in hospital. Many of his staff had left him.\\" and that \\"[o]f two of his lads who went to the war, one was killed and one is a hopeless case.\\" Survived by his wife, son and daughter, he died on 31 March 1978 at his residence on Belmont Avenue, Wollstonecraft.

He served in various metropolitan infantry regiments before becoming a staff officer in several divisions and army corps. Deffontaines became the youngest general in France on his promotion to g√©n√©ral de brigade in 1913. He led the 24th Infantry Division into action in Belgium in one of the opening battles of the First World War. Deffontaines was shot in the head while commanding his troops in the field on 22 August and died in hospital four days later. He was the youngest French general to die during the war.  Early career  Born on 16 February 1858 at Bouvines, Deffontaines was from a family of farmers from the region. He joined the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint- Cyr as an officer cadet on 30 October 1878. He was promoted to cadet first class on 22 December 1879 and to corporal on 21 March 1880. His graduation class was named for the Zulu race, which had recently fought in the Anglo-Zulu War, and he was commissioned into the 28th Infantry Regiment as a sous lieutenant (second lieutenant) on 10 October 1880. Deffontaines saw active service on campaign in Africa from 9 October to 15 December 1882. Promoted to lieutenant in the 87th Infantry Regiment on 12 July 1884, he transferred to the 101st Infantry Regiment on 29 February 1888. He received promotion to capitaine (captain) on 12 July 1890 at which point he also became regimental adjutant. He served in this capacity until 20 November. The following year, he transferred to the 11th Infantry Regiment.  Staff officer and general  Deffontaines became a staff officer with the 8th Infantry Division on 29 October 1891. He transferred to the same position with the 7th Infantry Division on 21 October 1892 and with the 10th Infantry Division on 6 June 1893. Deffontaines sought permission from his commanding officer to marry and did so, to Josephine, on 13 May 1893. He joined the staff of the 12th Army Corps on 31 August 1893, but left on 24 December 1894 to join the 63rd Infantry Regiment. Deffontaines was promoted to chef de bataillon (major) in the 8th Infantry Regiment on 17 April 1898 and joined the staff of 10th Army Corps on 23 November 1900. He was appointed a chevalier in the Legion of Honour on 29 December 1900. In 1913 he was promoted to the rank of g√©n√©ral de brigade (brigadier general), becoming the youngest general in France at the time.  First World War  Upon the outbreak of war Deffontaines had command of the 5th Infantry Brigade and was acting commander of the 24th Infantry Division. Whilst leading his division into battle at Robelmont (near Meix- devant-Virton, Belgium) on 22 August he was shot in the head and grievously wounded. Deffontaines was one of 27,000 French soldiers to fall in battle that day and was taken to a military hospital in Reims. He died there on 26 August and would be the youngest French general to die in the war. His son, Officer Cadet Jean Deffontaines, was also killed in action fighting with the 8th Infantry Regiment on 10 June 1915.  Honors  Deffontaines was buried in a family tomb in Bouvines in 1921. The tomb was restored by Le Souvenir fran√ßais, who installed a commemorative plaque, and unveiled on 22 August 2014 by General Guy Delamarre. The centenary of his death was commemorated in Bouvines and the Fort de Seclin also maintains a memorial in his honor. A rough interpretation of Le Souvenir fran√ßais's article on his commemoration notes the sad irony of his early passing: \\"One could also call him 'General Forgotten.' Killed in action too early to be in the annals of the great war and yet what a man, what a career and what a temperament. Fate, the mission and example symbolized in this general who is a tribute to all sacrificed in the First World War.\\"  References   External links  List of French Generals killed in the First World War French Wikipedia * http://www.ecole-superieure-de-guerre.fr/promotions/biographie/658 Category:1858 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:French generals Category:French military personnel killed in World War I Category:People from Nord (French department) ","title":"Achille Pierre Deffontaines"},{"id":"43645203","text":"The 2014 South Napa earthquake occurred in the North San Francisco Bay Area on August 24 at . At 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale and with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), the event was the largest in the San Francisco Bay Area since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The epicenter of the earthquake was located to the south of Napa and to the northwest of American Canyon on the West Napa Fault. Total damage in the southern Napa Valley and Vallejo areas was in the range of $362 million to $1 billion, with one person killed and 200 injured. Other aspects of the event included an experimental earthquake warning system that alerted seismologists several seconds before the damaging shear waves arrived, temporary changes in springs and wells, and the potential for postseismic fault creep. Tectonic setting The San Andreas Fault System is an active plate boundary comprising right-lateral strike-slip faults that runs nearly the length of California. This network of faults trends north-northwest in the area of the West Napa Fault, where it is wide from west to east. The West Napa Fault transfers slip between a group of related faults (including the Concord Fault and the Calaveras Fault) called the Contra Costa Shear Zone, which was assigned a maximum slip rate of 1mm/yr in the third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast. The authors of a separate study that focused on Global Positioning System data gave an estimated slip rate of 4¬±3mm/yr for the West Napa Fault. Earthquake The mainshock was magnitude 6.0, with a depth of 11.3 km. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that 15,000 people experienced severe shaking, 106,000 people felt very strong shaking, 176,000 felt strong shaking, and 738,000 felt moderate shaking. The earthquake lasted 10 to 20 seconds, depending on location. At least twelve aftershocks followed, including one of magnitude 3.9. The earthquake was the largest earthquake in the Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to the severe damage and the possibility of aftershocks. President Obama declared a major disaster for Napa and Solano counties. =Damage= Several older commercial buildings in downtown Napa showed signs of extensive external damage even though many had been retrofitted for earthquake safety protection. The Goodman Library, Napa County Courthouse Plaza, Sam Kee Laundry Building, Downtown U.S. Post Office, Alexandria Hotel and Annex, Native Sons of the Golden West building, First United Methodist Church, and First Presbyterian Church all suffered moderate to extensive damage. Damaged Alexandria Square building in Napa All of these buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although the structure of the Uptown Theater was determined to be sound, the building was red-tagged due to damage to the theater's ceiling. Several newer commercial buildings also suffered damage. Six major fires broke out, and four homes in Napa Valley Mobile Home Park located in north Napa were destroyed. Firefighters were hampered in their efforts to fight this fire by a broken water main. In Vallejo, several hundred storefront windows shattered and many building walls suffered extensive damage. A water main on Mare Island broke.Fimrite, Peter. Northern California earthquake: Blue-collar Vallejo hit hard, San Francisco Chronicle, August 26, 2014. Following the first round of building inspections by the City of Napa inspectors, a total of 613 structures had been tagged; 113 were red-tagged and 500 had been yellow-tagged. Pavement on several roads in Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties buckled and cracked during the quake. Within days, County officials estimated the damage at $362 million. According to an early estimate by the USGS, the economic costs to Napa County may go as high as $1 billion.Stevens, Matt. Napa, Calif., earthquake: Economic hit could reach $1 billion, Los Angeles Times, August 25, 2014. Several wineries including Hess Collection and Trefethen Vineyards suffered damage to buildings and infrastructure. Several wine storage facilities also suffered damage and loss of property. Estimates of the damage to the wine industry were downgraded to between $80 and $100 million in a September 5, 2014 report from Silicon Valley Bank to the Napa County Board of Supervisors. On September 16, 2014 in a report to the Napa City Council, members were briefed on the status of damage sustained. City Staff reported that 156 commercial and residential structures had been red-tagged and 1398 had been yellow-tagged. It was also reported that the estimate for damage to the City's infrastructure had reached $57.9 million. This total included repairs made to 144 water mains, repairs or replacement of a compromised water tank in Brown's Valley that is part of the City's water system and repair of 294 locations where streets and sidewalks had been damaged. USGS ShakeMap for the event =Injuries= About 200 injured people were treated at Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa. Thirteen of those injured were admitted. Nicholas Dillon was gravely injured after many bricks from a chimney fell on him. Many of the injuries were lacerations and abrasions from fallen debris. At least six of the injuries were classified as critical.KGO-TV report from Queen of the Valley Medical Center, 4:45 pm In Vallejo, 49 people were injured, including two who were hospitalized. CNN reported one individual still in critical condition, later discovery determined as a 58-year-old male who went through two surgeries, awakening four days later in ICU to discover it was going to take him approximately two years to learn how to walk again. One person died September 5 as a result of injuries from the quake. =Recovery= Several of the historic buildings damaged in the earthquake have been repaired while others are still awaiting renovation and restoration. The Uptown Theater was the first to reopen on November 9, 2014. The congregation of the First Presbyterian Church moved back into the sanctuary in July 2016 following repairs and restoration at a cost of $850,000. The United Methodist Church received $2.2 million in repairs and upgrades and reopened the doors to its congregation in November 2015. A $1.75 million contract to repair damage to the Goodman Library was awarded in January 2017 and work on the building is expected to be completed in early 2018. The United States Postal Service determined that repairing the building would be too costly and sold it to a developer for $2 million. The developer plans to turn the building into a hotel. An $11.6 million contract for restoration of the courthouse was awarded by Napa County in August 2017. The heavily damaged Trefethen Vineyard Eschol building was restored from earthquake damage following over two years of repairs and improvements. =Hydrologic effects= The event was credited with large, temporary increases in the water flow of several nearby streams, including Carriger Creek, Calabasas Creek, Felder Creek, Sonoma Creek, Tulocay Creek, Green Valley Creek, and Wild Horse Creek. In addition, the water levels of several wells in the Sonoma Valley rose suddenly at the time of the quake, in one instance by . =Fault creep= In the following months, geologists studying the effects of the event warned that a potential afterslip could cause the previously unmapped portion of the fault in the Browns Valley area of Napa to slowly move up to another in the next 3 years. Earthquake warning An experimental earthquake warning system being developed by the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory issued a warning upon detecting the P-waves five seconds before the slower, more destructive S-waves arrived in Berkeley. Initially this was reported to be a 10-second warning in Berkeley, but revised information indicates only a 5-second warning was provided. This means the S-waves had already arrived in Napa and Vallejo when the warning was issued. Seismic Warning Systems, Inc., a private earthquake warning company based in Scotts Valley, CA, had installed on-site warning systems at five fire stations in Vallejo in 2002 and 2003. These systems commanded the bay doors to open at these fire stations between 1.7 and 2.4 seconds before the S-waves arrived at each fire station. Earthquake warning systems could potentially give people time to take cover in the event of a quake, preventing injuries caused by falling debris, automatically stopping trains or shutting off gas lines. The system being developed at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (called ShakeAlert) in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey, the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington, will eventually cover the entire West Coast. The system would cost $80 million in funding to run for five years in California, or $120 million for the whole West Coast. In December 2014, United States Congress approved a $5 million allocation as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 in order to expand funding for development of the system.

On August 10, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. Some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place, but dry air soon impinged upon the system and imparted weakening. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean for several days. On August 19, an area of low pressure consolidated within the wave west of Central America. With favorable atmospheric conditions, convective activity and banding features increased around the system and by August 22, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370 mi (595 km) south- southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Development was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within six hours of formation and hurricane-force by August 23\\\\. However, due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. On August 24, Marie developed an eye and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h). At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575 mi (925 km) across. Marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on August 25 which prompted steady weakening. Over the next several days, Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. On August 29, after having lost all signs of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale- force on August 30\\\\. The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September 2 about 1,200 mi (1,950 km) northeast of Hawaii. Although Marie's center remained well away from land throughout its entire existence, its large size brought increased surf to areas from Southwestern Mexico northward to southern California. Off the coast of Los Cabos, three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas. In Colima and Oaxaca, heavy rains from outer bands caused flooding, resulting in two fatalities. Similar effects were felt across Baja California Sur. Toward the end of August, Marie brought one of the largest hurricane-related surf events to southern California in decades. Swells of battered coastal areas, with structural damage occurring on Santa Catalina Island and in the Greater Los Angeles Area. A breakwater near Long Beach sustained $10 million worth of damage, with portions gouged out. One person drowned in the surf near Malibu. Hundreds of ocean rescues, including over 100 in Malibu alone, were attributed to the storm, and overall losses reached $20 million. Meteorological history On August 10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a westward moving tropical wave emerging off the west coast of Africa, centered along 16¬∞W. Accompanied by disorganized convective activity, development, if any, was expected to be slow. A broad area of low pressure subsequently formed within the wave about halfway between Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. Embedded within an elongated trough, the weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished. Interaction with a monsoon trough reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on August 11 across a large area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, but the surface low had dissipated by this time. Development was no longer expected over the following days as dry air created a hostile area for storm organization. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic and entered the Caribbean Sea on August 16. Subsequent interactions with South America and an upper-level trough inhibited improvement of the system. Beginning on August 17, the NHC anticipated that a low pressure area would form within five days to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the potential for development to 60%. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection, developing a low pressure area on August 19\\\\. Conditions were favorable for further development, and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August 20. After an increase in rainbands and outflow around the well-defined center, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August 22 about 370 mi (595 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. A strong ridge over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone. Conditions were favorable for the nascent depression to strengthen. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model predicted the system would become a Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale when the system was only a tropical depression. Only six hours after the NHC issued its first advisory the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Marie, the thirteenth named storm of the 2014 season. The storm very quickly organized, developing a central dense overcast consisting of intense convection; this was aided by warm water temperatures and low wind shear. On August 23, the NHC upgraded Marie to hurricane status, and an eye began forming later that day. On the next day, as the storm rapidly intensified, the eye became much more distinct and was surrounded by a powerful eyewall. During this phase the storm wobbled, shifting due west before resuming its previous motion. At 18:00 UTC on August 24, Marie attained Category 5 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, the first such Pacific hurricane since Celia in 2010. The NHC estimated peak sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h), based on a Dvorak T-number of 7.0 provided by TAFB and SAB. They also estimated Marie's minimum barometric pressure at 918 mbar (hPa; 27.11 inHg), ranking as the seventh- strongest in the Pacific east of the International Date Line since records began in 1949. Coincidentally, Hurricane Odile attained the same pressure just three weeks later. At its peak, Marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm-force winds covering an area 575 mi (925 km) across. Shortly after Marie attained peak intensity, the convection weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, in which an outer eye formed. The storm also weakened due to gradually decreasing water temperatures. By early on August 26, the eye became much less defined. The double eye feature persisted through that day, although the outer eyewall opened up as thunderstorms weakened further. Late on August 27, Marie weakened to tropical storm status, by which time the circulation became exposed from the convection. A strengthening ridge near California caused the storm to accelerate more to the west-northwest, into an area of cooler waters and dry air. Failing to produce any additional convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low late on August 28. The residual circulation gradually wound down as it continued northwest. Through August 29, the system continued to produce gale-force winds. Turning west and later west-southwest within a weak easterly flow, Marie slowly moved across the open Pacific while remaining a broad, weak cyclone. The former cyclone eventually lost a well-defined center and dissipated on September 2, about 1,200 mi (1,950 km) northeast of Hawaii. Preparations and impacts =Mexico= Although the core of Hurricane Marie remained well offshore, a \\"green\\" alert was issued for Guerrero and Oaxaca and a \\"blue\\" (minimal) alert was issued for Jalisco, Colima, Michoac√°n, and Chiapas. Heavy rains in Oaxaca triggered flooding and landslides, with the districts of Juquila and Pochutla being most affected. Five people were swept away by a swollen river; all were wounded but later rescued. A portion of Federal Highway 200 and a bridge were closed. Approximately 10,000 people were in need of assistance and a disaster declaration was requested for the state of Oaxaca. Storm surge in Colima destroyed four buildings and damaged ten more. Flooding along the Marabasco and San Nicol√°s rivers resulted in two fatalities. Minor flooding also occurred near Acapulco and in Colima where waves pounded the coast. In Guadalajara, numerous trees were downed and 12 shops were closed. Off the coast of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on August 25\\\\. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three remained missing and were later presumed dead. Strong rain bands along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state. Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August 25. =United States= Large swells at \\"The Wedge\\" at Newport Beach, California Owing to the size of Marie, increased surf was anticipated well north of the hurricane. High surf advisories were issued in California for the Greater Los Angeles Area. Forecasters at the local National Weather Service office warned residents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could \\"potentially see the largest surf in recent years generated by a hurricane.\\" Swells of were anticipated with the risk of coastal flooding and structural damage. Advisories were also issued for Orange and Santa Barbara counties. Surf in the region ultimately reached along south-facing shores while west-facing beaches only saw waves up to . The combination of large swells, high tide, and powerful south-to-north longshore currents impeded by the bight formed by the Palos Verdes Peninsula resulted in significant coastal flooding in Seal Beach. A four-block area of oceanfront property was affected; several apartments were left with inches of water on the ground floor. Severe beach erosion resulted in the loss of 10,000‚Äì20,000 yd3 (7,600‚Äì15,200 m3) of sand; a state of emergency was declared to assist with restoration efforts. Near Malibu Pier, several surfers were caught in the rough swells and knocked into each other; one struck a rock, was knocked unconscious, and drowned. Malibu Pier itself sustained some damage and a lifeguard house built in the 1950s was destroyed. North of Malibu, one structure fell into the ocean. The Los Angeles County Fire Department assisted with over 115 ocean rescues on August 26. More than 170 rescues were made the following day, including 73 at the famous surfing spot \\"The Wedge\\" in Newport Beach. Breaches along the Middle Breakwater in Long Beach, California Significant flooding also occurred in and around the Port of Long Beach. The Army Corps of Engineers was sent out to inspect significant damage to the middle breakwater at Long Beach. Eleven sections of the breakwater sustained major damage, including three areas which were completely gouged out. Along the breakwater, of it sustained major damage, saw significant damage, and a further experienced moderate damage. Several hundred tons of rock were estimated to have been dislodged by the storm. The nearby San Pedro and Long Beach breakwaters saw substantial damage as well, though not as severe as the middle breakwater. Debris from the Navy Mole breakwater damaged a roadway near the Sea Launch Commander, within Long Beach. The breach resulted in roughly $3 million in damage to nearby terminals. Two barges and a pleasure craft were loosed from their anchors by the surging waves and had to be towed back. Two terminals had to close due to dangerous conditions for workers. Less than two weeks after Marie, Hurricane Norbert threatened to bring further increased surf to the area. With the breakwater yet to be repaired, a large sand berm was reinforced along beaches and residents were supplied with sandbags. Repair work along the Middle Breakwater on October 29 The Army Corps estimated that it would take more than $20 million to repair just the major breaches along the middle breakwater. On September 18 Connolly- Pacific Co. was contracted for $5m to repair the twelve worst affected areas of the breakwaters and construction began on October 8\\\\. An estimated 20,000‚Äì30,000 tons of rock would be used in the project. A $200,000 repair budget was initially allocated for areas around Navy Mole, including Pier F, J South, and Navy Mole Road; this was later increased to $4 million by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners in January 2015. On Santa Catalina Island, boulders estimated to weigh were tossed inland by the surf. Substantial damage took place at the Avalon Harbor where many dry-docked boats were knocked off their stands. The harbor was littered with debris for several days, mainly pieces of lumber. A pier at White's Landing was also partially destroyed. A boat was tossed onshore at Pebbly Beach into Catalina Laundry, the only laundry business on the island. The building and a nearby boatyard were deemed total losses. Damage at the beach was deemed the worst since September 1997 when Hurricane Linda brought large swells to the region. The Catalina Express ferry halted service on August 27 due to the rough seas. Damage across Catalina Island was estimated to be $3‚Äì5 million. Total losses in California amounted to nearly $20 million.

Built in 1843, it is one of two surviving tenement houses of the many that once lined Main Street near the Great Falls Manufacturing Company. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Lehoullier Building is located on the west side of Main Street, at its junction with Fayette Street. It is a brick building with a gabled roof and five irregularly placed chimneys. It is set on a sloping lot, presenting three stories to Main Street and two to the rear. It is nine bays wide, representing an original division into three separate townhouse-style units. Each unit has since been further subdivided into two units, for a total of six. The ground floor of each section has a center entrance flanked by paired sash windows. The second-floor units, accessed by a two-story porch, have entrances in either the left or right bay. A hip roof covers the porch, and there are smaller sash windows in the third floor bays. The tenement was built by Thomas Parks and Job Harris c. 1843 under a grant from the Great Falls Manufacturing Company, which operated the major textile mills in Somersworth. It is one of two surviving tenement houses that once lined Main Street, and is, along with the mills themselves, one of the few surviving reminders of the city's textile manufacturing past. During the 20th century, the building underwent a number of alterations, many of which have since been reversed by restoration. The ground-floor spaces were adapted for commercial use, and the upper-floor exteriors were rearranged to provide access to the upper units from the back of the building.

Jonathan made his debut screen appearance in the pilot episode \\"Covert Aggression in Netball\\", broadcast on 22 March 2011. Bodie secured the role while working in the United States and returned to Melbourne to play Jonathan. Jonathan is based on the show creator Bevan Lee. He is characterised as a caring, stylish and doting friend. Bodie would often implement his own ideas while filming the character. Jonathan is a gay character and has relationships with Chris Jones (Lachlan Woods) and Rhys Mitchell (Nick Simpson-Deeks). But it is his long-term friendship with Frances James (Virginia Gay) that fills most of his screen time. Originally centric to other character's storylines, the show developed the character during the show's second season. His story found him battling public perceptions of homosexuality and homophobia. Other storylines for the character include his break-up with Chris, romantic life with Rhys and their subsequent wedding. Bodie was delighted that the Seven Network supported his character's gay wedding plot. The character has polarised critics due to his homosexuality. Columnists from The Age often criticised the character. Frances Atkinson named him a cliched role, Melinda Houston thought he was the show's only \\"irritant\\" and Jim Schembri accused him of being a \\"critic-baiting\\" character. But Debi Enker believed writers had toned the character's flamboyancy down. Anthony D. Langford of TheBacklot.com became an avid supporter of Jonathan and Rhys' storyline. While viewer opinion has been positive. TV Week's Erin McWhirter stated that his persona delighted viewers and Matt Akersten of Samesame.com.au noted heightened viewer support for his storyline with Rhys. Development =Creation and casting= Bodie had previously worked with Winners and Losers producer Maryanne Carroll on a show titled Short Cuts. She remembered his work and helped him secure the role. He sent the self-test footage over to the casting department in Australia. Bodie was in the United States at the time he auditioned. He was required to carry out to further auditions before being officially cast. Bodie returned to Australia and branded Jonathan his dream role. Bodie's casting in the show was publicised in tabloid media ahead of the series premiere. In a press release Bodie stated \\"I've never hit that prime time slot before, this is an exciting point in my career, something I've never done before.\\" =Characterisation= Jonathan is a country boy originally from the Dandenongs. He was raised in an accepting and supportive family consisting of an \\"intelligent mother and gentle vintner Dad\\". Bodie has stated that the character is based on show on creator Bevan Lee and he wrote many of the character's \\"one-liners\\". The characters qualities are a caring nature and being a good friend. Bodie told Erin McWhirter from TV Week that his character loves his best friend Frances James (Virginia Gay) dearly and added \\"he's always carefree and enjoying himself.\\" He added that viewers had approached him wanting to hire an assistant like Jonathan. A writer from the official Winners & Losers website described him as \\"born to be helpful, efficient, bossy and well - right.\\" He has a stylish fashion sense, loves good food and wine and knows the best people and venues around Melbourne. His has charming and erudite persona and a \\"super efficient assistant\\" who is always well dressed in a business suit. Jonathan is an openly gay man. But he is not overly camp or effeminate. He is well spoken but can unleash his sharp wit on others. Bodie was often asked by fans about his own sexuality. The actor took it as a compliment because he felt like he portrayed Jonathan's homosexuality in an accurate manner. Bodie had to tone down his own \\"over-the-top\\" personality while playing Jonathan. He liked to add his own ideas into the characterisation but during filming directors often refused. Bodie quipped that he did not do the role justice unless directors told no more than times. Bodie said that he has a similar energy to Jonathan who is always trying to cheer the other characters up. He said that he likes to play such characters because you can be more creative. He added that Jonathan often gets to play out the show's comic relief because he is not \\"necessarily straight laced, boring or the lead [character].\\" =Friendship with Frances James= Jonathan shares a close friendship with Frances. Bodie told a reporter from Yahoo!7 that Jonathan adores Frances for who she is. As her personal assistant he not only helps to take charge of her work life but her personal life too. Bodie enjoyed working with Gay on Jonathan and Frances' friendship. He found their scenes \\"creative, playful and fresh.\\" He stated that his character's entire existence on the show hinged on the chemistry he and Gay shared. Bodie added that \\"the favourite aspect of playing my character is that with every day I get to explore, invest, create and delight in each scene trying to make Frances ease up on the heartburn.\\" Jonathan finds Frances hilarious but he constantly worries about her emotions which he believes to be damaged. He understands her and realises that she can handle businessmen but is unable to deal with romance. He serves to help her out in romantic situations. Gay has stated that Jonathan is so important to Frances because he is her complete opposite. She described him as \\"impulsive, ridiculous, socially canny, he's the yin to her yang.\\" =Relationships= The character was originally partnered with Chris Jones (Lachlan Woods), who unlike Jonathan was from an unaccepting family and did not dare disclose his relationship with Jonathan. This element makes Jonathan feel lucky to be loved by those closest to him. Chris ultimately ends their relationship. TV Week's Erin Miller reported that Jonathan would see Chris while on a night out with Sophie Wong (Melanie Vallejo). But Chris reveals that he is now straight and introduces them to his girlfriend. Miller added that the revelation would be a \\"shocking blow\\" for Jonathan. Bodie revealed that Jonathan's personal life would be explored more during the show's second season. Jonathan begins a relationship with Rhys Mitchell (Nick Simpson-Deeks). But this is awkward because Rhys' coming out had broken his former girlfriend, Jenny Gross' (Melissa Bergland) heart and she is also friends with Jonathan. The pair face further problems when Rhys cannot embrace Jonathan's public displays of affection because he feels awkward about society's reaction. The show invested more time in their relationship towards the season two finale. When Jonathan helps to plan Sophie and Doug Graham's (Tom Wren) wedding he discusses his own thoughts on marriage. Rhys is inspired by Jonathan's views and proposes to him. The pair marry surrounded by their friends. But their ceremony is deemed illegal under Australian law. Bodie explained to Miller that Rhys is leaving to work overseas with Zach Armstrong (Stephen Phillips). The pair love each other so should make it official. He branded their ceremony \\"sweet\\" and was proud to be involved in a gay wedding storyline. He added \\"I was glad Channel Seven was glad to back the topic - it was beautifully written.\\" Following Rhys' departure the duo's relationship was played out off-screen. Don Groves from If Magazine reported that Bodie had signed with management in the United States and planned to take his career there. Jonathan departed the show during the third season finale. The episode featured the departures of various regular characters. Rhys was briefly written back into the series with a surprise visit for Jonathan. His final scenes saw him leaving to live in San Francisco with Rhys. Reception TV Week's McWhirter said that Jonathan had delighted viewers as the \\"happy-go-lucky assistant\\". Tim Hunter (gaynewsnetwork.com.au) branded him a \\"likeable but stereotypical gay man\\" but originally \\"fairly one-dimensional, more of a caricature or cipher than a real character\\". But they praised his character development during the second season and believing that he had transformed into a \\"fleshed out\\" character. Hunter applauded the exploration of public displays of affection and homophobia. Matt Akersten of Samesame.com.au named Rhys' proposal of marriage a \\"very cute marriage proposal scene\\" and that viewers reacted positively to the storyline. Clem Bastow from The Vine criticised the character stating \\"the less said about Frances' snappy gay offsider Jonathan the better. At least Anthony and Stanford on SATC had inner lives beyond their hysterical one- liners.\\" Melinda Houston (The Sunday Age) said that Jonathan was one of the only ongoing gay roles on Australian television. Debi Enker from The Age believed that the show \\"dialled down the camp flamboyance of a cliched gay BFF\\" in season two. Their colleague Frances Atkinson branded it a \\"somewhat cliched role\\". But Melinda Houston was not impressed with \\"the camp, promiscuous sidekick with an eagle eye for fashion\\". She questioned whether all gay men behaved like Jonathan and branded him the show's only \\"irritant\\". While Jim Schembri branded him a \\"critic-baiting\\" character. Anthony D. Langford writing for TheBacklot.com bemoaned Jonathan and Rhys' lack of storyline presence. He felt that the characters were not given the screen-time to fully explore the issue of them moving in together. He was angry that Jonathan considered moving away with Rhys because he believed that they were moving to fast. Langford later stated that he thought fictional gay romances were often unrealistically rushed on-screen. But he decided that Jonathan and Rhys were an exception, that he loved and fan worshipped them. In 2014, Langford criticised Jonathan and Rhys' departure. He added that Jonathan only ever served as \\"Frances' BFF\\" and said his romance took place mostly off- screen.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Milton Town House is located in central eastern Milton, in the middle of the triangular junction of Town House Road and New Hampshire Route 125. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. There are two entrances on the eastern facade, with flanking windows at a raised elevation, and a central window in the gable above. All of the building's windows have fully operable shutters that are normally closed when the building is not in use. An iron railing, originally intended as a means to tie up horses, extends around the north and west sides. The interior is finished in knotty pine, with a pressed tin ceiling. The building was originally two full stories, and was built in 1803 (one year after the town was incorporated) to serve as a church and civic meeting space. The town purchased the building in 1855 after the local congregation became divided over religious issues and decided to sell the building. The town reduced it to a single story, and removed its interior religious trappings. The pulpit was reinstalled in 1965, but not at its original location, as a reminder of the building's religious past. The National Register listing includes a rebuilt copy of the town's original animal pound, a unique circular fieldstone structure which stands across Route 125. It was built in 1804, rebuilt in 1823, and moved and rebuilt when the highway was widened in 1928. It is one of three surviving stone 19th-century pounds in New Hampshire.

It is the main tributary of the Osun River. The landscape varies from wooded savanna in the north to rain forest in the south. The river is heavily polluted. Most of the people who live along its length practice farming and fishing. Name The ·ªåba River is named for the goddess ·ªåba, one of the wives of Shango, the Yoruba god of thunder. His other wives were ·ªåshun and ·ªåya. According to legend, ·ªåshun tricked ·ªåba into cutting off her ear and adding it to Shango's food, saying it would please him. When Shango found out what ·ªåba had done he, furious, screamed and Osun and Oba fled frightened, turning into the two rivers. That is why the meeting point of the Osun and Oba rivers is so rushing. Course The Oba River is the main tributary of the Osun River. It rises about north of Ogbomosho in Oyo State. The river flows past Ogbomosho, where it is dammed. The Ogbomoso Reservoir on the Oba River was completed in 1964, covers an area of and has a storage capacity of . The dam is fed by the Idekun, Eeguno, Akanbi Kemolowo, Omoogun and Yakun streams, and has a catchment area of . The Oba continues south from the dam until it joins the Oshun River just above the settlement of Odo Oba. Settlements along its course from north to south include Apo, Iluju, Obada, Mosunmade, Otuokun, Bale, Olori and Olumoye. The river receives a left tributary just downstream from Obada and another left tributary to the south of Olori. The second tributary flows past Ife Odan. The ·ªåba River joins the ·ªåshun River in a series of rapids. The two rivers meet at the northern end of the Asejire Reservoir. Environment The climate in the upper part of the river around Ogbomoso has consistently high temperatures, with moderate to heavy rainfall in March‚ÄìJuly. Annual rainfall averages . The vegetation is derived savanna, between the northern savanna zone and the Ibadan region rain forests. A study published in 2014 found that the fish in the Ogbomoso Reservoir were infected with parasites that could cause a risk to human consumers. The Oba River is heavily polluted, at class V on the Prati scale. There is little or no dissolved oxygen in the water. Sources of pollution include sewage and domestic and market waste, and includes much inert matter that is not readily biodegradable. Economy The people along the whole length of the Oba River are mostly engaged in farming and fishing. In 1977 the land use around the Ogbomoso Reservoir was 71.9% forest, 4.9% arable and 23.2% fallow. By 1992 land use was 23.5% forest, 60.5% arable and 16.0% fallow. The main crops were maize and vegetables, particularly okra. Farmers were making heavy use of nitrogenous fertiliser. In 2014 farm workers from northern Nigeria had started to practice irrigation farming in the Oba River basin at Ikose, Ogbomoso North Local Government and Iluju, Ikoyi-Ile, Orire Local Government in Oyo State. They were using pumps to take water from the Oba River, often piping it a kilometre or more to their farmland. Crops include vegetables, okra, maize, garden eggs and water melon. The farmers were finding a ready market with buyers from Osun, Ondo and Oyo states. Irrigation farming is unusual in the region since rainfall is fairly plentiful, but is common in the northern states where the farmers originate.

Southeast Asia Library Group (SEALG) History In 1971, Cambodia (then known as Khmer Republic) was accepted as a member of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO). It was in this same year, SEAMEO launched the Applied Research Center for Archeology and Fine Arts (ARCAFA) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The goal of ARCAFA was to discover and preserve the cultural heritage of Southeast Asia. Due to the Civil War in Cambodia, SEAMEO transferred ARCAFA's base to Thailand in 1973.SEAMEO ‚Äì History In March 1978, SEAMEO re-established ARCAFA as SEAMEO Project in Archaeology in Fine Arts thereby creating the acronym SPAFA. Being a project, the SPAFA organizational structure consisted of a Co-ordinating Unit which was based in Bangkok, and a network of Sub- Centres established in the participating member countries. From 1978 to 1981, SPAFA launched its First Development Plan with only three member countries: Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. The plan focused on the restoration and preservation of ancient monuments, prehistory, and underwater archaeology. In 1981, SPAFA became a permanent project and in its Second Development Plan, which covered the five years from 1981-1986, the programmes in fine arts activities were included. Stress was given to the promotion of the understanding and appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of the region. The plan emphasized archaeological researches as well as researches dealing with documentation of the vanishing forms of traditional arts, both creative and performing arts, and the continuance of programmes on preservation and conservation of surviving artifacts which abound in the region.‚ÄúSoutheast Asian Archaeology International Newsletter. Issue No. 5. Oct-Nov 1994. ‚ÄúWhat is SPAFA?‚Äù Arising from the needs expressed by the member states through visits and surveys by the working team to prepare the project personnel, it was decided that the nature of activities of SPAFA would be in five areas; i.e. # Training # Seminar and conferences # Research and development # Personnel exchange # Library and documentation. It was also decided that information about the project activities as well as academic and professional knowledge should be disseminated through publication of a journal entitled SPAFA Digest, and the proceedings of workshops and seminars. These information materials are distributed to scholars, researchers and those interested in archaeology, history and fine arts, within the region as well as outside. The Project achieved its goals successfully and was well received by SEAMEO member states, SEAMEO associated member countries, donor countries and international organizations having similar purpose such as UNESCO, ICOM, ICCROM, and so on. Contributions of books for the library, and fellowships were received from France, the Netherlands and the Bangkok Bank, Thailand. The works of the Co- ordinating Unit and the Sub-Centres network were duly recognized. In 1984, SPAFA began to work out its future plan which would enable it to play a bigger role along with other SEAMEO Centres for improvement of the quality of life of the peoples in Southeast Asia. The programme and activities were to be strengthened by reconstituting SPAFA into a Regional Centre. In 1985, at the SEAMEO Council's Twentieth Conference in Manila, the idea to turn SPAFA from a Project into a Regional Centre was endorsed by the SEAMEO Council, and the Government of Thailand agreed to host the new Regional Centre, which would be called the SEAMEO Regional Centre for Archaeology and Fine Arts. The acronym SPAFA, however, was maintained because of its well established recognition.

Built in the 1810s and repeatedly extended, it dates to the early settlement period of Milton, and is, along with the adjacent Plumer-Jones Farm, one of the oldest farm properties in the state. Both are now part of the New Hampshire Farm Museum. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Plummer Homestead is located on the west side of White Mountain Highway (New Hampshire Route 125) in central Milton. It is a typical 19th-century New England connected farmstead, with a main house, \\"little house\\", \\"back house\\", and barn, extending westward from the road. The main block of the house was originally a 1-1/2 story Cape-style house, which was raised to a full two stories in 1848. An extended seven-bay ell connects this main block to a c. 1870 barn. This cluster of buildings stands on about of land, the remnant of a once larger property reduced in part by the construction of the nearby Spaulding Turnpike. Its immediate surroundings are typical of a 19th-century farm layout, with a grassy and slightly more formal front yard, a working main yard on the south side of the building, where entrances to each of the farmstead's sections are located, and the farm's vegetable garden, located just north of the farmstead. The main house was built in the 1780s by Beard Plumer, brother of Joseph Plumer who built the adjacent Plumer-Jones Farm, and it was occupied by a succession of Plumer (later Plummer) descendants until the 1990s. It was acquired by the New Hampshire Farm Museum in 1993, which offers tours of the property and uses it in its historical programs.

It is located on Bernstorffsvej and was inaugurated on 4 February 1912. The cemetery serves Gentofte Municipality and the northnmost part of Copenhagen Municipality. History The establishment of a cemetery in Hellerup was first proposed in 1907 and Gentofte Municipality acquired a piece of land from Ibenske Jorder and laid it out as a burial site the following year. In 1912, after the local land owners' association had complained about the \\"scandalous state\\" of the site, the municipality commissioned a landscape architect to redesign the cemetery which was inaugurated on 4 February that same year. The cemetery has later been extended several times, most recently in 1920 when a 15,000 square metre piece of land on Ryg√•rds All√© was added to the grounds.

The film stars Dennis Morgan, Jane Wyman, Wayne Morris and Arthur Kennedy. The film was released by Warner Bros. on July 26, 1941. Plot After the war, with Confederate money now useless, many Missouri farmers find themselves unable to pay their bills. William Merrick and his men begin foreclosing on them or running them off, resulting in the death of Martha Adams, sweetheart of one of the Younger gang. The brothers Cole, Bob and Jim Younger ride back to Missouri just as their father is shot by Merrick's hired gun, Greg Bilson. A sheriff is killed as well and the Youngers are falsely accused of murdering him, so they retaliate by joining Jesse James's gang and pulling off robberies, giving the money to the needy farmers to pay their taxes. Merrick decides to flush out Jim Younger by arresting the woman he loves, Mary Hathaway, as an accomplice to the Younger brothers' crimes. He offers to exchange Mary for Jim behind bars, secretly plotting to kill Jim once he's in his custody. The Youngers turn the tables, leading Merrick and Bilson to their own accidental deaths. They leave town and head for Minnesota to pull off another theft, but Mary and the Missourians try to figure a way to bring them safely back home.

Skagen (1884) Launching the Boat. Skagen () is an 1884 painting by the Swedish artist Oscar Bj√∂rck. It depicts the activities of the local fishermen, a favourite subject for the Skagen Painters. Launching the Boat is the largest of Bj√∂rck's open-air paintings from Skagen. It is on display in Skagens Museum. Background The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Oscar Bj√∂rck first arrived in Skagen in 1882, encouraged by P. S. Kr√∏yer whom he had met in Paris. He immediately became attached to the artists' community there, especially Michael Ancher, his wife Anna and Holger Drachmann. Bj√∂rck spent several summers there, completing some of his best paintings under the influence of Kr√∏yer and the French Naturalism movement. Painting description Measuring , Launching the Boat is the largest of Bj√∂rck's open-air paintings from Skagen. It presents the everyday work of the local fishermen. In contrast to Ancher's Will He Round the Point?, there is no sense of alarm or danger in his painting. The thick layers of paint on the canvas help to convey the foaming surf and the coarseness of the sand. The fisherman at the front of the boat is Ole Svendsen who can also be seen in many of Ancher's paintings of the Skagen fishermen. The painting is in the collection at Skagens Museum.

He was the highest-rated two-year-old trained in France in 1974, when he was unbeaten in three race including the Prix des Ch√™nes and the Grand Crit√©rium. After extending his winning run to four when winning the Prix Greffulhe on his debut as a three-year-old, he was beaten in his three subsequent races but continued to display top-class form when being placed in the Prix Lupin, Prix du Jockey Club and Prix d'Ispahan. Despite being retired in the summer of his second season, Mariacci defeated many of the best French horses of his era including Allez France, Ivanjica, Green Dancer, Val de l'Orne and Nobiliary. He made little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Mariacci was a \\"neat, good-looking\\" bay horse bred in France by his owner Guy de Rothschild. His sire, Djakao, was a stayer who won the Grand Prix de Deauville and was placed in both the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris in 1969. The best of Djakao's other progeny included the Arlington Million winner Perrault and the Prix Lupin winner Belgio. Mariacci's dam Marbrisa was a moderate racehorse but was a granddaughter of Temora, a half-sister of The Derby winner Galcador. During his racing career, Mariacci was trained by Jean- Michel de Choubersky. Racing career =1974: two-year-old season= Mariacci began his racing career in the Prix de Cr√®vec≈ìur for previously unraced horses over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August and won by three quarters of a length. In September, the colt was moved up in class and distance for the Prix des Ch√™nes over 1600 metres at Longchamp. Starting at odds of 7/1 he was restrained in last place before making ground to challenge for the lead in the straight. He moved up alongside Green Dancer 200 metres from the finish and after a \\"sharp struggle\\" prevailed by half a length with the pair finishing eight lengths clear of Mister Jacket in third place. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when Green Dancer was sent to England and won the Observer Gold Cup. On his final appearance of the season, Maricci contested France's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Grand Crit√©rium at Longchamp on 13 October. Ridden by Gerard Rivases, he started the 4.3/1 third favourite in the betting behind the Angel Penna Sr.-trained Val du Fier and the Prix La Rochette winner Dandy Lute: the other runners included Sky Commander (Prix Robert Papin), Val de l'Orne and Nobiliary. Restrained by Rivases in the early stages, Mariacci overtook Val de l'Orne 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths. =1975: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Mariacci started 11/10 favourite against sixteen opponents in the Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres at Longchamp on 6 April. Rivases employed exaggerated waiting tactics, delaying his challenge until the last 200 metres but Mariacci maintained his unbeaten record, winning by a nose and a head from Good Point and Top Gear. On 18 May, over the same course and distance, Mariacci faced Green Dancer again in the Prix Lupin. The two colts engaged in a prolonged struggle in the straight, and Green Dancer inflicted Mariacci's first defeat as he prevailed by three quarters of a length. There was a gap of six lengths back to Matahawk, who went on to win the Grand Prix de Paris. Green Dancer was sent to England for The Derby and in the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 8 June Mariacci started second favourite behind Val de l'Orne. After fighting Rivases's attempts to restrain him in the early stages he looked likely to make a serious challenge in the straight before finishing third, beaten a head and two and a half lengths by Val de l'Orne and Patch. Mariacci was matched against older horses for the first time in the Prix d'Ispahan over 1850 metres on 29 June. Starting the 4/1 second favourite he proved too good for Allez France and Ivanjica but, in a huge upset, he finished second to the 33/1 outsider Ramirez. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1974: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the official French handicap, Mariacci was the top-rated two-year-old of the year, one pound ahead of Green Dancer and two ahead of the filly Broadway Dancer. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 133, one pound behind their best two-year- old Grundy. In their annual Racehorses of 1974 Timeform described Mariacci as \\"superior to any staying colt we know about\\" and said that he would be \\"very difficult to beat\\" if he was to contest the Epsom Derby. In 1975, Mariacci was given a rating of 128 by Timeform, nine pounds below their Horse of the Year Grundy. In the official French handicap he was rated the fourth-best three- year-old colt of the year behind Val de l'Orne, Patch and Green Dancer. Stud record Mariacci did not race again after finishing second in the Prix d'Ispahan and was retired to stand at the Haras du Meautry at an initial fee of 20,000 francs. He sired very few recorded foals, but these included Mariacho, who won the Prix Saint-Roman in 1980.

Based in Nuevo Laredo, Carrasco was the most powerful heroin kingpin in South Texas during his prime in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He has been cited as the \\"biggest and deadliest drug lord on the Texas-Mexico border, overseeing a cocaine and heroin empire that stretched from Guadalajara to San Diego, California, and Chicago, Illinois.\\" He was described as a \\"slightly overweight Mexican man of average height, perhaps a little taller than most Mexican men\\" who never smiled, and although only 34, was already referred to as \\"El Viejo\\" (The Old Man) due to his experience in drug dealing. In Gilb's Hecho en Tejas, he states that \\"more corridos have been written about Carrasco than Gregorio Cortez\\". Carrasco was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1940. He was arrested in Guadalajara in September 1972 after being found in possession with 213 pounds of heroin worth over $100 million. However, by December 1972, Carrasco escaped in Jalisco in a laundry truck after bribing the authorities. He was arrested again in July 1973 in San Antonio, Texas, surviving four gunshot wounds fired at him by police. He was also charged for killing a police officer and was suspected of murdering at least 47 people. From July 24 to August 3, 1974, Carrasco unsuccessfully attempted to escape from Huntsville Prison in Huntsville, Texas during an armed takeover. Carrasco's attorney, Ruben Montemayor, attempted to mediate the 11-day siege, the longest in prison history. Carrasco committed suicide after a ten-minute gun battle with law enforcement. Suzanne Oboler, Professor of Latin American Studies at the City University of New York, considers the imprisonment of G√≥mez Carrasco and others such as Jimmy Santiago Baca, Ricardo S√°nchez, Ra√∫l Salinas, Modesta Avila, Judy Lucero and Alvaro Luna Hernandez to be \\"inextricably linked to colonial domination and the subsequent struggle for material resources in the southwestern United States\\", rather than being purely about drug dealing and murdering. The consensus among law enforcement officials is that Carrasco is known to have murdered at least forty-eight people (including the librarian he shot on August 3, 1974) during and after his rise to power and that he did so for monetary gain, prestige and power in the Mexican/American drug trade.

Its stated aim is to reduce 'the environmental and social impacts of sugarcane production while recognising the need for economic viability'. It does this through setting sustainability standards and certifying sugar cane products including ethanol, sugar and molasses. , 25% of global land planted in sugar cane was Bonsucro certified. Bonsucro has more than 500 members in more than 40 countries around the world including farmers, millers, traders, buyers and support organisations. Bonsucro is one of the few certifications to have developed measures for greenhouse gas emissions, and consequently the European Commission has stated that the Bonsucro standard can be used to demonstrate compliance with the EU Renewables Directive (EU RED) when importing ethanol fuel, although the standard had to be altered to comply fully. Both Bonsucro and the standards set by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials have been noted as in practise expanding the EU RED guidelines to include other factors, such as land tenure issues as prescribed by national law. EU market access has been labeled as important by Colombian policy-makers, and described as driving the country's national policy aiming for 40% Bonsucro sugarcane. However, this use of certification in the context of biofuels has caused concern regarding the consequences of intensification in Colombia, although as of November 2014 no mills had yet achieved certification in the country. The first Bonsucro certified ethanol fuel, from Brazil, was first imported into Europe through the Port of Rotterdam in 2012.

Joining the army in 1874 Plessier fought in the Sino-French War and in Algeria. As a general in the First World War he led his brigade during the Battle of Mulhouse where he was wounded by German fire. Plessier, hit in three places in his spine, succumbed to his wounds eight days later in hospital. He is sometimes regarded as the first French officer to be killed during the war: although four other generals died before he did, his mortal wound was the first.  Early life and career  Plessier was born at 11pm on 19 May 1856 at Provins, Seine-et-Marne to Louis Francois Plessier, a lawyer, and his wife Victoire Toureau. He volunteered for the French Army on 19 October 1874 and entered the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr on 21 October 1874. Ranked 355th out of his class of 395 cadets, he was commissioned as a sous-lieutenant (second lieutenant) in the 96th Line Infantry Regiment on 22 September 1876. He attended the French Army's musketry school at Valbonne from 15 October 1877 to 5 January 1878 and was ranked 35th of 55 students. Promoted to lieutenant on 13 October 1882 in the 121st Line Infantry Regiment, Plessier transferred to the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment on 5 July 1884. He fought in the Sino- French War in Tonkin and Cambodia between 10 August 1884 and 9 December 1886 and, during an action at Angkor Chey on 12 June 1886, was wounded by a bullet in his left shoulder. Plessier was mentioned in dispatches for his actions in Indo-China, received the Tonkin Expedition commemorative medal and, on 7 July 1887, was appointed a chevalier of the Order of Cambodia. Following his return from the campaign, on 12 November 1886 he was promoted to the rank of capitaine (captain). Plessier transferred to the 27th Infantry Regiment on 12 April 1887 and to the 152nd Infantry Regiment on 12 October 1887 before joining the 1st Foreign Regiment on 8 August 1889 for service in Algeria. He remained in Algeria with the Foreign Legion, where he served as adjutant, until his regiment was sent to form part of the army of occupation in Annam and Tonkin on 3 November 1889. Plessier returned to French Indo-China where he served until 1 June 1892, whereupon the regiment returned to Algeria, and received an appointment in the Order of the Dragon of Annam on 17 October 1892 for his service. He was also made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 10 July 1891. He remained in Algeria until his transfer back to Metropolitan France with the 51st Infantry Regiment on 11 September 1892. In 1893 Plessier married Alice-Th√©r√®se-Marie-Am√©lie Dumant and, on 2 October 1895, was promoted to chef de bataillon (major) in the 160th Infantry Regiment. Plessier received promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the 91st Infantry Regiment on 13 July 1902 and was appointed an officer of the Legion of Honour on 12 July 1905, at which point he was serving as commander of 1st Infantry Group of the Verdun fortress.  First World War  Plessier was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade (brigadier general), commanding the 88th Infantry Brigade, on 19 June 1913 and was appointed deputy military governor of Lyon and chief assistant to the commander of Rh√¥ne. Upon the outbreak of war Plessier formed his brigade at Lyon and travelled with it by rail to Grandvillars. The unit took part in the French offensive from Dannemarie towards Mulhouse, which was then part of Germany, and saw action at Altkirch and Illfurth. Plessier was leading a reconnaissance expedition at Geisberg Hill, near Zillisheim on 19 August when he was hit by three bullets in his spinal cord. He was transported back to the Desgenettes military hospital in Lyon but died there of his injuries at 2pm on 27 August. Street sign in Rue du G√©n√©ral Plessier in Lyon Plessier is sometimes considered the first French general to be killed during the war; four other generals pre-deceased him (Raffenel, Rondony, Diou and Deffontaines), but Plessier received his mortal wound first. Plessier was posthumously appointed a commander of the Legion of Honour on 16 May 1915, backdated to 21 August 1914. His death, and that of the 600 men of his brigade who died on 19 August, is commemorated by a memorial obelisk in Mulhouse. A street in the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon is named in his honour.

A bit-paired keyboard is a keyboard where the layout of shifted keys corresponds to columns in the ASCII (1963) table, archetypally the Teletype Model 33 (1963) keyboard. This was later contrasted with a typewriter-paired keyboard, where the layout of shifted keys corresponds to electric typewriter layouts, notably the IBM Selectric (1961). The difference is most visible in the digits row (top row): compared with mechanical typewriters, bit-paired keyboards remove the _ character from 6 and shift the remaining &*() from 7890 to 6789, while typewriter-paired keyboards replace 3 characters: from \`\\"\` to \`@\` from \`_\` to \`^\` and from \`'\` to \`*\`. An important subtlety is that ASCII was based on mechanical typewriters, but electric typewriters became popular during the same period that ASCII was adopted, and made their own changes to layout. Thus differences between bit-paired and (electric) typewriter-paired keyboards are due to the differences of both of these from earlier mechanical typewriters. Bit-paired keyboards were common in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, due to ease of manufacture, but died out in the late 1970s with office automation, due to the number of users already accustomed to (electric) typewriter layouts. Bit-paired keyboard layouts survive today only in the standard Japanese keyboard layout, which has all shifted values of digits in the bit-paired layout. Technical details =Background= ASCII table: in bit-paired keyboards, shift corresponds to changing columns. In mechanical typewriters, the shift key functions by mechanically shifting some component so an alternate row of characters on typebars hits the paper. In an electronic system, by contrast, there is no necessary connection between the code points of unshifted and shifted values, though implementation is simpler if the code points of unshifted and shifted keys are related, most simply by a single bit differing. In electromechanical systems, this makes a significant difference in ease of implementation, as shifting must be accomplished by some physical linkage. For this reason, among others (such as ease of collation), the ASCII standard strove to organize the code points so that shifting could be implemented by simply toggling a bit. This is most conspicuous in uppercase and lowercase characters: uppercase characters are in columns 4 (100) and 5 (101), while the corresponding lowercase characters are in columns 6 (110) and 7 (111), requiring only toggling the 6th bit (2nd high bit) to switch case; as there are only 26 letters, the remaining 6 points in each column were occupied by symbols or, in one case, a control character (DEL, in 127). This is also present, but less precisely, in the organization of digits and symbols in columns 2 (010) and 3 (011) ‚Äì this discrepancy is the source of bit-paired layouts. Ideally the characters would have been ordered so that unshifted and shifted values of a typewriter key were in adjacent columns, allowing shifting to be implemented by toggling the 5th bit (1st high bit). Due to other concerns, this correspondence is inexact: for example, SP (Space) and \`0\` (zero) both have low bits 00000 (to ease collation for space and conversion to/from binary coded decimal for 0), preventing \`0\` from lining up with \`)\` (right parenthesis), its conventional value, and thus instead () corresponded to 89, instead of 90 as on typewriters. Further, while digits were placed in column 3, the characters ,-./ (conventionally unshifted) were placed in column 2, to ease collation, due to being used as separators, and the characters ;: (conventionally paired) were both placed in column 3. Other symbols also did not line up with their conventional digit pair, as detailed below. As a result, implementing an electromechanical keyboard that produced an ASCII encoding but had conventional typewriter key mappings would require significant complexity due to key-specific shift mechanisms for digits and symbol keys. This could be avoided by changing the key mappings to correspond to the ASCII table, which was notably done in the Teletype Model 33 (1963). Later keyboards continued to use this mapping, which was formalized in the American Standards Association X4.14-1971 standard, where it is referred to as logical bit pairing, and contrasted with typewriter pairing. In everyday usage these were referred to as bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards. =Mapping= The most conspicuous feature of a bit-paired keyboard are the shifted values of the digits, which are (only 9 values, 0 being unpaired): : ‚Ä¶instead of the conventional mechanical typewriter-paired values of: : ‚Ä¶and the electric typewriter-paired values of: : The shifted values of digits in a bit-paired keyboard thus differ from mechanical typewriters only in omitting _ and shifting the remaining characters left. Electric typewriters differ in replacing \\" with @, _ with ^, and ' with *. This is because smaller characters hit the paper with less force, and consolidating smaller characters such as and into a pair on a single key avoided needing to adjust the force based on shift state. Overall this results in the following comparison between bit- paired keyboards and (electric) typewriter-paired keyboards: they agree in 1, 3, 4, 5, and differ in 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0: bit-pairing replaces @ with \\" (position 2), removes ^ (position 6, shifting later characters left), and replaces * with ' (position 8/7); there is also no shifted value for 0, as this corresponds to space, which is covered by the space bar. This corresponds in the ASCII table to the following columns (displayed as rows here): high low bits bits 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 010 ! \\" # $ % & ' ( ) 011 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 There are also less conspicuous differences in the symbol keys: bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards agree on (rows 12, 14, and 15) but bit-paired keyboards have (rows 10, 11, and 13) instead of and are missing the key, as these are shifted values of digits. This is the complete set of symbols on the Model 33; it is notably missing though these are present on other bit-paired keyboards. On both bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards, are paired (rows 11, 12, and 13), but on bit-paired keyboards are paired and is an unpaired key, while on typewriter-paired keyboards and are shifted digits, while are paired and is paired with . Legacy In the US, bit-paired keyboards continued to be used into the 1970s, including on electronic keyboards like the HP 2640 terminal (1975) and the first model Apple II computer (1977). They died out in the late 1970s, due to the influx of users accustomed to electric typewriters, and were not included in the successor to the X4.14-1971 standard, X4.23-1982. No later common American layout uses bit- pairing. A typewriter-paired layout similar to the IBM Selectric's was used in the DEC VT52 (1975), the IBM PC (1981), and the Model M keyboard (1984). Other personal computers imitated it, resulting in the typewriter-paired layout becoming standard in the US, and to a lesser extent globally. In the UK, bit- paired keyboards were used on most 8-bit computers such as the Acorn BBC computers and the earlier Atom and Systems, the Amstrad CPC series, and (to an extent) the ZX Spectrum. In Europe, keyboards of computers for text processing underwent the transition to national typewriter layouts in the late 1970s, but otherwise the international bit-paired layout of ISO 2530 (1975) remained in use until general-purpose PC keyboards replaced the device-specific ones in the late 1980s. However, bit-pairing spread to countries that did not have as strong a tradition of typewriters but who adopted computers in the 1970s or early 1980s. It was found in the Japanese keyboard layout, the Turkish F-keyboard, and the Russian JCUKEN (Latin) layout. Of these, only the Japanese remains in use; the Turkish layout was replaced by QWERTY with typewriter- paired keys, while the JCUKEN (Latin) was replaced by Cyrillic layouts. The influence of the Selectric layout was incomplete, however, and many layouts use the earlier \`2\\"\` pairing, including UK layout and the Russian JCUKEN Cyrillic layout.

During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was Acting Commissioner of Montserrat for a period. Early years Cyril Hammond Elgie (he later changed his surname to Elgee) was born on 18 October 1871, eldest son of the Reverend Walter Francis Elgie. His mother was Catherine, daughter of Colonel F. Hammond of the 75th Regiment and widow of Captain Webber of the 42nd regiment. She died on 25 February 1881. Cyril was admitted to Lancing College as a scholar in May 1885, and left in July 1889. He was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1890. Career Defense Force, Montserrat, 1915. Seated in centre, left to right : Lieut. Dyett, Capt. Elgee (Acting Commissioner), Capt. Ruane, Canon Hayens In 1892 Elgee became a second lieutenant in the Bedfordshire Regiment. He was made a lieutenant in 1893. In 1895 he served with the Chitral Relief Expedition. He was promoted to captain in 1899. On 28 October 1899 it was reported that Elgee had been seconded for service to the Colonial Office. Appointed 1 January 1903, and taking up his post in February 1903, he was the British Resident in Ibadan, Nigeria from February 1903 until 1913. He succeeded F.C. Fuller as resident in Ibadan. Elgee treated the leading people of Ibadan with courtesy and respect. However, he was not approachable by the ordinary people. In 1903 Elgee wrote of \\"the rapid strides of late made by the people in economical and political progress. There was growing demand for post office services and for plots of land. Six European firms were established by 1903, and twenty-five German, English, French and Brazilian firms had branches in Ibadan by 1906. Elgee wrote of the legal framework in 1904, Based on agreements with Yoruba authorities, the colonial authorities gained jurisdiction to try certain types of civil offence involving non-native people, and certain types of criminal offence whether they involved natives or foreigners. A modified form of English laws was introduced. Elgee established the Ibadan Native Government, opened the Treasury, Customs. Police and Secretariat, and engaged clerks. He resigned his army commission in 1904. In 1906 he founded the Baale's school to provide training to the sons on the local chiefs. The school was not a success since the chiefs would not send their sons there despite pressure from the British authorities. Shipping records show Captain C. H. Elgee returning to England from West Africa on 4 May 1907, 16 September 1910, 23 April 1912 and 14 December 1913. Elgee was Acting-Commissioner, Montserrat in 1915. In 1916 there was correspondence about employment of Captain C. H. Elgee by the government in Montserrat. Elgee died on 17 August 1917, aged 45. St Mathew's Church, Otterbourne has a brass wall plaque in his memory and that of his brother Hugh Francis Elgee, who was killed in action at Gallipoli in 1915.

The area now known as Westchester County had seen human occupation since at least the Archaic period, but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the county did not occur until the Industrial Revolution. Prehistory At the time of European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Native American inhabitants of present Westchester County were part of the Algonquian peoples, whose name for themselves was Lenape, meaning the people. They called the region Lenapehoking, which consisted of the area around and between the Delaware and Hudson Rivers. Two related languages, collectively known as the Delaware languages, were spoken throughout the region: Unami and Munsee. They were part of the larger Algonquian language family and related to Mahican. Munsee was spoken by the inhabitants of present-day Westchester County as well as on Manhattan Island. Some ethnographers, lacking valid contemporary sources, simply referred to the various tribes of the area as Munsee speakers, or, even more generally, as Lenni Lenape. Title deeds given to European settlers supply considerable information on the sub-tribes in the region and their locations. The Manhattans occupied the island known by that name today, as well as the part of southern Westchester now covered by Yonkers. The Wecquaesgeek band of the Wappinger lived along the Hudson River and near the modern settlements of Dobbs Ferry, Tarrytown and White Plains. The Siwanoy lived along the coast of the Long Island Sound near present-day Pelham, New Rochelle, Larchmont, Mamaroneck and Rye. The northern portions of the county were occupied by smaller bands of Wappinger such as the Tankiteke, Kitchawank and Sintsink. Colonial era Van Cortlandt Manor The first European explorers to visit the Westchester area were Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 and Henry Hudson in 1609. European settlers were initially sponsored by the Dutch West India Company in the 1620s and 1630s, while English settlers arrived from New England in the 1640s. By 1664, the Dutch lost control of the area to the English and large tracts of Westchester were established as manors (held by a single owner) or patents (held by partners). The manor and patent owners leased land to tenant farmers and provided them with many essential services. Westchester County was one of the original twelve counties of the Province of New York, created by an act of the New York General Assembly in 1683. At the time it also included present day Bronx County, which included the original Town of Westchester and portions of Yonkers, Eastchester, and Pelham. Philipsburg Manor House During the colonial period, life in Westchester was quite primitive. Roads were few and in poor condition, and transportation was heavily dependent on water. Nearly everything settlers consumed was raised or made on their farms. Wood, cattle and food were bartered for the items the settlers couldn't grow or make themselves. Over time cottage industries, such as shoe and furniture making, sprang up. This led to heavier use of local roads, which encouraged improvements, which in turn spurred increased travel. Taverns catering to travelers were established and ferries were launched. By 1775, Westchester was the richest and most populous county in the colony of New York. American Revolutionary War The county experienced a variety of effects, caused by the American Revolutionary War, as families were often divided between Patriot and Loyalist sympathies. After the battles of Pell's Point and White Plains in 1776, the primary American headquarters was located at Continental Village, north of Peekskill, while the British were headquartered in New York City. The region between Morrisania and the Croton River, which was considered neutral ground between the two camps, was pillaged by both sides. The Philipsburg Manor House played an important role: British General Sir Henry Clinton used the manor house during the war. There in 1779 he wrote the Philipsburg Proclamation, which declared all Patriot-owned slaves to be free, and that blacks taken prisoner while serving in Patriot forces would be sold into slavery. Although the Revolutionary War devastated the county, recovery after the war was rapid. The large landowners in Westchester were mostly Loyalists, and after the war their lands were confiscated by the state and sold. Many local farmers were able to buy the lands they had previously farmed as tenants. In 1788, five years after the end of the war, the county was divided into 20 towns. In 1798, the first federal census recorded a population of 24,000 for the county. 19th century In 1800, the first commercial toll road, the Westchester Turnpike, which ran through Pelham and New Rochelle, was chartered. Other toll roads, including the Croton (Somerstown) Turnpike, were later established. During this same period, steamboats began to be used on the Hudson River. The expansion of transportation options encouraged economic growth. Larger industries were established, such as iron foundries in Peekskill and Port Chester, brickyards in Verplank and Croton, and marble quarries in Ossining and Tuckahoe. Two developments in the first half of the 19th century ‚Äì the construction of the first Croton Dam and Aqueduct, and the coming of the railroad ‚Äì had enormous impact on the growth of both Westchester and New York City. The Croton Dam and Aqueduct was begun in 1837 and completed in 1842. The aqueduct carried water from Croton to two reservoirs in Manhattan to be distributed to the city. Now a National Historic Landmark, the Croton Aqueduct is considered one of the great engineering achievements of the 19th century. In the 1840s, the first railroads were built in Westchester. In 1844, the New York and Harlem Railroad reached White Plains. The Hudson River Railroad was completed to Peekskill in 1849, as was That the New York and New Haven Railroad's route through eastern Westchester. The railroads often determined whether a town grew or declined, and they contributed to a population shift from Northern to Southern Westchester. By 1860, the total county population was 99,000, with the largest city being Yonkers. Many small downtowns, centered on railroad stations, flourished. Civil War monument at Philipse Manor Hall in Getty Square, Yonkers The period following the American Civil War enabled entrepreneurs in the New York area to create fortunes, and many built large estates in Westchester. Several mansions of this era are preserved and open to the public, including: Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, Kykuit in Pocantico Hills, the Jay Heritage Center in Rye, Caramoor in Katonah and Glenview in Yonkers. Expansion of the New York City water supply system also impacted local development, as new dams, bridges and roads were built. The flooding of thousands of acres for reservoirs created considerable dislocations in many towns north of White Plains. The building of the New Croton Dam and its reservoir, for instance, resulted in the relocation of the hamlet of Katonah to higher ground. In North Salem, the hamlet of Purdys was moved when five percent of the town was inundated. During the latter half of the 19th century, Westchester's transportation system and labor force attracted a manufacturing base, particularly along the Hudson River and Nepperhan Creek. Pills and patent medicines were manufactured in Ossining; greenhouses in Irvington; beer in Dobbs Ferry; sugar, paving materials and conduit in Hastings; and in Yonkers, elevators and carpets. In 1874, the western portion of the present Bronx County, consisting of the towns of Kingsbridge, West Farms, and Morrisania, was transferred to the City & County of New York; and in 1895 the remainder of present-day Bronx County, consisting of the Town of Westchester (centered on the present-day Westchester Square) and portions of the towns of Eastchester and Pelham, was also transferred to the City & County of New York. Prior to that, a portion of the town of Eastchester had seceded, to become the city of Mount Vernon. In 1898, these annexed portions were formed into the Borough of the Bronx. In January 1914, The Bronx was split off from New York County and Bronx County was created, thus making the Borough of Manhattan & the County of New York coterminous with each other. 20th century During the 20th century, the rural character of Westchester would transform into the suburban county known today. Between the county's railroad network and the proliferation of the automobile in the early 20th century, working in New York City and living in the country became possible for the middle class. In 1907 the Bronx River Commission, a joint venture between New York City and Westchester County, was established to improve the river's water quality. The Commission's efforts led to the creation of the Bronx River Parkway Reservation, completed in 1925, and the first modern, multi-lane limited- access roadway in North America. The success of the parkway encouraged the County government to develop its parks system, preserving great tracts of open space. Playland in Rye, a National Historic Landmark, opened to the public in 1928, the first planned amusement park in the country, and is operated by Westchester County to this day. The development of Westchester's parks and parkway systems supported existing communities and encouraged the establishment of new ones, transforming the development pattern for Westchester. Homes were constructed on former estates and farms. New businesses appeared in response to expanded markets; White Plains, with branches of many New York City stores, became the County's central shopping district. With the need for homes expanding after World War II, multistory apartment houses appeared in the urbanized areas of the county, while the market for single-family houses continued to expand. By 1950, the total County population was 625,816. Major interstate highways were constructed in Westchester during the 1950s and 1960s. The establishment of these roadways, along with the construction of the Tappan Zee Bridge, encouraged many major corporations, such as PepsiCo, General Foods, Ciba-Geigy and IBM to establish headquarters in Westchester. 21st century See also * List of counties in New York * National Register of Historic Places listings in Westchester County, New York * USS Westchester County (LST-1167) * Downstate New York Notes References Further reading External links * Westchester County Government Hudson Valley Directory, listings pertaining to Westchester County, New York * Westchester County Historical Society Category:Westchester County, New York Westchester ","title":"History of Westchester County"},{"id":"43646491","text":"Republic road I-4 () is a major road in Northern Bulgaria.

Early life and education Harris was born to Alfred F. Harris and Minnie Stull Harris, a granddaughter of Scottish Western Reserve settlers, in Warren, Ohio on June 10, 1891. After graduating from the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey, Harris attended Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. He then attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia until 1912. Later that year, Harris left school to begin his career at Harris Automatic Press Company, the family business. Harris worked as a draftsman in the engineering department until taking on the position of road technician in 1922. Leadership at Harris-Seybold Harris rose to vice president in change of engineering at Harris-Seybold in 1923. Twenty one years later, the company made him its president. Harris succeeded Ray V. Mitchell. While heading engineering initiatives, Harris led the company's development and advancement of offset printing using the lithography. His innovations in this area included the first modern two-color offset and the first process for four-color offsets. Harris also oversaw Harris-Seybold's installation of a research lab to facilitate innovation in lithography and graphic arts. At the time of its creation, the lab was one of the most advanced in the world for this purpose. During his career, Harris served on the board of the Lithographic Technical Foundation. Patents While at Harris-Seybold, Harris originated two significant patented inventions. In 1941, he filed a patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for \\"Perfecting printing press\\". As of 2014, 15 patents about printing machines (filed between 1945 and 1990) reference his invention. In 1937, Harris and Charles W. Harrold jointly filed a patent for \\"Inker throw-off\\". Sixteen patents about ink use in printing (filed between 1945 and 1984) reference this invention as of 2014. Harris also filed a patent in 1945 for \\"Sheet-fed offset perfecting press\\".

The estate was located on a hill between the Ossining and Scarborough train stations. The estate's name means \\"Forest Home\\" and its lands occupied a large tract of the property between Scarborough Road and Albany Post Road. Today, the estate's red-brick wall is still visible on the borders of Scarborough and Holbrook roads going as far south as where the entrance is to Philips Laboratories. By 1901, the Waldheim estate covered approximately 100 acres that held large meadows, a small lake, orchards, gardens of vegetables and flowers, and portions of woods that were left undisturbed. The decorative elements of the gardens of the house were not very elaborate by 1901, consisting only of a hedge that encircled the garden on the west side of the house that faced the Hudson, which had as a centerpiece a beautiful fountain of bronze which was in a basin cut from a single piece of red marble. Estate structures The structures on the estate by 1901 consisted of a lodge made of white stone near where the red-brick wall was broken by the main gateway. The only other outbuildings of the estate as of 1901 was the stable to the north of the manor house, and a nearby tall windmill. Waldheim itself was large with a wide veranda on three sides, high windows and several gables, all of which looked out over the meadows and gardens of the estate. The house was built in wood and stucco, and it looked as if it was made more for comfort than for elaborate display. Everything about this house and grounds, from its fences, stables, winding paths, roads, and grounds showed perfect maintenance. Waldheim manor When compared to other local wealthy landowners in the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough area, James Speyer conducted Waldheim in a more \\"aristocratic European manner\\". One example of this is that he had a footman positioned behind every chair of each of his guests at his dinner table. Despite the absence of both display and decoration, which suggested a house of \\"severe simplicity,\\" the house was still apparently \\"luxuriously furnished, and every apartment is decorated in perfect taste.\\" As far as the rooms of the house were concerned, the entrance hall of the house was the main apartment, which was completed with lounges, fireplace, easy chairs, and comfortable corners, which implied perhaps that James Speyer combined the functions of the old-fashioned sitting room and drawing room. Located to the right of the front hallway was the library, which had a view over the lawn, and was furnished in olive green; and its books on its shelves appeared worn as of 1901, and this room ultimate lacked the \\"severe order\\" which was apparent in most libraries for show of this time. Adjoining the library was the dining room, which was furnished in the Colonial style, complete with a frieze of tapestry, which formed a relief to the overall light tone in the room: the whole effect of this room was noted as \\"artistic and simple.\\" References External links * Olmsted Brothers images Category:Briarcliff Manor, New York Category:Houses in Westchester County, New York ","title":"Waldheim (Scarborough)"},{"id":"43646550","text":"Stanley Thomas Williams (25 October 1888 - 5 February 1956) was a scholar who helped to establish the study of American literature as an academic field during his teaching career at Yale University. In 1935 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. His most notable publication is a two-volume biography of Washington Irving but he is best remembered for changing the study of Herman Melville by strategically directing doctoral dissertations on his life and works. Career Williams was born in Meriden, Connecticut and studied at Yale (B.A 1911, Ph.D 1915). In 1915 he started to lecture at Yale, served as a second lieutenant in the Army Signal Corps, in 1932 became a Full Professor, from 1934 Colgate Professor, and in 1944 Sterling Professor. Williams followed William Lyon Phelps, who held the only academic chair in existence for the field. He was Chair of his department in 1939-1945. Publishing initially on English literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth-century, from the mid-1920s on he concentrated on American literature, which was handled as a young branch of English literature. His interest initially was in Nathaniel Hawthorne and Washington Irving, but in the late 1930s he turned his attention to Melville, though publishing only incidental works himself.Kermit Vanderbilt: American Literature and the Academy. University of Pennsylvania Press: Philadelphia 1986, p.446-48. Williams used his influential position at Yale in developing the study of American literature as a field.

Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature (2001) is a book by Harvard astrophysicist Eric Chaisson. It examines cosmic evolution which includes the history of natural evolution from the Big Bang to the present from the perspective of the emerging multi-scientific discipline of Big History. It offers an explanation of why simple structures billions of years ago gave way to more complex structures, such as stars, planets, life, and human beings in complex civilizations.

Overview Chaisson argues that cosmic history can be examined from the perspective of energy flows. He analyzes the flows of energy through various objects, and argues that these flows are relevant to understanding the relative complexity of these objects. He suggests that a key measure for scientific analysis should be energy per second per gram, termed \\"energy rate density,\\" and that analysis using this yardstick can be used to explain not only human evolution but cosmic evolution. He sees energy as \\"work per unit time\\" which he equates with power, and shows how energy rate density in some structures has increased over time.

According to his view, organisms do much the same thing with energy but in a more complex way, by taking in food instead of electrons, to keep themselves from disintegrating and becoming less complex; he analyzes energy flows in not just organisms and society, but in inanimate structures such as stars, galaxies, planets. Chaisson notes that increases in complexity are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics; according to one reviewer, the second law might suggest that complexity should decrease with the universe \\"slouching toward disorder.\\" Daniel W.

Energy rate density is a fine candidate for a third.\\" However, Chaisson argues that complexity can increase because complex structures such as a star can \\"generate and sustain complexity by exporting enough disorder to its surrounding environment to more than make up for its internal gains.\\" From this perspective, Chaisson offers a definition of life as an \\"open, coherent, space-time structure maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by a flow of energy through it.\\" Reactions to Chaisson's book are generally positive, although different reviewers took issue with some of his points and writing style. Biologist Daniel W. McShea originally noted that Chaisson is \\"prone to using inflated language,\\" but a decade later in another review of his work notes that \\"Chaisson offers data showing a trend in what he calls energy rate density ... over the history of life (and even over the much longer history of the universe), that's really saying something.\\" Critic Stewart Kauffman found the book to be a \\"wonderful discussion.\\" Critic Hillel Braude wrote \\"Cosmic Evolution draws from a rich scientific palette to paint a colorful explanatory model of the ascending complexity in nature.\\" Critic Charles Seife wrote highly about Chaisson's book although he criticized Chaisson's definition of life as being \\"such a broad definition\\" that it becomes meaningless, while acknowledging that Chaisson's analysis \\"gives the theory some numerical muscle.\\" Many more excerpts from reviews of this book are collected here . Choice of units Chaisson chose to use the obsolete cgs (centimetre, gram, second) system of measurement, rather than SI units as is standard current practice, for his calculations and numerical estimates - thus quoting energy in ergs (one ten millionth of a Joule), also using calories, and sometimes kilocalories as alternative measures of energy.

The barracks was originally known as Dundalk Barracks and was renamed after Frank Aiken, a commander of the Irish Republican Army and an Irish politician. It is the current Headquarters of the 27 Infantry Battalion of the Irish Army. Aiken Barracks Signage  History  = British Army = The barracks was established following the Irish Rebellion in 1798 on the site of a disused linen mill located on Parliament Square. The oldest building dates back to 1810. Arthur Samuel Richardson, a British Army surgeon, died in 1816 aged 38 from a wound he received in the Officers' Mess in Dundalk Barracks. His fatal wound was the result of a duel he had with a fellow officer who, allegedly, made a disparaging remark about a young woman of Richardson's acquaintance. Richardson's remains were buried in St. Nicholas Green Church graveyard in Dundalk. He had the grim distinction of being the last man to die as a result of a duel in Ireland. Reports suggest that the incident was more of a barrack-room brawl that a formal duel but his ghost reputedly haunted the Mess afterwards. The British occupied the barracks until 13 April 1922. = Irish Civil War = In April 1922 the 4th Northern Division commanded by Frank Aiken occupied Dundalk barracks as the British forces evacuated Free State territory under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Irish Civil War began in June 1922 and on 16 July 1922 the pro- treaty 5th Northern Division led by Dan Hogan occupied Dundalk taking Aiken and his men prisoner. Just eleven days later on 27 July, some of Aiken‚Äôs IRA command under Padraig Quinn blew a hole in the wall of Dundalk prison and in fifteen minutes the operation resulted in the freeing of Republican prisoners, including Aiken himself. Aiken now prepared to free the remaining republican prisoners held in Dundalk barracks. Aiken‚Äôs troops were armed with small arms and explosives because they had been supplied up until a month before by the very Army they were now going to attack. Aiken organised boats to ferry his 300 strong force across the Castletown river into Dundalk and equipped two storming parties of ten men with submachine guns and explosives. The attack commenced at 4:00 am on 14 August. Though several mines failed to explode, one did blast in the back gate. The surviving sentries were machine-gunned and the walls breached. After the back gate was destroyed by the explosion Frank Aiken and about nine men rushed the breach and got through. A heavy fire was soon directed on to the attacking troops from some of the barrack rooms. However, the attackers got the upper hand as prisoners were captured. Bags of about 8 to 10 lbs of explosives were thrown into the windows of the ground floors of the barrack rooms. When those exploded the inmates generally surrendered. The attack had been successful and 400 rifles and a large volume of ammunition was captured. Over 300 republican prisoners had been freed from the barracks and prison in Dundalk. However, Patrick McKenna, a member of Aiken‚Äôs Division, had captured a Lancia armoured car from pro-Treaty troops elsewhere in Dundalk. When he drove it through the main gate of the barracks after the fighting had ended, his comrades, mistaking it for a Free State counter-attack, detonated a mine, killing McKenna and another man Rogers. Five pro-Treaty soldiers were dead or dying and 15 injured. Two Republicans were killed, both by their own mine, and up to 30 wounded in the fighting. Reportedly one civilian also died. Dan Hogan travelled from Dublin to Dundalk with a heavily armed column (including artillery and armoured vehicles) and retook Dundalk without resistance - shooting only an unfortunate civilian who failed to stop at a roadblock. = Post Civil War = The barracks was occupied by the Army until 1928 when part of the barracks was leased to Rawson's Footwear until 1967 when the factory closed down. In 1934 the Volunteer Force was established with the Regiment of Oriel being based in Dundalk barracks. During The Emergency (1939-1945) 3 & 4 Cyclist Squadrons were based in Dundalk Barracks. = The Troubles = Observation Tower at Aiken Barracks In 1957, at the time of the IRA Border Campaign, the Army briefly based troops in Dundalk Barracks.An Cosant√≥ir From the late 1960s, during The Troubles, the Irish Government sent soldiers to the border area. Initially, the company-sized 1 Infantry Group was formed in Dundalk Barracks to operate along the border, however as the Troubles escalated, it was decided to establish an infantry battalion as a permanent replacement for the border infantry group. In September 1973, the 27 Infantry Battalion was established. From its activation the 27 Infantry Battalion's Headquarters, Headquarters Company and A Company have been based in Dundalk. = 21st century = In January 2009, B and Support Companies moved to Aiken Barracks when Monaghan Military Barracks closed. B Company has since 2012 been based in Gormanston Camp, County Meath. The 27 Infantry Battalion celebrated 40 years since its establishment with a parade in Dundalk town on 31 August 2013.  Incidents  A female soldier referred to as an Irish Army Poster Girl made an allegation of being sexually assaulted by another soldier whilst based at Aiken Barracks. Second Lieutenant Collette McBarron, a former Miss Ireland contestant, made the allegation against a fellow serving soldier which resulted in a full investigation by Irish Military Police. Following extensive enquiries, however, charges were dismissed as a result of lack of evidence. In the early hours of Monday 27 May 2013, an oil tanker containing illegal fuel which had been seized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners was stolen from Aiken Barracks and driven away. The tanker was one of a number of vehicles which had been part of a seizure at an illegal oil laundering plant in Drumacon, County Monaghan and was subsequently stored at Aiken Barracks. Thieves breached the security of the base and made off in the lorry, which contained 20,000 litres of fuel valued at ‚Ç¨30,000, and which was then driven at high speed through the main gates of the Barracks (which were locked at the time). Soldiers who were on duty at the barracks entrance were taken by surprise and the main gates sustained substantial damage as a result of the incident.

One of the largest examples of wall art in Britain, it was commissioned by the London Borough of Sutton to celebrate the borough's heritage. Location The mural is on the side of a three-storey building on the corner of High Street and St Nicholas Road at Trinity Square (the main town square). Description The Sutton Heritage Mosaic Trinity Square and the mosaic Sutton High St and the mosaic Measuring high by wide, the mural depicts various aspects of Sutton's heritage and local history in nineteen black and white panels. The centrepiece is Henry VIII's Nonsuch Palace in Nonsuch Park. Surrounding this are shown the heraldic beasts of the coats of arms of the historic local families of Carew, Gaynesford and Lumley. The mural also features local heritage buildings such as Honeywood House and All Saints Church in Carshalton Village; and the Old Cottage and Whitehall in Cheam Village. Old industries are also covered, represented by the inclusion of a River Wandle mill. The early railway line, which was routed alongside the river is illustrated, as is a Hannibal biplane, which used the former Croydon Airport. Design and construction The mural was designed by public artist Rob Turner, and created by him with fellow artist Gary Drostle. The artists had presented the borough's Public Arts Committee with six designs, and the Committee chose one, depicting local history in nineteen panels. Appledown Properties Ltd provided the financing. The mosaic was created from vitreous ceramic tesserae and put in place in 1994. It was initially created in a studio, using the reverse technique, whereby a full-size outline was drawn on paper in reverse. The tiles were then affixed to the paper with flour-and-water glue. At the end of the process, the paper and glue were washed off with water and the mosaic was grouted and polished. Consisting of well over 100,000 pieces, the mosaic took over 1,500 hours to design and construct. 2011 information plaque A plaque describing the panels was installed in 2011, and unveiled by Councillor Graham Tope, Executive Member for Community Safety, Leisure and Libraries, who said: See also * Sutton twin towns mural * Sutton armillary * The Messenger (sculpture in Sutton) References Category:1994 works Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Sutton Category:Murals in London Category:Sutton, London ","title":"Sutton Heritage Mosaic"},{"id":"43646841","text":"Paul Eugene Jappe (January 16, 1898 - April 1, 1989) was an American football player who played four seasons in the National Football League with the New York Giants and Brooklyn Lions.

Notable works include : *\\"Numbered Minutes\\" a short film, shot at the Palais Garnier, that he choreographed, danced, directed, and edited *\\"me2\\" (2006) text by raymond federman, music by the Misters, premiered 3e √©tage's founding performance in Vieux-Boucau in 2006 *\\"√âphiph√©nom√®nes\\" (2006) music by the Misters, premiered at 3e √©tage's founding performance in Vieux-Boucau in 2006 *\\"Quatre\\" (2006) music by Johannes Brahms after Niccolo Paganini, commissioned by Emmanuel Thibault, premiered in Bogot√°, Colombia, August 2006 *\\"Processes of Intricacy\\" (2011) No music, premiered in St Malo, France *\\"D√©sordres\\" (\\"Disorders\\") (2011) a full-length evening conceived by Murez as a series of interwoven scenes tied together by recurring themes, motifs, and characters, exploring the tension between formal order and the creative chaos. Scenes include \\"La Valse Infernale\\", \\"Chaconne\\", \\"Epiph√©nom√®nes\\", \\"me2\\", \\"Processes of intricacy\\", \\"Quatre\\", \\"me9\\", as well as a two scenes by other choreographers *\\"Premier Cauchemar\\" (\\"First nightmare\\") Prologue of the full-length narrative work \\"Le R√™veur\\" (The Dreamer), to an original score by Siegfried de Turckheim. *\\"D√©r√®glements\\" (\\"le Pillow Thirteen\\") (2013) Murez' first full- length program of his own work, a followup to \\"D√©sordres\\", it reprised some of the scenes and characters from D√©sordres, as well as new material, including \\"La Danse des Livres\\", \\"M√©phisto\\", \\"Thirst\\", and \\"D√©sordres (final)\\", Janine Parker His work as a choreographer has been performed at the Opera Bastille amphitheater in 2006,, G√©rard Mannoni 2011, and 2013, at the Festival des Arts de St Sauveur, Canada, in 2011, at international festival Jardins del Cap Roig in 2009,, Valeria Gaillard Sagunto en Escena in 2008,, artzeblai and at the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires in 2012., Patricia Casa√±as  Film-making  Murez directed and edited the short film of his choreography Numbered Minutes (2005). He wrote, shot, directed, and edited a 52-minute documentary about Korean Principal dancer Yong-Geol Kim, entitled Step by Step. This film was shown as part of a series of performances called which were nominated by the Korean press for best dance show of the year. He choreographed and danced in the film Contresens, directed by Pierre-Alfred Richard, and produced by France 3 and Onyx films. He choreographed the video for Interlude, a perfume by Amouage.  Music  Murez studied piano and solf√®ge for 10 years. He composed the scores to some of the scenes in \\"D√©r√®glements\\" (2013). These include the \\"Prelude\\" that plays during the \\"smoke-smoke\\" scene, and the humorous \\"Ray-Ban\\" march from \\"D√©sordres (final)\\". He also created and mixed the mashups used for the other scenes in \\"D√©sordres (final)\\". He has stated that collaborating with other composers on their scores to his work is one of his favorite creative activities.  Production  As artistic director of 3e √©tage, Murez also produces shows that are artistically directed by other artists, using the resources and producing experience of the company to help other choreographers and directors realize their vision. Under the 3e √©tage banner, he has produced: *Carte Blanche √† Agn√®s Letestu (2009) directed by Agn√®s Letestu, G√©rard Mannoni  Dance  Murez studied at the Paris Opera Ballet School from 1996 to 2001.

An adjoining field, called 'Butt's Close', were the remains of the archery butts, mounds of earth used for target practice.

Conceptualized originally by Richard Christie and Florence Geis, Machiavellianism refers to a psychological trait concept where individuals behave in a cold and duplicitous manner. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. Oliver James wrote on the effects of Machiavellianism and other dark triad personality traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and psychopathy.James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013) A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:Kessler, SR; Bandeiii, AC; Spector, PE; Borman, WC; Nelson, CE; and Penney, LM 2010. Reexamining Machiavelli: A three dimensional model of Machiavellianism in the workplace. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 40, 1868‚Äì1896 * maintaining power * harsh management tactics * manipulative behaviors. High Machs can exhibit high levels of charisma, and their leadership can be beneficial in some areas. The presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with counterproductive workplace behaviour and workplace deviance. Job interviews Individuals who are high in Machiavellianism may be more willing and more skilled at lying and less likely to give honest answers during interviews.Fletch, 1990Levashina, J., & Campion, M. A. (2006). A model of faking likelihood in the employment interview. International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 14(4), 299-316.Roulin, N., & Bourdage, J. S. (2017). Once an Impression Manager, Always an Impression Manager? Antecedents of Honest and Deceptive Impression Management Use and Variability across Multiple Job Interviews. Frontiers in Psychology, 8. Individuals high in Machiavellianism have stronger intentions to use deception in interviews compared to psychopaths or narcissists and are also more likely to see the use of lying in interviews as fair.Lopes, J., & Fletcher, C. (2004). Fairness of impression management in employment interviews: A cross-country study of the role of equity and Machiavellianism. Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal, 32(8), 747-768Roulin, N., & Krings, F. (2016). When Winning is Everything: The Relationship between Competitive Worldviews and Job Applicant Faking. Applied Psychology, 65(4), 643-670. Men and women high in Machiavellianism may use different tactics to influence interviewers. In one study, which examined how much applicants allowed the interviewers to direct the topics covered during the interview, women high in Machiavellianism tended to allow interviewers more freedom to direct the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism gave interviewers the least amount of freedom in directing the content of the interview.Weinstein, E. A., Beckhouse, L. S., Blumstein, P. W., & Stein, R. B. (1968). Interpersonal strategies under conditions of gain or loss1. Journal of Personality, 36(4), 616-634. Men high in Machiavellianism were also more likely to make up information about themselves or their experiences during job interviews.Hogue, M., Levashina, J., & Hang, H. (2013). Will I fake it? The interplay of gender, Machiavellianism, and self-monitoring on strategies for honesty in job interviews. Journal of Business Ethics, 117(2), 399-411. Workplace bullying overlap According to Gary Namie, High Machs manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas and to maintain dominance over others.Namie, G. (2006). Why Bullies Bully? A Complete Explanation. The following are the guiding beliefs of those high on Machiavellianism:Greenberg J, Baron RA Behavior in Organizations: Understanding and Managing the Human Side of Work (2003) * Never show humility * Arrogance is far more effective when dealing with others. * Morality and ethics are for the weak: Powerful people feel free to lie, cheat and deceive others when it suits them. * It is much better to be feared than loved. High Machiavellians may be expected to do the following: * Neglect to share important information. * Find subtle ways of making another person look bad to management. * Fail to meet their obligations. * Spread false rumors about another person. In studies there was a positive correlation between Machiavellianism and workplace bullying. Machiavellianism predicted involvement in bullying others. The groups of bullies and bully-victims had a higher Machiavellianism level compared to the groups of victims and persons non-involved in bullying. The results showed that being bullied was negatively related to the perceptions of clan and adhocracy cultures and positively related to the perceptions of hierarchy culture.Irena Pilch, El≈ºbieta Turska Journal of Business Ethics February 2014 Relationships Between Machiavellianism, Organizational Culture, and Workplace Bullying: Emotional Abuse from the Target‚Äôs and the Perpetrator‚Äôs Perspective In research, Machiavellianism was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision (an overlapping concept with workplace bullying).Kohyar Kiazada, Simon Lloyd D.

Early days Branko Ru≈æiƒá was born in Slavonski Brod to Katarina (born Bla≈æekoviƒá) and Antun Ru≈æiƒá, as the youngest of four children. When he was six years old his parents moved him to Vinkovci where he started school. Ru≈æiƒá showed a passion and skill for drawing from an early age and by the time he was in secondary school, he was already recognized by his art teacher who used to take him, along with his more advanced colleagues (one of them was painter Slavko Kopaƒç), to paint in the open air. After secondary school, Ru≈æiƒá has attended a few universities before he eventually entered the Academy of Fine Arts to study sculpture in 1940. He graduated under Ivo Lozica and Frano Kr≈°iniƒá in 1944. Although he already had a degree in sculpture he began a four‚Äìyear painting course in professor Marino Tartaglia's class. He acquired a degree in painting in 1948 and soon after began to exhibit his works. In 1951 Ru≈æiƒá mounted his first solo exhibition of paintings in Vinkovci City Museum. In the next couple of years he successfully participated in numerous exhibitions (including in Lyon and Bern), but soon found painting to be less and less fulfilling. Eventually Ru≈æiƒá completely abandoned painting so he could dedicate himself to sculpting, although he returned to painting later in his career. In 1956 he sculpted the head \\"Father\\", which he considered his first piece of sculpture. In 1959 he held his first solo exhibition of sculptures at the ULUH (Society of Croatian Artists) salon in Zagreb. Work, career and awards Branko Ru≈æiƒá, \\"Memorial to people of Zagreb who fell 1941-1945\\", Dotr≈°ƒáina, Zagreb, Croatia, 1981 Ru≈æiƒá was known for his famous statement ‚ÄûEverything is a sculpture‚Äú. He made his sculptures in various techniques including wood, bronze, plaster of Paris, copper plate, terracotta, stone and paper. With his condensed forms, suggestive profiling and architectural volumes in which he overcomes the general over the individual he joined the trend of renewal in Croatian sculpture in the 1950s. The motifs of Ru≈æiƒá's sculptures are varied: figures, portraits, sequences, groups, motifs from nature. His works are characterized by simplicity and monumentality, and sometimes by specific deformations that carry a strain of humor and irony. In his career Ru≈æiƒá held more than one hundred solo and two hundred collective exhibitions in Croatia and abroad. He won many recognitions and awards such as Rovinj Municipality Award (1967, 1972), City of Zagreb Award (1968), Vladimir Nazor Annual Award (1973), First prize at the Concorso Archettilegnani, Madonna di Campiglio (1988), Grand Prix at the 3rd Triennale of Croatian Sculpture, Zagreb (1988), Grand Prix Grisie, Rovinj (1989) and Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement (1985). In 1964 Ru≈æiƒá exhibited his sculpture at the 32nd. Venice Biennale where an international jury awarded his work with the prize for sculpture from the \\"David Bright Foundation\\", which makes him the only Croat ever to win a prize at the Venice Biennale. His works are exhibited at many galleries and museums but most of his opus stayed within his family and the Ru≈æiƒá gallery in Slavonski Brod. Ru≈æiƒá also wrote about his views and experience in working with children in the book ‚ÄûChildren drawing‚Äú (1958). From 1961 to 1985 he was professor in sculpture at Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb. The Ru≈æiƒá gallery In 1993 the authorities of the city of Slavonski Brod and Branko Ru≈æiƒá (and his wife Julia) signed an agreement concerning donation of 410 works and archives of the artist. Also, on Ru≈æiƒá‚Äôs call, more than a hundred renowned Croatian painters and sculptors gave of their works for this collection, which makes it the first permanent exhibition of the Croatian modern art of the second half of the 20th century.

Victor Pisapia  Victor is the founder of VictorsFood. His Italian background and European travels have influenced in his passion and knowledge of food. Victor started teaching cooking classes in an area just outside Philadelphia as soon as he left university. He opened his first business, called the Back Porch Caf√©, in 1976 in the town of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware United States. After a year in the business, Victor went on to study at the New School for Social Research in New York City, where he studied Culinary Arts and Restaurant Business. With his training behind him, Victor opened a small empire of restaurants in his home state of Delaware in the USA and was later named in ‚ÄòDelaware Today magazine‚Äô as one of the ‚Äú50 most influential people in the last 50 years‚Äù. In 1994, Victor moved to Australia and opened the award winning ‚ÄòRattlesnake Grill‚Äô. Since then, Victor has appeared on numerous television and radio programs, written multiple articles, published many recipes in publications and websites such as SBS and 9 news. He has also given numerous interviews and presentations. In 2002, Victor and Wanitha Tanasingam formed a team building company, called the Cheeky Food Group. The aim was to bring team cooking to the corporate market. Cheeky Food Group was written about in all the top business publications around Australia, and its brand is still very strong in the market today. However, Victor seized an opportunity to sell this business before the economic downturn. Victor later went on to create VictorsFood in 2007, which now focuses on creating interactive food experiences and sustainable practices.  Awards  VictorsFood has won and been nominated for a number of awards, including: *Nominated for Best Achievement in Catering in 2013 by Australian Event Awards for their work on Property Council of Australia Property Congress 2012 *Voted Best Team Building Suppliers in 2014 by Spice Magazine *Voted Best Team Building Suppliers in 2013 by Spice Magazine *Voted Best Team Building Suppliers in 2012 by Spice Magazine *Voted Best Team Building Suppliers in 2011 by Spice Magazine  Environment and Sustainability  VictorsFood encourages the use of sustainable practices in everyday lives by supporting food miles and local food producers.

The Devil's Carnivalhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt3892618/?ref_=nv_sr_2 (stylized onscreen as The Devil's Carnival: Alleluia!) is a 2015 American musical fantasy horror film directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Terrance Zdunich. It is a direct sequel to Bousman's 2012 short film The Devil's Carnival, but unlike the previous film, Alleluia is a feature-length project. Production commenced in August 2014 and the film was released on August 11, 2015 by Cleopatra Films. Plot Lucifer conducts a train full of condemned souls, including Ms. Merrywood, back up to Heaven. As the train approaches Heaven‚Äôs gates, Ms. Merrywood discovers a horseshoe pendant and the condemned souls begin singing hymns (‚Äò‚ÄôShovel and Bone‚Äô‚Äô). In Heaven, God discusses the crisis with his top dog, The Agent. The Agent and The Translators, officers in Heaven‚Äôs police force, interrogate Merrywood about her presence and the pendant. In Hell, the Ticket-Keeper warns Lucifer that the carnies are not prepared for a war with Heaven, but Lucifer dismisses him to entertain a cloaked figure. Lucifer opens his book of Aesop‚Äôs Fables and reads ‚ÄúThe Filly and The Lapdog‚Äù to the cloaked person. In flashback, a new crop of Applicants arrive in Heaven, including best friends June and Cora. They are welcomed into Heaven and are offered a tour of the premises (‚Äò‚ÄôAll Aboard (Everybody‚Äôs Doing The Ark‚Äô‚Äô). June defies The Librarian about banned books in Heaven and steals a Number 1 armband from The Designer, who keeps the Number 7s working in a windowless design shop, that starkly contrasts with the grandeur of the Heaven lobby (‚Äò‚ÄôOnly By Design‚Äô‚Äô). June‚Äôs rebellious nature makes her and the reserved Cora wander around Heaven, only to be arrested and interrogated by The Translators (‚Äò‚ÄôGood Little Dictation Machines‚Äô‚Äô). The Agent intervenes, and there is a mutual attraction between him and June, which gets him negative press from The Watchword. When God becomes aware of this, he orders The Agent to seduce June to expose her heresy. The Agent brings June to a bar, Club Cloud Seven, where his closeness with God leads him to be invited to sing (‚Äò‚ÄôDown at the Midnight Rectory‚Äô‚Äô). God arrives and serenades one of his girlfriends (‚Äò‚ÄôCloud Serenade‚Äô‚Äô). The Agent and June‚Äôs relationship continues, always under the watchful eye of The Watchword (‚Äò‚ÄôThe Watchword‚Äôs Hour‚Äô‚Äô). The Watchword confronts Cora, warning her that her lesbian attraction to June is forbidden and illegal in Heaven. The Agent gives June the horseshoe pendant Merrywood will find, telling her the story of Dunstan (needs clarification for relevance), which reignites her curiosity with banned material and she runs off to steal a restricted book. Confident that The Agent‚Äôs clout will protect her, she steals a book marked with an apple, suggesting it is the forbidden Book of the Knowledge of Life and Death, setting off an alarm. June is beaten by The Translators and tossed down an elevator shaft leading to Hell. Meanwhile, The Librarian instructs Cora and the other Applicants to denounce June, and spend the rest of the night restoring order by re-shelving Heaven's library with him (‚Äò‚ÄôHitting on All Sevens‚Äô‚Äô). The Librarian tells Cora she will go far in Heaven. June arrives at a weaker, smaller Carnival, with a younger Lucifer and Ticket-Keeper. She flees from The Fool and finds The Twin and asks him for a drink. The Twin obliges as long as she plays a shell game for her pendant. As the game goes on, The Twin shapeshifts into Cora, The Agent, and finally, June herself (‚Äò‚ÄôFair Game‚Äô‚Äô). Upon losing, June wanders into the midway and finds Lucifer, who becomes inspired by her to turn the Carnival into something that can challenge Heaven. He helps her transform into The Painted Doll (\\"After the Fall\\"). In the present, Ticket-Keeper rebuffs several plans to attack Heaven from the carnies. The cloaked figure is revealed to be Painted Doll, who will play a role in Lucifer‚Äôs war with Heaven. Ticket-Keeper confronts Lucifer about his worries with the Carnival, offering to sacrifice himself for the cause. Lucifer first mocks and then refuses Ticket-Keeper's offer of martyrdom, and these two show a level of loyalty that seems to be an ironic take on the kind of loyalty God demands but does not return. Lucifer and Ticket-Keeper then examine the plans for Hell's War on Heaven. Meanwhile, in Heaven, God dispatches The Agent to face Lucifer and quell the uprising in Hell, giving him a book containing the story ‚ÄúThe Filly and the Lapdog\\". Lucifer has referred to Painted Doll as \\"filly\\" and The Agent as \\"lapdog\\" throughout the movie and the story describes the relationship between the Agent, June, and the \\"owner\\" of these animals, God. The song \\"Hitting On All Sevens\\" also refers to the seven levels of angels as seven different kind of animals. God puts on a show for the denizens of Heaven, mocking Lucifer in a parable drawn from the Dust Bowl and Aesop‚Äôs Fable ‚ÄúThe Swallow and the Other Birds‚Äù (‚Äò‚ÄôBells of the Black Sunday‚Äô‚Äô). Meanwhile, The Agent arrives in Hell and finds Painted Doll. She leads him on to give the carnies time to capture and poison him. Lucifer prepares for battle by applying war makeup. God stands in front of a microphone in an empty room, as his servants arm themselves for war. In Heaven, Merrywood, beaten and haggard, transforms, revealing that it has been The Twin all along. The Twin then poses as the Agent returning from his mission (‚Äò‚ÄôHoof and Lap/The Devil‚Äôs Carnival‚Äô‚Äô). In a post-credits sequence, The Twin as The Agent serenades God (‚Äò‚ÄôSongs of Old‚Äô‚Äô), leaving the future uncertain.

New cast members include Barry Bostwick, Ted Neeley, Adam Pascal, Tech N9ne, Jimmy Urine, Chantal Claret, and David Hasselhoff. Whereas The Devil's Carnival took place in Hell, Alleluia focuses on Heaven. In describing it, writer Zdunich stated that \\"Heaven in particular is a very different aesthetic than hell...think Golden Age of Hollywood. You have fancy suits and everything is tailored, an air that everything is perfect and glamorous, but meanwhile in the backdrop of that era you also have the Great Depression.\\" Zdunich went on to say that the style would be \\"Clark Gable on acid.\\" Bousman described the film as \\"[pulling] back the curtain on Heaven... and in 'The Devil's Carnival,' God and his angels are a whole lot darker than Lucifer and his carnies.\\" =Filming= A fifteen-day shoot was planned, but due to financial constraints this was reduced to fourteen days, concluding on September 2, 2014. Release The official teaser trailer for Alleluia! came out on November 6, 2014, with the film due for a Summer 2015 release. As with its predecessor, Alleluia! was screened via a 'Road Tour' across the US.

It consisted of a shelf of books on the second floor of District Schoolhouse Number 2. A portion of the books in the original collection came from Ralph Waldo Emerson's private library. Ruth Tomkins' sister Susan had married John Emerson, nephew of Ralph Waldo Emerson and through them Ralph Waldo Emerson, or \\"Uncle Waldo\\", became one of the library's first patrons. The reasons for the move are unclear, but in the early 1880s the Library moved to a converted chicken coop across the street from the schoolhouse. It remained at the refurbished chicken coop for 14 years. In 1896, the Library outgrew the chicken coop and moved into a former cobbler's shop. The cobbler's shop location later became the Elephant's Trunk Thrift Shop, which was run by Friends of the Somers Library to provide money for the Library's operation. In 1963, the Library outgrew the cobbler's shop and moved across the street to the former cobbler's house, which was refurbished for the Library's use.

The Rand Water Board Building extension to the Fraser Street offices was the third in a series of buildings owned and occupied by the Rand Water Board (RWB) of Johannesburg before the relocation to large purpose built modern premises in Rietvlie. For clarity, this entry details the history and development of each successive building in chronological order. Please note that the original Rand Water Board Building of 1925 has been demolished. Building 1: The original Rand Water Board Building, Commissioner Street Since its establishment in 1903, Rand Water Board had always made use of rented accommodation. The first meetings of the board were in fact held at the Rand Hotel.The substance of ubiquity, Rand Water 1903-2003, Johann W.N. Tempelhoff, Kleio Publishers, Vanderbijlpark, 2003, 127.

The Rand Water Board Building was a Neo-Classical building on Commissioner Street designed by the firm of Gordon Leith & Partners in 1925 and built by Messrs Harper Bros. The consulting architect of the project was G.E.G. Leith (1886-1965), a South African-born, but British- trained architect who had worked under Herbert Baker when the Union Buildings were designed at the turn of the century.The substance of ubiquity, Rand Water 1903-2003, Johann W.N.

The new building's design was in the Beaux Arts tradition and it reminded one of the station building in Pretoria ‚Äì also a Herbert Baker design.The substance of ubiquity, Rand Water 1903-2003, Johann W.N.

In 1926, the ~8150sqft building was altered by the architects to enhance the facilities for the Rand Water Board. However, by the mid-1930s, it was clear the Board had insufficient office space in the building. It was proposed, at the time, to add an additional floor to the existing building but this idea was soon dismissed in favour of purchasing a suitable site elsewhere in the city for the erection of a new building that would meet the RWB's current and future office accommodation requirements. The organization, in the interim, had to rent additional office space.Water- Rand Water Board Newsletter, 1975 and Water- Rand Water Board Newsletter, 1976 New Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd submitted an offer of ¬£75,000 for the original RWB Building in 1939, which was accepted by RWB. This injection of capital allowed the RWB to commence their plans for a new four storey office building on Fraser Street. Building 2: The Rand Water Board Building, 3 Fraser Street The chosen site on Fraser Street was at stands 222 and 227, which were formerly the Primrose Buildings. Following negotiations with the owners, RWB successfully bought and demolished the Primrose Buildings to make way for the new offices in 1939 and building work commenced in 1940. The building work was tendered and the winning tender was that of John Barrow (Pty) Ltd for the sum of ¬£103, 328 0s 0d.Minutes of RWB Board Meeting 28 Jan 1944 (RWB). The construction was delayed by war-time restrictions on shipping of materials and took two years to complete, and cost ¬£166,785 5s 10d ‚Äì around ¬£26,000 more than originally estimated.GPG Precinct Project, Final Heritage Impact Assessment Report, 2004. 53 This new building had 20,200sqft, more than double the size of the original Rand Water Building. Despite this significant increase in office capacity, by 1962 the RWB were again facing office shortages and overcrowding. Again, the Board considered adding additional floors but it was decided this would not fulfill longer-term space requirements. It was consequently decided to investigate the possibility of extending the existing building by purchasing an adjoining site on which a building, linked to the existing building, could be constructed.GPG Precinct Project, Final Heritage Impact Assessment Report, 2004. 54 The RWB bought the New Library Hotel site from The Johannesburg Balmoral Hotel (Pty) Ltd for R195,000. Building 3: Extension to the Fraser Street Rand Water Board Building ‚Äì Custom House The new extension building was erected on stand 4508 in high quality materials ‚Äì including black granite, marble, hardwood windows, bronze grilles, brown brick ‚Äì and had its own vehicular access to the basement. The facade of seven bays with a rusticated base, was articulated by decorative key stones to the ground floor. The architects employed specially moulded bricks and deep stone surrounds to add shadow lines and visual interest to the facade. The building has six storeys (including the ground floor) and a basement. In 1956, the store on the third floor was converted to office space by C P Robinson, Chief Engineer RWB. In 1964, the RWB removed the accommodation (workers dormitory, dining hall and caretaker's flat) on the fourth floor to create more offices. This alteration was undertaken by Fassler and Howie.GPG Precinct Project, Final Heritage Impact Assessment Report, 2004. 57 At the completion of the alterations and additions to the building, the fourth floor consisted of a cafeteria, kitchen stores and dining room for cleaning staff. The offices of the Superintendent, Buyer and Controller were allocated on the fifth floor as well as those of the Trades Accounts Departments. Due to a growing number of employees and responsibilities there was a lack of office space and a decision was taken in 1965 by the Rand Water Board to extend it. It was originally a 5-storey building with a single basement. In February 1965 an additional floor to the existing Head Office building was approved. This was done by the architects J. Fassler & W. D. Howie. In 1978, R J Laburn undertook alterations to the staircase basement and first floor and in 1980, alterations were made to the entrance hall. Continued lack of space led the board to take another decision in 1983 to construct a pedestrian bridge to link the neighbouring Sanlam Building to the Rand Water Board Building. This was because various heads of its Head Offices were accommodated in the Sanlam Building (stand 4779) at the time. Later Years ‚Äì Relocation to Rietvlei The RWB had undertaken as many extensions and improvements as were practicable to the Fraser Street building and its Extension building, and having exhausted all avenues for further expansion decided to relocate the headquarters. Consequently, the board agreed that its farm, Rietvlei 101 JR, be used for the purposes of the new head office. It was environmentally suited and considered one of the most scenic spots on the Witwatersrand.The substance of ubiquity, Rand Water 1903-2003, Johann W.N.

Recent History - 3 Fraser Street and Custom House Extension The Rand Water Board moved out of the city to Rietvlei and the building was sold to the state. With the proposal of the Kopanong Precinct for the Gauteng Legislature in 2002, this building was to have been demolished providing underground parking with a park on top. Bitterly opposed by the Heritage organizations the project fell through when the matter went to appeal and the demolition permit was denied.http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=472&Itemid;=253 However the building was not occupied and currently lies in a dilapidated state. Heritage Status of the Rand Water Board Building (3 Fraser Street, 1940) The Rand Water Board Building is recognized as a national heritage asset of exceptional cultural significance for the following reasons: * The Rand Water Board Building was described by the National Monument Council in 1991 as ‚Äúfinely proportioned and well-detailed building of outstanding architectural quality‚Äù * The Rand Water Board Building is a fine example of the Neo-Classical Modernism architectural style executed in high quality materials * The Rand Water Board Building was built by John Barrow (Pty) Ltd (Barrow Construction), a company with a reputation for high quality workmanship * The Rand Water Board Building with its alterations and extensions tells the story of the expansion of the RWB * The Rand Water Board was an important organization in the development of Johannesburg and this was illustrated by the location of the RWB Head Office within the financial district of the city * The Rand Water Board Building forms a strong contextual grouping of fine buildings with the neighbouring Custom House, the Second new Library Hotel (1938), Johannesburg Public Library and the Volkskas Buildings.

The most common sub-type is the Holweck pump, which contains a rotating cylinder with spiral grooves which direct the gas from the high vacuum side of the pump to the low vacuum side of the pump. The older Gaede pump design is similar, but is much less common due to disadvantages in pumping speed. In general, molecular drag pumps are more efficient for heavy gasses, so the lighter gasses (hydrogen, deuterium, helium) will make up the majority of the residual gasses left after running a molecular drag pump. The turbomolecular pump invented in the 1950s, is a more advanced version based on similar operation, and a Holweck pump is often used as the backing pump for it. The Holweck pump can produce a vacuum as low as . History =Gaede= The earliest molecular drag pump was created by Wolfgang Gaede, who had the idea of the pump in 1905, and spent several years corresponding with Leybold trying to build a practical device. The first prototype device to meet expectations was completed in 1910, achieving a pressure of less than 10^{-6} mbar. By 1912, twelve pumps had been created, and the concept was presented to the meeting of the Physical Society in M√ºnster on 16 September of that year, and was generally well received. Gaede published several papers on the principles of this molecular pump, and patented the design. The working principle is that the gas in the chamber is exposed to one side of a rapidly spinning cylinder. Collisions between the gas and the spinning cylinder gives the molecules of gas momentum in the same direction as the surface of the cylinder, which designed to turn away from the vacuum chamber and toward a fore-line. A separate backing pump is used to lower the pressure at the fore-line (output of the molecular pump). If the pump is operated under pressures low enough that the gas is in free molecular flow, at a given speed, the pump will maintain a constant pressure ratio of the vacuum, P_{vac} to the pressure to the outlet, P_{fore} known as the \\"compression ratio\\", K: : \\\\frac{P_{fore}}{P_{vac}} = K This \\"Gaede molecular pump\\" was used in an early experiment testing vacuum gauges. =Holweck= The improved Holweck design was invented in the early 1920s by Fernand Holweck as part of his apparatus for his work in studying soft X-rays. It was manufactured by French scientific instrument maker, Charles Beaudouin.D. Beaudouin, Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society, No. 90 (2006). He applied for a patent on the device in 1925. The main difference from the Gaede pump was the addition of a spiral, cut into either to the spinning cylinder, or to the static housing. Holweck pumps have been frequently modeled theoretically. =Siegbahn= Another design was given by Manne Siegbahn. He had produced a pump which was used in 1926. About 50 of Siegbahn's pumps were made from 1926 to 1940. In 1943, Seigbahn published a paper regarding these pumps, which were based on a rotating disk. via Use in turbomolecular pumps While the molecular drag pumps of Gaede, Holweck, and Siegbahn are functional designs, they have remained relatively uncommon as stand-alone pumps. One issue was pumping speed: alternatives such as the diffusion pump are much faster. Secondly, a major issue with these pumps is reliability: with a gap between moving parts in the tens of micrometers, any dust or temperature change threatens to bring the parts into contact and cause the pump to fail. The turbomolecular pump, overcame many of these disadvantages. Many modern turbomolecular pumps contain built-in molecular drag stages, which allows them to operate at higher foreline pressures. As a stage in turbo molecular pumps, the most widely used design is the Holweck type, due to a significantly higher pumping speed than the Gaede design. While slower, the Gaede design has the advantage of tolerating a higher inlet pressure for the same compression ratio, and being more compact than the Holweck type. While the Gaede and Holweck designs are significantly more widely used, Siegbahn-type designs continue to be investigated, due to their significantly more compact design compared with Holweck stages.

Pitchfork called the band's sound \\"prime industrial pop\\"O'Connor, Andy, Azar Swan \\"Dance Before the War\\", Pitchfork and said that the album's title track was aggressive and accessible with a \\"bent for experimentation.\\" The band's second album, And Blow Us a Kiss, was released in October 2014 by Zoo Music, the record label owned and operated by Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls and Brandon Welchez of Crocodiles. They followed the album up with a double-A-side remix 12\\" called Variations on Handmade Birds, which featured mixes by Vatican Shadow and Cut Hands. Variations was notable for being the first time that both William Bennett (of Whitehouse) and Dominick Fernow (of Prurient), both widely recognized as two of the most significant pioneering figures in power electronics and noise music, had been featured on the same release. Strawn and Atash would go on to collaborate with longtime Hospital Productions audio engineer and mixer Kris Lapke for their subsequent work, with Savage Exile in 2017 and The Hissing of a Paper Crane as well as on a single for the Adult Swim Singles Series called Empire Grave, Adult Swim, both in 2019.

From 1956 to 1973 he worked at the firm I. M. Pei & Partners. I. M. Pei has been among the most honored architects in the world. Cossutta was Pei's associate and ultimately his partner in the first phase of Pei's career. He was responsible for some of the firm's best- known designs from that era, including three that have received \\"landmark\\" designations in recent years. In 1973 he and Vincent Ponte left Pei's firm to form Cossutta & Ponte, which ultimately became Cossutta and Associates. The new firm designed the Credit Lyonnais Tower in Lyon, France (1977) and the Tower at Cityplace (1988) in Dallas, Texas, among other commissions. Early career The University Gardens Apartments (1961) were one of the first commissions executed by Araldo Cossutta for Pei & Associates, and were part of an urban renewal plan for Hyde Park, a Chicago neighborhood and the location of the University of Chicago. The buildings are now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Cossutta was born on the island of Krk, which was then in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (and subsequently in Yugoslavia and then Croatia). He was educated at the University of Belgrade, the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1949 Cossutta worked in the atelier (the studio) of Le Corbusier, who \\"arguably had more of an influence on the form of the modern world than any other architect.\\" He received a master's degree from Harvard in 1952. From 1952-1955, he worked for Michael Hare and Associates. In 1955, Pei founded his own architectural firm, I. M. Pei and Associates. Like Cossutta, Pei had been profoundly influenced by Le Corbusier; Pei has written that the \\"two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\\" Cossutta became an associate in Pei's new firm shortly after its creation. Cossutta's designs for Pei's firm include the Denver Hilton Hotel (1960), University Gardens Apartments in Chicago, Illinois (1961), the north and south buildings of the L'Enfant Plaza complex in Washington, D.C. (1968), the Third Church of Christ, Scientist in Washington, D.C. (1971), and the Christian Science Center in Boston, Massachusetts (1973). Brutalism and the Christian Science Center Christian Science Center (1973), Boston, Massachusetts. The reflecting pool and the Colonnade Building (right) date from the 1970s; the domed Mother Church (center left) dates from 1894‚Äì1906.The Colonnade Building is now known as 101 Belvedere. See Architecture critics include Cossuta's buildings from the 1960s and 1970s as examples of the Brutalist architecture that flowered in that period. The name itself refers to the typical use of raw concrete (' in French). One of the seminal buildings for the New Brutalism was Le Corbusier's Unit√© d'Habitation (1952) in Marseille, France. Benjamin Flowers writes that, \\"In appearance, New Brutalism is characterized often, but not exclusively, by rugged and dramatic concrete surfaces and monumental sculptural forms.\\" Among the most recognized of Cossutta's designs is the Christian Science Center (1973) in Boston.Araldo Cossutta was the lead designer for the Center; see The Center incorporated the original Mother Church buildings (1894-1906), the eight story Christian Science Publishing House (1934), and three newly constructed buildings. The five buildings were incorporated into a large plaza with a long reflecting pool. The new buildings were the Colonnade Building with its sculpted, raw concrete colonnade, a 28-story office building, and the quarter-round Sunday School Building with its 500-seat auditorium.The new buildings were the 26-story office building (177 Huntington Avenue), the Sunday School Building (now known as Reflection Hall), and the Colonnade Building (now known by its address, which is 101 Belvedere). See Chandigarh, India (1953‚Äì1963). Pei is erroneously listed as the sole architect. Only Pei is credited for the Christian Science Center in this book. The plaza of the Christian Science Center was declared an historic landmark by the City of Boston in 2011. The report noted that the Center is \\"a singular achievement of civic design in the Modernist period. The Pei/Cossutta plan made the Christian Science Center one of the most monumental ‚Äì and successful ‚Äì public spaces in Boston.\\" Michael Kubo and his colleagues have written that this Brutalist design \\"shows how, with proper care and stewardship, these buildings can be wonderful participants in an active urban setting. At their best, they are powerful monuments of an ethic inspired by, but critical of, its Modernist past ‚Äî an ethic that sought authenticity for its time and embraced the future wholeheartedly.\\" The Christian Science Center has been changed fairly little since its construction around 1970, and is an example of a large public space that has been maintained by a private organization. Significant modifications to the design have been proposed by the Church. Third Church of Christ, Scientist Plaza entrance to the Third Church of Christ, Scientist (Washington, 1971; demolished 2014) Cossutta's design for the Third Church of Christ, Scientist (Washington, D. C., 1971) incorporates an octagonal church building with a raw concrete facade, an eight-story office building, and the plaza lying between the buildings. The design is also considered Brutalist, and has been controversial since the building's construction. While the building won an \\"Award for Excellence in Architecture\\" from the Metropolitan Washington Board of Trade, the Washington Post architecture critic Wolf von Eckardt was quite negative about the bunker- like exterior of the church and its disruption of the 19th Century scale of this section of Washington, which is close to the White House. The design and the early criticism of it were the subjects of an entire chapter in a 1988 book about Washington's architecture by Sue Kohler and Jeffrey Carson. These authors admired the auditorium, which they characterized as \\"exceptionally dynamic and powerful\\", and wrote that Cossutta's arrangement of the church, a paired office building constructed at the same time, and the plaza was \\"a '\\". About 1990 the congregation of the Church began to seek a buyer for the property, which they felt had become unsuitable. The probable consequence would have been demolition of the church building. In an effort to save the building, in 1991 two independent groups joined to file an application for historic landmark status for the church. This application was ultimately approved by a unanimous vote sixteen years later in 2007. An application to demolish the building to permit redevelopment of the property was then denied in 2008. The conflict between the congregation's and the Christian Science Church's right to control the property, and the buildings' status as an important exemplar of brutalist ecclesiastical architecture, continued and attracted national attention. A demolition permit was finally granted in 2009 despite the church building's landmark status. The granting of the permit acknowledged that the building had become a threat to the congregation's vitality, having become oversized compared to the congregation's membership and expensive to maintain. The structure was razed in 2014; Araldo Cossutta was philosophical about its destruction, saying ‚ÄúMy work should not be fossilized, but when you replace it, make sure the replacement is an even greater gift.‚Äù Honors The Denver Hilton Hotel, for which Cossutta and Pei were the lead designers, received an American Institute of Architects (AIA) National Honor Award in 1961, among other honors. In 1968, the firm I. M. Pei & Partners received the AIA Architecture Firm Award; Cossutta was then a partner in the firm, and had been with the firm essentially since its founding in 1955. In 1974 Cossutta was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and in 2010 he was elected as a foreign member of the French Acad√©mie d'architecture. In addition to his studies at the French √âcole des Beaux-Arts and his work with Le Corbusier, Cossutta's Tour du Cr√©dit Lyonnais is well-known in France, and has been nicknamed le crayon (the pencil). These were all noted in a discussion of his induction; see The Christian Science Center (1973) won the 1975 Harleston Parker Medal. Three of Cossuta's designs, all executed while he was with I. M. Pei's firm, have been granted landmark status: University Gardens Apartments (1961) was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, the Third Church of Christ, Scientist was listed as an historic landmark in the District of Columbia in 2008, and the plaza of the Christian Science Center was designated an historic landmark by the City of Boston in 2011. In 1994, Cossutta endowed the Araldo A. Cossutta Annual Prize for Design Excellence at Harvard University.

This temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva.Official Blog for Shri Dev Rameshwar Temple It is a historic temple built in 16th century. Its chief interest is the approach about 250 yards long, cut through rock fifty feet deep. The idol, a four-armed figure seated on a bull, is of solid silver said to weigh a hundred kilograms and is in good condition at present.The Gazetteer of Ratnagiri - Places of Interest (Vijaydurg) Temple Ghati (Eastern Gate) Gabhara (Inner Sanctum) The architectural patterns of the temple building shows that it has been expanded at least three times from its establishment until now. In the early 18th century, Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre built a quadrangular inner shrine made up of finely hewn stones, also called as the Gabhara around the original place of Shiva's pindi. This is the main room of the temple which contains a shivling or pindi at its centre. Later, in the mid-18th century, Sardar Sambhaji Angre and Sankhoji Angre built a Mandap in front of the gabhara. This mandap consisted of four huge wooden pillars bearing beautiful carvings all over them. They also built a Pradakshina Marg around the gabhara. The entire area was enclosed with walls to form a small temple consisting of the gabhara, the mandap and pradakshina Marg. The entire temple building covers an area of 4,025 sq ft. Stone tiles were placed in the area outside the main temple building covering an area of about 15,000 sq ft. It was in this era that the temple was provided with two new gates on the western and southern side. Shri Dev Rameshwar Temple - Main Building In 1763, Shrimant Madhavrao Peshwe appointed Sarkhel Anandrao Rudrajirao Dhulap as the chief of the Maratha Navy. Anandrao was also appointed as the governor of Vijaydurg Fort. In 1775, Madhavrao Peshwe appointed Gangadhar Bhanu as the Subhedar of Vijaydurg region. In 1780, Subhedar Gangadhar Bhanu built a huge Sabha Mandap with 20 carved wooden pillars. In the early 18th century, there were many changes and developments in the structures, architecture and the surroundings of the temple. The most notable change was made by Sarkhel Anandrao Dhulap. He built two additional gates on the northern and eastern side of the temple. The eastern gate was built by making a way or Ghati by cutting a small hill adjoining the temple on the eastern side. He also built the main entrance or the Mukhya Pravesh Dwar for the temple. A huge bell hangs on the eastern gate which has year 1791 engraved on it. This bell was the one that was brought from the Portuguese Ship which was captured by the Maratha Navy. The main wooden mast of this ship has been installed in front of the Main entrance of the temple at the beginning of the Temple Ghati. Mahashivratri Fair A fair is held for six days in the month of Magha every year which is attended by about 5,000 people from nearby villages and towns. The fair starts 5 days before the day of worship. On the Mahashivratri day, devotees observe fast and stay awake all night. Mahashivratri marks the night when Shiva performed the 'Tandava'. It is also believed that on this day Shiva was married to Parvati Ma. On this day Shiva devotees observe fast and offer fruits, flowers and Bael leaves on Shiva Linga.Society for the Comfluence of Festivals in India Wall Paintings The walls of the temple show drawings depicting incidences from Ramayana and Mahabharata. These drawings were drawn by artists appointed by Sardar Sambhaji Angre. These drawings are unique in the sense that although they depict stories from the ancient Vedic culture, the characters' clothes, weapons, ornaments and other equipment and instruments are similar to those found in the 18th century.

Life Parmentier was born in France in 1658. He initially studied art under his uncle, S√©bastien Bourdon, who died in 1671. After some further instruction from another relation, Parmentier went to England in September 1676, to work under the decorative painter Charles de La Fosse, who was then painting the ceilings at Montagu House in Bloomsbury. He came to the attention of William III, who sent him to work at his palace of Het Loo in Holland, but his employment there came to a premature end following a dispute with Daniel Marot, then surveyor of the royal palaces in Holland. While in the Netherlands Parmentier painted the ceiling and two chimney-pieces in the chief room of the royal palace at Binnenhof. He was a member of the guild of St Luke at The Hague, becoming a master on 1 December 1698. Charles de Saint-Evremond, another Frenchman in England, painted in 1701. Parmentier returned to London, but unable to find sufficient patronage there, he accepted an invitation to go to Yorkshire, where he painted many portraits. In 1711 he was paid ¬£50 to paint an altarpiece showing the Last Supper for the church of the Holy Trinity Church at Hull. It survives, although in a mutilated condition. He also executed a ceiling painting on the theme of Moses receiving the law for St. Peter's Church at Leeds, and decorated staircases at Worksop Manor for the Duke of Norfolk, and at the house of John Atkinson, a former mayor of Leeds. The house was at the corner of Call Lane and Duncan Street in Leeds. Following the death of Louis Laguerre in 1721 Parmentier returned to London, hoping to succeed to his practice as a decorative painter. During this London sojourn he became a member of a masonic music club called the Philo-musicae et -architecturae societas Apollini, which met at the Queen's Head tavern on Fleet Street near Temple Bar. Parmentier may have been hoping that freemasonry might provide a viable source of patronage for him, and it is known that he did get some work through the club, as its minute-book records that when the tavern changed its name to the Apollo tavern in recognition of its musical clientele, Parmentier painted the new sign.Andrew Pink, 'A music club for freemasons: Philo-musicae et -architecturae societas Apollini, London, 1725-1727', Early Music, 38 (4), pp. 523-36, accessed 16 May 2016. He did not, however, achieve his hoped-for success in London, and was on the point of returning to the Netherlands, where he had been invited to spend the rest of his life with relatives at Amsterdam, when he died on 2 December 1730. He was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden. The DNB cites as references Vertue's Diaries (Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 23076); Redgrave's Dictionary of Artists; Dussieux's 'Artistes Fran√ßais √† l'Etranger; and Obreen's Archief voor Nederlandsche Kunstgeschiedenis, v. 139.

Seven of his copies found their way into the Raphael Collection of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV in the Orangerie at Sanssouci. Upon his return to Berlin, he was named a member of the Academy and was appointed a Professor in 1836. He specialized in portraits and was especially esteemed for his portrayals of children.

Life and work Gathie Falk was born on January 31, 1928 in Alexander, Manitoba, Canada, to immigrant Russian parents. Her father, Cornelius, died that same year and her mother, Agatha, went to work to support her and her older brother Gordon, while her eldest brother, Jack, had to move in with another family. In 1930, the Falk family relocated to another small town in southern Manitoba and continued to move around, eventually ending up in Winnipeg when Falk was a teenager. At 16, she left high school to work so she could assist with the family finances and completed her education via correspondence courses. When she was 19, Falk and her mother moved to Vancouver, where she still resides. She became a school teacher and taught elementary students until 1965, when she left to commit herself full-time to creating art. At one time, Falk was a pupil of Lawren Harris, one of the artists from the Group of Seven.Birnie Danzker, Jo-Anne. Foreword. Gathie Falk: Retrospective. Vancouver: Vancouver Art Gallery, 1985. p. 5. Print. Falk has worked in various media, including installation, ceramics, painting, drawing and papier-m√¢ch√©. Her works find their source in the events and objects of everyday life, inviting us to consider the significance of the commonplace, including her well-known ceramic sculpture Fruit Piles (1967‚Äì70), Single Right Men's Shoes (1972‚Äì73) and Picnics (1976‚Äì77). As described by Vancouver Art Gallery senior curator Bruce Grenville, \\"Falk is remarkable for her ability to seize the ordinary and turn it into a powerful revelatory force... the paintings and sculptures she produces have a deeply personal presence that is grounded in an intense scrutiny of her daily environment.\\" Drawing from subjects ranging from apples, oranges and shoes to dogs, dresses, hedges and clouds, and often amplifying their beauty through repetition, her work summons and recalls for viewers the ways in which the everyday claims a vivid place in our imagination. Falk has participated in group and solo exhibitions in Canada, the United States, France and Japan. A major retrospective show of her work at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2000 later toured to various Canadian galleries including the National Gallery of Canada. Recent exhibitions include The Things in My Head (2015: Equinox Gallery, Vancouver), and paperworks (2014: Burnaby Art Gallery, Burnaby, British Columbia). Falk's work can be found in private and public collections including the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al, the Burnaby Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Canada. She is represented by Equinox Gallery in Vancouver, B.C., Canada and by Michael Gibson Gallery in London, Ontario, Canada.

In his Ph.D. thesis \\"Architectural Principles for Virtual Computer Systems\\" he also invented the classification for Hypervisors which is now widely adopted in the area of virtual computer systems and computer science in general. Biography Dr. Goldberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City, in 1944. He received the B.S. degree in Mathematics from MIT in 1965 and the MA and Ph.D. degrees in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University, in 1969 and 1973, respectively.

In 1974 with Gerald J. Popek he proposed the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, a set of conditions necessary for a computer architecture to support system virtualization. From 1966 to 1972 he was a member of the research staff at MIT, first at Lincoln Laboratories and then at Project MAC. From 1971 to 1972, Dr. Goldberg served as a consultant to the Director of Engineering at Honeywell's Boston Computer Operations. His teaching experience included lectureships at Brandeis University and Northeastern University. Dr. Goldberg was a member of ACM. He was the organizer of the Virtual Machine session at the 1973 National Computer Conference, was the Program Chairman and Proceedings Editor for the ACM SIGARCH-SIGOPS Workshop on Virtual Computer Systems, 1973 and has written and lectured extensively on many different aspects of virtual machine systems. Dr. Goldberg was a member of the Honeywell Information Systems Technical Office in Waltham,MA and also a Lecturer on Computer Science at Harvard University. His research interest included computer architectures, operating system design and evaluation, and data management systems at that time.Survey of Virtual Machine Research 1978 Dr. Goldberg filed a patent under the name \\"Hardware virtualizer for supporting recursive virtual computer systems on a host computer system\\" (Patent Nr. 4253145) which was accepted 1981 and is held by Honeywell Information Systems Inc.Patent number: 4253145 \\"Hardware virtualizer for supporting recursive virtual computer systems on a host computer system\\" In 1975 Dr. Goldberg together with Dr. Jeffrey Buzen and Dr. Harold Schwenk (whose last names are represented in the initials of the company) founded a company called \\"BGS Systems, Inc.\\" in the basement of Buzen's Lexington, Mass. home. Over the next fifteen years, it moved five times, but always within Waltham, Mass. The company set out to develop products that provided centralized capacity management and planning capabilities for all major computing platforms. In addition BGS created products that managed and evaluated computing systems such as UNIX, MVS, VM, OpenVMS, and the AS/400 as well as OS/2 and Windows NT. By the early 1980s the company could claim over 30,000 installations worldwide with its BEST/1 product. This software, which was based on queuing theory, was devised by the three founders and promoted by the company as being the de facto standard for capacity management and planning in heterogeneous distributed environments.BGS Systems, Inc.

Randall inspecting the Poole Collection in the Lilly Library David Anton Randall (5 April 1905 ‚Äì 25 May 1975) was an American book dealer, librarian and bibliographic scholar. He was head of Scribner's rare book department from 1935 to 1956, librarian of the Lilly Library and Professor of Bibliography at Indiana University. Randall was responsible for the sale of two copies of the Gutenberg Bible.Randall, David A. (1969) Dukedom Large Enough. New York: Random House, cover notes. As a practitioner of bibliology with a bibliophiliac addiction, a raconteur of history of books, and an avid collector, he developed a keen appreciation for books as physical objectsincluding the tasks of collecting, cataloging, finding and preserving them.  Early life  Randall was born in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania and educated at Harrisburg Academy (graduated 1924) then Lehigh University from which he graduated with a B.A. degree in English in 1928. He began to study law at Harvard but dropped out after one term after attending George Parker Winship's course on the history of the book. He got a job working for E. Byrne Hackett in New York for whom he attended the Jerome Kern auction. In 1931 the depression found him unemployed and he took up independent book scouting to support himself. He had doubts about the decision, his wife was pregnant and \\"the only thing to do, it seemed, was to return to the Pennsylvania coal mines.\\"Randall, 1969, p. 15. Mrs Randall, however, thought otherwise, saying that he was hard enough to live with as it was and he would be \\"completely intolerable\\" if he wasn't doing a job he liked. He formed a relationship with Max Harzof through whom Randall met important figures in the book world. Randall also prepared catalogs based on Harzof's stock.\\"Randall, David A.\\" in  Scribner's  In 1935 Randall was appointed to head Scribner's rare book department, a position he held until 1956. In that capacity he got to know leading dealers and collectors of the day including Estelle Doheny, Carl H. Pforzheimer, Carroll A. Wilson, and Thomas W. Streeter. Through his friendship with John Carter in Scribner's London office, Randall was able to acquire many important British and European books, including the re-discovered Schuckburgh copy of the Gutenberg Bible.The David A. Randall Retrospective Memorial Exhibition: Twenty Years' Acquisitions Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington, 1975.\\"The Talk of the Town: Gutenberg Bible\\", The New Yorker, 17 February 1951, p. 21.

Lilly, Jr. of the pharmaceutical Lillys. When Lilly decided to give his collection to Indiana University in 1955, where they formed the basis of the Lilly Library, Randall was asked to take up the post of Lilly Librarian which he did on 1 July 1956. He also received the title of Professor of Bibliography. Among the collections that Randall acquired for Indiana were the Bobbs-Merrill archive, the Bernardo Mendel Latin American library, the Upton Sinclair papers, the George A. Poole early printing collection, the Wendell Willkie papers, and Ian Fleming's collection of nineteenth century science and thought and his James Bond novel typescripts.The Ian Fleming Collection of 19th-20th Century Source Material Concerning Western Civilization together with the Originals of the James Bond-007 Tales: a machine-readable transcription. Lilly Library Publications Online. Retrieved 25 August 2014.  Writing  Randall was a prolific contributor to bibliographic journals, including Publishers Weekly, The Colophon, Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, and Bibliographical Notes and Queries (for which he was the American editor). In book form, Randall tended to work with others, contributing chapters or editing. Important works included his essay \\"American First Editions 1900-1933\\" in John Carter's New Paths in Book Collecting (1934) and a revision of A Primer of Book Collecting with John T. Winterich in 1946. He was a member of the committee charged with preparing the Bibliography of American Literature. His reminiscences for the years 1929‚Äì1956, Dukedom Large Enough, were published by Random House in 1969.  Memberships  Randall was a member of the Bibliographical Society of America, the Grolier and University Clubs of New York and the Caxton Club of Chicago.  Honors  In 1966 Lehigh University awarded Randall an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. He also received the \\"Leather Medal\\" from Sigma Delta Chi. A thousand items of Randall's drafts, correspondence and personal memorabilia are in the collection of the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Donald Dickinson, author of the Dictionary of American Antiquarian Bookdealers, opined that Randall was a knowing and resourceful bookman and antiquarian, who cultivated relations with a broad range of collectors, dealers and bibliographers. Randall effectively parlayed his knowledge and extensive contacts in bookstores, the industry and libraries to further the cause.  Selected publications  *A Primer of Book Collecting.

She is the founder and Editor-in-Chief of Baszari and Baszari magazine. For more than a decade she has worked in both the fashion and the publishing world. At age 24 she was the Creative Director of Kenzo Takada in Paris, France. Her digital art collection \\"Ensue√±os Rioplatenses,\\" was declared a \\"National Work of Tourist Interest\\" by the government of Uruguay, the highest artistic honor awarded by that nation (analogous to the United States National Medal of Arts). Casas was also officially declared a \\"Young Leader in Latin America\\" by the Washington, D.C.-based Inter-American Development Bank (IBD). Casas was named by the Museum of the Americas as \\"one of the most influential artists of 2015,\\" and she was permanently admitted to its 100 Certified Artists Organization. Casas' work has been exhibited across the globe, including as part of Google's Project for New Media in New York and in private commissions and exhibitions by Fortune 500 companies, such as Fiat (2013) and Goodyear (2014).  Biography  Casas spent her formative years living in Bonn, Germany and The Hague, Netherlands, where her parents served as diplomats. It was in Europe, at age 8, that she developed an early passion for fine art and design. For the next two decades, Casas returned to South America to complete her studies in Argentina and Uruguay and to launch her career as an artist. As a young proteg√©, her talent was quickly recognized by world-renowned international artists Yaacov Agam, who gave Casas her earliest formal instruction, and Japanese artist and fashion designer Kenzo Takada, for whom she later served as Art Director for his shows in Buenos Aires and Paris. The famous Uruguayan artists Pablo Gimenez, Alvaro Amengual, and Rogelio Osorio, in particular, helped to develop Casas' painting style.  Art career  At age 24, Casas' paintings debuted publicly in 2009 in Buenos Aires at the Castagnino Roldan Gallery. Shortly thereafter, and inspired by Andy Warhol and others, Casas began working with digital art, first by digitally transposing photographs of iconic historical figures and later by digitally reconstructing images of iconic sculptures. One of her earliest digital pieces, Liberty, Fraternity and Equality, a tribute to the heroes of the early 19th century Latin-American Wars of Independence, was curated by Google and included in its ‚ÄúProject for New Media‚Äù in New York later that same year. Casas followed the success of \\"Liberty, Fraternity and Equality\\" in 2011 by releasing a collection of digital work entitled \\"Ensue√±os Rioplatenses,\\" earning her numerous national and international awards at age 27. \\"Ensue√±os Rioplatenses\\" was inspired by the work of Casas' great-grandfather, the famous Argentine sculptor Gonzalo Leguizamon Pondal (1890-1944). Her work, a digitally reinterpreted collection of iconic sculpture images, paid tribute to the stylistic bond that Leguizamon Pondal shared with his contemporary, the Uruguayan sculptor Jose Luiz Zorrilla de San Martin (1891‚Äì1975), both of whom in 1931 became their respective county‚Äôs first artists to win France's National Salon of Paris Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts prize.http://chnm.gmu.edu/transatlanticencounters/items/show/4601 Ten of the twenty-six Ensue√±os Rioplatenses pieces were immediately curated for Uruguay's Bicentennial, a national event commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the country's May Revolution, and Casas was named as Official Artist of the Bicentennial of Uruguay. The full collection was then displayed in a solo exhibition at both the National Museum Zorrilla and the Santos Cultural Palace in Uruguay. Within months, the entire collection was declared by Uruguay's Ministry of Culture as a \\"Work of National Tourist Interest,\\" the highest artistic honor awarded by the government of Uruguay, and she was described as a \\"young iconic artist.\\" Fiat, a major supporter of the exhibition at the National Museum Zorilla, also exhibited the full collection at the Fiat's prominent Stile Italia Space in Buenos Aires. First edition pieces of \\"Ensue√±os Rioplatenses,\\" such as \\"Virgin Flower,\\" were acquired by various private collectors, the National Museum Zorilla, and private foundations, such as the Rozenblum Foundation. In 2014, after returning from a special artist residency in Rome, Italy, Casas was commissioned by Goodyear to create a three-meter tall Tree of Life made from cut, recycled tires that Casas handcrafted into geometric designs forming a mandala of colors and symbols paying homage to Goodyear‚Äôs 100-year history throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The work was unveiled at an exhibition sponsored by Goodyear and Latin Trade during the 2014 Art Basel show in Miami, Florida. During 2015, Casas earned several new international awards and distinctions. In February, Casas was named one of the most influential artists of 2015 by the Museum of the Americas, and she was permanently admitted into its 100 Certified Artists Organization. She was selected as a winner of the 1st, 4th and 5th 2015 Showcase for New Media by Artslant in Los Angeles. In June, one of Casa's works was selected for a special exhibition of leading international artists at the Carrousel Du Louvre Art Fair at the Louvre Museum in Paris. And in December, at private auction during the 2015 Art Basel show in Miami, Florida, Casas was commissioned to create a portrait of American actress Eva Longoria. In 2017, she founded Baszari, a highly selective and carefully curated shoppable editorial showcasing luxury fashion, art, and design with a VIP Global Distribution as well as a high purchasing power target. Baszari's A-Listers include world-famous celebrities, designers, and artists including Maestro Carlos Cruz-Diez, Hollywood actors Antonio Banderas & Jordi Molla, Latin Grammy Award singer Alejandro Sanz in collaboration with contemporary American-Spanish artist Domingo Zapata, Art Collector and Real Estate Developer Mr. Craig Robins, Mario Testino, Pablo Atchugarry, Fashion Business Expert Eva Hughes, Art Collector Alan Faena, Angel Sanchez, Esteban Cortazar among many others.

This extremely twiggy shrub ('ramosissima'), which grows to about 1m in height, bears a profusion of white or bluish-mauve flowers and is found growing under semi-desert conditions in cracks in sheetrock and on steep, bare, rocky slopes in very dry and hot locations bordering the Gariep River, from near the Augrabies Falls, through the Richtersveld to the vicinity of the river mouth. The branches of this shrub are woody and rigid, divaricate, and sometimes spinescent. The thick and rather fleshy leaves are alternate, shortly petiolate, obovate- cuneate to broadly ovate in shape, with a wedge-shaped base, margin toothed except at the base, about 2-6mm long by 2-6mm broad. Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze (1843‚Äì1907) in 1891 first published a description of the genus in \\"Revisio Generum Plantarum\\" 2: 461, based on the earlier description of Sutera by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth (1757‚Äì1834) in 1821. The species was first described in 1904 as Sutera ramosissima by the botanist and mathematician William Philip Hiern in Harvey's Fl. Cap. 4: II. 265. (see illustration) Hiern's description was based on two specimens collected by Max Schlechter (1874-1960), and his more famous brother, Rudolf Schlechter (1872-1925).

Club career Born in Puerto Serrano, C√°diz, Andalusia, Luismi graduated from Sevilla FC's youth setup, making his debut as a senior with the C-side in Tercera Divisi√≥n. In July 2012, he signed his first professional contract, also being promoted to the reserves in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. On 11 November 2012, Luismi broke two bones in his skull in the dying minutes of a 1‚Äì0 home win against Real Ja√©n, only returning to action on 31 March of the following year, against the same club. On 1 February 2014, he was called up by manager Unai Emery for a La Liga match against M√°laga CF as a replacement for Cardiff City-bound Cala, also being selected to the game against UD Almer√≠a on 8 March but remaining on the bench on both occasions. On 3 July 2014, Luismi penned a new two-year deal with the Andalusians, being also an unused substitute in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup 0‚Äì2 loss to Real Madrid at Cardiff City Stadium on 12 August. He made his first-team ‚Äì and top division ‚Äì debut on 23 August, replacing Vicente Iborra in the 80th minute of a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Valencia CF. On 30 July 2015, Luismi signed his first professional deal, being definitely promoted to the main squad and being assigned the number 16. The jersey, worn by Antonio Puerta when he died playing for Sevilla in 2007, was only to be given to products of the club's academy from that moment onwards; halfway through the campaign, however, he was stripped of the number when it was controversially handed to Argentine Federico Fazio. After turning down a deal to play for the reserves in Segunda Divisi√≥n, Luismi signed a two-year deal at fellow league team Real Valladolid on 29 June 2016. On 29 December, after being rarely used, he was loaned to Gimn√†stic de Tarragona in the same league until June. He scored in his second appearance for the latter on 14 January 2017, opening a 1‚Äì1 draw at UCAM Murcia CF. Upon returning, Luismi was a regular starter for Valladolid during the 2017‚Äì18 campaign, which ended in top-tier promotion. On 15 January 2020, however, after failing to feature in any league matches in the last two seasons (due to injury), he was loaned to Real Oviedo of the second division until June. On 25 September 2020, Luismi agreed to a two-year contract with Elche CF, recently promoted to the top flight.

The genus contains a single described species, Archiponera wheeleri known from several Late Eocene fossils which were found in North America.  History and classification  When described the genus Archiponera was known from a single pair of fossils preserved as an impression in fine shale of the Florissant formation in Colorado. No further specimens have been reported since that time. The formation is composed of successive lake deposits which have preserved a diverse assemblage of insects. The insects and plants suggest a climate similar to modern Southeastern North America, with a number of taxa represented that are now found in the subtropics to tropics and confined to the old world. When Archiponera was described, the Florissant formation was considered to be Miocene in age, based on the flora and fauna preserved. Successive research and fossil descriptions moved the age older and by 1985 the formation had been reassigned to an Oligocene age. Further refinement of the formation's age using radiometric dating of sanidine crystals has resulted in an age of 34 million years old. This places the formation in the Eocene Priabonian stage. At the time of description the holotype worker and allotype male of A. wheeleri were deposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology paleontology collections at Harvard University. The fossils were first studied by paleoentomologist Frank M. Carpenter of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. His 1930 type description of the new genus and species was published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. When described, Carpenter noted perceived similarities between Archiponera and the modern genera Streblognathus and Dinoponera, suggesting that the two modern genera were the closest relatives of Archiponera. Wheeler suggested that Streblognathus and Dinoponera, at that time each known from a single described species, were members of a close generic grouping, or \\"super genus\\", which prior to the Pleistocene ice age, was a tropicopolitan, with Archiponera being a northern member of the group. However molecular data analysis has shown that while Streblognathus and Dinoponera show general morphological similarities, they are not closely related as suggested by Wheeler, and the relationship status of Archiponera is not known. Archiponera is one of eleven extinct Ponerinae genera described as of 2012. Description In general Archiponera specimens have large heads with rounded sides and small, uncurved mandibles. The clypeus is large in proportion to the head, with a forward margin that has a cleft in the middle and a rearward margin with a large lobe present. The eyes are similar in placement and size to that seen in Streblognathus and Dinoponera, being smaller and positioned high on the head capsule. The twelve segmented antennae are long, with a scape that extends past the rear of the head capsule. The gaster is notably rounded and small at long, being nearly the same size as the long head. The workers have an overall length of with a thorax of about . The male is overall smaller than the known worker, with an estimated length of , a condition that is seen in Dinoponera species. The wings of the male are long and bearing two cubital cells.
