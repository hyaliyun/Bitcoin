He is the founder and the director of one of Turkey's earliest art galleries, Galeri Baraz. Early life and career Yah≈üi Baraz was born in Istanbul, Turkey. He is the son of Ahmet M√ºnir Baraz and √úlker Baraz. His great grandfather is Zeki Pasha, a field marshal of the Ottoman Army during the Turkish Balkan Wars and World War I. He studied ceramics at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul, currently known as Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, and graduated with a B.A. in 1969. His teachers included prominent Turkish artists and historians such as Sabri Berkel, Edip Hakkƒ± K√∂seoƒülu, Belkƒ±s Mutlu, Nejat Diyarbekirli, ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Oygar and Sadi Diren. He traveled in Europe - hitchhiking - during his summer vacations in his Academy years. He did his mandatory military service in Southeastern Turkey, on the Syrian border as a gendarmerie. Upon being discharged from the military he built a ceramics workshop in Kurtulu≈ü, ƒ∞stanbul, at the current gallery building and used it as his studio between 1971 and 1976. In 1974 he went to New York City where he first worked at \\"Fire House Ceramics\\" and later at \\"Unicorn Gallery\\" in SoHo as an intern. That was where he realised that he wanted to be an art dealer instead of an artist. After returning to Turkey in 1975, he set out to convert the ceramics workshop into an art gallery. Galeri Baraz opened on November 14, 1975 with a show of Can G√∂knil's paintings and Yah≈üi Baraz's ceramic works. Since then the gallery held more than two hundred and fifty exhibitions of important Turkish artists such as Burhan Doƒüan√ßay, Mehmet G√ºlery√ºz, Nuri ƒ∞yem, Edip Hakkƒ± K√∂seoƒülu, Fikret Mualla, Bedri Baykam, Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, Nejad Melih Devrim, G√ºng√∂r Taner and √ñmer Ulu√ß. He also introduced Peter Halley, Hunt Slonem, John F. Simon JR. and Mark Kostabi to the Turkish art world. Yah≈üi Baraz has played a significant role in promoting Turkish art and artists and has been very influential in getting people to form art collections since the 70s. His clients included Feyyaz Berker, Erol Aksoy, Ali Ko√ßman, Aykut Hamzagil, Mustafa Taviloƒülu, Halil Bezmen, ≈ûakir Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ±, B√ºlent Eczacƒ±ba≈üƒ±, Cengiz √áetindoƒüan, Barbaros-Sema √áaƒüa and many others. In 2010, he founded Galeri Baraz Publishing House. The company has published 6 books about arts in Turkish. Personal life Yah≈üi Baraz married H√ºlya Salihoƒülu in 1983. He has a daughter named R√ºya Baraz from this first marriage. In October 2004 he married Bulgarian sculptor Maria Kƒ±lƒ±√ßlƒ±oƒülu.

Two locomotives were built by ƒåKD as prototypes, with the locomotive never entering mass production, due to the locomotive's high weight, and progress in electrifying main lines.  History  The locomotives were initially developed due to the requirement in the late 1960s for powerful diesel locomotives to be used on express services. 2 prototypes were built between 1974 and 1975 by ƒåKD Praha, who leased the locomotives to ƒåSD. The locomotives were initially tested between Prague and Ostrava, working the express train Ostravan. Although the locomotive could keep to the timings of the ƒåSD Class E 499.1 locomotives, the locomotives suffered from reliability problems. In 1976 the second locomotive was returned to the manufacturer, due to frequent unavailability. In January 1977, both locomotives were moved to Dƒõƒç√≠n, and used on freight services between Dƒõƒç√≠n and Prague. The first locomotive was withdrawn in November 1979, following an engine room fire, with the second following in March 1980 due to an engine fault. The two where then purchased by V√ö≈Ω (V√Ωzkumn√Ω √östav ≈Ωelezniƒçn√≠), the Czech Railway Research Institute, and moved to the Velim test circuit. The first locomotive was used as a spare parts source for the second, and was eventually used for crash tests, then scrapped. In 1992, locomotive two was withdrawn after an engine room fire.  Later use  In December 2012, the second locomotive was moved to DPOV's Nymburk works for a return to operation, with adaptations being made to overcome the initial reliability problems, including the fitting of an entirely new electrical control system. This overhaul was completed in late 2014, with locomotive testing beginning in 2015, and moving to its new home at the Velim test circuit in February 2015. Since 2015, the locomotive has been used by V√ö≈Ω, for testing work.

After receiving her military pilot's licence in 1948, she gave up dentistry to devote herself to aviation. From 1951, she undertook French Air Force reconnaissance missions in the Far East until she returned to France in 1954. In 1957, she once again took up dentistry opening a practice in Paris. Early life Born in Belleville-sur-Meuse on 28 July 1912, Suzanne Henriette Jannin studied dentistry at Nancy, receiving her diploma in 1939. In May 1939, she began to train as a pilot at Tomblaine on a Potez 43. French resistance and World War II During German occupation, she became an active participant in the French resistance. As a member of the Meuse department's F.F.I., Region C, under Colonel Grandval, she lodged British and American parachutists, escorting them from Verdun to the Swiss border. She also provided medical services, transmitted news reports, and transported documents, weapons and munitions. On 1 September 1944, she became a lieutenant and on 1 January 1944 she joined the army's Women's Auxiliary Administration Corps. Rather than take on administrative duties, she found a 4-by-4 vehicle which enabled to ferry French prisoners back from Germany. Between 6 May and 15 August 1945, on her own initiative, she led four convoys of 38 vehicles, repatriating a total of 650 prisoners. Aviation and French Air Force A keen aviation enthusiast, she became president of the Verdun Air Club. After giving up her dental practice in Verdun, she moved to Paris where she could devote all her time to aeronautics. In 1948, she received her military pilot's licence followed by additional training courses at Saint-Yan and at Challes-les-Eaux. In April 1951, she joined the Far Eastern Women's Auxiliary Administration Corps (Corps des auxiliaires f√©minines d‚Äôadministration: Cafaeol) as a dental captain based in Tonkin, French Indochina. In 1952, General Lionel-Max Chassin encouraged her to join the Air Force. In order to do so, she had to give up her officer's grade and become a simple corporal. On 6 April 1953, she was sent to join the 52nd squadron at Tan-Son-Nhut near Saigon where she piloted Morane Criquets. She was the second woman to become a pilot in the Air Force and the first in Indochina. She flew day and night, both on reconnaissance, guidance and rescue missions, clocking up 290 flights, of which 86 were war missions. After being sent to Laos, she gave up aviation for a time to provide dental services to the troops stationed there. In her own words, Jannin explained: \\"I always tried to help my country, to assume responsibility and that's why I went to Indochina.\\" Later life and commemoration After General Chassin's departure, it was difficult for her to continue her missions. She returned to France in 1954, where she continued to serve as an Air Force dentist until 1957, stationed first in Saclay and then in Ch√¢tillon-sous-Bagneux. She then re-established her dental practice in Paris. On 27 April 1961, she married Gustave Delvoye in Paris. Suzanne Jannin died in 1982. Her funeral was held on 10 July 1982 at Mons-en-Bar≈ìul, a suburb of Lille. In September 2019, a plaque in memory of \\"Suzanne Jannin Pilote en Indochine\\" was unveiled by Le Souvenir Fran√ßais at Belleville-sur-Meuse, her birthplace. The square on which the plaque stands was ceremoniously named \\"Square Suzanne Jannin\\" by the mayor, Yves Peltier.

It owes its name to the fact of being the color of the House of Savoy, a ruling dynasty in Italy from 1860 to 1946. Having become a national color with the unification of Italy (1859‚Äì70), its use continued even after the birth of the Italian Republic (1946) with the name \\"Italian blue\\". An Italian-blue border is in fact inserted on the edge of the Presidential Standard of Italy, and the use of the blue scarf for the Italian Armed Forces' officers, for the presidents of the Italian provinces during the official ceremonies, and of the blue jersey for Italian national sports teams it was also maintained in the Republican era. Historical origin Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy The origin of the color seems to date back to June 20, 1366 when Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, before leaving for a crusade commissioned by Pope Urban V and organized to help the Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos, cousin of a maternal part of the Savoy Count, wanted that on the flagship of the fleet of 17 ships and 2000 men, a galley of Republic of Venice, waved, next to the red-crusading silver banner of the Savoys, a blue flag: The color therefore has a Marian implication, bearing in mind that there is also the possibility that the use of a blue banner by the Savoys started earlier. In any case the oldest documented Savoy flags, dating back to 1589, have the colors red, white (or the colors of the coat of arms of the dynasty) and blue. The latter color acquired over time prevalence until it became the Italian national color. Use The Italy national football team at the 1982 FIFA World Cup The Presidential Standard of Italy Debora Ballarini and Silvia Gaudino during a match of the Italy women's national rugby union team Referring to the Marian cult, the ribbons of the Order of the Annunciation (the greatest Savoyard knight sign, transplanted also in the kingdom of Italy), were blue; blues, also in the Republican era, are also the ribbons of the decorations of military valor (gold, silver, bronze medal and the war cross). Later, even for the officers, a blue scarf was provided in the outfit, dressed as a neck-band passing over the right shoulder and knotted on the left side. In 1572 this use was made obligatory for all the officers by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. Through various transformations, the savoy blue scarf is still the main rank of the Italian armed forces' officers, who dress it both in ceremonial services and, sometimes, on guard. Other uses in the Republican era of color are the border of the Italian presidential banner (blue, in heraldry, means \\"law\\" and \\"command\\") as well as on the institutional flags of some primary public offices (President of the Council of Ministers, minister and undersecretary of defense, high degrees of the Italian Navy and of the Italian Air Force), as well as on the distinctive range of the presidents of the Italian provinces,Legislative Decree 18 August 2000, n. 267, article 50, on the subject of \\"Consolidated law on local government regulations\\". on the Italian blue cockade and on the aircraft used by the Frecce Tricolori. In the sporting field, the blue of Savoy distinguishes almost all of the athletes who represent Italy internationally in any discipline: the origin of the use of this color dates back to 6 January 1911, when the Italy national football team faced in Milan the Hungary national football team. The term blue shirt by now represents for metonymy the international appearance for Italy, and the athletes who represent the country are called Azzurri.Except in motor sports, where the color assigned to Italy is traditionally the red race, and in other disciplines such as cycling and winter sports, which often make use of white. There is no univocal color coding of the blue links, so that the shade of blue is historically varied over time both within the same national team and, for example, in the same historical era between national teams of different disciplines.

She has been considered a pioneer in the field of social impact design. In honor of her memory the American Institute of Graphic Arts created the Sylvia Harris Citizen Design Award, which honors a professional designer who has created a project that enhances public life.  Personal life and education  Harris was born in Richmond, Virginia during 1953. As she grew she experienced racism and attended a desegregated high school. Harris has stated that she remembers her mother shouting from her car at the Ku Klux Klan while they were displaying on the street. Her father coached women's sports, and her mother was an art teacher and artist. After graduating high school Harris went on to attend Virginia Commonwealth University, where she graduated with a BFA in communication art and design in 1975. She eventually married her husband Gary Singer, with whom she had one daughter, Thai. Harris died on July 24, 2011. She had collapsed three days prior while attending a meeting in Washington, D.C. and was taken to George Washington University Hospital, where she later died due to heart problems. Early career Harris moved to Boston after college and discovered graphic design as a career path. Harris began working at Washington Business Group on Health, where Chris Pullman mentored her. Her second position was at Architects Collaborative working on environmental graphics. On Pullman's advice she left Architects Collaborative to earn an MFA in graphic design from Yale. After graduating she co-founded Two Twelve Associates, Inc. with David Gibson and Juanita Dugdale in 1980. During this time she did design work for Citibank. In 1994, she left Two Twelve to form Sylvia Harris LLC. She focused on using design to solve problems for civic agencies, universities, and hospitals. She renamed Sylvia Harris LLC to Citizen Research and Design as the company's focus shifted towards a design process driven by public research. In 2011 she co-founded the non-profit Public Policy Lab \\"committed to the more effective delivery of public services to the American people.\\" In 2014 she was awarded the American Institute of Graphic Arts medal.

The reason patients got lost was because of poor signs, lack of funding for feature for the building, etc. For Harris to plan the project she had to go through five steps. The first step was assessment which was getting to the cause of the problem, the second step was management which was making sure the building is under control. The third step was coming up with a strategy to fix the problems, the next step was the designs, and the last step was implementation which was making negotiations for the designs to be approved.

Stating that she did not find part-time work difficult because it allowed her to do the writing she loved, even after she heard that Cheongchun pasan won a prize, she continued working her part-time jobs. Perhaps for this reason, her works tend to only display an autobiographical aspect. Her other works include the 2018 story collection, Syorum (ÏáºÎ£∏ Showroom), and her second novel Kolsenteo. Kim stated that she wanted to write words that reflect ‚Äúmy own stories that unfold in this place where we currently live.‚ÄùEun Jeong-jin, ‚ÄúNovelist Kim Eui-Kyung, ‚ÄòThere Is No Textbook Answer, You Can Only Write What You Know,‚Äô‚Äù Korea Economic Daily, October 22, 2018. https://www.hankyung.com/life/article/2018102220761  Writing  Kim Eui- kyung‚Äôs first novel, Cheongchun pasan, was originally submitted to her publisher under the title of Peuribaiteo (ÌîÑÎ¶¨Î∞îÏù¥ÌÑ∞ Free Part-Timer), but was afterwards changed to the currently known title and published. In line with its original title, which referred to people that make their livelihood through part-time jobs, Cheongchun pasan focuses on characters such as a delinquent borrower in their 20s and a woman in her 30s that declared individual bankruptcy, and thus meticulously reveals the lives of contemporary youth in great detail. In reality, the author herself, like the characters in her works, came from a family that declared household bankruptcy when she was 17 and had to move numerous times while eking out a living through various part-time jobs. Her first short story collection, Syorum, like Cheongchun pasan, is also based on her personal experiences. Syorum was born from her experiences living in semi-basement rooms for over ten years, all the while dreaming of home ownership and visiting IKEA. The characters in Syorum ‚Äîsuch as a female college student that lives in a one-room apartment while looking for employment, a bankrupt couple, an adulterous man in his 40s‚Äîare all based on real people that the author observed in IKEA. All the characters in Syorum are satisfied with buying furniture from IKEA rather than expensive, high- priced furniture. Within that decision is the hidden, fundamental desire known as ‚Äúhappiness.‚Äù The author explained the reasoning behind her work as, ‚ÄúI thought about why people gathered at IKEA, why they were compelled to decorate their homes‚Äù and that ‚Äúin the end, I realized it was because they yearned for happiness.‚Äù Kolsenteo examines five young people who manage calls from people ordering pizza and delicately draws daily life as spent in a call center. The novel was born out of the author‚Äôs personal experience working at a call center for six months and has received favorable reviews from critics for pleasantly and vividly capturing the current generation and the so-called ‚Äúgapjil [arrogant abuses of power by those who have positions of power over others] society.‚ÄùKim Eui-kyung, ‚ÄúNovelist Kim Eui-Kyung, ‚ÄòYouth, Space, and What‚Äôs Next,‚Äô‚Äù interview by No Weon-su, Classian, April 2, 2019, http://www.classian.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1236.

Dotson died in 1982 and was buried in Alabama.  Background  Dotson was born in Alabama. He served as pastor of Town Creek Baptist Church in Courtland, Leighton Baptist Church and Courtland Baptist Church before his service in Africa.  Serving at Rusitu Mission (1931-1950)  Dotson was commissioned in 1931, when he was assigned by the South Africa Mission Board to join other missionaries serving at Rusitu Mission in Chimanimani District. Shorty after he arrived, he was appointed to be the leader of the mission station. He served for 20 years but in 1949 he had a disagreement with the other missionaries and he left Rusitu Mission, becoming an independent missionary with his wife.  Working with the Southern Baptist Convention (1950-1972)  After working for a short time as an independent missionary, the Dotsons were appointed by the Foreign Mission Board (FMB) now International Mission Board (IMB) of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) in 1950. The FMB was planning its first denominational work in Rhodesia and the Dotsons were the first missionaries appointed by the FMB in Rhodesia. In the 1951 SBC Annual Congress, Dotson encouraged the SBC to send more missionaries and resources to reach out to the blacks in Southern Rhodesia. At this time there were only four Baptist churches which allowed white people only. Dotson led the establishment of Sanyati Mission, many clinics which include Sasame, Chinyenyetu, Manyoni, Chireya and Chinyenyetu, the Baptist Theological Seminary of Zimbabwe and the Baptist Convention of Zimbabwe. He left Zimbabwe in 1972 because of his deteriorating health and returned to America.  Family Life  Dotson married three times and was widowed twice. His first wife Hattie was killed in a motorcycle accident in Harare on March 3, 1955. Dotson then married Ebbie who died during child birth on 1 January 1958. Rev Dotson was living in Mutare at this time and on this day he spent the night praying on one of Mutare town hills. In the morning he told people that he had been shown Calvary by God. In 1958 he met his third wife Anneli, a native of Finland who had moved to South Africa to serve as a missionary. The two married in 1960 before moving to serve in Zimbabwe. Anneli worked as a registered nurse and midwife. She felt called to missionary work at the age of ten.  Legacy  Dotson pioneered the work of Southern Baptist Convention in Zimbabwe resulting in the formation of the Baptist Convention of Zimbabwe. Through his efforts Sanyati Baptist Hospital was built and a number of clinics in Gokwe. There is a hall at Baptist Conference Centre named after him and his helper J Nyathi.

Walsh was an American priest of the Archdiocese of Boston. Personal life Walsh was born in Newton, Massachusetts but moved as a child to East Boston where he attended the Chapman School. He then attended Boston College and was graduated in 1883. He attended the Grand S√©minaire de Montr√©al for several years until Saint John's Seminary in Boston was complete. Once it was, he transferred to St. John's and was ordained as a member of their first class. He had two brothers, Richard L., who was also a priest, and Edward B. Both priests were on the altar when Edward was married. Ministry He was ordained June 25, 1887 at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross by Bishop Matthew Harkins. He was well known within the diocese. Walsh's first assignment was to St. Mary's Church in Randolph, Massachusetts. He remained there for 10 years. Walsh then spent 10 years as an assistant pastor at St. Charles' parish in Woburn, Massachusetts. In 1902, while saying mass for more than 700 people, a fire was discovered in the church. Walsh alerted the congregation and asked them to calmly leave the church, which they did. In 1908, Walsh became a pastor for the first time at Sacred Heart Church in South Natick. In 1917, Walsh was made the first pastor of a newly created parish in Needham, Massachusetts. When Walsh was transferred from Needham to St. Mary's Church in Dedham, a public reception was held for him at the town hall. He arrived in Dedham on July 16, 1923. As the construction on the church had recently been finished, Walsh was able to focus on the various groups and societies within the parish. His pastorate ended with his death in 1929. Death Walsh died on February 2, 1929 at the St. Mary's rectory of pneumonia. As his body lay in state in the church, delegations from various societies took turns standing as honor guards as the public filed by. A mass was said for the repose of his soul at 8 a.m. for the children of the parish, and a solemn Requiem Mass was said at 10 am. The church, which has a seating capacity of 1,500, was not big enough for all those who wished to attend. In attendance were other priests from the Archdiocese, clergy from other denominations, government officials, parishioners, and residents. The priests' choir provided music. The honorary pallbearers came from the ranks of the Fourth Degree Knights of Columbus. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts.

It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019. Due to its popularity, the game received the award for the \\"Best Popular Vote Game\\" by the Google Play Store in 2019. As of May 2020, Free Fire has set a record with over 80 million daily active users globally. As of November 2019, Free Fire has grossed over worldwide. Garena is currently working on an enhanced version of Free Fire which will be called Free Fire Max.  Gameplay  Garena Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in a third person perspective. The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life. When players join a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.  Reception  The graphics were described as having \\"a benefit for mid and low specification phones\\", but a reviewer stated that \\"if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds.

She graduated with honors from Bryn Mawr College with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Psychology in 1985. At Bryn Mawr, Chapman conducted research on Pavlovian conditioning with Dick Gonzalez. Chapman pursued her PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania where she initially worked with Robert Rescorla on studies of animal learning. Chapman shifted her research focus while engaged in research with fellow graduate student Steven Robbins, and completed her PhD in 1990, with her dissertation titled \\"Models of contingency judgment.\\" She was a post-doctoral fellow in the Decision Sciences and Marketing Departments at the Wharton School at The University of Pennsylvania from 1990-1992, where she conducted research on anchoring with Eric J. Johnson. Chapman was Assistant Professor of Clinical Decision Making in the Department of Medical Education, at the College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago from 1992‚Äì1996. From 1993-1996 she worked as a Research Health Scientist in the Health Services Research Department of Veteran Affairs in the West Side Medical Center in Chicago. Chapman moved to Rutgers University in 1996 and remained there until 2017. She was a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Psychology and served as Chair and Director of Graduate Studies while at Rutgers. Chapman joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University as Professor of Social and Decision Sciences in 2017.  Research  Chapman's research program examined the psychological processes underlying decision making with the aim of designing theoretically-motivated, policy-relevant interventions to facilitate healthy and prosocial behavior, such as vaccination and blood donation. Her research on decision making addresses a variety of topics including the default effect, goals and social comparisons, and allocation of scarce resources. One of main ideas in decision research is that decision makers code outcomes as gains or losses relative to a reference point. Chapman's research has shown that goals can act as a reference point, such that falling short of a goal is coded as a loss. Chapman has studied the role of time preferences in health behavior by studying compliance with hypertension medication regimens, cholesterol-lowering medication, and annual flu vaccines. She also pursued the study of differences between time preferences for health and money, finding, for example, that agreement between the two domains is improved when decision makers view health as money. Chapman is interested in factors that drive vaccination decisions because these decisions can be a window onto a number of fundamental psychological phenomena including temporal discounting and prosocial behavior.

She exposed the poor practices that led to the spread of hepatitis C and HIV in central China in the 1990s, potentially saving tens of thousands of lives. In 2001, following harassment by Chinese officials, she moved to the United States, where she worked until her death. Early life Wang was born with the family name Zou on 20 October 1959, in Fugou County, Henan. Her mother, Huang Yunling, worked as a village physician. Her father, Zou Bangyan, was a mathematics teacher who served as a soldier of the Kuomintang Army, which made her childhood difficult during the Cultural Revolution. She refused the Red Guards' command to denounce her parents and was expelled from school at the age of 8. When she was 13, she moved away from her village, was legally adopted by an uncle who was a member of the Communist Party, and adopted his surname, Wang. She was then allowed to continue her education. Career Wang graduated from Henan Medical College in 1983, specializing in infectious diseases. From 1986 to 1991, she worked at Zhoukou Center for Disease Control and Prevention and conducted research in hepatitis. In 1991, she was assigned to work at a plasma collection center in Zhoukou, part of Henan's Plasma Economy project to pay donors for plasma donations. She found that several donors were infected with hepatitis C but were not turned away. At this point, plasma donations were not kept separate but mixed with all other donors', so that this infection spread to anyone that received the mixed sample. Further, to reduce costs, health workers would reuse tubing and other equipment that would be contaminated with a person's blood or plasma after donation. After confirming the presence of hepatitis C in several of the collections, she reported this to local health officials to change their practices, but they asserted it would cost too much to address the problem. She approached the national Ministry of Health with her findings, which led to a 1993 regulation to require all plasma donors to be screened for hepatitis C. She was removed from her position at the collection center, but took it upon herself to evaluate other facilities elsewhere, creating her own testing site and taking her own samples from the population, as well as evaluating collection centers and identifying further points of cross-contamination. She determined that the hepatitis C antibody was present in as high as 84.3% of the population in the region at the height of the epidemic. Dr. Shuping Wang (center) with public health colleagues visits rural AIDS village in Henan. Around this time, AIDS became a major health concern across the world. China took to restricting blood samples from foreign countries for fear of bringing AIDS into the country, seeing it as a Western disease, and incentivised the people to donate blood and plasma as a precaution against AIDS. This was particularly popular for central China, mostly made up of farmers earning low wages, as they would be paid for their blood donations. Wang recognized the same concerns she had on discovering hepatitis, and began evaluating for the HIV virus that is a precursor to AIDS. After finding one patient with the virus in 1995, she found that HIV had a 13% infection rate in blood plasma collection centers in their area. Again, she attempted to alert local public health officials to screen for HIV, but they refused on the cost basis. Wang took her data to the Ministry of Health, and in 1996, a new regulation requiring HIV screening for donors was established, and ultimately leading China to take more precautionary measures to control the epidemic. She formed a campaign with Gao Yaojie, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Henan who would become a major AIDS activist in China; Wang evaluated the blood samples, while Yaojie was the spokesperson to report on these. Wang was targeted for her whistleblowing by local health officials. One retired official smashed a sign at her testing site and then struck her with a baton. Some attempted to shut down her testing site, and eventually the local utilities were cut off, which destroyed the blood samples she had collected. She later moved to Beijing and found work there before moving to the United States in 2001. She became a naturalized US citizen and worked as medical researcher both in Milwaukee and at the University of Utah until her death. According to David Cowhig, a U.S. Foreign Service officer at the Beijing embassy during the 1990s, Wang's research \\"was also the single most important source\\" that the United States had in understanding the AIDS epidemic in China, which was used in informing China‚ÄìUnited States relations during the presidency of Bill Clinton. By 2001, the Chinese government affirmed that more than half a million citizens in central China may have been infected by HIV due to the poor collection practices that Wang had exposed. The BBC and The Guardian have credited Wang with potentially saving tens of thousands of lives. The King of Hell's Palace Wang at opening night of The King of Hell's Palace In the month prior to her death, Wang was involved in the production of a play based on story of HIV epidemic in Zhoukou region and her whistleblowing, entitled The King of Hell's Palace, that was to open at the Hampstead Theatre in London. However, she reported that family and friends living in China had been intimidated to pressure her to drop the show. She said that this pressure was happening because Chinese officials were afraid of publicity, \\"but even after all this time, I will still not be silenced, even though I am deeply sad that this intimidation is happening yet again.\\" She believed that the play would help expose corruption in Chinese health service, save people and help persecuted Chinese doctors and AID activists like Gao Yaojie and Wan Yanhai.  Personal life  Wang's first husband was Geng Honghai, an employee of the Ministry of Health. They had a daughter, Samantha Geng, a clinical pharmacist. Wang's husband Geng was shunned by his colleagues during Wang's whistleblowing campaign, and their marriage ended in divorce. After moving to the United States in 2001, Wang took the English name Sunshine. Wang never felt safe enough to return to China. In 2005, she married Gary Christensen. They adopted her elder brother's two children, Julie Zou, an army nurse, and David Zou, an engineer.

Park Cheong-ho () (1966 - ) is a South Korean writer. In 1990, he became known as a ‚Äúnew generation author‚Äù and his works received attention for their freedom of form and distinct prose. Though he began his career writing both poetry and prose, he gradually came to focus solely on novels. The unique stylistic aspects of his writing include devices such as the enumeration of imagery, wordplay, and abrupt switches between scenes. In terms of subject matter and themes, he has constructed a literary world imbued with his individuality through the depiction of apathy and disinterest in public order, authority, and traditions, all while in search of a new set of moral and ethical values.See the publisher‚Äôs introduction for Park Cheong-ho‚Äôs Dan hanpyeonui yeonaesoseol. http://moonji.com/book/4136/  Life  Park Cheong-ho was born in 1966. In college, he studied creative writing with the continuous dream of becoming a writer and displayed an interest in diverse literary genres such as poetry, plays, and novels. Perhaps it is for this reason that his works are characterized by the transgression of conventional literary genres. He made his debut with a poetry collection in 1989 and a play in 1992. With the publication of his novel Geuga nareul salhaehada (Í∑∏Í∞Ä ÎÇòÎ•º ÏÇ¥Ìï¥ÌïòÎã§ That Which Kills Me) in 1995, he officially started his career in writing novels as well. Along with other writers such as Park Seongwon, Baek Minsuk, Song Gyeonga, and Bae Suah, he became part of the so- called ‚ÄúNew Generation Authors,‚Äù known for inaugurating a new sensibility and formation of literature during the 1990s. Their works were characterized by a cheerful and buoyant sensibility, an urbanist imagination, and an ethical numbness regarding sex and sexuality.Kim, Byeongik. ‚ÄúThe New Generation, the New Way of Life, and Literature.‚Äù Literature and Society 30 (1995): 665‚Äì87. While Park Cheong-ho‚Äôs novels also resonate with these characteristics, they differentiated themselves through a sense of identity and self-consciousness. That is, Park‚Äôs works display a philosophical orientation in which, even as they deal with a chaotic and melancholy reality, possess a kind of self- introspection.Jang, Seokju. ‚ÄúDiscourses of Erupting Disillusionment: On Park Cheong-ho‚Äôs Novels.‚Äù Literature and Society 35 (1996): 1311-1321. Just as the author himself stated that ‚ÄúI will write for the new generation that has suffered in this country,\\"Park, Cheong-ho. ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äôs Note.‚Äù In Geuga nareul salhaehada. Seoul: Sejongchulpangongsa, 1995. he has maintained the consciousness of a ‚Äúnew generation author‚Äù in constructing his literary works. Moreover, his novels frequently portray the appearance of a father in a decisive moment. This emphasizes the extent to which Park‚Äôs own father, a Christian pastor, influenced him. He claimed that his father was not the ordinary father of everyday life, but nearly always appeared as a pastor that stood on the border between God and human. Personally unable to accept such a father, Park has stated that it was only after his father passed away that he became aware of how his father made his own existence possible, and that his father had guided him towards God. In this manner, it is apparent that his father immensely influenced his mentality.Park, Cheong-ho, and Seongsil Choe. ‚ÄúLiving from the Borderlands of Death, or Surviving Conversations.‚Äù Literature and Society (August 1996): 1350‚Äì59.  Writing  = Early Works = Park Cheong-ho‚Äôs early novels betray traditional moral values and methods of private ownership, tearing down conventional ways of writing. His first works, such as the 1996 short story collection Dan hanpyeonui yeonaesoseol (Îã® ÌïúÌé∏Ïùò Ïó∞Ïï†ÏÜåÏÑ§Only One Romance Novel) and the 1995 novel Geuga nareul salhaehada, deal with doubts regarding basic moral order. For instance, he portrays subject matters such as accidental sojourns, apathetic and unmotivated sex and romance, unnecessary murders, adultery, idleness, and psychiatric hospitals and in this manner, the majority of his novels explore the so-called ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù and deviance. On the formal level, his works are written in a very free and experimental style. Through diverse methods such as following a stream of transient emotions as they arise, switching between first and third person to show the intermingling of time, and using devices such as mise-en- abyme in which another story is contained within his own, he materializes a distinct narrative form. = Later Works = Park‚Äôs works after 2000 extend the tendencies seen in his earlier writings. His 2002 short story collection, Jilbyeonggwa sarang (ÏßàÎ≥ëÍ≥º ÏÇ¨Îûë Sickness and Love), portrays a protagonist undergoing the ennui and pain of everyday life in order to render the desire of modern people to escape from everyday life. His experiments in narrative form also continue with devices such as the intermingling of reality and illusion and the exclusion of scenic descriptions. In addition, the short stories ‚ÄúSangsangdeul‚Äù (ÏÉÅÏÉÅÎì§ Imaginations), ‚ÄúSageondeul‚Äù (ÏÇ¨Í±¥Îì§ Incidents), and ‚ÄúHaengwideul‚Äù (ÌñâÏúÑÎì§ Actions) included in the 2006 collection Sarangui susahak (ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùò ÏàòÏÇ¨Ìïô The Rhetoric of Love) can each be considered as independent and stand-alone novels in their own right, but nevertheless take the form of an omnibus in which each short story is somehow linked.See the publisher‚Äôs introduction for Park Cheong-ho‚Äôs Sarangui susahak. https://digital.kyobobook.co.kr/digital/ebook/ebookDetail.ink?barcode=4808972882732  Works  = Poetry Collections = „ÄäÏπòÎ™ÖÏ†ÅÏù∏ Í≤ÉÎì§„Äã, Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨, 1995 / Chimyeongjeogin geotdeul (Lethal Things), Moonji, 1995. = Short Story Collections = „ÄäÎã® ÌïúÌé∏Ïùò Ïó∞Ïï†ÏÜåÏÑ§„Äã, Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨, 1996 / Dan hanpyeonui yeonaesoseol (Only One Romance Novel), Moonji, 1996. „ÄäÏÜåÎÖÑ ÏÜåÎÖÄÎ•º ÎßåÎÇòÎã§„Äã, Ìï¥ÎÉÑ, 1998 / Sonyeon sonyeoreul mannada (Boy Meets Girl), Hainaim, 1998. „ÄäÎùºÌëºÏ†§Ïùò ÎëêÎ≤àÏß∏ Î¨ºÍ≥†Í∏∞„Äã(Í≥µÌé∏), Î¥Ñ, 2002 / Rapunjerui dubeonjjae mulgogi (Rapunzel‚Äôs Second Fish)(co-editor), Bom, 2002. „ÄäÏßàÎ≥ëÍ≥º ÏÇ¨Îûë„Äã, Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨, 2002 / Jilbyeonggwa sarang (Sickness and Love), Moonji, 2002. „ÄäÎ≤öÍΩÉ Îú∞„Äã, ÏÉùÍ∞ÅÏùòÎÇòÎ¨¥, 2005 / Beotkkot tteul (Cherry Blossom Garden), Saenggaguinamu, 2005. „ÄäÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùò ÏàòÏÇ¨Ìïô„Äã, ÏûëÍ∞ÄÏ†ïÏã†, 2006. / Sarangui susahak (The Rhetoric of Love), Jakkajungsin, 2006. „ÄäÏΩîÏΩîÏä§„Äã, ÌòÑÎåÄÎ¨∏Ìïô, 2007 / Kokoseu (Coco‚Äôs), Hyundae Munhak, 2007. = Novels = „ÄäÍ∑∏Í∞Ä ÎÇòÎ•º ÏÇ¥Ìï¥ÌïòÎã§„Äã, ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÏ∂úÌåêÍ≥µÏÇ¨, 1995 / Geuga nareul salhaehada (That Which Kills Me), Sejongchulpangongsa, 1995. „ÄäÍ∞±Ïä§ÌÑ∞Ïä§ ÌååÎùºÎã§Ïù¥Ïä§„Äã, Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨, 2000 / Gaengseuteoseu paradaiseu (Gangster‚Äôs Paradise), Moonji, 2000. „ÄäÏÇ¨ÌùòÎèôÏïà„Äã, Ïù¥Î£∏, 2003 / Saheuldongan (For Three Days), Irum, 2003. = Children's Books = „ÄäÏ¥àÏΩúÎ¶ø ÎÇòÎ¨¥„Äã, Ìë∏Î•∏ÎßàÏùÑ, 1994 / Chokollit namu (Chocolate Tree), Pureunmaeul, 1994. „ÄäÎèåÏïÑÏò® Ïñ¥Î¶∞ÏôïÏûê„Äã, ÌååÎûëÏÉà, 1997 / Doraon eorinwangja (The Return of the Little Prince), Parangsae, 1997. „ÄäÏÜåÍ∏à Ïû•ÏàòÏôÄ Í∏∞Î¶Ñ Ïû•Ïàò„Äã, ÌïúÍµ≠Ìó§Î∞çÏõ®Ïù¥, 2007 / Sogeum jangsuwa gireum jangsu (The Salt Merchant and the Oil Merchant), Korea Hemingway, 2007. „ÄäÌï†Î®∏Îãà Ïñ¥Î¶¥Ï†Å„Äã, ÌõàÎØºÏ∂úÌåêÏÇ¨, 2012 / Halmeoni eoriljeok (When Grandma Was Young), Hunmin, 2012. = Anthologies = „ÄäÍΩÉÎì§ÏùÄ Î™®Îëê Ïñ¥ÎîîÎ°ú Í∞îÎÇò„Äã, Î•¥ÎÑ§ÏÉÅÏä§, 1997 / Kkotdeureun modu eodiro ganna (Where Have All the Flowers Gone), Reunesangseu, 1997. „ÄäÏù¥ÏÉÅÌïú Í∞ÄÏó≠ Î∞òÏùë : Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨Í∞Ä Ï£ºÎ™©ÌïòÎäî Ï†äÏùÄ ÏûëÍ∞ÄÎì§„Äã, Î¨∏ÌïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÏÑ±ÏÇ¨, 2000 / Isanghan gayeok baneung : munhakgwajiseongsaga jumokaneun jeolmeun jakgadeul (Strange Reversible Reaction: Notable New Authors from Moonji), Moonji, 2000. „ÄäÍ∑∏ÎåÄÏóêÍ≤å ÍΩÉÏùÑ„Äã, ÏãúÍ≥µÏÇ¨, 2003 / Geudaeege kkocheul (Flowers For You), Sigongsa, 2003. „Ää(2004)Ïù¥Ìö®ÏÑùÎ¨∏ÌïôÏÉÅ ÏàòÏÉÅÏûëÌíàÏßë„Äã, Ìï¥ÌÜ†, 2004 / 2004 Lee Hyo-seok munhaksang susangjakpumjip (The Complete Anthology of 2004 Lee Hyo-seok Literary Award Winners), Haeto, 2004.

Characteristics Melanocoryphus albomaculatus has a black head, scutellum, antennae and legs. On the red pronotum are two hook-shaped black spots. The corium of the hemelytra (the partially hardened front wings) is red with a black round spot in the middle, while the membrane (the transparent part of the front wings) is black and in the middle has a white round spot. The connexivum (on the visible side part of the abdomen) is red with black spots. The bug reaches a body size of 7‚Äì9 mm. Distribution and habitat This heat- loving species is very common in the Mediterranean region. Its distribution area extends in the east via Asia Minor to the Caspian Sea. In Central Europe, the species occurs only sporadically and is usually limited to so-called \\"heat islands\\". In Germany, these are located in the Upper Rhine Plain and on the Middle Rhine. The species is also present on the northern French channel coast, in the Netherlands and in Austria. Lifestyle The species prefers hot, dry, rocky habitats; more rarely areas with sandy soils. It is a so- called seed sucker. The main food plant of the species is the swallow-wort (Vincetoxicum hirundinaria).

History  = Founding in 1998 and conceptual idea = The band was founded in 1998 in Rome by the current members and first made a name for itself in the Italian Progressive rock scene through live performances. In the following years they developed and refined their conceptual idea to conceive rock operas in the classical Italian tradition of Progressive Rock. The band combines their own composed music with short excerpts from a film projected in the background. Among the musical influences are bands like Goblin, Genesis and Marillion. The first complete project was released by the band in 2002, when the four Italians accompanied Werner Herzog's film \\"Nosferatu\\" in concerts and provided it with new sounds. This procedure, called \\"Cineconcerto\\" by the band, is reminiscent of the film adaptations of Art Zoyd, who also chose \\"Nosferatu\\" as an object for their adaptation. In contrast to the French, RanestRane did not choose the original by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau as a model, but the remake by Werner Herzog.. = First studio album = The resulting album Nosferatu Il Vampiro (2007) thus offers a new soundtrack to Werner Herzog's film in the form of a kind of rock opera, with Daniele Pomo as the only singer. Excerpts from the film, i.e. original fragments of the Italian soundtrack, short dialogues and monologues, serve as hooks for the individual numbers, which are then presented by the four protagonists on various keyboard instruments, guitar, bass and drums, sometimes interrupted again by insertions with film dialogues. Musically one moves completely in the tradition of the classical, rather song oriented Italo-Progs of the 70s. There are links to italian Neo-progressive rock. In 2011 the band released their second album Shining, an adaptation of Stanley Kubrick's \\"The Shining (film)\\" with psychedelic atmospheres and changing vocal and instrumental parts, typical for Ranestane's work. = The Space Odyssey Trilogy = In November 2013 the first part of a trilogy inspired by Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (film) was released with A Space Odyssey - Part 1 - Monolith. The album included guest appearances by Steve Rothery and Steve Hogarth, guitarist and singer respectively of Marillion. The opportunity to collaborate arose in 2012 during the annual The Web Italy Convention, when RanestRane previewed the album and played some songs from the Marillion repertoire with Steve Rothery. In the same year RanestRane played at the Italian Prog Rock Festival in Japan together with the guitarist Enzo Vita, accompanied by a symphony orchestra. It was the first live performance of the groundbreaking symphonic rock album Contaminazione (originally released in 1973 by Il Rovescio della Medaglia - RDM) in its entirety. The recording of the concert has been released in 2014 as Live in Tokyo. In the year 2014 RanestRane played as opening act of the Steve Rothery band on their European Tour. On February 5, 2015 Monolith in Rome - A Space Odyssey Live has been released as an album on DVD and CD. This live recording was filmed and recorded at the Crossroads Live Club in Rome with Steve Rothery. In March 2015 RanestRane performed on the prestigious stage of the Marillion-Weekend in Port Zelande, Ouddorp (Netherlands) in front of 3,000 spectators. In September 2015 the band played acoustic arrangements of Marillion's classics and Hogarth's song repertoire with Steve Hogarth in Rome. The event was part of Steve Hogarth's 'H natural 2015 Christmas' tour. On 12 December 2016 the live recording of the concert had been released on DVD as Friends, Romans: H Natural featured by RanestRane. The live CD was released in February 2017. Almost two years after the first part, the band released the album A Space Odyssey - Part 2 - H.A.L. on 16 November 2015, the second part of their interpretation of the music to Stanley Kubrick's classic \\"2001: A Space Odyssey (film)\\". RanestRane had been touring Europe from 27 November 2015 on to support the Album during their H.A.L. EUROPA TOUR 2015/2016, playing in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and England. In spring 2017 the band toured in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Denmark and Italy with the concept of \\"The Cinematic Show\\". During this tour RanestRane played a \\"Best of\\" of their previous albums as well as a preview of the new, third album of the Odyssey trilogy A Space Odyssey - Trilogy. In October 2017 RanestRane played as support act during Marillion's Japanese Tour. RanestRane at Night of the Prog - Festival 21. Juni 2019 open-air-stage Loreley With the release of the third part A Space Odyssey - Final Part - Starchild in the year 2018 the band closed this elaborate project. This album again included guest appearances by Steve Rothery and Steve Hogarth of Marillion. It was followed up by a fan weekend and concerts in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, England, Denmark and Sweden at their \\"Starchild Tour\\" (The 20th Anniversary Across Europe). In September 2018 RanestRane performed as one of the Headliners at the Veruno Two Days +1 Prog Festival, the most important Italian prog festival. On 21 July 2019 the band has performed at Europe's biggest prog rock festival, the Night of the Prog- Festivalhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Prog on the Loreley open air stage in Germany. The new RanestRane project The Wall il cineconcerto is largely finished and is expected to be released on 23 November 2019 in Rome.

The current studies have found that most people underestimated how much another person liked them and enjoyed their company. This difference is the liking gap. Theories for why the gap exists This misunderstanding or gap has multiple factors that lead to or contribute to it. First, people tend to be overly self-critical and ruminate more on what they have said. In turn people tend to not think too much about what the other person said. We are often very self-absorbed and think that everyone is judging us. Some good examples of this is the spotlight effect. The spotlight effect is when people think everyone is looking and judging them more than they truly are. The illusion of transparency also shows how we get self-absorbed in social situations. This illusion is when people tend to think that everyone knows exactly what we are thinking when in reality they do not. Second, in conversations we tend to be as polite as possible especially in first encounters. This politeness is a kind of fa√ßade people use which can cause people to misunderstand how much the other person likes them. Third, people tend to protect against rejection. One way of doing this is to not show interest in someone. Fourth, conversations are often quite complex, and we miss verbal and nonverbal cues. An example of this is when we are thinking about what we want to say next and ignore what the person just said to us. Empirical research Various studies and replications have examined the liking gap and provide validity for the occurrence of this phenomenon. The liking gap is a newer idea and requires more research in order for it to be more widely accepted. Although no specific all-encompassing factor can explain why it happens, it does seems to appear in many interactions. The first study done was to see if there was a liking gap with a random stranger. This study was statistically significant and the people tended to underestimate how much their conversation partners liked and enjoyed their company. In another study, videos of first encounters were judged based on verbal or nonverbal cues of enjoyment. Even when cues were obvious to outside observers, the gap persisted with the participants. It also was evident in conversations of varying lengths; conversations that were short, medium, and long were compared and the gap appeared in all categories of conversation length. The gap was also seen in a year-long study of dorm mates. The dorm mates participated in multiple tests over the year and the gap consistently appeared. It was reliably shown that people's views of their own conversation tended to be more negative than their view of other people's performance. The gap is not showing that people are always negative. In fact, people usually have favorable views about themselves and others. However, there is evidence that people tend to exhibit self-criticism when thinking about their own interactions with others.

Fargues was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2018 in Rio de Janeiro.  Career  From 2002 to 2011, Fargues was a charg√© de recherches at the CNRS in Orsay, from 2011 to 2013 he was research director at the IRMA in Strasbourg and, from 2013, a professor at the l'Institut de math√©matiques de Jussieu in Paris (a campus of the Sorbonne University). Fargues works mainly centers around the study of Shimura varieties, p-divisible groups and their moduli spaces, and p-adic Hodge theory. One of his most significant contributions has been to link the local Langlands correspondence with the so- called \\"Fargues-Fontaine curve,\\" an object introduced by Fargues together with Jean-Marc Fontaine. In particular, Fargues has formulated a general geometric conjecture which refines the classical local Langlands conjecture, and at the same time introduces extra structure which mirrors the more categorical formulation of the geometric Langlands conjecture. These works were (in part) the subject of a S√©minaire Bourbaki expos√© in 2018 by Matthew Morrow and an Arbeitsgemeinschaft meeting at Oberwolfach in 2016. His work with Peter Scholze on the stack of vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve is expected to have implications for the construction of a local Langlands correspondence for general groups. Fargues gave the Peccot course at the Coll√®ge de France in the spring of 2004, was awarded the Petit d'Ormoy, Carriere, Thebault prize from the French academy of sciences in 2009, and was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2018 in Rio de Janeiro in both the number theory and algebraic geometry sessions.

It was broadcast live on Fox, and marked the show's return to Friday nights (thus being renamed Friday Night SmackDown); The broadcast featured current WWE wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands as well as Hall of Famers and Legends from the past. The main event saw Brock Lesnar defeat Kofi Kingston to win the WWE Championship for a fifth time in what was Lesnar's first match on the brand in 15 years. On the undercard, Kevin Owens defeated Shane McMahon in a ladder match resulting in Shane being (kayfabe) fired, Roman Reigns defeated Erick Rowan in a lumberjack match, and Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch defeated Bayley and Sasha Banks. The event also saw Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson's first appearance on SmackDown in over five years, and the WWE debut of mixed martial artist Cain Velasquez and boxing champion Tyson Fury. Background =Production= SmackDown! made its debut as a professional wrestling television special for the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) on UPN on April 29, 1999, and made its debut as a weekly program for the network on August 26. Over the years it had shifted networks; before its move to Fox, SmackDown had previously aired on its sister syndication service MyNetworkTV from October 2008 to September 2010. On June 26, 2018, WWE announced that SmackDown would move to Fox on Friday nights beginning in 2019, under a five- year contract valued at $205 million per-year. Amid a competitive bidding situation, NBCUniversal and USA Network chose to focus on retaining Raw. The move to pursue SmackDown came as part of Fox's increasing focus on live sports programming and non-scripted entertainment, in the wake of the then-upcoming sale of its film and television studios to Disney. The network's founder Rupert Murdoch promised extensive promotion of the program during its sports telecasts, and proposed a weekly WWE studio show on its cable network FS1. On September 26, 2019, WWE announced that Michael Cole would be returning to SmackDown for the first time since 2008 to lead the commentary team alongside his former Raw colleagues Corey Graves and Renee Young. The following night, Fox aired a special, SmackDown's Greatest Hits, which featured memorable moments from the program's 20-year history. Booker T and Young hosted a half- hour kickoff special prior to the premiere, joined by Fox Sports reporter Charissa Thompson as \\"blue carpet\\" correspondent. =Storylines= The show included six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and SmackDown Live (with this broadcast renaming the latter to Friday Night SmackDown). At Clash of Champions, Kofi Kingston defeated Randy Orton to retain the WWE Championship. On the following SmackDown, after The New Day (Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods) defeated the team of Orton and SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder) in a six-man tag team match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) returned and challenged Kingston for the WWE Championship, which Kingston accepted. On the September 9 episode of Raw, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair defeated The Boss 'n' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks) in a tag team match, after Lynch and Flair were attacked by the two the previous week. At Clash of Champions, Lynch retained her Raw Women's Championship against Banks by disqualification, while Bayley retained her SmackDown Women's Championship against Flair. On the following Raw during a tag team match against WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross, Banks and Bayley were attacked with steel chairs by Lynch and Flair. On the September 24 episode of SmackDown, a tag team match pitting Lynch and Flair against The Boss 'n' Hug Connection was scheduled for October 4. Prior to the announcement on the September 16 episode of Raw, after Banks and Bayley were attacked by Flair and Lynch, Banks challenged Lynch to a rematch for the Raw Women's Championship at Hell in a Cell, and Lynch accepted as a Hell in a Cell match.https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/09/16/9-16-wwe- raw-results-powells-review-of-chad-gable-vs-baron-corbin-in-king-of-the-ring- tournament-finals-the-street-profits-hosting-a-gender-reveal-party-for-maria- kanelliss-baby-the-begin-of-t/ Over the summer of 2019, Kevin Owens became furious with Shane McMahon due to the latter taking up more and more screen time each week from other wrestlers and exerting even more authority, which was in contradiction to what The McMahon Family (Vince McMahon, Stephanie McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Triple H) had promised several months prior. Despite Shane's attempts to ban Owens from SmackDown, Owens would nevertheless show up and attack Shane at opportune moments. During Raw Reunion on July 22, Owens challenged Shane to a match at SummerSlam and said he would quit the WWE if he were to lose, and Shane accepted. Owens went on to defeat Shane at the event. Two nights later on SmackDown, Shane fined Owens US$100,000 for attacking a designated official, Elias, who was again appointed as the special guest enforcer for Owens' match against Samoa Joe where Elias cost Owens the match by making a fast three count. Owens then tried to sympathize with Shane to lift the fine. Shane said he would consider it, but then cost Owens his King of the Ring tournament match against Elias by taking over as ref and making a fast three count. Shane then replaced Elias, who got injured, in the King of the Ring semi-finals against Chad Gable and promised that he would lift Owens' fine as long as Owens was the referee for the match and \\"did his job correctly\\". Gable made quick work of Shane, pinning him in under a minute. Shane then made the match a two out of three falls match and attacked Owens, but Gable made Shane submit to win. Despite Owens calling the match fairly, Shane fired him. Owens then threatened Shane with a lawsuit for wrongful termination as Shane had attacked a designated official (Owens). Shane gave Owens two options: if Owens pursued the lawsuit, he would keep Owens in court indefinitely, but if Owens dropped the lawsuit, he would be reinstated but still have to pay the fine. Owens instead challenged Shane to a ladder match where if Shane won, Owens would drop the lawsuit and leave the WWE for good, but if Owens won, Shane would be gone and Shane accepted. Prior to SummerSlam, Erick Rowan had attacked Roman Reigns backstage and lied about it. When Reigns found footage that showed Rowan as the culprit, this caused Rowan and Daniel Bryan to split their tag team due to Rowan lying, and a match between Reigns and Rowan was scheduled for Clash of Champions. Rowan then defeated Reigns in a No Disqualification match at Clash of Champions thanks to the returning Luke Harper, reforming their tag team. A rematch between Rowan and Reigns was scheduled for October 4 as a lumberjack match. Prior to the announcement on the September 24 episode of SmackDown, Reigns and Bryan challenged Rowan and Harper to a tag team match at Hell in a Cell which was made official. Despite being advertised for the show and arriving backstage, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Sting did not appear on the broadcast, with Undertaker later posting on his official Instagram page that he \\"wasn't needed.\\" https://www.ringsidenews.com/2019/10/05/fans-upset-after-steve-austin-no-show- at-wwe-smackdown-chanted-aew/  Event  The show opened with Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praising SmackDown only for King Corbin to interrupt, followed by The Rock. After exchanging verbal insults, Lynch and Rock attacked Corbin with multiple punches. Lynch performed a leg drop on Corbin, while Rock followed up with The People's Elbow and the Rock Bottom on Corbin to end the segment. =Preliminary matches= In the first match, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair faced Sasha Banks and SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley. In the end, Flair forced Bayley to submit to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the match. Next was a champion versus champion match with Universal Champion Seth Rollins against Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura in Rollins' first match on SmackDown since 2016. Before the match began, Bray Wyatt appeared in the Firefly Fun House and taunted Rollins about their match at Hell in a Cell. The match ended in a no-contest when Wyatt as The Fiend appeared and attacked Rollins with The Mandible Claw with The Fiend throwing Rollins off the stage. After that was the ladder match between Kevin Owens and Shane McMahon with both of their jobs on the line. Shane dominated at the beginning of the match by striking Owens with multiple objects and performing an elbow drop on Owens through the announce table. Owens then performed a frog splash on Shane through a ladder. In the end, as Shane ascended the ladder, Owens caught him with a Powerbomb through a ladder. Owens then climbed the ladder and retrieved the briefcase to win the match. As per the stipulation, Shane was (kayfabe) fired. After that, Braun Strowman, The Miz, and Heavy Machinery (Otis and Tucker) faced Randy Orton, United States Champion AJ Styles, and Raw Tag Team Champions Robert Roode and Dolph Ziggler in an eight-man tag team match. In the end, Strowman performed a powerslam on Ziggler to win the match. During the match, Strowman had taunted boxing star Tyson Fury, who was seated in the front row. After the match, Fury jumped the barricade but was restrained by security. In a backstage segment, DJ Marshmello tripped and fell on top of Carmella, thus pinning her to win the WWE 24/7 Championship. Additional footage was shown on WWE's website and social medias showing Carmella winning back the title. In the penultimate match, Roman Reigns faced Erick Rowan in a lumberjack match. In the end, Reigns performed a Spear on Rowan to win the match. = Main event = In the main event, Kofi Kingston defended the WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman)‚ÄîLesnar's first match on television in 15 years. Kingston ran and leaped at Lesnar, but Lesnar caught him and performed an F-5 to win the title in eight seconds. Following the match, Rey Mysterio, who Lesnar had brutally attacked on the previous Raw (along with Mysterio's son Dominic) came out with Cain Velasquez (making his WWE debut), the man who defeated Lesnar by technical knockout to win the UFC Heavyweight Championship back in 2010. Velasquez entered the ring and attacked Lesnar with numerous body shots until Lesnar retreated to end the show.  Aftermath  In a backstage interview after SmackDown went off the air, Cain Velasquez said he came to get revenge on Brock Lesnar for what he did to Rey Mysterio and Mysterio's son Dominic, who was later revealed to be Velasquez's godson. Afterwards, it was announced that Lesnar would defend the WWE Championship against Velasquez at Crown Jewel. Due to Charlotte Flair making Bayley submit in the tag team match, Flair was granted a match for the SmackDown Women's Championship against Bayley at Hell in a Cell. On the following Raw, Tyson Fury appeared, wanting an apology from Braun Strowman. Strowman said he was just messing around on SmackDown until Fury seemed to indicate that he wanted to fight. After some verbal insults, a massive brawl broke out between the two that had to be separated by security and other wrestlers. A match between the two was scheduled for Crown Jewel.

Plot Petula and Tilda are young artists in New York who make a living as drug dealers. After losing their stash and money while barely escaping police, they are given two days to repay their supplier. The two reconnect with Daphne, a wealthy, unstable childhood friend who lives alone in a remote rural mansion, in the hopes of finding a safe in her house that is full of money. The girls rekindle an intricate fantasy game they played as children - one in which Tilda assumes the role of a young girl, Daphne as her mother, and Petula a visiting doctor. The game has three rules - everyone must play, no outsiders allowed, and nobody leaves. Daphne makes Petula do increasingly bizarre things as the game progresses, such as hitting Tilda‚Äôs knee with a hammer and simulating sexual intercourse with Daphne. Tilda suffers from a bad drug trip, interspersed with a flashback of an argument between the three girls during their childhood that led to Daphne being pushed out of the treehouse and landing on her head, resulting in her current unstable mental state which causes her to believe the game they‚Äôre playing is real. In the present, Daphne has bound and gagged Petula and Tilda, having fully lost herself to the delusion that she is actually their mother. Daphne is visited by Detective Siegel, who knew all three girls when they were children, after he receives reports of screams coming from her home. Though Daphne's odd behavior makes him suspicious, he leaves after she reminds him that he doesn't have a search warrant. Daphne later gives Petula clues to the location and code of the safe, and promises to free the girls if she can find it. Petula succeeds and the girls escape, but are pursued by Daphne, who runs Petula over with her car before taking them back to her mansion. Daphne cuffs Petula to a chair and locks Tilda in a cage, forcing the latter to watch as she gives Petula a Glasgow smile. The next morning, Daphne tells them that the ‚Äúgame‚Äù has concluded and that they are free to leave, but also that she believes she has become pregnant from her faux sexual encounter with Petula. Realizing that this gives them new power over her, Petula restarts the game by convincing Daphne that she needs to be taken in for an emergency caesarean section. Just as the two girls are about to attack an unconscious Daphne with surgical tools, they are stopped by Spiegel, but Daphne wakes up and repeatedly stabs him. Tilda gleefully joins her, while Petula initially watches on in horror, but eventually joins the other two in bludgeoning him to death. They bury his body in Daphne‚Äôs yard before all three women return to living in the mansion and playing the game, their scars from the injuries inflicted by Daphne having miraculously disappeared. As Petula grows increasingly wary of her surroundings, it is eventually revealed that the entire movie has taken place within Daphne‚Äôs mansion - every event that occurred up until this point was merely a part of the game, which Tilda is in on as well - and that Petula has tried to escape several times, only to be punished each time by having her arms burned. This \\"round\\" of the game concludes when all three women pretend to commit suicide, only to begin again, showing Daphne as an old woman in a dilapidating house, suggesting that they have been playing for many years. Cast * Madeline Brewer as Daphne Peters/Mother * Imogen Waterhouse as Petula Thames/Doctor * Sarah Hay as Tilda Darlings/Daughter * Scott Cohen as Detective Siegel Background and casting Braid is the first feature film of Mitzi Peirone, who serves as both writer and director.

The film stars Gina Carano and Richard Dreyfuss. Plot Clair Hamilton is a military veteran whose son Charlie has been kidnapped. She brings a bag of money as ransom for Charlie but at the exchange she is double-crossed, leading to a shootout. Clair shoots two of the kidnappers but one of the men, Larsen, escapes. Clair falls into a frozen lake while chasing him but Larsen pulls her out because he was not planning to kill anyone and did not know about the plans to double-cross her. Clair has a peaceful encounter with a black wolf while recovering, then catches up with Larsen and forces him at gunpoint to take her to the leader of the kidnappers, Father, a man who is angry at her deceased father for closing a mill and leaving money owed to him. As they near the hideout in the snowy forest they are fired upon, but the rifleman is attacked and killed by three wolves. Clair finds the hideout but the kidnappers have moved on to a lodge on the other side of the mountain to await a hand-off to sell off the boy and Larsen reveals that Father killed his father and abducted Larsen and his mother when he was a boy. At the lodge Clair attempts to exchange the money and Larsen for Charlie. Father pulls out a concealed gun and shoots at Charlie but Larsen jumps in front of the bullet and is shot in the back. Clair shoots Father and the other kidnappers, then flees on a snowmobile pursued by the uninjured kidnapper Hobbs whose metal knife stopped the bullet Clair shot at her. Clair crashes her snowmobile and gets into a knife fight with Hobbs but is pushed over the edge of a waterfall and Charlie is captured again. Clair climbs out of the river and is guided into the forest by three wolves. She returns to the lodge, kills the injured kidnapper with a hatchet, and confronts Father, who is inside torturing Larsen with a red hot fire poker while confessing that he killed Larsen's mother after she left him. Charlie returns with Hobbs and Clair throws a knife into her throat. Larsen attacks Father but Father shoots him then turns the gun on Charlie as Clair leaps at Father and pushes him out a window. Clair thanks Larsen before he dies, then she climbs on a snowmobile and exchanges glances with the black wolf as it approaches before she escapes with Charlie. Father rises out of the snow as a pack of wolves descends on him and tears him apart. Three months later, in the spring, Clair and Charlie are hiking a path on the mountain when she sees the black wolf again and smiles.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"a subpar vehicle for an action star who deserves better\\" and wondered if Richard Dreyfuss \\"ever imagined he would be reduced to this sort of B-level material when winning an Academy Award for The Goodbye Girl and working for directors like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Paul Mazursky and Barry Levinson.\\" Courtney Howard of Variety.com called it a \\"female-led, capably-crafted actioner\\", writing that \\"the filmmakers adeptly blur the lines between the heroes and anti-heroes, constructing a dynamic, character-driven portrait of rage and redemption.\\" She concluded, \\"In an era of the 'Strong Female Character,' Hackl and Agiashvili‚Äôs iteration blessedly doesn‚Äôt rely on lazy screenwriting shorthand, nor does it pander to feminism with a simple gender-swap in its female-centered feature.

Murders  Zelich frequented S&M; websites under the alias ‚Äúmrhandcuffs‚Äù, where he searched for submissive sex slave partners. That's where he met his two victims, 19-year-old Jenny Gamez and 37-year-old Laura Simonson. Gamez was killed in Oregon in late 2012 and Simonson was killed in Minnesota mid 2013. Zelich claimed both died accidentally during sex. He admitted that after causing their deaths, he put their bodies into suitcases and hid them in his home. The suitcases were later put into the trunk of his vehicle, and then dumped along a Geneva, Wisconsin roadway in tall grass. On June 5, 2014, a highway worker discovered the pair of discarded suitcases. According to the subsequent criminal complaint, the more decomposed of the two bodies was partly concealed in black plastic garbage bags and had her hands bound behind her back with rope. The other body ‚Äúwas found with a rope wrapped around her neck, had a sexual ball gag strapped into her mouth with a collar and was naked.‚Äù Zelich, who had continued to use S&M; dating websites after the recovery of the bodies, was arrested on June 27, 2014.

Gamez was last seen by her family in Cottage Grove, Oregon in 2012 at which time she said she would be moving, and had not been reported missing. Walworth County released a composite sketch of Gamez, which led friends and family to identify her. The identification of Jenny Gamez was confirmed by dental records on June 28th, 2014. On the 25 of June 2014, Zelich was charged with two counts of hiding a corpse and given a million dollar bail. He was later charged with murder.  Trial and imprisonment  Zelich pleaded guilty to the murder of Jenny Gamez in early 2016. He received 35 years imprisonment. In February 2017, he was sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder of Laura Simonson. Zelich received another 10 years for the charges of hiding of corpses in October 2017.

From 1327 to 1344 he was Archbishop of Bremen, one of only two commoners to be elected to that office (the other was Johann Rode von Wale), resulting in an unusually good relationship between the city and the archbishopric during his tenure. Life From a family of citizens of Bremen, Grelle's father Volcmar was a member of the city council from 1296 to 1314. Burchard graduated MA at the University of Paris before becoming canon and then from 1310 archdeacon in R√ºstringen, where he was able to mediate between the city of Bremen and the inhabitants of R√ºstringen then living in Fehde. For a period he represented the archdiocese before the Roman Curia and after archbishop Jens Grand's death Pope John XXII appointed Burchard to the vacant archbishopric on 25 September 1327. He remained in the papal court in Avignon until 1328, receiving consecration as a bishop and the pallium. Politically he allied with the Curia against Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, with the pope working to weaken the Holy Roman Empire's power, though there are no known instances of Burchard openly acting against the Emperor.

Her work has appeared in Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Research  Feigenson's research explores the fundamental processes of human cognition and memory using infants and young children to test the limitations of theories related to the understanding of numbers. Many of her studies are related to numerical cognition, object-based attention, and short-term memory. One of Feigenson's studies involving a choice task with ten- and twelve-month-old infants examined how infants understand the concept of more and less. In this study, Feigenson concluded that these infants pay more attention to the total volume, or the surface area, of objects instead of viewing items individually. Feigenson watched infants crawl towards two containers containing crackers and choose crackers from one of the containers. She observed that infants tend to choose the container with more crackers or crackers with the larger surface area. Her study supports the hypothesis that infants are more likely to rely on object- file representations than one-to-one correspondence between the object files. Feigenson's study involving approximate number sense suggests that there is a relationship between early sense of number and later mathematical ability. In this study, she gave three- to five-year-old children a task that did not require symbol use or arithmetic calculation, while also testing their math ability and vocabulary size. Feigenson found a correlation between children's approximate number sense and their mathematical ability even after controlling for children's vocabulary size and math ability before they received formal math education. In another study, Feigenson examined the limits of infants' quantification of small object arrays, using a four-object array to examine how infants represent information. The study supports the three-item limit of parallel representation where infants tend to fail to discriminate arrays with greater than three items. There is an emphasis that infants depend on object- based attention and short-term memory to represent small numbers of objects. Feigenson concluded that the infants were knowledgeable about the array ‚Äì realizing that the cracker exists, the cracker-material, and the size of the individual objects within the array ‚Äì despite failing to represent the quantity \\"four\\".

State governments have responded to the suits against Smithfield and similar litigation by strengthening right-to-farm laws. Nuisance suits =North Carolina= About 500 plaintiffs in 29 cases have sued Smithfield Foods through its subsidiary Murphy-Brown alleging harm from odors and insects associated with anaerobic lagoons. As of July 2019, a federal judge required the two sides to take turns picking cases to establish a typical case value for use in a negotiated settlement. In April 2018, a jury in federal court awarded ten plaintiffs who lived close to a hog farm, Kinlaw Farms in Bladen County, with 15,000 animals a total of $750,000 in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages. Kinlaw Farms was not named in the suit. The farm passed all state regulatory investigations and was never the subject of a complaint from its neighbors until this lawsuit was filed. The award for punitive damages was adjusted downward as mandated by North Carolina law that caps punitive damages at a level equal to three times the award for compensatory damages, or $250,000, whichever is greater. Under this law total damages were reduced to $3.25 million. In July 2018, two plaintiffs, who were neighbors of a Smithfield operation in Duplin County, were awarded a $25 million verdict. The farm in question was owned by Joey Carter. This judgment was rendered despite the fact that the Carter farm had always met or exceeded the requirements of North Carolina's laws and regulations governing the raising of hogs, invested in modern technologies to aid in waste disposal, and responded to concerns raised by neighbors in a timely and responsible manner. Joey Carter was not sued. Joey Carter started raising hogs in 1984. Since then, dozens of people have constructed houses near his farm. One of his neighbors stated in court testimony, ‚ÄúThis farm is not a nuisance, it‚Äôs a blessing. Nobody‚Äôs closer than I am. There‚Äôs no issue here.‚Äù Another neighbor said in their testimony.\\" No plaintiff alleged medical issues or property damage from Carter's farm. One plaintiff alleged that the nutrients being used on the Carter property were drifting onto his property. Testing determined that actual source of his complaint was human waste from nearby septic systems. Immediately after this verdict, 1,000 to 1,600 people attended a rally on a Duplin County farm to support farmers in their struggle against nuisance suits. North Carolina's lieutenant governor, speaker of the house, agriculture commissioner, and a state legislator attended. In December 2018, eight plaintiffs who live near a contract farm in Sampson County won a verdict against Smithfield Foods. Four plaintiffs received $100 in compensatory damages. Two won $1,000 in compensatory damages. One received $25,000 in compensatory damages. One elderly female plaintiff who lived close to the farm and grew up nearby was awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages. A judge ruled that the plaintiffs did not provide enough evidence to justify the award of punitive damages. Before and during the trial, many residents of the area planted yard signs that read, \\"Stand for hog farmers.\\" In March 2019, a jury awarded only $440,000 to ten plaintiffs who allegedly suffered due to nuisances from a Smithfield operation in Duplin County that raised about 5,000 pigs. Smithfield appealed this judgment in the 4th United States Circuit Court of Appeals. Regarding the above appeal, Smithfield Foods stated in a press release: \\"These lawsuits are an abuse of our legal system, one that bypasses decisions made by lawmakers and regulators. As with the first three trials, the negative result is due in large measure to rulings by the court that our attorneys believe are incorrect. These errors skewed the evidence presented in favor of plaintiffs and prejudiced our ability to defend the case, our company, our industry, family farmers, and all agriculture.‚Äù Farm trade groups and sympathetic politicians have openly complained that these suits endanger their industry. North Carolina changed its right-to-farm law to further protect farmers from frivolous lawsuits. The language of the law was substantially altered to more narrowly and clearly define what qualifies as a nuisance while limiting when plaintiffs may be awarded punitive damages. Owners of the farms at the center of this dispute were not allowed to tell their side of the story due to a gag order that was in place until it was lifted by United States District Court Judge Earl Britt on September 3rd, 2018. Earl lifted the gag order, which he had imposed, right before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was able to rule on a petition to overturn it. The National Pork Council and the North Carolina Pork Council filed an amicus brief in support of the petition to the Court of Appeals. They argued that gag orders have to be carefully crafted to be constitutional, that there was no compelling need for such an order in these cases, and that the order issued was vague, overbroad, and ineffective. The jurors were not allowed to visit the farms in question or the areas around them in all of these cases. The cases presided over by Judge Earl Britt have ended with dramatically different verdicts than those heard by Judge David Faber. Bifurcation of compensatory and punitive damages Smithfield moved to bifurcate the issues of its liability for compensatory damages and its liability for punitive damages. This motion was granted on October 24th, 2018 by Senior United States District Judge David A. Faber.Bifurcation decision by Judge David A. Faber (24 October 2018) Research shows that bifurcating trials in this manner creates more uniform verdicts for compensatory damages and decreased the chance of juries awarding extremely high judgments for compensatory damages. Bifurcation also results in lower awards for compensatory damages in cases of involving minor or less severe injuries while resulting in higher awards for in cases where injuries are severe. Jurors report they feel they use evidence more appropriately in bifurcated trials. As of September 24, 2019, jurors in the cases mentioned above have awarded a total of $549,772,400 in damages. These damages have been reduced to $97.9 million in accordance with North Carolina's laws limiting punitive damages. Petitions In 1991, a petition signed by 25 residents of Duplin County asked for a hog facility to be built on a different location, but on the same parcel of land, than the one initially proposed on a building permit. This petition has been used as evidence by plaintiffs attorneys in at least two cases. Fifteen of the same residents signed a new petition in support of the farms. This petition was not allowed into evidence. Doug Pierson, a signer of both petitions, said, \\"We did sign the petition in 1991 and then built our house in 1992. It was mostly because of the fear of the unknown. Since then my wife walks with the dog every day and I run. We‚Äôve held engagement parties outside around our pool, we‚Äôve never had a problem with smell or anything.‚Äù =Appeals= Smithfield appealed the five verdicts from North Carolina. The five cases were consolidated at the appellate-level and are now known as Joyce McKiver, et al. v. Murphy-Brown, LLC. Twenty-one cases with about 500 plaintiffs will not be tried until this appeal is resolved. Arguments concluded on January 31, 2020. Judges have 90 days to issue a decision. The appeal was heard by the 4th United States Circuit Court of Appeals. Questionable evidentiary decisions made by Judge Earl Britt are an important part of the case. Britt allowed evidence that was entirely unrelated to the question of what, if any, damages were suffered by the plaintiffs and whether or not the respondent was responsible for them. For example, Britt allowed testimony about the compensation of and other senior managers to influence punitive damages, and he allowed the plaintiffs to use an expert witness but refused to allow the respondent to call their own expert on the same subject matter. The definition of \\"willful and wanton misconduct\\" applied by Britt is also at issue. Lawyers for Smithfield argued that none of the farms in these five cases had ever been cited for violations of state laws regulation hog farms and that none of the plaintiffs in these cases had ever complained about the issues for which they brought suit. Legislation The state legislature passed the North Carolina Farm Act of 2018 to help reduce the exposure of farmers to unreasonable litigation and high punitive damage awards. Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the act, but the legislature overrode his veto. The new law does not apply to lawsuits that have already been filed. =Insurance claims= In early 2019, Smithfield sued several of its insurance companies. Smithfield has filed suit against ACE American Insurance and Old Republic Insurance for breach of contract. It has also filed suit against ACE Property & Casualty Insurance, American Guarantee & Liability Insurance, Caitlin Underwriting Syndicate 2003, Endurance Risk Solutions Assurance, Great American Insurance Company of New York, St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance, XL Insurance America, and XL Specialty Insurance seeking trebled damages and legal fees for unfair claim settlement and deceptive business practices. Smithfield has filed claims with its insurers to recover its legal fees and judgments owed due to nuisance lawsuits filed in North Carolina. =Virginia= In February of 1978, Virginia's State Water Control Board sought civil penalties against Smithfield for failing to make improvements to mitigate wastewater discharge into the Pagan River in a timely manner. In June of that year, the state attorney general accepted an out-of-court settlement that included a $25,000 payment. In 1985, a federal judge in Richmond fined a Smithfield subsidiary about $1.2 million in a Clean Water Act suit filed by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Labor disputes The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a 15-year dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.Maher, Kris. \\"Firms Use RICO to Fight Union Tactics,\\" Wall Street Journal, December 10, 2007. After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the union called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal racketeering lawsuit against the union. The following year Smithfield and the union reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott in return for the company dropping its racketeering case and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the union.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"After 15 Years, North Carolina Plant Unionizes\\", The New York Times, December 13, 2008.

History In 1902, the Austrian bookbinders' union suggested organising an international conference of bookbinders, and this took place in Germany in 1904. The conference agreed to build closer relationships between the unions in attendance, and the Union of Bookbinders and Paper Workers of Germany issued a questionnaire on what form these should take. The responses were inconclusive, but the Austrian union was keen on forming an international federation, and in 1907, the German union agreed to host a founding conference in Nuremberg. The headquarters of the federation were established in Berlin, but in 1920 they moved to Bern. By 1925, the federation had 17 affiliates, with a total of 79,800 members, dropping to 42,072 in 1935. At this point, its largest affiliate was the British National Union of Printing, Bookbinding and Paper Workers, with other affiliates in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, France, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. In 1939, the federation agreed to merge with the Lithographers' International and the International Typographers' Secretariat. However, due to World War II, no progress was made until 1946, when the British Printing and Kindred Trades Federation established a committee which drafted a constitution for a merged organisation. This was established in 1949, as the International Graphical Federation.

As an educator, she serves as the Inuktitut Language Specialist and Cultural Arts teacher, supporting students in grades 7 through 12, at the Qarmartalik School in Resolute. Tanya Tagaq, notable Inuk throat-singer, referred to Kalluk as her \\"beautiful cousin.\\" (In Indigenous cultures throughout Canada, a cousin need not be a blood relative, and often refers to a close friendship or relationship.) Kalluk's throat-singing was featured in a documentary, The People Behind the Inukshuk, produced by the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, shaded in dark red. The Sweetest Kulu Kalluk's debut book, The Sweetest Kulu, illustrated by Alexanderia Neonakis,Sweetest Kulu is available in English, French, and Inuktitut. The Inuktitut edition has been published twice, in both Roman characters and Inuktitut syllabics. The book was first published in 2014. It features a poem for a newborn baby, Kulu; \\"Kulu\\" is a term of endearment for babies and young children in Inuktitut. Kulu is blessed with the animals of the Arctic. The book emphasizes traditional Inuit values of care and stewardship for nature, respect for animals, and connection to the Arctic land. The Sweetest Kulu received several awards upon publication. It was named Huffington Post's Best Bedtime Book of 2014 and won an award from the Worldcraft Circle of Native Writers and Storytellers for the Best Picture Book in 2015.

A telephone cable was also damaged, knocking out phone service for about 5-- customers. * 1991 On January 31, a Mobil Company crude oil pipeline ruptured near Valencia, California, spilling up to 75,000 gallons of crude oil. The same day, a report was released showing that particular pipeline had a 99.8% chance of a leak in the next 5 years. * 1991 On February 5, a backhoe hit a gas distribution line, next to apartments in Greendale, Wisconsin, causing an explosion & fire that killed 3 and injured 6 others. * 1991 Construction crews ruptured a propane pipeline, on March 2, forcing the evacuation of 2,500 from several subdivisions in Richland County, South Carolina for a time. There was no fire. * 1991 On March 3, a Lakehead (now Enbridge) crude oil pipeline, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, ruptured. More than 1,700,000 gallons of crude went into the Prairie River, of which about 1,672,000 were eventually recovered. About of oil had spilled from that pipeline from the early 1970s to 1991, per Minnesota records. A resident in the area noticed the smell of oil and alerted the local fire department. Approximately 300 people living in homes near the site were evacuated for safety, but were allowed to return to their homes later in the night. * 1991 On March 16, an anchor from a ship ruptured a Chevron Corporation pipeline offshore of El Segundo, California, spilling about 55,000 gallons of light oil. Wildlife was affected. * 1991 A Diamond Shamrock 10 inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in Knox City, Texas on June 8, spilling about 84,000 gallons of crude oil, with much of it entering the Brazos River. Heavy rains caused the pipeline to fail. * 1991 A bulldozer hit a Chevron Corporation crude oil pipeline near Park City, Utah, on June 27. About 126,000 gallons of crude oil were spilled. * 1991 On June 29, about 54,222 gallons of fuel oil and gasoline leaked from a 10-inch Koch Industries pipeline in Portage County, Wisconsin, from a 3-inch crack. A previous significant leak had occurred on this pipeline in that area the year before. Local officials urged Koch to upgrade its leak monitoring equipment, and, the Office of Pipeline Safety ordered this pipeline to be shut down until tested. Koch later replaced of that pipeline in the area. The original pipe was installed in 1988. * 1991 On June 30, an Amoco pipeline failed near Denver City, Texas, spilling 28,200 barrels of petroleum. The failure was caused by internal corrosion. * 1991 On July 17, workers were removing a corroded segment of the Consumers Power Company's (CP) 10-inch transmission line pipeline in Mapleton, Michigan. As a segment of the pipeline was being removed, natural gas at 360-psig pressure exerted about 12 tons of force on an adjacent closed valve (H-143), causing it and a short segment of connected pipe to move and separate from an unanchored compression coupling. The force of the escaping gas killed one worker (a welder), injured five other workers, and collapsed a steel pit that housed valve H-143. * 1991 On August 30, an earth mover hit a 16-inch ExxonMobil pipeline near Beaumont, Texas, causing a leaking that spilled about 19,000 gallons of crude oil.

Hasher is Professor Emerita in the Psychology Department at the University of Toronto and Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care. Hasher received the 1995-1996 James Mckeen Cattell Fellowship from the Association for Psychological Science. She was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 1986. Hasher is one of the authors of Working Memory and Human Cognition (1996).  Biography  Hasher received her Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Smith College. She received her Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1970, under the supervision of Leo Postman. Hasher held faculty positions at Carleton University, Temple University, and Duke University. In 1999, Hasher joined the faculty of the University of Toronto and the Rotman Research Institute. While at the University of Toronto, she became a Fellow of Massey College. Hasher retired in December 2017. Hasher is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, the Psychonomic Society, and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. She is a member of the Memory Disorders Research Society. Her research has been funded by the National Institute on Aging, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. She is married to David Goldstein, with whom she conducted research on the illusory truth effect. They have two children.  Research  Hasher's research career has focused on basic attentional processes, including inhibitory control, the role of attention in understanding language and remembering events, and how control of attention changes with age. Many of her seminal studies on attention and working memory were conducted in collaboration with Rose Zacks. Hasher's research team has explored circadian rhythms and the impact of sleep schedule on cognition and emotion. In a study exploring happiness in young adults and older adults, they found that older adults tended to report more positive emotions than younger adults, and were more likely to be morning-type people. Across groups, being a morning-type person was associated with higher rates of happiness. Another study asked how performance on tasks requiring attention varies in relation to the time of day. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), Hasher and her research team examined changes of neutral activity in the attention control network. Results showed that time of testing influenced task-related FMRI signals in older adults.  Awards  In 2009 Hasher presented the Paul B. Baltes Lecture at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities.  Representative publications  * Hasher, L., Goldstein, D., & Toppino, T. (1977).

It was directed and written by Karl Golden. The film stars Jonathan Byrne and Alex Reid as a jilted groom and waitress who make an unlikely alliance and embark on an unusual adventure in rural County Donegal.  Plot  Dubliner David (Jonathan Byrne) is left at the altar by his fianc√©e Fiona, who meets him to calls off the wedding saying she is reluctant to marry him. Returning to the wedding reception alone, he finds out he has been gifted a holiday cottage in Donegal as a wedding present. Meanwhile, Claire (Alex Reid) is getting ready for work on her birthday when her boyfriend Peter cancels their weekend plans so as to spend time with his wife and children, who do not know he is seeing Claire. She leaves on bad terms with him for her waitressing job. Leaving the wedding guests, David takes a bottle of champagne and drives to the airport, intending to go on his honeymoon alone, but gets drunk, missing the flight. Remembering the holiday cottage, he tries to convince a taxi driver to take him there, with no success. At work, Claire throws a drink on a customer and is fired. Her manager refuses to pay her. She attempts to take her wages from the till but is prevented from doing so. On the way to her car, she is approached by David who asks her to drive him to Donegal. She begrudgingly accepts after bargaining a price, including a few hundred euro and his wedding ring. They reach the cottage at night. David invites Claire to stay and to drive her to the bus stop the following day. She asks if she can stay for a few days but he refuses. Later she spies him crying in his bedroom. The next morning, David's car won't start and they are stranded at the cottage. David sprains his hand and Claire uses her pink scarf to bandage it. David unsuccessfully searches for help for his car while Claire visits the beach. Entering a neighbour's cottage, he is ambushed by the elderly owner brandishing a gun, thinking he is being robbed. As his clothes are wet, returning home, David changes into an outfit of Claire's. While drying his clothes, Claire finds a letter in his pocket. She reads and hides it. They have a picnic on a cliff, their relationship softening somewhat with David making her a birthday treat with sparklers. Peter phones Claire but she tells him she does not want to see him. Larry, a neighbour, visits, enquiring about an attempted robbery. He is taken aback by David's feminine attire and the pink scarf on his hand. David agrees to let Claire stay another night. They drink whiskey and Claire tries to lighten the mood. They dance to an old record but Claire spins David and he falls, breaking a lamp. They have a disagreement and he tells Claire to leave the next morning. The next day David apologises with a bouquet of wild flowers and tells Claire she can stay as long as she likes. He borrows her phone and calls Fiona to let her know where he is. David and Claire go swimming in the sea. They make a fire and get to know each other better. Claire reveals she removed a part from the car's engine so that she could stay longer. Once the part is back in the engine, David drives Claire to the bus station and on the way they encounter Larry. He invites them for lunch with him and his wife Mary. Mary convinces Claire to try on her wedding dress while Larry shows David his waterbed and tells him that he likes to try on his wife's clothes. David panics and he and Claire leave in a hurry, with Claire still wearing Mary's wedding dress. On the drive, Claire makes a smart comment and David stops the car and tells her to get out. They have a disagreement, ending with Claire throwing the car keys into the distance and walking away. Claire hitches a lift in a farm truck. Meanwhile, Peter unexpectedly arrives at the now empty cottage. David finds his keys in a field. He pulls in at a rural pub where the farm truck is parked outside. A traditional music session is on in the pub and David sees Claire. David and the truck driver get in an argument when he tries to talk to Claire. Also in the pub is the elderly neighbour. He accuses David of attempted robbery. A pub brawl ensues and to interrupt it, Claire releases a flock of sheep from the truck. The sheep run amok in the pub. The couple escape the scene and drive back to the cottage where Peter is waiting. He has left his wife and is angry to find Claire with David, assuming they are a couple. David stands up for Claire and Peter punches him in the face. Claire tells Peter to go home and he leaves. Later, they hear a knock on the door. Larry is hiding behind the door and he tackles David to the ground, accusing him of stealing his wife's wedding dress. Claire takes off the dress and gives it back to Larry. Afterwards, Claire and David share a romantic moment. The next morning, Claire goes to the shop to get breakfast. In the meantime, Fiona and Ben arrive at the cottage unexpectedly. When Claire returns, Fiona introduces herself as David's fianc√© and acts as if they are still together. David doesn't correct her. Fiona tries to write Claire a cheque to pay her back for the weekend's expenses and asks Claire for her wedding ring back. Claire says no. She then reads out the letter she found in David's pocket that reveals Fiona had been seeing her ex-boyfriend Ray. Claire storms out and Ben goes with her to bring her to the bus. David and Fiona have a talk about their relationship and Fiona asks David to marry her. David says that he can't marry her because he is in love with someone else. He drives to the town in a hurry to catch Claire. He thinks the bus has left and he is dejected, but she is on a different bus that hasn't left yet. They meet and share a romantic moment before walking away together. In the last scene in Claire's bedroom, he offers her back the wedding ring. She throws it out the window, saying it's just a ring.  Production  According to Variety, though the film does not proclaim to subscribe to Dogme 95 filmmaking movement, it was allegedly shot according to the movement's values. Most of the music in the film was by Ash, a Northern Irish rock band.  Reception  Leslie Felperin for Variety gave a positive review of The Honeymooners, calling the performances engaging and saying it \\"look[ed] a lot better than one would expect given its reported limited resources\\", though not impressed by the final act. Caroline Hennessy for RT√â called it \\"contrived but entertaining\\", hailing the use of digital video to \\"get right into the faces of the actors, which initially gives the film a great sense of immediacy although it does lag in the middle.\\" Hennessy thought it a promising debut for director Golden.

Fig. 1 - example web traffic with potentially anomalous points. In statistics, an anomaly (a.k.a. outlier) is an observation or event that deviates so much from other events to arouse suspicion it was generated by a different mean. For example, the graph in Fig.1 represents ingress traffic to a web server, expressed as the number of requests in 3-hours intervals, for a period of one month. It is quite evident by simply looking at the picture that some points (marked with a red circle) are unusually high, to the point of inducing suspect that the web server might have been under attack at that time. On the other hand, the flat segment indicated by the red arrow also seems unusual and might possibly be a sign that the server was down during that time period. Anomalies in a big dataset may follow very complicated patterns, which are difficult to detect ‚Äúby eye‚Äù in the great majority of cases. This is the reason why the field of anomaly detection is well suited for the application of Machine Learning techniques. The most common techniques employed for anomaly detection are based on the construction of a profile of what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù: anomalies are reported as those instances in the dataset that do not conform to the normal profile. Isolation Forest uses a different approach: instead of trying to build a model of normal instances, it explicitly isolates anomalous points in the dataset. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility of exploiting sampling techniques to an extent that is not allowed to the profile-based methods, creating a very fast algorithm with a low memory demand.  History  The Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm was initially proposed by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting and Zhi-Hua Zhou in 2008. The authors took advantage of two quantitative properties of anomalous data points in a sample: # Few - they are the minority consisting of fewer instances and # Different - they have attribute-values that are very different from those of normal instances Since anomalies are \\"few and different\\", they are easier to ‚Äúisolate‚Äù compared to normal points. Isolation Forest builds an ensemble of ‚ÄúIsolation Trees‚Äù (iTrees) for the data set, and anomalies are the points that have shorter average path lengths on the iTrees. In a later paper, published in 2012 the same authors described a set of experiments to prove that iForest: * has a low linear time complexity and a small memory requirement * is able to deal with high dimensional data with irrelevant attributes * can be trained with or without anomalies in the training set * can provide detection results with different levels of granularity without re-training In 2013 Zhiguo Ding and Minrui Fei proposed a framework based on iForest to resolve the problem of detecting anomalies in streaming data. More application of iForest to streaming data are described in papers by Tan et al., Susto et al. and Weng et al. One of the main problems of the application of iForest to anomaly detection was not with the model itself, but rather in the way the ‚Äúanomaly score‚Äù was computed. This problem was highlighted by Sahand Hariri, Matias Carrasco Kind and Robert J. Brunner in a 2018 paper, wherein they proposed an improved iForest model named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF). In the same paper the authors describe the improvements made to the original model and how they are able to enhance the consistency and reliability of the anomaly score produced for a given data point.  Algorithm  alt= At the basis of the Isolation Forest algorithm there is the tendency of anomalous instances in a dataset to be easier to separate from the rest of the sample (isolate), compared to normal points. In order to isolate a data point the algorithm recursively generates partitions on the sample by randomly selecting an attribute and then randomly selecting a split value for the attribute, between the minimum and maximum values allowed for that attribute. Fig. 3 - an example of isolating an anomalous point in a 2D Gaussian distribution. An example of random partitioning in a 2D dataset of normally distributed points is given in Fig. 2 for a non-anomalous point and Fig. 3 for a point that's more likely to be an anomaly. It is apparent from the pictures how anomalies require fewer random partitions to be isolated, compared to normal points. From a mathematical point of view, recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure named Isolation Tree, while the number of partitions required to isolate a point can be interpreted as the length of the path, within the tree, to reach a terminating node starting from the root. For example, the path length of point xi in Fig. 2 is greater than the path length of xj in Fig. 3. More formally, let X = { x1, ..., xn } be a set of d-dimensional points and X‚Äô ‚äÇ X a subset of X. An Isolation Tree (iTree) is defined as a data structure with the following properties: # for each node T in the Tree, T is either an external-node with no child, or an internal-node with one ‚Äútest‚Äù and exactly two daughter nodes (Tl, Tr) # a test at node T consists of an attribute q and a split value p such that the test q < p determines the traversal of a data point to either Tl or Tr. In order to build an iTree, the algorithm recursively divides X‚Äô by randomly selecting an attribute q and a split value p, until either (i) the node has only one instance or (ii) all data at the node have the same values. When the iTree is fully grown, each point in X is isolated at one of the external nodes. Intuitively, the anomalous points are those (easier to isolate, hence) with the smaller path length in the tree, where the path length h(xi) of point x_i \\\\in X is defined as the number of edges xi traverses from the root node to get to an external node. A probabilistic explanation of iTree is provided in the iForest original paper.  Properties of isolation forest  * Sub-sampling: since iForest does not need to isolate all of normal instances, it can frequently ignore the big majority of the training sample. As a consequence, iForest works very well when the sampling size is kept small, a property that is in contrast with the great majority of existing methods, where large sampling size is usually desirable. * Swamping: when normal instances are too close to anomalies, the number of partitions required to separate anomalies increases, a phenomenon known as swamping, which makes it more difficult for iForest to discriminate between anomalies and normal points. One of the main reasons for swamping is the presence of too many data for the purpose of anomaly detection, which implies one possible solution to the problem is sub-sampling. Since iForest respond very well to sub-sampling in terms of performance, the reduction of the number of points in the sample is also a good way to reduce the effect of swamping. * Masking: when the number of anomalies is high it is possible that some of those aggregate in a dense and large cluster, making it more difficult to separate the single anomalies and, in turn, to detect such points as anomalous. Similarly to swamping, this phenomenon (known as ‚Äúmasking‚Äù) is also more likely when the number of points in the sample is big, and can be alleviated through sub-sampling. * High Dimensional Data: one of the main limitation to standard, distance-based methods is their inefficiency in dealing with high dimensional datasets:. The main reason for that is, in a high dimensional space every point is equally sparse, so using a distance- based measure of separation is pretty ineffective. Unfortunately, high- dimensional data also affects the detection performance of iForest, but the performance can be vastly improved by adding a features selection test like Kurtosis to reduce the dimensionality of the sample space. * Normal Instances Only: iForest performs well even if the training set does not contain any anomalous point, the reason being that iForest describes data distributions in such a way that high values of the path length h(xi) correspond to the presence of data points. As a consequence, the presence of anomalies is pretty irrelevant to iForest's detection performance.  Anomaly detection with isolation forest  Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest is a process composed of two main stages: # in the first stage, a training dataset is used to build iTrees as described in previous sections. # in the second stage, each instance in the test set is passed through the iTrees build in the previous stage, and a proper ‚Äúanomaly score‚Äù is assigned to the instance using the algorithm described below Once all the instances in the test set have been assigned an anomaly score, it is possible to mark as ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù any point whose score is greater than a predefined threshold, which depends on the domain the analysis is being applied to. = Anomaly score = The algorithm for computing the anomaly score of a data point is based on the observation that the structure of iTrees is equivalent to that of Binary Search Trees (BST): a termination to an external node of the iTree corresponds to an unsuccessful search in the BST. As a consequence, the estimation of average h(x) for external node terminations is the same as that of the unsuccessful searches in BST, that is c(m) = \\\\begin{cases} 2H(m-1)-\\\\frac{2(m-1)}{n} & \\\\text{for }m>2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{for }m=2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} where n is the testing data size, m is the size of the sample set and H is the harmonic number, which can be estimated by H(i)=ln(i)+\\\\gamma, where \\\\gamma=0.5772156649 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The value of c(m) above represents the average of h(x) given m, so we can use it to normalise h(x) and get an estimation of the anomaly score for a given instance x: s(x,m)=2^\\\\frac{-E(h(x))}{c(m)} where E(h(x)) is the average value of h(x) from a collection of iTrees. It is interesting to note that for any given instance x: * if s is close to 1 then x is very likely to be an anomaly * if s is smaller than 0.5 then x is likely to be a normal value * if for a given sample all instances are assigned an anomaly score of around 0.5, then it is safe to assume that the sample doesn't have any anomaly  Extended isolation forest  As described in the previous sections, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs very well from both the computational and the memory consumption points of view. The main problem with the original algorithm is that the way the branching of trees takes place introduce a bias, which is likely to reduce the reliability of the anomaly scores for ranking the data. This is the main motivation behind the introduction of the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) algorithm by Hariri et al.left In order to understand why the original Isolation Forest suffers from that bias, the authors provide a practical example based on a random dataset taken from a 2-D normal distribution with zero mean and covariance given by the identity matrix. An example of such a dataset is shown in Fig. 4. It is easy to understand by looking at the picture that points falling close to (0, 0) are likely to be normal points, while a point that lies far away from (0, 0) is likely to be anomalous. As a consequence, the anomaly score of a point should increase with an almost circular and symmetric pattern as the point move radially outward the ‚Äúcentre‚Äù of the distribution. This is not the case in practice as the authors demonstrate by generating the anomaly score map produced for the distribution by the Isolation Forest algorithm. Although the anomaly scores correctly increase as the points move radially outward, they also generate rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions, compared to other points that fall roughly at the same radial distance from the centre. Fig. 5 - random partitioning with EIF It is possible to demonstrate that these unexpected rectangular regions in the anomaly score map are indeed an artifact introduced by the algorithm and are mainly due to the fact that the decision boundaries of Isolation Forest are limited to be either vertical or horizontal (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). This is the reason why in their paper, Hariri et al. propose to improve the original Isolation Forest in the following way: rather than selecting a random feature and value within the range of data, they select a branch cut that has a random ‚Äúslope‚Äù. An example of random partitioning with EIF is shown in Fig. 5. The authors show how the new approach is able to overcome the limits of the original Isolation Forest, eventually leading to an improved anomaly score map.

According to Canggal inscription (dated 732 CE), the island of Java had long been under the rule of this wise and virtuous king. However, the kingdom fell into disunity after his death. Amid a period of violence and confusion Sanjaya, son of Sannaha (the sister of Sanna) ascended to the throne, and established the Kingdom of Mataram. He was named as Prabu Sanna or Bratasena in Carita Parahyangan (a book composed around late 16th-century CE). According to Carita Parahyangan, Sanna was the King of Galuh that was usurped by his cousin, Purbasora. In this book, Sanjaya is described as the son of Sanna, rather than his nephew. So, to avenge his father's defeat, Sanjaya attacked Galuh with a special force and killed Purbasora along with his family. Afterwards, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and began to rule Java.

Biography Danilo Stevanoviƒá was born on 20 May 1815 in Timi»ôoara. He was the son of Jovan Stevanoviƒá, a Poreƒç timberman, and a brother to prominent politician Tenka Stefanoviƒá. Stefanoviƒá was educated in Poreƒç, Po≈æarevac, and Belgrade. After his education, he learned the tertiary craft and then began his trade. In 1838 Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá appointed him head of the Poreƒç-Rijeka district, and as early as 1839 he became assistant to the head person of the Krajina district. He was transferred to Zajeƒçar in 1844 for an assistant to the mayor, and in 1848 he was appointed the chief of a district. Subsequently, he was transferred in 1852 to the mayor of the ƒåaƒçak district, and in 1856 to the mayor of the fire district. In 1859, Prince Milo≈° appointed him a member of the State Council, and Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá confirmed him in 1860. The Old Council was abolished in 1869, but Danilo was appointed a member of the new State Council on September 20, 1869. In February 1875 Aƒáim ƒåumiƒá resigned as Prime Minister and Stevanoviƒá was given the mandate to form a new government, serving as the Minister of the Interior as well. He did not like the Nominal Constitution of 1869, according to which the National Assembly had quite wide powers to draft laws and Stefanoviƒá dislike ke the fact that the composition of a village assembly of mostly illiterate deputies drafted laws and that ministers had to respond to the interpellations before such an assembly. Because he looked old-fashioned, he was known as \\"Uncle Danilo\\". Prince Milan Obrenoviƒá chose mostly younger conservatives for the government, but the majority-liberal assembly opposed the ministers and the government. Daniloviƒá himself was not a politician but a bureaucrat, and in doing so he was to suppress the heated political passions between conservatives and liberals, and his government was called \\"a ministry of reconciliation and goodwill.\\" Stefanoviƒá's government largely engaged in current affairs and avoided any major political issues. However, the political altercation of the Liberal Majority caused the Conservatives to obstruct the Assembly, and the Government barely welcomed this as a reason for the dissolution of the Assembly. Herzegovina uprising (1875‚Äì1877) or the Nevesinje rifle erupted during the government of Danilo Stefanoviƒá. The government allowed volunteers rallies to assist the rebels in Herzegovina and provided them with weapons from military warehouses, and transferred some of the forces across the border. Police persecution Following the dissolution of the assembly, the government sought to force a conservative majority in the assembly in a new election. Since Danilo was the interior minister and an experienced police officer, it was expected that he would have more success than Aƒáim ƒåumiƒá had in a similar attempt a year earlier. On the eve of the election of 15 August 1875, Danilo returned several old clerks to the service and gave the mayors instructions as to who should be elected MP. Danilo's police persecuted or imprisoned opposition MPs and arrested those who agitated for the opposition. However, the elections were again won by the Liberals which made the prince to decide to form the Liberal government of Stevƒça Mihailoviƒá in August 1875. Danilo retired from public duty in 1879.

He is considered one of the pioneers of oceanographic studies in his native country. He was an accomplished academic, administrator and scientist.  Biography  Rafael Antonio Curra was born on February 14, 1934 in Ciudad Bol√≠var, in the Venezuelan Guiana region. A natural son and only child of a humble seamstress named Justina Antonia Curra, his mother took him to Caracas at an early age in search for a better life. He was a disciple of distinguished teachers such as Elena Mart√≠nez, Alonso Gamero Reyes, Francisco Tamayo and Josefina Lopez Ruiz, and was part of an extraordinary generation of professionals in the sciences of the sea and other aquatic spaces that included Fernando Cervigon, Jose Celestino Flores, Francisco Mago Leccia, Pedro Roa Morales, Rafael Mart√≠nez Escarbassiere, Gilberto Rodr√≠guez, Pablo Mandazen Soto (Brother Gines), Evelyn Zoppi, among others. He studied at the Miguel Antonio Caro Teacher School, in the Caracas parish of Sucre, where he obtained a teacher's degree in 1952, which allowed him to obtain a job as Principal at the Ca√±ada de la Iglesia Evening School in Ca√±o Amarillo. He completed his college degree at the Pedagogical Institute of Caracas where he graduated with honors in Biology and Chemistry in 1957. In addition to being widely recognized for the many achievements at such an early age, Rafael Antonio Curra stood out for his virtuosity with the Venezuelan cuatro. Rafael Antonio Curra married his college sweetheart and colleague Luisa Antonia Lava Sanchez in 1961. She was the second daughter of wildlife breeder Pio Lava Boccardo, an Italian immigrant who managed zoological parks in Maracaibo and Maracay, and was the founding director of the first Caracas zoo, in 1945. He had three children: Luisa Alejandra (born in Edinburgh in 1962), Rafael Andr√©s (born in Caracas in 1963) and Miguel Antonio (born in Caracas in 1965). His wife died at the Military Hospital of Caracas in 1966, as a result of acute renal failure.  Advanced studies  After the Venezuelan Association for the Advancement of Science (AsoVAC) was founded in 1950 under the direction of the distinguished physician and academic Francisco De Venanzi, the concern for creating an oceanographic research center in Venezuela arose. An ambitious human resource training program allowed him to obtain a scholarship and attend first the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1958, and then the University of California at Los Angeles where he received the master's degree in Marine biology in 1960. In 1961, with the support of the doctor Luis Manuel Pe√±alver, founding rector of Universidad de Oriente, he began studies of ichthyology at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, where he obtained a PhD degree in 1963 for the doctoral thesis entitled \\"Ionic regulation in Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet): Studies on the morphology, histochemistry and electrical properties of isolated gills\\" that presented the results of his research on European crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), a threatened endemic species of the British Isles.  Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela  The Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela was created as a Branch of Universidad de Oriente by Presidential Executive Order 459 signed by interim President Edgar Sanabria on November 21, 1958. The institute began its work in the facilities of the Marine Biology Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture in Caig√ºire, Sucre state, and moved to its definitive headquarters at the Universidad de Oriente main campus in the city of Cumana, in 1963. Rafael Antonio Curra was part of the initial staff of researchers of the institute. In mid-1963 he was appointed Head of the Department of Marine Biology of the Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela where he developed a creative work organizing seminars, expeditions, courses and workshops, and stimulating his colleagues, publications and attendance at national and international conferences. He was the editor of the Lagena scientific publication at the Oceanographic Institute since its creation in 1963. In 1967 he was appointed Director of the Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela where he promoted relations with the main universities in the world, which allowed the arrival of foreign researchers to reinforce the faculty with a view to imparting postgraduate studies in marine sciences. His outstanding role at the Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela, growing national and international prestige, and the great respect and admiration gained among colleagues and other collaborators at Universidad de Oriente placed him as frontrunner to occupy the positions of Dean and Rector of his university.  Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission  The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, IOC/UNESCO, is an organization founded by UNESCO founded in 1961 whose main function is to promote and coordinate the study of oceanography throughout the world. In 1968, cooperative investigations of the Caribbean Sea and adjacent regions were initiated with the participation of 18 countries with interest in the area, carrying out physical, chemical, geological and biological oceanography and fisheries work. In compliance with IOC/UNESCO Resolution V-5, and by appointment of President Raul Leoni, the first Venezuelan representation to the International Coordination Group for Cooperative Investigations in the Caribbean Sea and Adjacent Regions (CICAR) was designated in 1968. Rafael Antonio Curra, as director of the Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela, was appointed National Group Coordinator. The group was made up by the highly regarded deputy coordinators: Fernando Cervig√≥n of the Marine Research Station of La Salle Foundation of Natural Sciences; Gilberto Rodr√≠guez of the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research; Francisco Mago Leccia of the Institute of Tropical Zoology of Universidad Central de Venezuela; Captain Ramiro Perez Luciani of the Hydrography and Navigation Department of the Venezuelan Navy; and Jose Heredia Osio of the Fisheries Office of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Death  Commemorative plaque for the 50th anniversary of the Pan Am Flight 217 tragedy. On the night of Thursday, December 12, 1968, Pan Am Flight 217 covering the route between New York City and Caracas plunged into the Caribbean Sea at 10:02 at night during its final approach to the Maiquet√≠a International Airport, causing the death of all its occupants. The Boeing 707-321B with registration N494-PA and named \\"Clipper Malay\\" was carrying 42 passengers and 9 crew members. The cause of the crash was believed to be pilot error, as a result of an optical illusion created by the lights of the city on an upslope. This caused the plane to crash into the sea and explode on impact, killing all on board. Rafael Antonio Curra was returning to his country after establishing academic exchange agreements with authorities of the University of Rhode Island on behalf of Universidad de Oriente. On December 12, 2018, family and friends of the victims of the Pan Am Flight 217 gathered at 301 West 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the tragedy, and deposited 51 flowers onto the waters of the Hudson River in memory of the victims. A commemorative plaque with the names of all passengers and crew members was handed over to the administration of the John F. Kennedy International Airport, former Pan American Airlines base and where the ill- fated flight originated.  Tributes and distinctions  Upon confirmation of the death of Rafael Antonio Curra, the Board of Trustees of Universidad de Oriente agreed to declare three days of mourning, and order to raise the university flag at half-mast in all its university campuses. As a posthumous tribute, the library of the Oceanographic Institute of Venezuela, located on the main campus of Universidad de Oriente in Cumana, bears his name. The prominent Hindu philologist E. Kandaswamy Ganesan described and dedicated a kind of native benthic seaweed from the Venezuelan coast as Amphiroa currae Ganesan (1971) in posthumous tribute.  Publications  * Curra, R. A.

No such federation was created, but further meetings were held in Paris in 1889, Zurich in 1893, and London in 1896. The International Federation of Hatters was established in 1900, initially based in Paris. Its headquarters moved to Altenburg in 1906, Monza in 1921, and back to Paris in the early 1930s. One of the smaller global union federations, by 1925, it had 13 affiliates with a total of 57,077 members. By 1936, it had affiliates in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It appears to have dissolved at the start of World War II.

His father inherited Stevens House, the historic home of his grandfather, Maj. Gen. Ebenezer Stevens. Among his siblings was Albert Gallatin Stevens, Frances Mary Stevens (wife of Rev. Uriah Tracy), Byam K. Stevens Jr. (who married Elizabeth Langdon Wilks, sister of Matthew Astor Wilks) His maternal grandfather was Albert Gallatin, the 4th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and France. His paternal grandparents were Major General Ebenezer Stevens and Lucretia (n√©e Ledyard) Sands Stevens. From his grandmother's first marriage to Richardson Sands (younger brother of Joshua and Comfort Sands), she was the grandmother of fellow banker Samuel Stevens Sands. Among his many prominent relatives was uncle Alexander Hodgdon Stevens, a surgeon, and his first cousins, Lucretia Stevens (n√©e Rhinelander) Jones, the mother of author Edith Wharton. He was educated at Huddard's School in New York City, entering Yale College in 1850 where he graduated four years later in 1854. Career Beginning in January 1855 he served as a cashier's clerk in the Bank of Commerce in New York City, under his uncle, John Austin Stevens, the president of the Bank. After two months of travelling in Cuba, he became a clerk in his brother's store in New York City in May 1856. In early 1857, his elder brother Albert took him into partnership under Stevens, Angelo & Company, and they ran a sugar commission business with Cuba until 1868. In July of the 1868, he became cashier of the Gallatin National Bank of New York (which was founded by John Jacob Astor and which his grandfather had been the first president). He served as cashier until April 1880 when he became vice-president of the Bank. In 1890, he was elected president of the Sixth National Bank. When the Sixth National Bank consolidated with the Astor National Bank in 1899, he became vice-president. He served alongside Thomas Cochran as vice-president of the Astor National Bank (later the Astor Trust Company) until his death in 1916. Stevens also served as president of the Samuel Stevens Realty Company (which had been in the family since its creation by his uncle Samuel Stevens) and was a director of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. He was a member of the Sons of the Revolution, founded by his cousin John Austin Stevens. Personal life On December 4, 1860, Stevens was married to Mary Alleyne Otis (1833‚Äì1918) in Hartford, Connecticut. Mary was the daughter of William Foster Otis and Emily (n√©e Marshall) Otis, and the granddaughter of U.S. Senator Harrison Gray Otis.

Grossman was born in New York City in 1927. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1946, then attended Haverford College, graduating in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to attend Harvard, earning a Master of Arts degree in 1949. Grossman then returned to New York City, where he lived for the rest of his life. From 1951 to 1961, he edited East Europe magazine, the journal of the National Committee for a Free Europe, an anti-communist Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front organization,. In 1959, he published his first novel, Acrobat Admits (1959). It was an early example of the wave of Black comedy that swept through American fiction in the early 1960s. In the book, a handsome New Yorker seduces two different women, falls for one, and murders a man. \\"Mine,\\" he told The New York Times reviewer Anthony Boucher, \\"is that country where the frontier between the possible and the not possible is unmarked.\\" Boucher found the book unsuccessful but \\"dazzling and delightful.\\" Most reviewers found it slick and amoral, but Marvin Mudrick, in a Hudson Review roundup of a dozen novels, called it \\"the most perverse and in many ways the most promising of the dozen.\\" In 1961, after he married Celestia Martinez y Cardeza, who was a successful travel agent, he quit to become a full-time writer. He was, however, frustrated in his attempts to interest an American publisher in his second novel, Many Slippery Errors. It was finally accepted by U. K. publisher Heinemann and published in 1963. Grossman's protagonist, Charles Kraft works as a demographer for the United Nations but quietly attempts to subvert the aims of his conventional world. He takes of up with gang of Brooklyn hoodlums, has an affair with one of its female members, conspires to blow up a city power plant, and allows his wife to find him in bed with his own sister. \\"...[W]e must live in a tension between the commands of society and the demands of the individual, not acceding wholly to one or the other,\\" he remarks at one point. Reviewing the book in the Manchester Guardian, Andrew Leslie wrote that Grossman was an \\"expert at picking up the shorthand messages of the metropolitan scene.\\" In The Times Literary Supplement, David Williams called it \\"a fable designed to illuminate the unease and vacuity of modern life, with its sell-or-bust compulsions.\\" The book was then picked up by Doubleday and published in the U. S.. \\"This new humorous temper,\\" wrote Martin Levin in the New York Times, \\"is cool, existential, telegraphic in style--and funny. It substitutes deadpan comment for the moral judgment and is as different from the comic spirit of a decade ago as bop was from Dixieland.\\" He criticized Grossman for creating characters that were shells, but considered them \\"beautifully decorated shells, and the author manipulates them in a masterful game of his own invention.\\" Marie Beginning (1965) was Grossman's third novel. Grossman's heroine, Marie Betty Svobodna, conducts guerrilla warfare against conventions using nothing more than bravado and bare-faced truth as her weapons. \\"Her career is a parody of the American dream of success,\\" Anthony Ward wrote. Ward called it \\"a very good novel\\" and wrote that Grossman was \\"inventive in a way few contemporary English writers are.\\" In a The Times Literary Supplement review titled \\"Poor Girl Bests Fascist Beast,\\" Martin Seymour-Smith wrote, \\"Mr Grossman's extravagance and apparent zaniness are deceptive: although this is a comic novel, it is securely built on carefully planned and serious foundations.\\" The Do-Gooders (1968) was Grossman's last novel. In it, he brought back the title character from Marie Beginning, now widowed and wealthy and eager to act as an agent of chaos on a larger scale, inciting riots and blowing holes in 12-lane freeways. In a featured The New York Times review, John Leonard wrote, \\"His locales are always urban, his characters usually trapped, and his style a pastiche of sex, puns, parodies and razor-wounds that gets funnier as the situation gets more desperate.\\" Leonard quoted Anthony Burgess, who called Grossman \\"one of the most brilliant of the younger American novelists,\\" whose work was \\"vital, idiosyncratic, crammed with living characters and real dialogue.\\" Leonard wrote with anticipation, \\"Grossman has the wit, talent, imagination, intelligence and moral vision to terrify and transform. I'm waiting for more.\\" Instead, Grossman was soon forced to return to full-time work out of financial need. Around the time that The Do-Gooders was published, Grossman was included in a Chicago Tribune feature, \\"Ten Neglected American Writers Who Deserve to be Better Known.\\" He told the reporter, Lois Cantor, \\"I've never made more than piddling sums, not counting a $2,000 advance on movie rights to one book, which fell through. So one just turns one's face to the wall.\\" Soon after, Grossman went to work as a staff editor of The New York Times Encyclopedic Almanac. He divorced his first wife and married Althea Van Boskirk, who also worked on the almanac, in 1972. Grossman never published another book. A 1981 The New York Times article titled, \\"Life's Ironies Taunt a Manhattan Novelist,\\" revealed that Grossman had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1976 and was living alone, confined to a wheelchair, dependent upon Medicaid and Social Security. Although he had lost the ability to type, he was still writing, composing in his head, then taping his mental draft. He said he had finished on a novel taken from a line in the Book of Job, about a New Yorker who communicates with an alien spacecraft, but had been unable to find a publisher for it. When Strand Bookstore employee Burt Britton solicited a self portrait sketch in 1975, Grossman provided an awkward circle with the caption, \\"E = MC2\\" and a scrawled signature. He died in 1987.

One of the earliest recorded sabres of this type was recovered from an Avar grave in Romania dating to the mid 7th century. Although minor variations occur in size and hilt, they are common enough in design across 5 centuries that individual blades are difficult to date when discovered without other context. These swords measured between 30 and 40 inches in blade length and bore a gentle curve, leading to a pointed tip useful for thrusting. They were designed for use on horseback and neighboring peoples frequently encountered these blades at the hands of Turkic raiders. A common feature of the hilts was a 'bend' just below the pommel. This is partly due to construction of the pommel and tang and partly a feature interned to aid a mounted warrior swing the weapon at an opponent. The hilt bore short quillions that often swept slightly forward, but could also be straight. Just after this, the hand guard on the forte of the blade lay a feature typically of copper or iron called tunkou in China. This was made as a sleeve of metal to wrap around the blade, designed to aid the sword sealing into the scabbard. Some early tunkou of high status swords were gilded and decorated with patterns. Later swords that descended from these blades bore non functional tunkou that were ornamental and at times just etched onto the blades. Influence on Later Swords Chinese Swords: Prior to the 13th century Chinese swords were both single and double edged but were always straight. The Mongol invasion and subsequent Yuan Dynasty brought with it the Turkic influenced curved sabres, which eventually lead to the development and adoption of curved types of Dao family of swords (initially called Peidao). Traces of the Turko-Mongol heritage were notable in the liuyedao, persisting into the Qing dynasty where it retained design elements such as blade shape and tunkou. Islamic Swords: Early Arab swords were all straight and mostly double edged (similar to european arming swords blades). Although Turko-Mongol Sabres have been found among a turkic slave of the Samanid Empire, straight swords continued to be more popular outside of certain groups (such as the Seljuks) as that was the traditional style of sword the Prophet Mohammad wore. After the Mongol invasion, across the Muslim world, in the 13th century, the curved designs became more popular in particular with the Ottomans in Anatolia. The Ottomans continued to use curved swords, developing them further until they distinguished a distinct heavy-bladed version which would become the Kilij in the first half of the 15th Century. The Mongol style sabers continued to remain in use in Persia until the late 16th century, at which point they developed into the recognizable Shamshir. The Mughul invasion of Afghanistan and India brought these sabres to the subcontinent which developed into the Pulwar and Talwar respectively in the 16th century. While these Islamic blades often retained tunkou showing their Turko-mongol heritage, even by the 15th century the device had become a stylized decorative element. The Ottoman Yataghan, while not bearing a traditional curved sabre blade, did still bear the tunkou indicating their turko-mongol heritage. Saber from the nomadic burial of the South Russian steppes. 11-13th century. Three 17th century swords with influence from the Turko-Mongol line: the North African Nimcha, the Indian Tulwar, and the Polish Szabla (Bator√≥wka). European Swords: Eastern Europe had long had contact with nomadic steppe groups such as the Avars, Alans and Cumans. While Western Europe was still focused primarily on straight bladed longswords and arming swords during the medieval period to combat the heavy armor that was being used in European warfare, the arrival of Turkic warfare, first with the Mongols and secondly with the Ottomans, influenced warfare and armaments in Eastern Europe. *The Byzantine Army employed a sword called the paramerion, which is considered to be a type of sabre, from the 11th century if not earlier. The Byzantines had close contact with various Turkic steppe peoples, Khazars, Pechenegs, Cumans etc., from which the paramerion may have derived. Later Byzantine images, from the 14th century onwards, show very curved swords with a yelman, that are similar to early examples of the Turkish kilij.Dawson, Timothy (2007) Byzantine Infantryman, Eastern Roman Empire c.900‚Äì1204, Osprey, Oxford , , p. 25. *Russia had an earlier history of straight swords from the earlier viking age, but starting in the 10th century, the Saber was adopted as well. From the 10th through 13th centuries Saber use spread from southeastern Russia and made its way northward. Finds prior to the Mongol invasion show almost, but not quite, as many sabres as straight swords in use in Russia during these three centuries. *In the Caucasus, the Cossacks developed the Turko-Mongol saber into a distinct version called the Shashka by the 12th century. *Poland too adopted this type of sword design in the Szabla starting in the late 16th century. Indeed, these Hungarian and Polish examples of sword and cavalry would become so effective that the great Powers of Europe would later take from this design in the development of the modern period cavalry sabre which exists in uniform dress of many armies to this very day. * In Germany, encounters with the encroaching Turks caused modifications of the langes messer which eventually brought about the dusack in the mid 16th Century.

Work  Dr. Samek's work on various economics topics, including charitable giving, education, and health, includes over 100 academic publications. = Charitable giving = Samek's work in charitable giving, among other topics, looks at what affects the decisions of donors in the act of giving.  Social pressure effect  Samek and Chuan explored how the manipulation of allowing a donor to give a card along with their donation, an act meant to add meaning to the transaction, affects their giving rates. It was discovered that this manipulation caused a social pressure effect as \\"small donors feel that they should be donating more\\" and thus refrains them from donating all together.  Selective recognition  In 2013, Samek and Sheremeta investigated how the act of recognizing donors affects the extent of contributions to public goods. They found that recognizing all or solely the lowest donors significantly increases contributions, while recognizing the highest donors has no effect on the extent of contribution at all. It was concluded from the study that \\"aversion from shame\\" is more powerful than \\"anticipation of prestige\\". = Education = Among other papers, Samek's work analyzes how different modes of education can effect early childhood learning and adult financial decision-making.  Improving financial literacy  Samek, along with Lusardi, Kapteyn, Glinert, Hung, and Heinberg, evaluated different mediums of educational programs aimed at to educate adults about risk diversification. The work cites risk diversification as an \\"essential concept for financial decision-making\\". Their research found that videos are the most effective means of communicating financial literacy, which highlighted the power of online media in educating and altering the decisions of recipients.  Academic achievement gap  In 2012, Samek helped launch a large-scale project called the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center (CHECC). Samek and a team of scholars sought to understand the academic achievement gap and how early childhood education interventions may reduce it. The research found that preschool programs and incentives to parents lead to large reductions in the academic achievement gap. Dr. Anya Samek said this about her work at CHECC: > The CHECC results not only allow us to provide quality early childhood > education but also help inform us about how to most effectively develop > early childhood programs. We are excited to move forward as we continue to > provide the Chicago Heights community quality early childhood programming. = Health = Samek's work on health includes examination of the effects of interventions in the decision-making of children in regards to food choice.  Prompts  Over several weeks, Samek, List, and Lai ran an experiment aimed at better understanding how prompts affect the food-choice of children. They discovered that when nudges by cafeteria workers are applied, children are more likely to opt for white milk relative to sugar-sweetened chocolate milk.  Individual incentives and educational messaging  Samek and List analyzed how individual incentives and educational messaging affect the food choice of children. They discovered that when the two interventions were applied in tandem, they held an important influence in increasing the rate at which children opt for healthier snacks. Notably, the research showed that the effects of the experiment continued to spill over after its completion, suggesting that individual incentives and education messaging encourages habit-building among children.

History After the European colonization of the area, this was the main export and import region, using boats to transport the cargo from the shore to the ships. A proper port was then built in the needle like peninsular area on which the Puntarenas canton and downtown city is now located, starting with wood materials in the 1910s and then steel in the 1930s. By the 1960s due to the difficulty of access to the city, it was decided to build a proper port with easier access, which started construction in the 1970s and was inaugurated on 17 December 1981. Efforts to upgrade the port capabilities are in the planning stage, with a proposed delivery date in the year 2029 for the first stage and 2045 for the second stage, with no specific objectives per stage yet, and because the contract to manage the port only includes operations and not enhancements, it has been difficult to improve the infrastructure of the port.

M85 survived the remainder of the war, and was passed on to the Reichsmarine, the navy of the Weimar Republic and then to the Nazi German Kriegsmarine. The outbreak of the Second World War saw M85 supporting the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, and she was sunk by a Polish mine on 1 October 1939 in one of the last acts of the Polish campaign. Design and construction The M1916 Type minesweeper was an improved and slightly enlarged derivative of the M1914 and M1915 Type minesweepers which Germany had built since 1914. They were fleet minesweepers, seaworthy enough to operate in the open sea, and proved to be successful and reliable in service. M85 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a design displacement of and a deep load displacement of . Two coal-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to two sets of 3-cylinder triple expansion steam engines, rated at , which in turn drove two propeller shafts. Speed was . 120 tons of coal was carried, sufficient for a range of at . As built, M85 had a main gun armament of two 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/45 naval guns, while 30 mines could be carried. Post-war, most of the ships of the class were rearmed with a single 10.5 cm gun and three 2.0 cm anti-aircraft cannon. The ship had a crew of 40. M85 was laid down at the shipbuilder Nordseewerke's Emden shipyard as yard number 110. She was launched on 10 April 1918 and entered service on 3 August 1918. Service M85 survived the remaining three months of the First World War. While the majority of the ships of the Imperial German Navy were interned at Scapa Flow and were scuttled on 21 June 1919, the German Navy's minesweepers remained under its control, although disarmed, as they were needed to help clear the extensive minefields in the North and Baltic Seas. When the Weimar Republic established the Reichsmarine, with its size constrained by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, M85 was one of the ships taken over by the new navy. In 1931, M85 was noted as being in reserve. M85 had returned to active service by 1 September 1939, when the German invasion of Poland started the Second World War, with M85 forming part of the newly established 7th Minesweeping Flotilla. On 4 September 1939, together with sister ships M75 and M84 assisted the minelayer in laying a minefield at the southern end of the √òresund. The 7th Minesweeping Flotilla, including M85 was deployed to Polish waters on 5 September. On 1 October 1939, shortly after the garrison of the Hel Peninsula had agreed to surrender, ending the Battle of Hel, M85 struck a mine north east of Jastarnia, which had been laid by the Polish submarine . 24 of M85s crew were killed, with the survivors rescued by the minesweeper M122 and several R boats.

Walt Whitman was an American journalist and poet from West Hill, New York. The Half-Breed; A Tale of the Western Frontier, was published anonymously in the Aristidean and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. The story takes place west of the Mississippi River in a little town called Warren. The Half Breed is a tale of the relationship between local Native Americans and the white settlers who are the inhabitants of Warren and the idea of Westward Expansion. Walt Whitman was known as strong supporter of Westward Expansion. The main characters get along until a thief is caught and a white man, Peter Brown, is thought to be dead. This reveals some possible hidden agendas from a few of the characters, along with some underlying suspicions from the townsfolk. There is a character of \\"mixed-blood\\", Boddo, who is described as a half white and half Native American hunchback of the town. He does not seem to be respected by the people of the town due to his appearance. Once revealed, Boddo's story helps the audience understand why the short story was given his name. This interesting tale gives a great idea of the attitude around this time period, while adding mystery and stories of betrayals.  Background  Walt Whitman a few years after writing The Half-Breed; A Tale of the Western Frontier Walt Whitman wrote The Half-Breed; A Tale of the Western Frontier during the lead up to the Mexican-American War, while he was editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. He frequently voiced his opinions of Mexico, especially regarding the wars between the United States and Mexican territories. When talking about how Mexico will be affected by the war, Whitman says \\"Mexico will be a severed and cut up nation. She deserves this, -- or rather her government deserves it, because Mexican rule has been more a libel on liberty than liberty itself\\". He was a believer of manifest destiny, and wanted the United States to expand as far as it could. Therefore, he was supportive of wars fought between anyone who wanted to get in the way of that. As Shivley states, \\"Whitman supported the Wilmot Proviso that would exclude slavery from conquered territories and called for an end to the war. Those like Whitman who could not support the extension of slavery founded the Free Soil Party\\". The Half-Breed; is one of Whitman's earlier works, and his second-longest, just behind Franklin Evans, a temperance novel. Throughout his works, Whitman alludes to Native Americans and contributes to the vanishing Indian trope. There are arguments of Whitman's racial bias towards Native Americans. Some argue that he shows \\"fondness for Indian subjects\\" because of his frequent inclusion of Natives in his narratives. Others argue that the representation of Native people feeds into negative mindset towards Natives. For example, Some say that in The Half-Breed; Whitman \\"lapses into the stock racial profile of an 'apathetic\\" and expressionless Native American.\\" The silent Native character, mixed in with Whitman's inclusion of expansion, feeds into the vanishing Indian trope. Whitman also made the decision to end Arrow-Tip's life in the story, which also plays into the trope. In The Half Breed;, Whitman seems to include another political statement. Many say he is creating an argument against capital punishment. In the story Arrow-Tip \\"dies as a result of mistaken testimony, revenge, and a precipitant legal hanging.\\" Arrow-Tip's unnecessary death highlights the dangers that capital punishment comes with. By choosing to end Arrow-Tip's life, the townspeople took responsibility for him. Whitman's possible statement shows that some people will be wrongfully accused, and the aftermath of that situation is messy and difficult to deal with. Whitman published The Half Breed under the name Arrow-Tip in The Aristidean in March of 1845. The novelette was republished under its current name in June of 1846 in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.  Plot  The story opens with Boddo, who is an ill-respected, physically-deformed and unattractive man of white and Native American parentage, as he travels to tell Father Luke about a wedding that is set to take place between the blacksmith Peter Brown and his intended. On the day of the wedding, Master Caleb leaves, only to witness the Native American Arrow-Tip coming over the hill. A few days later, some items are stolen from Mr. Thorne. Arrow-Tip is automatically assumed to be the thief despite no evidence to suggest this. Shortly after, Arrow-Tip uncovers the thief to be none other than the town hunchback, Boddo. Meanwhile, Peter's bride has come to befriend Father Luke, who has been spending more time with the villagers, and manages to convince him to tell her of the events that brought him to his current situation. He tells her of his upbringing in Ireland and of his adventures to America. Upon arriving to America, he meets a Native American woman with whom he fathers a child, Boddo, who is unaware of this. His story is interrupted by some disturbing news of an event that took place during a hunting party. While hunting, two of the men in the party chose to create a raft. As they reach their destination, they hear Peter Brown and Arrow-Tip quarreling. Upon reaching shore, they discover the blacksmith unconscious next to a silent Arrow-Tip. He refuses to answer any questions, as he knows that it would serve no good. The two men throw a blanket over Peter and take Arrow-Tip back to the village to announce Peter's death and Arrow- Tip's crime. They do not closely examine the blacksmith and as such, do not discover that he is still alive. Upon waking up, Peter quickly thinks of the argument between him and Arrow-Tip, deeming himself to be in the wrong. He's discovered by Boddo, who then takes him to Father Luke's cave, the safest available shelter. While fetching water for Peter, Boddo meets Father Luke who tells him that Arrow-Tip has been accused of Peter's murder. When Peter learns of Arrow-Tip's situation, he suggests sending Boddo to alert the villagers that he is alive because he is still too weak to make the journey himself. While traveling to the village, Boddo decides to play with the fate of Arrow- Tip's life for exposing his indiscretions earlier in the story. He and the villagers travel to the place of the purported murder and discover that Peter is gone, causing them to assume that Deer, Arrow-Tip's brother, stole the body away in an attempt to acquit Arrow-Tip. When they return home the townsmen are determined of Arrow-Tip's guilt and decide to enact vengeance. Arrow-Tip manages to convince the men to let him tell his story in front of the entire village, upon which point he says that the quarrel was over a wager over who would ‚Äì or wouldn't ‚Äì catch any game, with some of their possessions as the prize. During the conversation Peter lost his temper and upon seeing Arrow-Tip try to take the weapon he had wagered, the two men began to scuffle. Arrow-Tip is convinced that he did indeed kill Peter, as are the townsmen. Boddo is the only person who can backup the knows the truth and despite being present, doesn't come forward. As a result, Arrow-Tip is sentenced to die the following morning via hanging. That following morning the townspeople are glib and a comparison is made to the celebration at Peter's wedding. Deer is allowed to visit his brother. During their meeting Arrow-Tip tells him that he's determined to approach his impending death stoically and that his sentence would have been the same with their own people. While this is taking place, two schoolchildren discover Peter Brown sunning himself along the riverbank near Father Luke's home. They quickly rush to Master Caleb who, along with Quincy, realize that Boddo has lied about discovering Peter dead. They travel to Father Luke's cave and discover that Peter is alive. They quickly travel to tell the others that Peter is alive, but are too late and arrive just after Arrow-Tip's hanging. Attempts to cut him down and revive him are unsuccessful. Three days after Arrow-Tip's death Father Luke and Deer leave the town. Whitman states that years into the future an aged friar will be buried while hundreds of miles away an Indian leader leads his tribe further west in an attempt to avoid being bothered by the white man. The fate of Boddo is unknown, only that he fled the town and is believed to be either dead or living a similar miserable existence in another place. Meanwhile, Master Caleb has become the leader of an incorporated academy while Quincy is well respected and will likely be nominated for political office. One of his best admirers is Peter Brown, who has survived and fathered multiple children.  Characters  * Boddo: The \\"half breed\\" of the story that was mistreated not only because of the pigmentation of his skin but because of his lack of intelligence and hunched over back. He was later classified as a liar and a thief throughout the story and became the villain of the story. * Peter Brown: A Blacksmith; He marries the daughter of a respectable man. Peter ends up being \\"killed\\" by Arrow Tip, but in the end we find out that his death was a lie. He actually recovered in the care of Father Luke. * Arrow Tip: Arrow-Tip is the brother of Deer. He is accused of theft followed by being accused of murder, which he was executed for. It is later found out that Arrow Tip did not murder Peter Brown. Because Boddo did not come forth with the secret that he kept concerning Peter Brown's condition, Arrow-Tip was publicly executed for the murder of Peter Brown. * Deer: Deer is the brother of Arrow-Tip, and says very little throughout the story. * Master Caleb: Master Caleb is an educator in Warren, and develops a rather odd relationship with a child in his class named Quincy. * Father Luke: Father Luke is a monk who lives a little while from the town of Warren. He is revealed to be Boddo's biological father.  Themes  Isolation/Abandonment: There have been many times that characters in this text deal with abandonment and not feeling accepted. Boddo for example, in the beginning of the text, was picked on simply because he did not look like everyone else or have the same intellect as those around him. He was also shunned by his father because of his in-capabilities and differences in belief and stature. Whitman makes it clear throughout the text that Native characters were only in Warren for a short time, or if they stayed they were outcasts. He writes his characters as if they're already gone, like when Arrow-Tip was completely silent after he was accused of murder. The idea of isolation or abandoning someone or something relates to the Vanishing Indian trope, which shows the erasure of Native American people through history and literature, but is still relevant and can be found to this day. Absence of Women: \\"The absence of women in the tale also strikes one as odd, even for a frontier story.\\" Throughout the story there are brief mentions of three women (Peter Brown's wife, Boddo's mom, and Father Luke's sister) that do not serve a strong purpose, but simply mention their name and relation to a prominent husband or another male character of the text. Peter Brown's fianc√©e \\"serves as a mere audience for Father Luke's long monologue regarding his scandalous past\\" This open our eyes as the reader to the continuation of race and sexuality and how the three are highlighted throughout the text. Though the absence of women is \\"hidden\\" in a way that is not noted from the author, it still strikes as a theme worth emphasizing in relation to the meaning of the text. Women in the short story were only used as vessels for men to get what they need, which shows how women were considered during the time. Representation of Mixed Race People: Boddo is mentioned as \\"deformed in body ‚Äì his back being mounted with a mighty hunch, and his long neck bent forward\\". All other characters mentioned in the text, including Native American people, would be considered \\"normal\\" and without any deformities. In fact, \\"Whitman's idealization of Arrow-Tip, the story's pure-blood is portrayed above all as honest, noble, and endowed with a close-to-the-Iand authenticity. The negative racism against the Native American, on the other hand, is projected almost exclusively upon Boddo, just as he also embodies the \\"monstrous\\" nature of any mixing of the races.\\" By making Boddo, our \\"half-breed\\" character the center of the story, he is highlighting the deformities Boddo has. The only space a mixed-person has in this text is as a deformed, hated character. The idea of mixture during this time was scary, and Whitman shows an example of what could happen as a bad result of mixture. \\"And so is Boddo vilified as the stock villain of his story, in part because of the others' anxious inability to 'class' him as 'Red' or 'White', as an entity indefinitely positioned on the 'Chain‚Äô. And yet there are places in the tale in which an inkling of sympathy for Boddo peeks through the cracks\\"  References  Category:Wikipedia Student Program ","title":"The Half-Breed (short story)"},{"id":"61891456","text":"Hiroshi Miwa (born 2 September 1940) is a Japanese field hockey player.

In 2002, planetary scientists Alan Stern and Harold Levison proposed the following algorithm to determine whether an object in space satisfies the definition for a planetary body. The body must: # Be low enough in mass that at no time (past or present) can it generate energy in its interior due to any self-sustaining nuclear fusion chain reaction. # Be large enough that its shape becomes determined primarily by gravity rather than mechanical strength or other factors (such as surface tension or rotation rate) in less than a Hubble time, so that the body would on this timescale or shorter reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium in its interior. A 2018 version of the algorithm was worded for a more general audience, and intended specifically as an alternative to the IAU definition of a planet: a planet is \\"a substellar-mass body that has never undergone nuclear fusion and has enough gravitation to be round due to hydrostatic equilibrium, regardless of its orbital parameters.\\" Under geophysical definitions of a planet, there are at least as many satellite and dwarf planets in the Solar system as classical planets, and very likely more. Geophysical planets in the Solar system The number of geophysical planets in the Solar system is unknown. At the time of the IAU definition in 2006, it was thought that the limit at which icy astronomical bodies were likely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium was around 400 km in diameter, suggesting that there were a large number of dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt and Scattered Disk, making dwarf planets the most common type of planet in the Solar System. However, it's since been shown that icy moons up to 1500 km in diameter are not in equilibrium, and that most trans- Neptunian objects up to 900 to 1000 km in diameter are not even solid bodies, suggesting that there may be only a few dwarf planets in the Solar system. Regardless of the number of planets, however, geophysical definitions are designed to classify planetary bodies on the basis of common physical properties rather than on location or orbit. An examination of spacecraft imagery suggests that the threshold at which an object is large enough to be rounded by self-gravity (whether due to purely gravitational forces, as with Pluto and Titan, or augmented by tidal heating, as with Io and Europa) is approximately the threshold of geological activity. However, there are exceptions such as Callisto and Mimas, which have equilibrium shapes (historical in the case of Mimas) but show no signs of past or present geological activity, and Enceladus, which is geologically active due to tidal heating but is apparently not currently in equilibrium.  Comparison to IAU definition of a planet  The geophysical definition is more or less equivalent to the second clause of the IAU definition of planet. It excludes the first clause (that a planet be in orbit around the sun) and the third clause (that a planet has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit). It thus counts dwarf planets and planetary-mass moons as planets. Five bodies are currently recognized as or named as dwarf planets by the IAU: Ceres, Pluto (the dwarf planet with the largest known radius), Eris (the dwarf planet with the largest known mass), Haumea and Makemake, though the last three have not actually been demonstrated to be dwarf planets.  Reaction to IAU definition  Geophysical definitions of a planet are alternative definitions of what is and is not a planet. An early petition rejecting the IAU definition attracted more than 300 signatures, though not all critics supported a geophysical definition. Proponents of a geophysical definition have shown that such conceptions of what a planet is have been used by planetary scientists for decades, and continued after the IAU definition was established, and that asteroids have routinely been regarded as \\"minor\\" planets, though usage varies considerably. Many critics of the IAU decision were focused specifically on retaining Pluto as a planet, without specifying what a planet should be.  Applicability to exoplanets Geophysical definitions have been used to define exoplanets. The 2006 IAU definition purposefully does not address the complication of exoplanets, though in 2003 the IAU declared that \\"the minimum mass required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System,\\" which is equivalent to the geophysical limit. While geophysical definitions apply in theory to exoplanets and rogue planets, they have not been used in practice, due to ignorance of the geophysical properties of most exoplanets. Geophysical definitions typically exclude objects that have ever undergone nuclear fusion, and so may exclude the higher-mass objects included in exoplanet catalogs as well as the lower- mass objects. The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, Exoplanet Data Explorer and NASA Exoplanet Archive all include objects significantly more massive than the theoretical 13-Jupiter mass threshold at which deuterium fusion is believed to be supported, for reasons including: uncertainties in how this limit would apply to a body with a rocky core, uncertainties in the masses of exoplanets, and debate over whether deuterium-fusion or the mechanism of formation is the most appropriate criterion to distinguish a planet from a star. These uncertainties apply equally to the IAU conception of a planet. Both geophysical definitions and the IAU definition consider the shape of the object, with consideration given to hydrostatic equilibrium. Determining the roundness of a body requires measurements across multiple chords (and even that is not enough to determine whether it is actually in equilibrium), but exoplanet detection techniques provide only the planet's mass, the ratio of its cross-sectional area to that of the host star, or its relative brightness. One small exoplanet, Kepler-1520b, has a mass of less than 0.02 times that of the Earth, and analogy to objects within the Solar system suggests that this may not be enough for a rocky body to be a planet. Another, WD 1145+017 b, is only 0.0007 Earth masses, while SDSS J1228+1040 b may be only 0.01 Earth radii in size, well below the upper equilibrium limit for icy bodies in the Solar system.

Education  Secunder Kermani graduated with a first class honours degree in History and Spanish from the University of Manchester, and a Master's in TV Journalism from Goldsmiths, University of London.  Career  Kermani began reporting for the BBC's Newsnight programme in 2014. Many of his reports focussed on the growth of the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and Western recruits to the organisation. He secured a number of exclusive interviews with members of ISIS including British jihadist Omar Hussain, and Australian suicide bomber Jake Bilardi, as well as with relatives of other ISIS fighters. In October 2016, it was reported that police from the Thames Valley Police Counter Terrorism department had obtained a court order allowing them to seize Kermani's laptop to view messages between him and a member of ISIS he had interviewed. The case attracted criticism from press freedom campaigners. Editor of Newsnight Ian Katz said he was \\"concerned that the use of the Terrorism Act to obtain communication between journalists and sources will make it very difficult for reporters to cover this issue of critical public interest.\\" In February 2018 Secunder Kermani was appointed the BBC's correspondent in Pakistan and Afghanistan. He has interviewed Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, current Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, the President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena, and chief negotiator of the Afghan Taliban, Abbas Stanikzai.

Early life  Dorothy Still was born in Saginaw, Michigan, on November 29, 1914, the daughter of William H. Still and Arrissa Still. She was raised in Long Beach, California. She trained as a nurse at the Los Angeles County General Hospital in 1932. US Navy Nurses rescued from Los Banos. General Kinkaid facing away from camera; Chief Nurse Laura Cobb to immediate left of Gen. Kinkaid with cigarette; Nurse Dorothy Still Danner seated at far left.  Navy nurse in World War II  Dorothy Still worked at two hospitals before she joined the Navy in 1937. She was first assigned to Balboa Hospital in San Diego; in 1939, she was sent to Ca√±acao Naval Hospital in the Philippines. Still was one of the American Navy nurses, later known as the \\"Twelve Anchors,\\" who were taken prisoner by Japanese troops in January 1942 in Manila.Elizabeth M. Norman, We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of the American Women Trapped on Bataan (Random House 2011). The group was taken first to the University of Santo Tomas, and to the Los Ba√±os prison camp in May 1943. There, despite a severe lack of supplies and malnutrition, they built an infirmary and cared for inmates until the camp was liberated in February 1945. On the night before liberation, the guards set up machine guns to prepare to execute all the inmates the following day. Despite this looming threat, Still and nurse Margaret Nash still showed up to the infirmary for their scheduled night shift. Still was on duty during liberation and helped with the evacuation. She was awarded a Gold Star, a Bronze Star, and a Prisoner of War Medal, among other decorations. Soon after her return to the United States, Still promoted war bonds for the U. S. Treasury Department. She was transferred to Panama late in 1945. She retired from the Navy when she married in 1947. She experienced ongoing health issues for years after her imprisonment, but found little support; a Navy psychiatrist told her that nurses could not experience posttraumatic stress disorder like soldiers did. She worked as a nurse and a hospital supervisor in her civilian life. In retirement, she wrote a memoir of her wartime experiences, What a Way to Spend a War: Navy Nurse POWs in the Philippines (1995). In 2019, she was the subject of the book, This is Really War: The Incredible True Story of a Navy Nurse POW in the Occupied Philippines.  Personal life  Dorothy Still married Goldburn Robert Danner in 1947. They had three children, the third born after Peck Danner's death in 1956, from a heart attack. She was known as Dorothy Still Terrill in the 1980s, after a second marriage. Still died on June 16, 2001, aged 86 years, at a veteran's home in Boise, Idaho. Her remains were buried, with full military honors, in Arlington National Cemetery. Her name, along with the names of the other Angels of Bataan nurses, is on a historical marker in Cavite City in the Philippines.

He is recognized as a pioneer behind modern face recognition, and is known for eigenfaces, the method of snapshots, low dimensional dynamical systems, analysis of the US Supreme Court, neuronal population dynamics, and the faithful copy neuron.  Early life and education  Sirovich was born to Jewish immigrants from Poland and raised in Brownsville, a working-class immigrant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. He gained entrance to the Brooklyn Technical H.S., an experience which first opened his eyes to the possibilities of the world. There he was captain of the math team and years later, in 2018, inducted into the BTHS Hall of Fame. Sirovich attended Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate math major, and as a graduate student in aeronautical engineering (where applied mathematics was practiced). In 1958, jointly with Johns Hopkins University, he became a research assistant at the Courant Institute at NYU. It was there that he wrote his PhD dissertation \\"On the Kinetic Theory of Steady Gas Flows\\" in 1960. At the Courant Institute, K.O. Friedrichs, a mathematician of great insight and taste, was his most influential teacher. For Sirovich, taking a course with Friedrichs on asymptotics was a life-changing experience. Another early mentor at the Courant Institute was Fritz John, a mathematician of the highest character with whom Sirovich later started the eminent Applied Mathematical Sciences series, of Springer-Verlag Publishing.  Research  Sirovich's early research was in kinetic theory, its connection with fluid mechanics, and such areas of fluid mechanics as supersonic flow and turbulence. A turning point in Sirovich's research came with his reading of Jim Watson's The Double Helix, which caused Sirovich to realize that he was not engaged in the heroic research of his time. This prompted participation in a Cold Spring Harbor summer course on biology, and eventually led to his close association with H. Keffer Hartline's Laboratory of Biophysics at the Rockefeller University, and a long collaboration with Bruce W. Knight, the present head of the laboratory. As a maturing scientist, Sirovich's research interests took on an element of serendipity (\\"chance confers an advantage on the prepared mind\\", Louis Pasteur). For example, a chance remark on the failure of the standard description of the horseshoe crab's lateral eye neural network at its boundaries led to a complete Weiner-Hopf solution to the problem, with complete experimental agreement. An article by Linda Greenhouse in the New York Times led to \\"A pattern analysis of the second Rehnquist U.S. Supreme Court.\\" An observation that human faces, are always different, but are always recognizable as a face; and likewise that images of turbulence had the same property of being different, and being recognizable as turbulence led to a successful model of face recognition, and also served as an analysis model for turbulence. The former led to Sirovich's establishing the subject of face recognition. Allied to this was the notion of low dimensional dynamical descriptions of turbulence in standard geometrical settings. In a series of three papers on the subject, Sirovich established the field of low dimensional dynamical models. According to Google Scholar, Lawrence Sirovich has ~250 publications, which have been cited over 21,000 times.  Personal life  Sirovich met Carole Hochman, a number theorist, at the Courant Institute. Their first date took place on September 4, 1960 and they married October 16th, 1960. Carole received her PhD from the Courant Institute and later became Chair of the Department of Math and Science at the Pratt Institute, which she retired from in 2017. Their daughter Brenda Sirovich was born in 1963, and received a B.A. in math and biology from Harvard. She is the co- director of the VA Outcomes Group at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine. Their son Matthew was born in 1966. Matt studied math and economics at Brown University, and is currently a board member there. Math is the family business. and their two grandchildren, Lucas and Eliza, show every indication of joining the family business. In 2018 Mathew Sirovich honored his parents by endowing the Carole & Lawrence Sirovich Chair of Public Health at Brown University.

Although Darayan I's name was usually read as \\"Darew\\" by numismatics, an engraving of his name on a silver bowl has led to his name being read as \\"Darayan\\" by most recent studies. The name is derived from Old Persian daraya- vahau≈°, the name of the prominent Achaemenid King of Kings Darius the Great (). Darayan I, unlike his predecessors‚Äîthe fratarakas‚Äîused the title of shah (\\"king\\"), and laid foundations to a new dynasty, which may be labelled the Darayanids. The title for \\"king\\" he uses on his coinage is malik, whilst the legend on the reverse is d‚Äôryw mlk‚Äô (\\"Darius the King\\"). The reason behind his adoption of the title of Darayan was seemingly because he felt strong enough to do so, and in spite of the difficulties that he and his successors faced, they did not renounce the title until the fall of the kingdom. The style of the silver drachmas under Darayan I was a continual of the one under the fratarakas. On the obverse, the king is wearing a soft cap (bashlyk) with a crescent. On the reverse, the king is facing a fire temple with the Zoroastrian supreme deity Ahura Mazda above, and holding a scepter, and on the other side of the temple an eagle mounted on a pedestal. The reverse has an inscription in the Aramaic script: ê°É‚Ä¨ê°Äê°ìê°â‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ê°Ö‚Ä¨ ê°åê°ã‚Ä¨ê°ä‚Ä¨ d‚Äôryw mlk‚Äô (\\"Darius the King\\").

In its human form, the Rev-9 is portrayed by Gabriel Luna. History The Rev-9 is a Terminator model developed by Legion, an artificial intelligence designed for cyber warfare in a future timeline where Skynet's rise was prevented. Legion dispatched a Rev-9 back in time to 2020 from 2042 with the mission of terminating Dani Ramos, a young woman who will go on to lead humanity against Legion's forces in the future. Upon its arrival in Mexico City, the Rev-9 goes to Dani's home, only to find that she and her brother Diego have already left for their job at a factory. It kills their father and assumes his appearance as a disguise to infiltrate the factory. There, it nearly shoots Dani, but is ambushed by Grace, a cybernetically-enhanced human soldier sent from 2042 to protect her. The Rev-9 pursues them in a truck as they escape, and during the chase reveals its capability to split into two individual units. It manages to kill Diego and corner Dani and Grace, only to be temporarily disabled by the sudden arrival of Sarah Connor, who attacks it using high-grade ammunition. Dani and Grace flee, and later meet up with Sarah. Having lost its targets, the Rev-9 hacks into local surveillance cameras to reacquire them. It discovers the trio is heading to Laredo, Texas, which inevitably they would need to cross the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. Disguising itself as a United States Border Patrol officer, it arranges their arrest, so that it can ambush them. The Rev-9 arrives at the Border Patrol detention center in Laredo and slaughters numerous Border Patrol agents and detainees but the trio escapes in a helicopter. By the time it is able to locate them again, they have allied with Carl, a T-800 Terminator left behind after Skynet's demise. The Rev-9 catches up with its targets at a military base where they seek to acquire electromagnetic pulse (EMP) grenades to use against it. In the ensuing battle, the EMP grenades are destroyed, while Dani and her allies escape in a military aircraft. The Rev-9 gives chase in an aircraft of its own, and manages to board theirs, leading to both Carl and the Rev-9 crashing into a river near a hydroelectric power plant while Dani, Sarah and Grace parachute to safety. Although temporarily slowed down in the river's current, it quickly catches up with them inside the plant, where they decide to take a stand against it. As they fight the Rev-9, Carl and Grace managed to restrain it and force it into a turbine, causing an explosion that mortally wounds Grace and temporarily disables Carl and Sarah. The explosion also destroys the Rev-9's liquid metal exterior, but its endoskeleton continues pursuing Dani, who tries to use Grace's power source as an EMP against it, only to be held down and nearly killed until Carl reactivates and holds it back. Once Dani stabs the power source into the Rev-9's endoskeleton, Carl drags it into a nearby pit, where the device's discharge melts both Terminators, destroying them. Background Luna as the Rev-9, in both its endoskeleton (left) and liquid-metal humanoid exterior (right) The Rev-9 is portrayed by Gabriel Luna, who began a four- month casting process in December 2017. Rev-9 is an advanced machine sent from the future by Legion (an AI that succeeded Skynet after the timeline alteration following the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day) from the year 2042 to terminate a woman named Dani Ramos, among others. Rev-9 has a traditional solid endoskeleton covered with a liquid-metal exoskeleton, somewhat similarly to the T-X from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and is considered a combination of the T-800 and the T-1000. The Rev-9 possesses the ability to fully split these two components into two separate, fully autonomous units. The separation does not significantly weaken either unit, making the Rev-9 one of the most formidable Terminator models yet seen (Its ability to take punishment is slightly lessened when the two are separate, but this only means that it is easier to throw the Rev-9 back or slow it down rather than actually destroying it). Its poly-alloy and endoskeleton can separate and fuse back together at a rapid pace, enabling it to split or merge during combat without ceasing its movements. Director Tim Miller commented on this upgrade, telling CinemaCon attendees, \\"Our cool new feature... is he can split. So he's twice as deadly.\\" However, the Rev-9 is at its strongest when it is one unit. Miller wanted the character to be \\"lethal and capable, but not so lethal that our heroes don't stand a chance to fight against him,\\" saying, \\"You want to have some limits and you don't want him to have plasma weapons, or ones that explode like a nuclear bomb, which would mean the movie will be over quickly.\\" Eventually, the filmmakers decided on a Terminator character that would essentially have a combination of the T-800's endoskeleton and the T-1000's liquid metal skin. The Rev-9 is shown to have a deeper personality than Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 character. Miller said the Rev-9 \\"is not some cold machine that has a limited personality like Arnold was. He is a fully featured character. He's more human than human, and if it's easier to charm his way past an obstacle versus kill it, stab it or break it down, he'll do that.\\" For example, in the film, the Rev-9 tries to convince the other characters to let him kill Dani, implying that he will let them go if they do, and tries to use logic to coerce the T-800 into joining him. During an earlier encounter with cops in Texas, it assumes a southern accent to blend in. Luna analyzed the first two Terminator films for guidance on how to portray the Rev-9. His portrayal was also inspired by Ted Bundy and by Tom Cruise's assassin character in the 2004 film Collateral. Luna explained \\"[We] certainly wanted to honor everything that had come before. There's no reason to remake the wheel when it's running so smoothly and seems to scare the pants off everybody. [We wanted to] find what worked really well ... but I think that they wanted him to have a charming quality, an approachable quality. You know, the fact that Ted Bundy could walk up to you in a park and all of a sudden, you're gone. That always was there.\\" Luna also underwent physical training and fight choreography to prepare for the role. Luna said that the Rev-9's ability to learn and simulate human emotion ultimately becomes the character's weakness, stating that the Rev-9 grows frustrated with its failed attempts to kill Dani. As a result, it becomes increasingly focused on her while somewhat ignoring the other characters who come after it during the film's final battle. Luna said that scenes were cut from the final film which would have further developed the character's personality and frustration. Dave Trumbore of Collider speculated that the Rev-9's name may have been inspired by the Biblical verse of Revelation 9, which mentions \\"the Destroyer.\\" Another possibility is that it stands for \\"Revision 9,\\" marking it as the ninth attempt to create such a Terminator model. Chris Klimek of Slate believed that the Rev-9, in its disguise as a villainous Border Patrol agent, was meant as an allegory on immigration issues between the U.S. and Mexico. Abilities The Rev-9's primary feature is the ability to split its liquid metal exterior and endoskeleton into two separate units. In addition to this, it possesses similar basic capabilities to the Terminators created by Skynet before its destruction. Like the T-1000 it is capable of shapeshifting to assume the appearance of anyone it touches and can morph its arms to form stabbing weapons and other shapes, such as hooks for scaling vertical surfaces. The Rev-9 exhibits more control over its composition than the T-1000, allowing it to use its polyalloy in more inventive and adaptive fashions. The endoskeleton is also shown to adjust its physical form to bend in an inhuman manner. The Rev-9 is also a skilled acrobat, able to make great leaps and climb treacherous surfaces with ease. The Rev-9 is composed of carbon-based alloy, making it lighter and stronger than previous Terminators. The Rev-9 can adapt behavioral responses (such as emotions) similarly to the T-800, and its exterior can quickly heal itself after taking an injury, like the T-1000. The Rev-9 is able to tap into servers and rapidly gain large amounts of information. Luna said that this ability allows the Rev-9 to do \\"very quickly what it took the T-800 decades to achieve.\\" Once connected itself into computer systems, it can control other machines linked to them such as drones as well as communications, essentially a computer virus that invades other programs and inserts its own code. When the Rev-9 is separated into two units, its liquid metal form continues using a human disguise, while the other part takes the appearance of a metallic endoskeleton. It is unknown if the liquid metal and endoskeleton are individual but collaborative units, or if the endoskeleton remotely controls function of the polyalloy. This is due to the fact that the endoskeleton continued to function after the liquid terminator ceased to function. Unlike the T-1000, the Rev-9 liquid metal is black in color. While the Rev-9 is still dangerous whether its two halves are integrated or not, it is slightly more vulnerable when separate; when integrated it can take machine gun fire to the face without significant impairment, but when separate, its endoskeleton can be thrown long distances by a T-800 while the cybernetically-enhanced soldier Grace can cut its polyalloy exterior apart with a chain, disabling it until it regenerates. Both halves are capable of underwater combat even when separated from each other. In addition, its metallic black color scheme can camouflages the Rev-9 against darkness such as deep below of waters. An earlier model, the Rev-7, appears briefly in Terminator: Dark Fate during a scene set in the post-apocalyptic future. The Rev-7s also have the ability to split apart, as well as tentacles that function as their weapons. They also have flight capability for airborne chase, in which the Rev-9 lacks. Grace describes the Rev-9 as the \\"most lethal Terminator ever created\\" in her timeline and states \\"you don't fight it, you run from it.\\" See also *Nanotechnology in fiction *Programmable matter *Self-assembly of nanoparticles References External links * Category:Terminator (franchise) characters Category:Fictional amorphous creatures Category:Fictional androids Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional computer viruses Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional super soldiers Category:Film characters introduced in 2019 Category:Nanotechnology in fiction Category:Science fiction weapons Category:Time travelers ","title":"Rev-9"},{"id":"61892151","text":"Venus Envy is a 1993 novel by Rita Mae Brown.  Plot Synopsis  Mary Frazier Armstrong, known to all as \\"Frazier\\", is a successful and beautiful 35 year- old art gallery owner. When she is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and is told she has only hours left to live, she decides it is time to let everyone know what she really thinks. She writes a series of brutally honest letters to friends and family, and because she'll be dead by the time she reads them, she also tells her deepest secret: She's a lesbian. When the letters arrive, chaos and pandemonium ensue in her hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia, peaking with the news that Frazier is not dying after all. As the society around her seeks to excoriate her for her sexual identity and those close to her are afraid to be painted with the same incriminating brush, only her father, brother, eccentric aunt, assistant and closest friend Billy stick by her. When the pressure grows too great, Frazier escapes, with the help of an accidental electric shock, to a fantasy visit into a 17th-century painting of Mount Olympus, only to wake up in the arms of the stunning and bisexual goddess Venus, and gets to hang out with the ancient, wiser goddesses and gods.  Characters  * Mary Frazier Armstrong: A woman of wealth and social position, who creates a furor among her family and friends when she tells them exactly what she thinks of them, under the mistaken impression that she is on her deathbed. * Libby Armstrong: Frazier's mother, who's bitterness has poisoned her daughter's life. * Carter Armstrong: Frazier's brother, a sensitive, alcoholic, \\"redneck\\" type, whose self-destructiveness is a counterpoint and by-product of Frazier's success * Ann: Frazier's secret romantic partner, who has a growing grudge regarding the limitations of their hidden life. * Billy Cicero: Frazier's outrageous gay best friend. * Mandy: Frazier's assistant at the art gallery, whose exhortation, \\"Don't die a stranger,Tell the people you love who you are\\" sets the comic train wreck in motion.  Reception  The novel received mix reviews from critics. Publishers Weekly opined that \\"The risible title is arguably the best thing about Brown's latest comic novel\\", noting that fans of Brown might well enjoy Venus Envy, but that first-time readers are bound to be disappointed. The Kirkus review found an excess of platitudes in the text, but also that Brown's \\"sexual frankness and flippant humor are as refreshing as always.\\" Chicago Tribune's Patrick T. Reardon found the novel \\"uneven\\", and \\"a real mess of a book, albeit a usually amiable and often amusing one,\\" noting that Venus Envy is more a polemic than a novel: \\"a series of set pieces in which characters - read Brown - speechify about deep and important things.\\" Yet for all his criticisms, he concludes that the book is enjoyable and fun. Carla Tomaso, in the Los Angeles Times, calls Venus Envy an \\"often witty and tender novel\\", in which Brown does what she does best: \\"create irreverent individualists, usually lesbians, who thumb their noses, always attractive, at society and then have a great time watching everybody squirm. We readers enjoy it as well, especially when Brown doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously in the attempt to be profound.\\" The fault she finds is that Brown pulls \\"too many strings\\", and that some of the dialogue gets \\"didactic\\", and gives her \\"permission\\" to \\"relax and stop worrying that we won‚Äôt get the message. We will.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1993 American novels Category:Lesbian fiction Category:1990s LGBT novels Category:Novels with lesbian themes Category:American LGBT novels ","title":"Venus Envy (novel)"},{"id":"61892161","text":"Heinrich Gottlob Lang (1739, Dresden - 1809, Augsberg ) was a German entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera.

It was written by Mary Laws and directed by Kevin Bray, and aired on September 29, 2019. In the episode, the Roys travel to Dundee, Scotland, Logan's birthplace, to celebrate his 50th anniversary as CEO of Waystar RoyCo. Plot The Roys attend the premiere of Willa's play; Kendall seduces Jennifer, one of the actresses. The next day, the Roy children record messages for Logan's 50th anniversary at Waystar, which will be celebrated in his hometown of Dundee, Scotland. On the plane, the Roys learn that a disgruntled former employee of the company is ready to be a whistleblower for the cruises scandal. In Dundee, Shiv confronts Rhea over her opportunistic behavior, accusing her of trying to take over the company. While Logan is away, Marcia passive-aggressively indicates to Rhea that she knows of her affair with Logan. During a family meeting, Shiv enlists the aid of her siblings to sabotage Rhea's image to Logan in various ways. While touring a state-of-the-art news building dedicated to Logan, Kendall admits to Rhea that he isn't genuinely working against her. Rhea suggests that Kendall is Logan's most likely successor at the company. Ewan arrives in Dundee, and gives Greg an ultimatum: either quit working for Logan, or lose Ewan's $250 million inheritance. Shiv struggles to convince her brothers to work with her against Rhea, as none of them seem to have as much of a problem with her. Rhea has arranged an elaborate gala celebrating Logan's 50 years at the company, having invited hundreds of guests, well beyond Logan's expectations. Logan and Shiv agree to a \\"truce\\" for the night. Shiv meets with Gerri, Hugo, Cyd, Frank and Karolina, who inform her that the company whistleblower is refusing even the quadrupled settlement of $20 million to withdraw his statement. Shiv decides not to concern her father with the details of the scandal during his celebration. During speeches for Logan, Kendall surprises the audience with a rap performance. Roman and Eduard Asgarov tell Logan they have purchased the Hearts football club as a gift, only to be reminded that Logan in fact supports the rival Hibs. Shiv realizes that Rhea will have to bear the brunt of the cruises scandal if she were placed in charge of the company, and gives Logan her approval to name Rhea as his successor. Logan makes the announcement during his speech. Marcia, upset with how Logan has treated her, leaves the event. As Logan prepares to unveil his plaque commemorating his 50 years at the company, Ewan confronts his brother, warning him that he will face a reckoning for his actions. Production Some of the episode's scenes were filmed at the V&A; Dundee. The episode was filmed on location in Dundee, and some scenes take place in the newly-opened V&A; Dundee.

On an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, actor Brian Cox revealed that the decision to make Logan's birthplace Dundee - which is Cox's real-life hometown - was made late in the production of the first season as a \\"surprise\\" from showrunner Jesse Armstrong, after Cox had already completed filming most of the episodes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY6kXXccQDI Kendall's rap for the Logan during his 50th anniversary ceremony, \\"L to the OG\\", was released as a single on May 20, 2020.https://music.apple.com/us/album/l-to-the-og-from- succession-season-2-single/1513048215 Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 0.579 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 0.11. =Critical reception= \\"Dundee\\" received critical acclaim.

Club, gave the episode a B+, praising the piecemeal, ambiguous way in which the series provides details on Logan's past: \\"There‚Äôs no flashback episode, no ready-made narrative about absent fathers, loving mothers, and persevering beyond abuse. Instead, details of Logan‚Äôs past bob up as they do in his mind, only to be shoved back down into the dark corners he leaves unswept.\\" Colburn also praised Kendall's rap as \\"a weird, humanizing moment of total lameness for all of these rich, untouchable people.\\" Scott Tobias of Vulture gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, comparing Kendall's rap to Karl Rove's comedic rap performance at a 2007 radio and television correspondents' dinner.

It is classified as an exceptional forest ecosystem. Location The Laval River Rare Forest is in the municipality of Colombier in La Haute-C√¥te-Nord Regional County Municipality. It is to the north of Forestville. The 33 hectares (82 acres) Laval River Rare Forest (For√™t rare de la Rivi√®re-Laval) is on the east side of the Laval River between Lac √† Jacques and Route 138. The forest is administered by the Forest Environment Directorate of Quebec ªs Ministry of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Parks. It was designated a rare forest ecosystem in 2003, and has IUCN management category III. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Forestville region in the 5g-T ecological subregion of the east fir/white birch subdomain. The Laval River area is dominated by stands of balsam fir (Abies balsamea). The soil consists of glacial deposits, with many rocky outcrops. The forest has developed on the thin and stony soils of the flat areas and small hills along the east bank of the river. Flora The Laval River Rare Forest is a young stand of black spruce (Picea mariana) and red pine (Pinus resinosa). The presence of red pine is unusual, since it is far from its normal range, which in Quebec is mainly the deciduous forest area to the west of the Gatineau River where the climate is milder and fires are more common. Red pines are hardly ever found on the C√¥te-Nord, and this stand would have needed repeated fires to have survived. The stand is open and has developed after a fairly severe fire around 1960. It is mainly black spruce and balsam fir, but red pines are scattered throughout. The red pines have many branches, and the stems are very twisted. Trunks are sometimes over in diameter at chest height and only high, probably due to poor soil. The fire seems to have been the cause of the low density of trees and the abundant Ericaceae and lichens in the undergrowth, which reduces competition from balsam fir. The shrub and herbaceous layer is dominated by species adapted to poor and dry environments such as sheep laurel (Kalmia angustifolia), common blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloides), lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), Cladonia rangiferina (Cladonia rangiferina), green reindeer lichen (Cladonia mitis) and northern reindeer lichen (Cladonia stellaris). The frequency of these species in the undergrowth would be expected to decrease with time unless a new fire re-establishes conditions favorable to their growth.

It was written by series showrunner Jesse Armstrong and directed by Mark Mylod, and aired on October 6, 2019. In the episode, the Roys are compelled to testify in Washington, D.C. before the Senate regarding allegations of sexual misconduct on their company's cruise ships, bringing a subplot that began early in the first season to the forefront. Plot At Logan's apartment, the Roys watch a televised interview with the whistleblower in the Brightstar Cruises sexual misconduct scandal. The employee names the late Lester McClintock personally responsible for most of the misconduct, but implicates Gerri, Tom and Kendall in helping cover it up. The interview also discusses the company's \\"No Real Person Involved\\" (NRPI) cases, in which the victims were sex workers or migrant workers at foreign ports, which the company used to clear itself of any legal liability. Roman agrees to help the company survive financially by securing funding from Eduard Asgarov's family, and Rhea arrives to aid the company's plans. The Roys plan to use Bill Lockheart, Tom's predecessor who initially oversaw the cruises documents, as a scapegoat, but are surprised to find him in the Senate building the following morning. Bill subtly suggests that he is there to ensure his own survival of the scandal. Logan, Kendall and the others strategize from within a boardroom, while Tom is the first to be called to testify alongside Gerri. Tom flubs his responses to Senator Gil Eavis' aggressive questioning, at one point even claiming not to know who Greg is. He returns from his testimony in a panic, accusing Shiv and the others of using him as a \\"patsy\\". Meanwhile, Roman travels with Karl and Laird to consult Eduard's help. He and Eduard half-heartedly continue their duties as owners of the Heart of Midlothian football club, and Eduard invites Roman and the others to Turkey to make their investment proposal to Eduard's father. In Turkey, as Roman is in the middle of a sales pitch, he and the others are ushered into a hotel lobby by anti-corruption militia forces, and held there as hostages for 24 hours while Roman manages to secure something of an agreement with Eduard. Shiv meets with Gil and Nate privately, where she learns that they have a witness who is ready to testify against the Roys. Logan sends Shiv and Rhea to meet with the witness while he and Kendall take the stand. Logan also stumbles through his responses to Eavis' questions, but deflects the blame onto Kendall, who nonetheless provides a strong and confident rebuke to Eavis and accuses him of operating on personal bias against Logan and his company. Shiv and Rhea track down Kira, the witness, to a playground where she plays with her daughter. Rhea is uncomfortable coercing a sexual assault victim into silence, so Shiv meets with the woman alone. Shiv candidly tells Kira that she and the company cannot be trusted, but asks her whether her personal courage in coming out as a witness against the Roys is worth the lifetime of public scrutiny that will follow her if she chooses to go through with her statement. She offers Kira a hefty settlement as well as a promise that she will work to ensure that those involved in the crimes will see justice. Kira agrees to back down, and Shiv wins the approval of her father for helping them win the case. After the trial, Rhea, disturbed by the lengths Logan is willing to go to protect his empire, tells him she no longer wants to be associated with the company, and abdicates her CEO title before walking away. Logan watches Kendall's testimony with Shiv and worries that his son's combative stance against Congress will hurt Waystar's relationship with its shareholders. He tells Shiv that if they really want the company to survive, they will need to make a \\"blood sacrifice\\". Production \\"DC\\" was written by Succession showrunner Jesse Armstrong and directed by Mark Mylod in his seventh episode for the series. For the scenes in Congress, the production crew built a replica of a Senate chamber at a studio in Queens. To prepare for his scenes during Tom's testimony, actor Matthew Macfadyen watched the House testimony of Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Donald Trump, and his questioning by Rep. Elijah Cummings. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 0.705 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 0.15. =Critical reception= \\"DC\\" was critically acclaimed, with reviewers praising the writing, performances, and culmination of the cruises storyline that had begun in the first season. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a rating of 100% based on 15 reviews, with the critics' consensus stating, \\"Disturbingly daunting, and thoroughly engrossing, The Roy family pulls out all the stops as they prevent Congress from destroying their company in 'D.C.'\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/succession/s02/e09 Randall Colburn of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, praising the comedy of Tom's testimony and Matthew Macfadyen's performance as \\"genuinely distressing\\". Colburn also praised the major scene involving Shiv's meeting with the sexual assault victim, as well as Brian Cox's \\"brutal, incredible delivery\\" during the final scene with Rhea. Scott Tobias of Vulture gave the episode a full five stars, praising the \\"brilliant\\" writing of the scenes where the Roys assess the extent of the damage done to them by the scandal, and compared the meeting between Shiv and Kira to the real-life case of Christine Blasey Ford and her sexual assault allegations against then-nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh. Tobias also praised how the \\"darker, more serious tone\\" of the episode helped underscore the fundamentally \\"rotten\\" quality of the Roys. Noel Murray of The New York Times praised the episode as \\"gripping, but also illuminating\\" in the way it explored how the wealthy come up with various machinations to avoid accountability. Vox called \\"DC\\" a \\"terrific\\" episode, praising writer Jesse Armstrong for drawing humor from \\"cringe-inducing\\" moments.

Tom grapples with the aftermath of the Brightstar Cruises expos√©. Meanwhile, Logan's relationship with Rhea deepens. Plot Logan throws a party at his apartment to maintain healthy relations with his wider circle amidst the Brightstar Cruises sexual misconduct scandal. Frank and Gerri call Logan, Kendall and Roman upstairs to discuss strategies to keep Waystar's shareholders on their side amid both the looming cruises scandal and Sandy and Stewy's takeover bid. They decide to fly to London to meet overseas shareholders, including Logan's second wife Caroline, who owns 3% of the company's shares. Roman informs Shiv that she has been sidelined from the discussion. The next day at work, Tom is interviewed in an internal investigation regarding the cruises incidents, and is surprised to receive pointed and hard-hitting questions, contrary to what he was led to believe. Shiv assures Tom that his job is safe and decides to fly to London to confront her father. Tom, meanwhile, confronts Greg, who had kept copies of the documents pertaining to the scandal, and demands they be destroyed. However, while burning the copies that night, Greg discreetly recovers some of the pages. In London, Kendall and Roman are surprised to see that Logan has invited Rhea along to aid their efforts on account of her strategic mind and business savvy. Logan and Rhea later spend the night together. Kendall continues his relationship with Naomi Pierce. Stewy and Sandy have begun running smears on Logan invoking the death of Andrew Dodds, suggesting that it was a suicide triggered by Logan's mistreatment of his staff. Logan asks Kendall, still reeling from the accident, to join him in meeting Dodds' family, and has Roman talk to his mother. Shiv arrives in London and has lunch with Rhea, who offers her own former position as CEO of PGM to Shiv. Shiv senses that this is a ploy concocted by Logan. Meanwhile, Kendall and Logan visit Dodds' family; Kendall is visibly shaken, but Logan tells him the family attributes Andrew's death to his drug problems and don't blame the Roys. Later that night, Kendall secretly delivers cash to the family's mailbox. Shiv and Roman visit their mother and tell her the acceptable range of money Logan is apparently willing to offer to buy her loyalty to the company. Caroline sees through the ruse and demands either the family's summer home in the Hamptons, or a simple $20 million on the condition that she sees her children every Christmas, allowing Logan to ultimately choose. Kendall arrives that night and attempts to open up about his guilt over Andrew's death, but Caroline asks to discuss the matter the following morning. However, Kendall wakes up to find that Caroline has already left the house. Shiv confronts Logan over her position at the company. Logan accuses her of conspiring against him, confirming that he orchestrated the meeting with Rhea. The others fly back to New York without Shiv. Logan grows increasingly comfortable with Rhea.

McQuillan (February 26, 1929 ‚Äì September 19, 2019) was an American judge and jurist. In legal circles, McQuillan was most noted for his work and expertise in the complete revision of the New York State penal code in the 1960s, the first major overhaul of that law since the 1800s. Following the revised penal code's enactment in 1971, McQuillan then served 21 years as a judge in New York, before retiring from the New York State Supreme Court in 1992. Among his many cases in the news, he ruled against jury exclusions based on gender; against prosecutorial withholding of evidence in the case of Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad; against illegal search and seizure in the case of playwright Miguel Pinero; and against unwarranted government surveillance. He also co-wrote an independent review of flaws in the criminal case mounted against Jeffrey Deskovic, an upstate New York man who spent half his life in prison for a rape and murder he did not commit.  Early career  In the 1950s, McQuillan served as an assistant district attorney in New York County under Frank Hogan. He was also an assistant counsel for the state Commission of Investigation, which examined the 1957 gathering known as the Apalachin Meeting. The Apalachin Meeting was considered a landmark case in the history of organized crime. In 1961, McQuillan became special counsel to the New York State Temporary Commission on Revision of the Penal Law, which oversaw the rewriting of New York State's penal and criminal procedure law. This was the first major revision of the law in over 80 years. Prior to the revision, the code was a piecemeal collection of local and statewide laws, with language and provisions going back to the 1800s. The commission was chaired by state assemblyman Richard J. Bartlett. McQuillan and Richard G. Denzer were the lead counsels to the commission. The commission was tasked by Governor Nelson Rockefeller with modernizing the entire criminal procedure law, ensuring consistency and fairness in sentencing guidelines, and eliminating the many archaic provisions of the existing law that went back to the previous century. Their revised penal law took effect on September 1, 1967. That same year, McQuillan co-authored a defining book on the revisions. Practice Commentary to Penal Law by McQuillan and Denzer provided historical references and case law for all of the code's revised statutes. After McQuillan left to become director of the State Office of Crime Control, there were additional revisions to the code and the final draft took effect as law on September 1, 1971.  Notable Court Cases  McQuillan was appointed to the New York Criminal Court in 1971 by Mayor John Lindsay. He was named a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court the following year, 1972. In 1985, McQuillan was also named administrative judge of the criminal branch of the State Supreme Court, a position he held until his retirement. Both during and after his time on the bench, McQuillan presided over or was involved with a number of publicized trials. In the case of Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad (formerly Richard Moore) McQuillan reversed Wahad's conviction for attempted murder, after Wahad had served 19 years in prison. In 1990, McQuillan ruled that the prosecution had failed to disclose evidence which would have helped Wahad's defense. McQuillan based his ruling on a 1986 New York State Court of Appeals decision calling for a reversal of a conviction whenever the prosecution withholds evidence. McQuillan ordered that Wahad be freed and released without bail, pending a new trial. An attempt to appeal this ruling was rejected by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, and in 1995, the Manhattan district attorney's office said it would not retry Wahad. In the case of Jeffrey Deskovic, McQuillan co-wrote the independent review which found that a series of investigative and prosecutorial missteps led to Deskovic's wrongful conviction. The review was commissioned by the newly elected Westchester County district attorney Janet DiFiore and was written by McQuillan along with Leslie Crocker Snyder, William L. Murphy; and Richard Joselson. The 2007 report found that throughout the case against Deskovic, errors were made that propelled the case to an \\"unjust\\" outcome, including police and prosecutorial \\"tunnel vision,\\" overreliance on profiling, and a what the report called a deliberate attempt to play down the DNA evidence that ultimately led to Deskovic's exoneration. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the death penalty in 1976 (Gregg v. Georgia), McQuillan was also the first to declare that New York's death penalty was unconstitutional, and to give specific reasons for it. He ruled that the law was unconstitutional according to the Supreme Court's ruling, because it did not give a judge or a jury leeway to exercise discretion in deciding an appropriate sentence for a particular case, and did not provide for two separate trials‚Äîone for determination of guilt and another for determination of sentence. McQuillan's ruling was not binding on other Supreme Court justices, but was considered significant by the New York Times because of its detail and the fact that McQuillan was considered to be \\"one of the leading authorities\\" on the state's criminal law. In the case of playwright Miguel Pinero, McQuillan ruled that there was no justifiable cause for the arrest of Pinero and two other men on the 1978 charges of armed robbery, and that all evidence taken in the arrest resulted from an illegal search and seizure, and was therefore inadmissible in court. McQuillan also became an advocate for non-discriminatory jury selection. In a 1972 legal ruling, he urged the state legislature and governor to change laws that provided for automatic exemptions for women from jury duty. At the time, New York was one of seven states in which women were included on juries only if they volunteered. Prior to his appointment as a judge, McQuillan was director of the New York State Office of Crime Control Planning. He also was a member of the Criminal Jury Instructions Committee and served on a task force formed by NY Governor Hugh Carey to study ways to increase state funding for local police departments. From 1976 to 1992, McQuillan served as an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law , the school from which he had received his law degree. In 1993, he received the New York State Bar Association's Vincent E. Doyle, Jr. Award for Outstanding Judicial Contribution in the Criminal Justice System. Throughout his career, McQuillan also wrote opinion pieces for multiple publications including the New York State Bar Association Journal, the Fordham University Law Journal, and the New York Times.  Retirement  In retirement, McQuillan stayed active in criminal law. In addition to the review of the Deskovic case, he compiled a newsletter for the Innocence Project, focusing on DNA exonerations in criminal court cases around the world. He was also a member the New York State Commission on Forensic Science and a consultant on DNA and public access to DNA databanks.  Personal life  McQuillan was born and raised in Manhattan. After serving in the army and graduating college, he received his law degrees from Fordham University School of Law and New York Law School. In 1953, McQuillan met his first wife Dorothy when friends set them up on a blind date. They were married for 28 years and had one daughter, Veronica. McQuillan officiated as the judge for his daughter's wedding, held at Windows On The World at the original World Trade Center. After Dorothy died in 1981, McQuillan married attorney Carol Halprin. The couple divided their time between homes in upstate New York and Florida until his death at his N.Y. home in September 2019.

Biography Giuseppe Alberigo Giuseppe Alberigo received a graduate degree in law, studying under the German historian Hubert Jedin, under Delio Cantimori in Florence. and under the diocesan vicar and monk Giuseppe Dossetti who was one of the most influential progressives at the Second Vatican Council. Alberigo's most important work was the direction of the editorial initiative Storia del Concilio Vaticano II, but its progressive character did not have unanimous acceptance among Catholics, with critical reviews appearing in L'Osservatore Romano. The work of Giuseppe Alberigo and the \\"School of Bologna\\" is criticized because it supports the hermeneutics of discontinuity, an interpretation of the Second Vatican Council which considers it a crucial event that marks a turning point in the history of the Catholic Church. Following the presentation of the bill on the \\" :it:Diritti e doveri delle persone stabilmente conviventi Rights and duties of people living together \\" (DiCo) presented by the ministers Rosy Bindi and Barbara Pollastrini and the criticisms coming from the ecclesiastical hierarchy, on 13 February 2007 Alberigo promoted a public appeal in which he invited the Episcopal Conference of Italy to not intervene in a proposal for an official vote among Italian Catholic politicians. The bill has never been approved. On 20 April 2007, after his admission to the hospital Policlinico Sant'Orsola- Malpighi, Alberigo's relatives were informed by the Bologna Prefect Vincenzo Grimaldi that the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano had conferred on him the honor of a Knight of the Grand Cross of the Italian Republic, saying that his was \\"an authoritative voice emphasizing with critical awareness the importance of the contribution of Catholic culture in the debate on ideas in our country.

The microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, for example, is composed of only a thousand cells but has about the same number of genes as a human. Researchers suggest resolution of the paradox may lie in mechanisms such as alternative splicing and complex gene regulation that make the genes of humans and other complex eukaryotes relatively more productive. DNA and biological complexity The conflict between the morphological complexity of eukaryotes and the amount of genetic information they carry has long puzzled researchers. The sheer amount of DNA in an organism, measured by the mass of DNA present in the nucleus or the number of constituent nucleotide pairs, varies by several orders of magnitude among eukaryotes and often is unrelated to an organism‚Äôs size or developmental complexity. One amoeba has 200 times more DNA per cell than humans, and even insects and plants within the same genus can vary dramatically in their quantity of DNA. This C-value paradox troubled genome scientists for many years. Eventually, researchers recognized that not all DNA contributes directly to the production of proteins and other biological functions. Susumu Ohno coined the phrase ‚Äújunk DNA‚Äù to describe these nonfunctional swaths of DNA. They include introns, genetic sequences that are removed after transcription into mRNA and thus are not translated into proteins; transposable elements that are mobile fragments of DNA, most of which are nonfunctional in humans; and pseudogenes, nonfunctional DNA sequences that originated from functional genes. The share of the human genome that may be considered ‚Äújunk‚Äù remains controversial. Estimates reach as low as 8% and as high as 80%, with one researcher arguing that there is a fixed ceiling of 15% imposed by the genome‚Äôs genetic load. (Prokaryotes, which have little \\"junk\\" DNA by comparison, exhibit a fairly close relationship between genome size and biological functionality.) In any case, the assumption was that once the C-paradox was swept away and the focus shifted to the number of protein-coding genes, the anticipated correlation between genetic information and biological complexity in eukaryotes would emerge. Unfortunately, the G-value paradox simply picked up where the C-value paradox left off, because the discrepancy persisted when comparisons were narrowed to just protein- coding genes G-value paradox Estimates of the number of coding genes in the human genome reached upwards of 100,000 prior to the human genome project, but since have dwindled to as low as 19,000 following completion of that massive sequencing effort and subsequent refinements. By comparison, the microscopic water flea Daphnia pulex has about 31,000 genes; the nematode C. elegans about 19,700; the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) about 14,000; the zebrafish (Danio rerio), 26,000; and the small flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana', 27,000. Plants in general tend to have more genes than other eukaryotes. One explanation is their higher incidence of gene and whole genome duplication and retention of those additional genes, due in part to their development of a large collection of defensive secondary metabolites. The apparent disconnect between the number of genes in a species and its biological complexity was dubbed the G-value paradox. While the C-value paradox unraveled with the discovery of massive sequences of noncoding DNA, resolution of the G-value paradox appears to rest on differences in genome productivity. Humans and other complex eukaryotes simply may be able to more with what they have, genetically speaking. Among the mechanisms cited for this greater productivity are more sophisticated transcriptional controls, multifunctional proteins, more interaction between protein products, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications that may produce several protein products from the same genetic raw material. In addition, thousands of non-coding RNAs that are transcribed from DNA but not translated into protein have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and development in humans and other eukaryotes. They include short RNA sequences, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Piwi- interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) that may regulate gene expression at different stages of development. Some researchers suggest that instead of the number of genes the focus now should shift to gene interactions and the network of genetic regulatory mechanisms that allow them to support a variety of biological activities. These transitions have taken analysis of genetic complexity from the C-value to the G-value to what some refer to as the I-value, a measure of the total information contained in a genome.  Defining complexity  One of the challenges in the long debate over the mismatch between genome size and biological complexity has been ambiguity in defining complexity. Is it the number of cell types in an organism, the sophistication of its nervous system or the number of different proteins it produces? By some definitions, the greater complexity of humans compared to other organisms may be illusory. Even once complexity is defined, some researchers argue complexity in function does not necessarily require the same complexity in process. Evolution is not a paragon of efficiency but travels a crooked path that leads to a more cumbersome genome than is necessary in some species.

Built on the site of an older house by Collen Williamson and John Adam in the mid eighteenth century for Sir Ludovic Grant of Grant, it was the first building designed by a member of the Adam family to be built in Moray. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1971, and has been listed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland since 1990; ravaged by fire in 1995, it is now a ruin. Description Moy House is a ruined mansion, built in the classical style. Its three-storey central block, which is now roofless, has two main facades, one facing east and the other west, with its principal entrance in the east front. Three-storey wings project to the east at either end of the main block, forming a U-shaped courtyard, and two-storey wings projecting beyond these to the north and south. The building is not inhabited, and has remained in a ruinous state since a fire in 1995. Its dilapidation has been described by Walker and Woodworth as \\"one of the greatest architectural losses in Moray\\". =East elevation= The house's principal entrance is in the east facade. Prior to the bridging of the Findhorn, visitors would have approach the house from the east, following the road from the Findhorn Ferry; the bridge's construction around 1799 allowed carriages to approach the house from the west. The symmetrical frontage, described by Walker and Woodworth as \\"almost uncompromisingly severe\\", has five bays, and a round-headed central door surmounted by a corniced doorpiece and flanked by narrow ionic columns. Above the door is an enlarged window, which may have been designed to accommodate a balcony, but this is no longer present. =West elevation= Also of three storeys and five bays, the west front has a recessed entrance, flanked by two Roman Doric columns, which in the past supported a porch roof. Above this is a Venetian window, with Ionic columns and decorated architraves. =Interior= Much of the interior has been ruined by the 1995 fire. A cantilevered stairway survives in the hall, with a moulded ceiling above. An ornately moulded ceiling rose is still present in the former drawing room, as is an elaborate fire surround with brass reliefs of a king and prince of Wales, assumed to be George III and his son, the future George IV. History The land that Moy House stands on was purchased by John Campbell, of the Campbells of Cawdor, from the Bishop of Moray in 1579. It remained in the Campbell's possession until 1733, when the seventeenth-century 'auld house' that had been built on the site was acquired by Major George Grant. The wings projecting to the east added to the house in the 1750s by Collen Williamson, and in 1862 Grant's nephew, Sir Ludovic Grant of Grant, had the original part of the house demolished, at a cost of ¬£5, and a new central block built. Williamson was the overseer and mason on the project, which was built between 1762-3 to a design by John Adam, after a design by his brother Robert Adam had been rejected. It was the first building designed by a member of the Adam family to be built in Moray. In 1870, while the house was still owned by the Grant family, Alexander Ross added the two-storey wings to the north and south. The house remained in the possession of the Grants until 1922, since when it has had various owners. Moy House was designated a Category A listed building in 1971. In 1988, concerns were reported in the local press about the condition of the building, which was at that date occupied in part by its owners, with some of the house rented to tenants. In 1990 it was listed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland, and the local authority issued a repair notice, but the owners asserted that they were unable to afford cost of repairs, which were estimated at ¬£80,000 - ¬£160,000. A plan was put forward to build new properties within the house's grounds, which would raise funds to allow the repair of the house, but these were refused. In 1991, compulsory purchase proceedings were initiated, but these were appealed, and eventually rescinded, in 1992. A new plan for twelve houses to be built on the grounds was submitted later that year, which was accepted, and the building was completed in 1994, and in 1995 a fire broke out in Moy House that reduced it to a ruinous state. External supports were erected to stabilise the fabric of the building, and it was boarded up. Its owners indicated in 1997 that they hope to restore the house and convert it into flats, but building has remained abandoned and boarded up since the fire. The Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland rates its condition as ruinous, and its level of risk as severe.

A professor at the University of Iowa, Kochanska is known for her research on parent-child relationships, developmental psychopathology, and child temperament and its role is social development.  Biography  Kochanska grew up in Warsaw, Poland, and earned her Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw. She immigrated to the United States in 1981. Kochanska completed post-doctoral work at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and the Laboratory of Developmental Psychology at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. By 1991, she created her own laboratory at the University of Iowa. The research she studies includes social-emotional development and developmental psychopathology, focusing on the interplay of children's biologically-based characteristics and parent-child relationships in the origins of adaptive and maladaptive developmental pathways. Kochanska received the G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contribution to Developmental Psychology in 2017 from Developmental Psychology, Division 7 of the American Psychological Association.  Research  Kochanska conducted the research study called Children and Parents Study (CAPS). The goal of this research study is to learn about the different aspects of young children's social and emotional development. She also studied the differences in children's biological based temperament and the differences in parents' care giving styles. They also try to understand how those influence children's early development. Her team's main goal was to prevent maladaptive pathways and to advocate positive, adaptive pathways in children's socioemotional development. The research took place in the Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences in Iowa City. The children are kept there and when they are about 7‚Äì9 months old, they receive two and a half hour visit in the family's home to observe the mom, dad and baby. They continue to have visits when the child is 15‚Äì17 months, 36‚Äì38 months, and 46‚Äì48 months. The children were tested based on their individuality twice at 26‚Äì41 months and at 43‚Äì56 months repeatedly in multiple experimental situations as well as using parental reports. The good internal consistencies occurred in children at toddler and preschool age. The children's internalization was detected while they were left alone with restricted objects. They were given day-to-day chore, playing games that cause cheating, being persuaded to go against the code of conduct, as well as evaluated by using parental reports. Considering the individuality of children was significant but was often neglected as it played a significant role in developing internalization. At both ages, the girls outperform the boys. Another study she conducted was to observe the development of self-regulation in the first four years of a child's life. She examined the situational compliance and the committed compliance of 108 children. These forms of compliance are studied \\"Do\\" and \\"Don't\\" contexts in which \\"Do\\" context is when the mother requests her child sustains unpleasant behavior, and \\"Don't\\" context is when the mother requests their child to suppress pleasant behavior. Similar assessments were done at 14, 22, 33, and 45 months of age for each child. At these ages, the \\"Do\\" context was harder than the \\"Don't\\" context. Committed compliance was connected to the internalization of maternal rules in the children, whereas the situational compliance was not. There was enough evidence to show that committed compliance might be generalized to interactions with other adults and not just the mother.  Representative publications  * Kochanska, G., Murray, K.

It is located near the gushing spring of \\"La Fontaine\\", around which was an Augusteum, a sanctuary devoted to the cult of the emperor and his family, centred on a nymphaeum. Its basilica- like floor plan argues against it being a temple and there is no archaeological or literary evidence for its dedication to Diana Pierre Gros, La France gallo-romaine, 1991, Nathan, , pp. 39-40. The building may instead have been a library. Its facade was rebuilt during the 2nd century and in the mediaeval era it housed a monastery, ensuring its survival. It was excavated in 1745 during work to create the garden of La Fontaine. It was painted by Hubert Robert and other 18th century painters and was made a monument historique in 1840. It is now accessible from the jardins de la Fontaine.  Structure  Building from above showing vaults Its roof construction is unusual in that it consists of several elaborate thick barrel-vaulted rooms using carefully cut ashlars supporting an upper floor. Partly dug into the side of Mount Cavalier, the building was originally flanked by annexes. The main facade is pierced by three large arches. The remains consist mainly of a vaulted hall of 14.5 x 9.5 m, flanked by two staircases to missing semi- detached buildings. The north side wall has a series of five rectangular niches surmounted by alternate triangular and semi-circular pediments. Between each niche was a column of composite order. Three other rooms have ceilings decorated with carved coffered ceilings. The ancient opus sectile floor made of precious marble shapes of various colours backed by mortar was discovered the during the excavations of 1745.

Teamsters Local 1932 is the largest union in the County of San Bernardino, representing 11,000 of the County's 25,000 employees. The union was founded by members of the independent San Bernardino Public Employees Association (SBPEA) after a vote to affiliate with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in April 2015.  History  = Origin = A map of the Inland Empire metropolitan area of California, which consists of the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino. Local 1932 is based in San Bernardino. The San Bernardino Public Employees Association was founded in 1932, and prior to its demise represented employees at the County of San Bernardino, as well as employees from 18 cities in San Bernardino, Riverside and Los Angeles counties, and other public agencies in the region. Amid losses of hundreds of in members to Service Employees International Union Local 721 and a lawsuit by the union against its former general manager for missing funds and unauthorized expenditures, members of SBPEA voted to affiliate with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in April 2015. SBPEA converted to Teamsters Local 1932, in honor of SBPEA's founding year. = 2015 ‚Äî Present = Local 1932 members were victims and survivors of the December 2, 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, CA. Local 1932 was active in lobbying for victim access to grants to use for medical care in the aftermath of the attack. In November 2016, 500 employees at the San Bernardino County Preschool Services Department joined Teamsters Local 1932. Starting in November 2016, Teamsters Local 1932 began partnering with local businesses in the Riverside‚ÄìSan Bernardino‚ÄìOntario metropolitan area (known as the \\"Inland Empire\\") to provide members with discounts as a reward for shopping locally. As of January 2020, the program, called \\"Teamster Advantage,\\" has grown to a network of over 500 local businesses. In October 2018, the union hosted a job fair called ‚ÄúA Day Without a Temp‚Äù focused on raising awareness of the increase in temporary and contingent work across the Inland Empire, while providing union job opportunities to those attendance. At the County of San Bernardino's \\"State of the County\\" event in February 2019, one hundred Local 1932 members passed out a University of California, Riverside report regarding poor job quality in the Inland Empire. The union's members from the County's Preschool Services Department hand-billed the 2020 \\"State of the County\\" event as part of the group's campaign for a new contract, raising concerns on working conditions and its effects on student learning conditions. In September 2019, after ten months of negotiations, Local 1932 ratified a new contract with the County of San Bernardino, which the union says brought down healthcare costs for employees. Under the leadership of Secretary-Treasurer Randy Korgan, a former warehouse worker, Local 1932 prioritizes organizing workers in the local logistics industry. The Inland Empire is home to a \\"central hub of the supply chain\\" with 80 percent of goods arriving at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach eventually passing through the region. = Activity at San Bernardino International Airport = In April 2019, Teamsters Local 1932 was active in pushing for a Community Benefits Agreement, including job quality and air quality standards, at a development planned for San Bernardino International Airport. After a lengthy period of rumors surrounding the air cargo facility's tenant, San Bernardino International Airport Authority Executive Director Michael Burrows confirmed that Amazon would be operating at the site in May 2020. Amazon is the Inland Empire's largest private employer and its involvement in the project has led to pushback from local unions and community organizations because of the company's labor and environmental practices in the region. The project was the subject of a community picket line in front of an Amazon facility in San Bernardino on Cyber Monday 2019. The Community Benefits Agreement push by Teamsters Local 1932 and community allies were supported by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in December 2019. On February 21, 2020, Becerra joined Local 1932 Secretary- Treasurer Randy Korgan in a press conference announcing a lawsuit by the state of California against the San Bernardino International Airport Authority, the Federal Aviation Administration, and project developer Hillwood over a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act during the development of Eastgate.

son of Willemtgen and Willem Janszoon, was born south of Dirk Hartog Island, in present-day Western Australia. His father, not to be confused with the earlier Dutch explorer of the same name, was a midshipman from Amsterdam. He and his wife were aboard the Leijden, commanded by Claes Hermanszoon, which was charting the coast at the time. Their son's name in Dutch meant \\"sea-born (or sea-birth) of new land\\".From the journal of the Leijden (or Leyden): \\"On the 27th do.

Later articles put her as the second white female, then with historical evidence of convict women having given birth earlier, the claim (originating with a notable descendant) was qualified with the expression \\"free born\\", but even so, genealogists reckon she may have been the twentieth. :Small married Francis Oakes on 27 January 1806; George Oakes and Francis Oakes were two of their sons. ;Victoria *William James Hobart Thorne (25 November 1803 ‚Äì 2 July 1872) was born at Port Phillip, in what was still part of New South Wales but became Victoria, during the short-lived settlement led by Lieutenant-Governor David Collins. Thorne married Elizabeth Norman (c. 1812 ‚Äì 9 January 1876) on 1 January 1830.

The firm merged with Bankers Trust in 1917. History The Astor National Bank of New York was authorized to begin business on February 9, 1898, with initial capital of $300,000. John Jacob Astor IV was the first depositor when the bank opened on February 14, 1898 with George Fisher Baker as president and Charles F. Bevins as cashier. The first days deposits totaled $700,000. The Bank was located in the Astor Court Building, adjoining the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, at 34th Street and Astor Court (just west of Fifth Avenue). It was rumored that Jack Astor was \\"interested in the company and might be active in its management.\\" In 1899, Sixth National Bank (which was founded in 1864), of which Alexander Henry Stevens was then president, consolidated with the Astor National Bank. Stevens then became a vice-president of Astor National Bank, serving in that role until his death in 1916. By 1900, the Bank had $350,000 in capital. From 1906 to 1914, Thomas Cochran served as vice-president of the bank (Cochran became a partner in J.P. Morgan & Company in 1917). Edmund C. Converse served as president of Astor Trust from 1907 to 1917. In 1907, Astor National Bank merged with the New Netherlands Trust Company to become the Astor Trust Company. New Netherland Trust Company had been organized in October 1906 by \\"interests identified with the Bankers' Trust Company\\". After the 1907 consolidation, the Astor Trust Company had capital of $1,250,000, and left the Astor Court Building, and moved to 369 Fifth Avenue and 36th Street where New Netherland Trust was shortly to have begun business. In 1912, during the Pujo Committee inquiry, Astor Trust was included in the presentation that showed that \\"eighteen financial institutions in New York, Chicago, and Boston virtually constituted a 'money trust,' having a voice through the places on the Board of Directors in the management of 134 corporations, with an aggregate capital of $25,325,000,000.\\" Upon questioning by Samuel Untermyer, Scudder informed the committee that the 29 Astor Trust Co. directors held 64 directorships in 17 other banks and trust companies. Also in 1912, it was falsely reported that the Astor Trust Company was merging with the Jefferson and Century Banks. =Subsequent mergers= On April 23, 1917, the Astor Trust Company merged with Bankers Trust, which had been talked of for some time as both banks had a number of directors in common (e.g. Seward Prosser was president of the Bankers and a director of the Astor and Edmund C. Converse was president of the Astor and a director of the Bankers). The Astor continued \\"with no change in management, as the uptown branch of the Bankers Trust Company.\\" The new company had capital of $11,250,000, \\"undivided profit of more than $5,000,000 and deposits of about $300,000,000.\\" Bankers Trust was later acquired by Alex. Brown & Sons in 1997, however, Deutsche Bank agreed to purchase Bankers Trust for $10.1 billion in November 1998. Deutsche Bank sold The Trust and Custody division of Bankers Trust to State Street Corporation in February 2003. =Astor Trust Company building= The Astor Trust Co. Building, 1917. In 1915, the Oceanic Investment Company announced the construction of a new building at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street to replace a commercial building built by the Pottier & Stymus Company (which itself replaced the House of Mansions, which had been built in 1856 by Alexander J. Davis). The new building was named after the Astor Trust Company who was the new building's primary tenant after they took a 21-year lease and agreed to move from their existing offices at 389 Fifth Avenue (and 36th Street) into the new building upon its completion in 1917. Astor's old office was then occupied by the American Red Cross. In the new building: > \\"The ground floor will be devoted to stores, while the Astor Trust Company, > now at Fifth Avenue and Thirty-sixth Street, will occupy the first, second, > and third floors, also using the basement for safe deposit vaults. The main > banking rooms, while occupying three floors, will be arranged as a single > floor, with the ceiling rising thirty-five feet above the main banking room. > Three lofty arched windows will overlook Fifth Avenue from the banking > floor.\\" The building was designed by architect Ernest Flagg, who was known for designing the Thomas Cook building at 565 Fifth Avenue. The Astor Trust Company building was eventually renamed the Bankers' Trust building, which stands to this day. In 1919, Bankers Trust acquired its second uptown location at the northwest corner of Madison Avenue and 57th Street from the Union Trust Company and expanded its main location at 14 Wall Street and Nassau Street by acquiring the property adjacent to their headquarters (which was completed in 1912) from William Waldorf Astor, Baron Astor, for approximately $1,750,000.

Biography and career After graduating from high school in WarsteinAbiturientia 1977, Europa-Gymnasium Warstein (in German) in 1977, Volker Diehl first studied at the Kunstakademie M√ºnster under Hans-J√ºrgen Breuste, and from 1978 art history at the Free University of Berlin. In West Berlin, he supported various artists as part of the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program (including Markus Raetz, Andr√© Thomkins, Wolf Vostell, Dieter Hacker) and got to know Ren√© Block in this context. At the exhibition \\"F√ºr Augen und Ohren\\" curated by Block, which was first shown at the Academy of Arts, Berlin, and then at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris,Gruppenausstellungen, Stephan von Huene (in German) he was also responsible for the support of artists and thus got to know Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, Joe Jones, and many other artists. A little later he became assistant to Shigeko Kubota and ran her studio. From 1981 to 1983 he was assistant to Christos M. Joachimides and Norman Rosenthal. In this context, he supported the artists and worked as personal assistant in the exhibition Zeitgeist (1982), which was \\"arguably one of the most historically significant global painting surveys of the 20th century\\".Odrija Fi≈°ere: At the end, the artwork survives. In: Arterritory.com, 12. August 2016. Together with Roland Hagenberg, he subsequently published the two books Maler in Berlin (1982) and the sequel ... Und (1983) in their own publishing house \\"HAPPY- HAPPY\\", which contained numerous interviews and portraits of artists and collectors, among them Anselm Kiefer, Georg Baselitz and Erich Marx as well as representatives of the art groups Neue Wilde and Arte Cifra. With Roland Hagenberg he traveled New York City, where they conducted interviews with Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe, Keith Haring, Francesco Clemente, Julian Schnabel, Robert Morris, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend, Mary Boone, Tony Shafrazi, and many more. The tapes used turned out later to be defective, so the interviews were never published. Activities as gallery owner In 1983 he began to curate exhibitions at the \\"Galerie Folker Skulima\\" in Berlin as a junior partner and showed young, contemporary artists including Jaume Plensa, Rosemarie Trockel, Leiko Ikemura, Sergey Volkov, Ray Smith and Martin Assig. In September 1990 he took over the rooms at Niebuhrstr. 2 with the founding of \\"Galerie Volker Diehl\\". In 2000 he moved to new rooms at Zimmerstr. in Berlin-Mitte, in 2007 to Lindenstra√üe in the Kreuzberg district.Galerie Volker Diehl, Berlin.de (in German) In autumn 2011 the gallery moved back to the former space at Niebuhrstra√üe in Berlin- Charlottenburg. In September 2013, a project space was added under the name \\"Diehl Cube\\" in Emser Stra√üe in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, in which exhibitions were shown until 2018. In addition, Diehl was the first western gallery owner to open its own exhibition space in Moscow under the name \\"Diehl + Gallery One\\" in April 2008. In the former premises of the state Soviet art trade at Smolenskaja No. 5/13, Diehl exhibited the works of the American artist Jenny Holzer under the title Like truth as the first project from April 17 to June 15, 2008. After other exhibitions by Wim Delvoye, Zhang Huan, Jaume Plensa and Olga Chernysheva, the Moscow branch closed again at the end of 2009. Under the name \\"Diehl Projects\\" Diehl was responsible for further projects, first around 2000 and 2007/2008 in Berlin, later for the exhibition of the Russian artist Olga Chernysheva Adventure Istiklal N. 9 in the \\"Yapi Kredi Kazim Taskent Art Gallery\\" in Istanbul (2009) and two group exhibitions in Rostov-on-Don with the titles Berlin tut gut! and Pubblico ‚Äì Privato (spring 2012). Other projects In 1996 he and 13 other gallery owners were founding members of the art fair \\"art forum berlin\\" and, together with Rudolf Kicken, also managed the business of the company until 2001. It was internationally the first exclusively contemporary art fair and the first fair in the world to be conceived and conducted by gallery owners. With Margarita Pushkina and Vlad Ovcharenko, he established the Russian art fair \\"Cosmoscow\\" in 2010 with an \\"all-inclusive concept\\".Julika Kehb, Natascha Kirchner, Esther Knuth: Galerieprofil Volker Diehl ‚Äì H√§rte und Brutalit√§t.

The station operated from 1973 to 2011. History On February 22, 1972, Paul Smiths applied for a construction permit to build a 10-watt non- commercial educational FM station on 89.1 MHz at the college, which was granted by the Federal Communications Commission on June 27. WPSA signed on for the first time on January 12, 1973; (1972 is a misprint) the station initially operated from the basement of Cooler Dorm, a campus dormitory that was a former meat market. By 1980, the station's operations had relocated to the student council room in Rec Hall. The early 1980s saw the station almost be shut down because of prior mismanagement, resulting in new managers and the radio club instituting a more professional station environment. In 1982, the radio station was described as \\"the most active club on campus\\", broadcasting 18 hours a day, seven days a week. For 1986, the station moved again to the Buxton Annex; it now only broadcast on weekdays for two hours in the morning and then from 2 p.m. to midnight, plus 14 hours a day on weekends. The station was approved to move to 98.3 MHz in 1991. WPSA's license was cancelled and its call letters deleted in 1999 for failure to file a late renewal; the college filed a petition for reconsideration from the FCC, which was granted in 2001. The station was later assessed a $7,000 fine, reduced to $250 per its Class D station status, for the failure to file the renewal. WPSA ceased broadcasting at the end of the fall 2011 semester and surrendered the license to the FCC for cancellation that December. Reasons for the cessation of operations included a lack of interest from students and a potential FCC fine for failure to broadcast the minimum number of hours stipulated by its license.

The series was released on Netflix on May 29, 2020. At their Q2 report meeting in July 2020, Netflix reported the series had been viewed by about 40 million households since its release. In August 2020, it was estimated that 8.3% of subscribers had watched the series over its first month. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of the series has an approval rating of 38% based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 5.78/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"An all-star cast and blockbuster-worthy special effects aren't enough to keep Space Forces uneven blend of earnestness and satire from spinning quickly out of comedic orbit.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Carell, for his \\"impeccable comedic timing and his uncanny ability to play yet another character who's often an insufferable buffoon with not a speck of self-awareness\\" but criticized the hit-and-miss humor, and unrealized potential, saying \\"Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I enjoyed Space Force... It‚Äôs just with all the credentials of the main contributors, we hoped for greatness and got ... pretty good.\\" Caroline Framke of Variety wrote: \\"For all the heft behind it, Space Force should be an easy win. Ten episodes later, it's safer to say that Space Force is really just okay.\\" Rahul Desai of Film Companion gave a mixed review, \\"Space Force is stuck between the space of The Office and the force of Veep.\\" Nick Allen, writing for RogerEbert.com says, \\"Space Force has the supporting characters to color its cringe-worthy absurdity,\\" praising its cast but calling out on the story's incompetence. The Guardian gave the first season of the series only 2 out of 5 saying, \\"Above all, despite occasional laughs to be gleaned from the twist that Malkovich can give the most unpromising of lines, Space Force is not funny, which makes it hard to class as a comedy.\\" Joshua Rivera from The Verge gave Space Force a disappointing review stating that \\"the show falls apart before it even gets going\\", chiefly because the show strays away from the sharp political satire that shows such as Veep had nailed and instead \\"adheres to the conventions of the workplace comedy.\\" References External links Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American workplace comedy television series Category:English- language Netflix original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows about the United States Space Force Category:Television series by 3 Arts Entertainment Category:Television shows set in Colorado Category:Television shows filmed in Los Angeles Category:Television series created by Greg Daniels ","title":"Space Force (TV series)"},{"id":"61892983","text":"The Mountain is an adult album alternative radio station in Pittston, Pennsylvania. The station's website states \\"Independent Radio\\" as part of its mission.http://www.102themountain.com/misc12384.asp Station IDs often include the phrase \\"It's different here.\\" On August 5, 2013 The Mountain moved from its original frequency at 102.3 MHz under the call letters of WDMT to the HD2 sub-channel of 98.5 WKRZ and assumed the call letters WKRZ-HD2. The Mountain and 98.5 KRZ are owned and operated by Entercom Communications including radio stations WKRZ, WGGY, WILK-FM, WILK and most recently WHBS, taking The Mountain's frequency at 102.3 MHz under a new format. On April 26, 2019 The Mountain moved to WGGY's HD2 signal.https://www.facebook.com/102TheMountain/posts/10157375073550039 Format The Mountain built its reputation on a \\"More Music, Less Hype\\" philosophy without typical on-air contests and stereotypical radio. The playlist includes old and new adult rock, many B-side tracks, as well as music from local artists in the Northeastern Pennsylvania region. The Mountain previously featured hosts referred to as \\"Mountain Guides,\\" not DJs. Unlike typical DJs who run many promotions, the guides typically gave background on a musician or song. Great guides such as Lou Fontaine, Jack Meyers, Cathy Donnelly, and Jim Rising shared their passion for music with listeners until the move to the new frequency of 98.5-HD2. Alan K. Stout's \\"Music On The Menu\\" show aired Sundays at 8pm on The Mountain until August 2013. Alan showcases music from local musicians, including interviews and live in-studio performances. Music On The Menu is an exclusive staple of the Northeast PA radio community, and continues to air on WWRR on Sundays at 9pm. This formatting style is similar to those of other \\"Mountain\\" radio stations owned by Entercom, including KHTP in Seattle. Previous formats The station previously operated as 102.3 Rebel Radio in the early 1990s, formatted after MTV. Playing the glam metal bands (hip hop added later) and wild station imaging brought Rebel Radio many critics. The station died about the same time as glam metal lost popularity. It later reverted to Q-102, a Top 40 format and later Kiss 102.3 through the mid-1990s. Low ratings finally saw the change in ownership and change in formats. Buzz 102 played all '80s music, much of which consisted of shows syndicated from other markets. Ratings began to drop as this format began to wear out after about two years. It was at that point that the station began operating as The Mountain. Digital radio The Mountain's digital signal requires an HD Radio receiver. The Mountain also streams via its website.

Two separate High Court cases were brought together for the purposes of this appeal: :1. Carson, R v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions & Anor (2002) EWHC 978 (Admin) from the Administration Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales before The Honourable Mr. Justice Stanley Burnton; :2. Reynolds, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] EWHC 426 (Admin) (7th March, 2002) from the Administration Court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales before Mr. Justice Wilson. The two litigants in this case were Annette Carson and Joanne Reynolds. This case was a UK labour law and Human Rights Act 1998 case on \\"Right to property\\" under Article 1 of the First Protocol (Protection of Property) and Article 14 of the Convention (Prohibition of Discrimination. In Reynolds's case, there was also Article 8 - the right to respect for \\"private and family life\\" to consider.  Background  Carson contended that the failure of the UK Government to pay the annual inflationary increase to the UK State Pension in some countries but not others contravened the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and that she and many others were being discriminated against. She had found that the annual increase to the UK State Pension is payable in countries like the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA) and a number of disparate countries (the United States, for example), whilst not being payable in predominantly Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Carson claimed that under Article 1 her state pension, or alternatively its uprating, are \\"pecuniary rights\\", and therefore ‚Äúpossessions‚Äù within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol and Article 14. In her original case, Justice Burnton had found in favour of the UK Government, citing that the judiciary should not override legislative UK government policy. Reynolds was born on 9 November 1976. When she left school she began work and continued to work until she was made redundant on 12 October 2000. Whilst she was working she paid National Insurance Contributions. On 24 October 2000 she applied for Jobseeker's Allowance and it was paid with effect from that date. There are two different types of Jobseeker's Allowance - ‚ÄúJSA(C)‚Äù which is based on National Insurance Contributions paid over a prescribed minimum period and is not means-tested - the other ‚ÄúJSA(IB)‚Äù is income-based and a Means-tested benefit. Reynolds was paid the lesser of the two amounts and therefore was taking civil action against the UK Government saying that the UK Government's action was incompatible with Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention; and under Article 14 of the convention she claimed she was being discriminated against because of her age; and under Article 8 of the ECHR (respect for her private life and her home); and finally her right not to be subjected to degrading treatment under Article 3 of ECHR (the prohibition of torture, and \\"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\"). Reynolds could not return to work so instead of receiving the Job Seeker's Allowance she received Income Support which continued to be paid to her. She was under 25 at the time and lived in social housing. She received ¬£41.35 a week and if she was over 25 she would have received ¬£52.20 per week. The UK Government said that 18- to 24-year-olds earn less and mostly do not live independently. They should be discouraged from living independently and there is welfare support for this group in other ways.  Judgment  = Carson = Carson contended that Regulation 3 of the Social Security Benefits Uprating Regulation was \\"repugnant\\" to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1P because it discriminated against her based on the fact that she had relocated to South Africa for work purposes. para 15 In addition, it was beyond the powers of this Regulation in violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 1P because it discriminated against Carson on grounds of her \\"place of residence\\" without any \\"objective and reasonable justification\\". The Regulation also constituted a violation of Article 1P taken on its own. The UK Government claimed that, in the original hearing, Justice Burnton should have dismissed the case from the beginning, since there was certain evidence that should not have been introduced in regard to Article 1: \\"a signatory State is only obliged to secure the Convention rights for the benefit of persons residing within its territorial jurisdiction\\". However, Justice Burnton had stated that Article 1 did not operate so as to bar Carson's claim. The UK Government stated that it would cost at least a ¬£100 million to uprate the state pension universally, that this would have to come out of general taxation, and would deprive pensioners living in the UK from future increases because there would be no funds available which the court accepted. However, Carson contended that \\"cost should not constitute a legitimate justification\\". paras 70 & 71 Lord Justice Laws concluded that Article 1P on its own, had not been violated. para 23, and in his opinion the most important aspect was whether Article 14 read with Article 1P was violated. para 16 He concluded, based on the facts of the case, that he could not see how any exercise of Article 1P right was involved such as might engage Article 14. para 33 Lord Justice Laws then considered Article 14 read with Article 1 of the First Protocol, with regard to Carson's \\"place of residence\\", and in that aspect, he was not convinced that there was any discrimination at all. Looking at Article 14 on its own, Carson was asked if they could find a similar cohort of pensioners to her where they were given the annual uprating and thereby showing that she was being discriminated against. Carson identified two such groups: para 51 \\\\- namely, pensioners, who like Carson lived abroad, but in countries where the annual uprating was being paid, and pensioners living in the UK, all of whom are paid the annual uprating to their UK state pension. The UK Government's position had always been: : \\"Successive Governments have taken the view that the level of increases in retirement pensions relates to conditions in the UK and that it would not be right to impose an additional burden on contributors and taxpayers in the UK in order to pay pension increases to people who have chosen to become resident elsewhere in the world....motions to pay the annual uprating to Carson (and others in her position) were submitted to both Houses of Parliament in June and July 1995 during the passage of the Pensions Bill, which called for uprating to be paid. All were defeated by large majorities\\". para 52 The UK only uprates the state pension where there is a legal liability to do so - this includes all UK pensioners living in the UK, the EEA, and a number of other countries where there are bilateral social security agreements in place, Whilst there are bilateral agreements with Australia (1953), New Zealand (1956) and Canada (1959), they did not include the uprating of the UK state pension. Australia cancelled its agreement with the UK in 2001 because the UK Government would not uprate the State Pension for those UK pensioners who had emigrated to Australia. This was not an issue when the UK joined the EEC since bilateral agreements were in place for all of the EEC countries except Denmark. These bilateral agreements did facilitate the uprating of the UK State Pension. para 53 Lord Justice Laws conceded that the current situation was \\"haphazard\\", quoting the UK Minister of State Jeff Rooker who, on 13 November 2000, said: : \\"I have already said I am not prepared to defend the logic of the present situation. It is illogical. There is no consistent pattern. It does not matter whether it is in the Commonwealth or outside it. We have arrangements with some Commonwealth countries and not with others. Indeed, there are differences among Caribbean countries. This is an historical issue and the situation has existed for years. It would cost some ¬£300 million to change the policy for all concerned‚Ä¶\\". para 54 Lord Justice Laws concluded that the UK Government would not need to create new bilateral agreements in order to uprate the State Pension universally. para 66 However, giving the \\"annual uprating\\", or taking it away is entirely a rightful decision by the UK Government. para 67 Based on literature produced by the DSS, Carson had no right to expect her State Pension to be uprated, given her decision to relocate to South Africa for work purposes. para 68 Lord Justice Laws referred to R v DPP, ex p. Kebilene. para 73 : \\"In some circumstances it will be appropriate for the courts to recognize that there is an area of judgment within which the judiciary will defer, on democratic grounds, to the considered opinion of the elected body or person whose act or decision is said to be incompatible with the Convention\\". Lord Justice Laws dismissed Carson's appeal, and he quoted from Corner v United Kingdom (Application No. 11271/84, decision of 17 May 1985, unpublished): para 74 :\\"The Commission has held that the 'freezing' of a pension at a particular level when a person leaves the United Kingdom does not amount to a deprivation of possessions infringing Article 1 of the Protocol. (Dec. No. 9776/82, 10.83 to be published in D.R. 34). Moreover, the different treatment of persons entitled to pensions who remain in the country of payment compared with those who emigrate is justified on the grounds that the applicant will only lose the benefit of future increases in the pension, whose purpose broadly speaking is to compensate for rises in the cost of living in the United Kingdom and which the applicant will not have to endure (Dec. No. 9776/82, loc. cit.). The Commission also considers that the economic state of third countries is not a matter which domestic pension authorities should be obliged to consider.\\" = Reynolds = Reynolds had been given leave to appeal on a limited basis. There were no grounds to support her case regarding Articles 3, 8 or Article 1P, but taking Article 14 with Article 1P, she may have a supportable case for arbitrary discrimination. para 14. Justice Laws determined that \\"income support\\" did constitute a \\"possession\\" as far as Artcle1P was concerned. para 17 With regard to Article 14 read with Article 8, Lord Justice Laws believed that no argument could be made to support Reynolds' claim when taking these two Articles together. para 29 The next question he considered was whether Income Support was a \\"possession\\" with regard to Article 1P for the purpose of Article 14. para 30, and he concluded that Article 1P on its own, had not been violated. para 23 Lord Justice Laws then considered Article 14 read with Article 1 of the First Protocol, with regard to Reynolds's claim of age discrimination para 30 Lord Justice Laws then determined that there had been a violation of Article 14 taken with Article 1P but only as far as the Job Seekers Allowance\\" was concerned. With respect to \\"income support\\", there was no violation. paras 38-49 Lord Justice Laws dismissed Reynold's appeal because \\"in my view, the Secretary of State has demonstrated a perfectly reasonable justification for the differential payments of Job Seeker's Allowance.\\" = Carson and Reynolds = In Lord Justice Law's opinion with both of the appeals, the most important aspect was whether Article 14 read with Article 1P was violated. para 16 The UK Government argued that Article 1P only applies to a person's existing possessions, and that it does not include the right to \\"acquire\\" possessions at a future date. In addition they also contended, that the amount of the benefit \\"cannot constitute an interference with the right given by Article1P, rather it merely defines the property right\\". This position has been consistently supported by the courts in the European Union. paras 18 & 19 If Carson was not discriminated based on her \\"place of residence\\" and Reynolds was not discriminated against based on her age, was there an objective and reasonable justification for such discrimination? Lord Justice Rix agreed with Lord Justice Laws, in dismissing both appeals, as did Lord Justice Brown, and leave was not given to appeal to the House of Lords refused. On 17 July 2003, Carson was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords.

The station opened in 1885 as the terminus of the Main Western line. Passenger trains to Bourke ceased in 1975 when the rail service beyond Dubbo was replaced by road coaches. NSW TrainLink continues to serve the station precinct by coach. The property belongs to the Country Regional Network (CRN), which is owned by Transport for NSW and operated by John Holland Rail.  History  By 1877, there was significant political pressure to minimise the diversion of trade from western New South Wales to Victoria and South Australia via river trade along the Darling and Murray rivers.McKillop, B. \\"Developing the Inland: The Great Western Railway to Bourke\\". Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin. Vol 53, no 779. September 2002. The town of Bourke had become the key centre for pastoralists in western New South Wales since its formation in 1861. Provision was thus made to extend the line to Dubbo, reaching Wellington in 1880 and Dubbo in 1881. At the time, Dubbo had grown into a town of strategic importance on the stock routes between northern New South Wales and the Victorian goldfields. Beyond Dubbo, the railway opened up new land to European settlement, and was directly responsible for the development of townships. The line reached the future site of Narromine in 1883, and the railway station was the first building in the future settlement. The line reached the site of Nevertire in 1882, serving the nearby established village of Warren (a branch opened to Warren in 1898). Construction reached the site of Nyngan in 1883, with the nearby coach-stop village of Canonbar moving in its entirely to establish the town of Nyngan. Beyond Nyngan, the line swept across the plains in a straight line for , then the longest stretch of straight railway line in the world. It reached the temporary terminus of Byrock in 1884 before reaching its final destination of Bourke in 1885.\\"Developing the Inland - The Great Western Railway to Bourke\\" MacKillop, Bob Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, September, 2002 pp328-340 The now-gone Station Master's residence was completed in the same year. A loading bank was built in 1890. A small coal stage, depot and drivers' barracks were added in 1891. In 1965, the station building was destroyed by a fire. It was replaced in 1968, becoming the first station building in New South Wales to be air-conditioned. The last freight train to Bourke ran 1989.  Services  NSW regional rail network Bourke was served by the Far West Express, which connected with the Western Mail from Sydney Central at Dubbo. The Far West Express was withdrawn by the Public Transport Commission on 20 September 1975 and was substituted by coaches. A NSW TrainLink coach service runs from Bourke to Dubbo. From Dubbo, the Central West Express operates to Central. In 2018, NSW TrainLink began trialling a day-return coach service from Bourke to Dubbo, as well as from Brewarrina to Dubbo. The service, running on Wednesday and Thursday, travels to Dubbo in the morning and returns in the evening.  Heritage listing  The 1968 station building at Bourke is notable as the first railway station building in NSW to be air conditioned. The site is also significant as one of the more remote railway precincts in NSW. The Bourke Railway Precinct was listed on the NSW State agency heritage register via s.170 of the Heritage Act, having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in NSW. The station building has some technical significance as the first railway station to be air conditioned in NSW.

He is most noted for his contributions to the programming languages Smalltalk, Squeak, and Apple Computer's HyperCard system, and other technologies developed at Xerox PARC.  Background  Kaehler is a son of a mechanical engineer and grew up tinkering with mechanical toys. During the 1960s, he built a computer on his own following an article published in Scientific American. He went to Gunn High School, a public school in Palo Alto, California. He graduated in 1968. While in high school, Kaehler was accepted to a summer job at then named Fairchild Industries. During this work, he learned the programming language Fortran. During his high school days, he was introduced to his first computer, an IBM 1620, operated by the Palo Alto Unified School District. Kaehler then attended Stanford University to study physics, studied programming under Donald Knuth, learned the language APL, and met Dan Ingalls. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in physics in 1972. Later, Xerox began a pilot program with Gunn High School, loaning them a Xerox Alto.  Xerox PARC  Ingalls introduced Kaehler to PARC when he secured a contract with Xerox. They formed a team that included George White, who was already with the company working on speech recognition software. During his early years at PARC, he attended Carnegie Mellon University. He graduated with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in computer science in 1976. By the 1980s, he was reportedly demonstrating a virtual reality (VR) technology that involved a user in Maze War 3D game. This depiction successfully voiced a response in-world to another user in the real world. The development has been touted as the first avatar- centric reference to this kind of VR technology. Kaehler was also documented as one of the researchers at PARC who briefed Steve Jobs about the company's three innovations: the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Xerox Alto computer, Smalltalk, and Ethernet network at PARC. = Smalltalk = Kaehler was part of a group led by Dr. Alan Kay who refined the concept of network computing through Smalltalk. This is a system that drew from John McCarthy's language LISP and from simulation programming language Simula, versions 1 and 67, which were developed by the Norwegian Computing Center. In Kay's account of Smalltalk's early development, he cited key milestones attributed to Kaehler. According to Kay, along with Ingalls, Dave Robson, and Diana Merry, for instance, Kaehler successfully implemented the Smalltalk-76 system from scratch within a period of seven months. It constituted 50 classes that composed 180 pages of source code. Kaehler was also credited for designing the virtual memory system named Object-Oriented Zoned Environment (OOZE). This system gave Smalltalk more speed, and the development of a system tracer used to clone Smalltalk-76 since the technology can write out new virtual memories from their prior iterations. With Smalltalk, Kaehler worked closely with two future Turing Award winners. He began a lifelong professional association with Alan Kay, as described herein. Kaehler also co-authored a book, A Taste of Smalltalk, with University of California, Berkeley professor David Patterson, future leader of the RISC-V movement.  Apple  Squeak's EToys In March 1985, Kaehler moved to Apple as a researcher. He became involved in the development of Macintosh computers, primarily providing technical support. However, Kaehler was more noted for improving other technologies such as the company's HyperCard system from 1985 to 1987. This is a tool that allows users to create entertainment and instructional content. Kaehler added an interface that made it possible to control videodiscs. In 1996, while at Apple, Kaehler received a US patent for co-inventing user interface intermittent on-demand (pop up) halos around objects, with buttons to manipulate that object. = Squeak = Kaehler also became part of the open-source software community- supported Squeak Central Team in 1996, which also included Ingalls, John Maloney, Scott Wallace, and Andreas Raab. It was initially developed out of the Smalltalk-80 at Apple Research Laboratory and was later continued at Walt Disney Imagineering. Squeak was developed as an open and highly-portable language that is written fully in Smalltalk and included the EToys system, which allows children to see the software operation. The use of Smalltalk technology allows Squeak to be easier to debug, analyze, and change. Kaehler was credited for writing the code of the platform's painting system, Squeak Paintbox, and other EToys pilot versions.  Personal life  In 1982, Kaehler wed Carol Nasby, who also worked at Apple for several years, wrote the first Macintosh Owners Guide, built the HyperCard Help System for version 1.0, and wrote the book HyperCard Power. In 1991, she died from complications of Type 1 diabetes. In 1998, he wed his second wife Cynthia. She was a former preschool teacher for 25 years, and an artist who made fused glass pendants for necklaces and broaches. They lived in Las Vegas, Nevada and had three children. In 2020, she died from cancer.

The historian Johann Strauss wrote that Konstantinoupolis \\"was long to remain the most widely read Greek paper in the Ottoman Empire.\\" (info page on book at Martin Luther University) // Cited: p. 29 (PDF p. 31). An employee, Manuel Gedeon,Balta and Kavak, p. 37. stated that the style of the periodical was similar to that of Revue des Deux Mondes.Balta and Kavak, p. 35. According to historians Evangelia Balta and Ay»ôe Kavak, Konstantinoupolis \\"went down in the history of the Istanbul press as setting the seal on [Ottoman Greek newspaper and legal code publisher Demetrius Nicolaides]'s career in journalism\\".Balta and Kavak, p. 36-37. They also wrote that its popularity was reflected by the long length of publication.Balta and Kavak, p. 55. The newspaper was published daily for much of its history, though initially it was a thrice weekly publication. History Eptalofos Nea Ioannis M. Raptarchis owned a periodical named Heptalophos. Nicolaides became the editor in 1864, and in 1865 Raptarchis sold it to him. Initially Nicolaides renamed it Eptalofos Nea/Nea Eptalofos, with the first new issue in 15 January of that year.Balta and Kavak, p. 33. Publication in a by newspaper format began in 1867, and after six months of newspaper publication it was given the name Konstantinoupolis.Balta and Kavak, p. 36. Publication as a periodical stopped in 1871. At times the Ottoman authorities enacted censorship, so publication did not occur for circa 1783 until 1884. As more and more Greeks adopted the Megali Idea, clashing with Nicolaides' Ottomanist beliefs,Balta and Kavak, p. 57. the readership decreased in the 1900s and 1910s. Nicolaides' son Nikolakis \\"Nikos\\" received the publication in June 1909 (mid-1327 in the Ottoman calendar) after their father asked the Ottoman Press office, in summer 1905 (start of Ottoman calendar 1326) to allow for a change of ownership as he was becoming elderly. Because Nicolaidis tried to save the newspaper no matter what it took, he sold his possessions and lost his wealth.Balta and Kavak, p. 56. Balta and Kavak concluded, therefore, that the newspaper also caused \\"his financial ruin\\". Publication stopped for good in 1914, when World War I broke out. Contents The Konstantinoupolis newspaper had political news and commentary for the first two pages, and letters to the editor and other news on the third page. Classifieds and announcements were on page four. The Nea Eptalofos periodical version had three sections. The first was for literary and science articles, some Greek versions of content from European journals and some initially published in Nea Eptalofos. The second discussed ethnic Greek notable figures and home economics and other personal content.Balta and Kavak, p. 34. The third was dedicated to poetry and literary fiction, with some translations from European publications, as well as tourism-related content and content about the Byzantine Empire.Balta and Kavak, p. 34-35. Nea Eptalofos included German studies of the Turks, including a glossary of terminology related to administration, Oghuz Turkish history, and where the Turkish people came from. Balta and Kavak stated that this was the first publication in the Greek language to have such content. Political stances The newspaper favored the Rum Millet,Balta and Kavak, p. 38. the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Joachim III. Balta and Kavak stated that it had a \\"moderate stance\\" in regards to the \\"Bulgarian Question\\". The editors opposed illegal activity.Balta and Kavak, p. 39.

Additionally, she was an editor of the Journal of African Development (JAD) between 2017 and 2018. Dr Asiedu is also a founder and president of the Association for the Advancement of African Women (AAAWE). She sat on the board of the National Economic Association between 2016 and 2019. Asiedu is a member of the following; * Global Research Competition Steering Committee, Global Development Network, India, October 2011-Present * Distinguished External Reference Group, The African Capacity Building Foundation, Zimbabwe, April 2012-Present * Member of a four-scholar international panel committee to conduct a ten-year review of The United Nations University/ World Institute of Development and Economic Research (UNU/WIDER), Finland, May 2010-January 2011  Research and selected publications  = Access to Credit by Small Businesses: How Relevant Are Race, Ethnicity, and Gender? (2012) = In this article, Asiedu, James A. Freeman, and Akwasi Nti-Addae explore the role of race, ethnicity, and gender on credit access. Their study categorizes race and ethnicity into the following: Black, Hispanic, Asian/Native American/Pacific Islander (ANP), White female, and White male. They find that firms owned by visible minorities have a higher denial rate with the highest denial rate for Hispanics. Additionally, the denial rate for has increased between 1998 and 2003. Finally, they find that minority-owned firms also paid higher interests than the White-male owned firms. In terms of gender, they find that firms owned by White women did not experience discrimination when accessing credit, and they also paid less interest rates own loans than their male counterparts. Their study showcases that factors such as race, ethnicity and gender do in fact affect access to credit and interest paid on loans. = Does Foreign Aid In Education Promote Economic Growth? (2014) = The paper \\"Does Foreign Aid in Education Promote Economic Growth? Evidence From Sub-Saharan Africa\\" explores whether the foreign aid that is aimed towards education is effective in primary education and secondary education in sub-Saharan Africa. Asiedu‚Äôs study focuses on 38 countries from 1990-2004. She argues that although educational financial aid is positively related to growth (because it provides resources such as books, training for teachers, etc.) this is only the case for primary education. Educational financial aid in secondary education, on the other hand, does not contribute to economic growth, in fact it may have an adverse effect on growth. This is because of the lack of employment for secondary school graduates (which she suggests is true to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa), she suggests that another reason why this might be true is the lack of quality secondary education (such that increased time spent in school has no benefits). Furthermore, she argues that this might be true because many secondary school graduates are employed in jobs that are low in productivity, thus reducing the potential for economic growth. Finally, she argues that there is a lack of physical capital and other ‚Äúcomplementary inputs‚Äù in Sub-Saharan Africa that would otherwise encourage productive labour in the region. = The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Foreign Direct Investment (2015) = In the paper \\"The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Foreign Direct Investment: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa,\\" Asiedu alongside Jin and Kanyama illuminate the relationship between HIV/AIDS and foreign direct investment (FDI). They examine this in 41 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and their model concludes that FDI is inversely related to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection for a number of reasons; on of which is that workers that are healthy are more productive, multinational companies (MNCs) that seek to establish themselves in Sub-Saharan Africa would consider the health of the population. Health of the labour force is important because it effects absenteeism and thus overall productivity. Secondly, their model suggests that the negative externalities associated with HIV/AIDS (high morbidity and mortality rates which may affect coworkers that are not infected too). They find that reducing the infection rate will encourage FDI, and thus encourage economic development in Sub- Saharan Africa. = Remittances and Investment in Education (2015) = The paper \\"Remittances and Investment in Education: Evidence from Ghana\\" analyses remittances (both international and domestic) in Ghana, and how they affect the likelihood of enrolment in both primary and secondary education. Asiedu and Kwabena Gyimah-Brempong argue that the increase in remittances to less developed countries (LDCs) such as Ghana not only have a positive effect on the GDP (making up about 5.5% of Ghana‚Äôs GDP in 2011), but this in turn allows for households in Ghana to invest in human capital as it eases financial constraints. Additionally, this paper argues that this effect is more observable when the household is headed by a female, and that the increase in investment in human capital allows for long term poverty alleviation in Ghana. The paper uses cross-sectional data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) from waves 5, as well as pseudo-panel data from GLSS waves 3-5 thus has a wide research base. Asiedu and Gyimah-Brempong use this data to analyze the data with the resource constraint model. = Foreign Direct Investment, Natural Resources, and Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa (2015) = In the paper \\"Foreign Direct Investment, Natural Resources, and Employment in Sub- Saharan Africa,\\" Asiedu, Komla Dzigbede and Akwasi Nti-Addae explore the rise of oil production and in Sub-Saharan Africa and its effect on foreign direct investment FDI, they authors also question the impact of FDI in Sub-Saharan Africa. They suggest that although FDI may be a vital factor in aiding economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, this economic growth is mostly accrued by the employment created by multinational corporations (MNCs) as these companies usually pay their employees higher wages than domestic companies. The authors use Tullow Oil, plc as an example to show the region‚Äôs growing share of world oil production as well as to explore the role of MNCs FDI in terms of development and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, they emphasize that the propensity to encourage economic growth or development is highly dependent on the type of FDI - FDI in manufacturing creates more employment than FDI in extractive industries like oil. Additionally, the authors argue that the success of FDI is also dependent on other factors such as the education level in a given country, making it the much more difficult to truly benefit from FDI in just about any industry.

Description  In 1890, Scribner‚Äôs Magazine dispatched American painter Robert Frederick Blum to Japan to illustrate a series of articles (written by Sir Edwin Arnold) the magazine was publishing. Blum occupied a small house in Toyko for two years, and traveled through the country in search of scenes to illustrate. The Ameya was created by Blum during the later period of his stay in Japan. The work depicts an ameya, a candy maker practicing the art of Amezaiku; Blum himself described the ameya's work as being akin to glassblowing. Following his return to the United States, Blum's work was well received, particularly at the 1893 exhibition of the National Academy of Design‚ÄîBlum later credited The Ameya with securing his election to the Academy. A critic for the New York Times praised the work's use of multiple subjects in varied dress, and described it as being \\"admirably painted\\".

It empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Location The Pigou rises on the Laurentian Plateau and empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence about east of Sept-√éles. The river rises in Petit lac Travers at an elevation of . It is about long. The river flows south through the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Nipissis. The East Pigou River, a small tributary, enters about from its mouth. The mouth of the Pigou River is in the municipality of Sept- √éles, Sept-Rivi√®res. Name The name \\"Pigou\\" may come from the Algonquin language pikiou meaning \\"gum\\", referring to a place where resin is extracted from fir or pine, or from the Innu language pikiou meaning \\"fish\\". The name is also used for nearby islands and a fishing bank. Another theory, less likely, is that \\"pigou\\" is an old navy term for a hanging candle holder. The Pigou River is first mentioned by name in 1892 by the surveyor C. C. Duberger who wrote that \\"the Pigou River is small and does not appear to be long\\". Description According to the Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1914), Basin The river basin covers . It lies between the basins of the Loups Marins River and the Bouleau River. It covers part of the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Nipissis and part of the municipality of Sept-√éles. The bedrock is Precambrian, covered in typical boreal vegetation. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Pigou River in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. Salmon Anadromous Atlantic salmon are blocked by a waterfall above the head of the tidal stretch. The gradient of the section of the river below the waterfall is . This section has large pools separated by short sections of rapids. The bed of the river is fine Champlain sediment in parts, bare rock in other parts. Between 1984 and 2017 there were only two reported catches of salmon in the river, both in 1998. In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec. In 2017 all salmon, large and small, had to be released on the Malbaie (Gasp√© Peninsula), Pigou, Bouleau, Magpie, Coacoachou, N√©tagamiou, Little Mecatina and V√©co rivers. Only young salmon could be retained on 51 rivers, and limited retention of large salmon was allowed on 19 rivers.

They are similar to the physically unable to perform and injured reserve lists. Active/NFI Players who report to training camp injured or ill due to injuries or illnesses sustained outside of NFL practices or games can be placed on the active/non-football injury or active/non-football illness lists while they recover. A player cannot remain on an NFI list if they participate in a practice or game during the preseason. Players on these lists still count towards the 90-man roster limits prior to the start of the regular season. If a player on the active/NFI list is still injured or ill by the final roster cutdown date, they can be placed on the reserve/non-football injury or reserve/non-football illness lists and not count towards the 53-man roster limit. Reserve/NFI Players on the reserve/non-football injury or reserve/non-football illness lists are ineligible to practice or play in games for the first six weeks of the regular season. After six weeks, a player can begin practicing with their team but cannot be moved to the active roster until after the team has played its first eight games of the season. When a player starts practicing, a three-week window begins in which the player can be moved to the active roster. If a player does not get activated after the three-week window ends, they must remain on the reserve/NFI list for the rest of the season. Only up to two players from the NFI lists are eligible to return to the active roster for each NFL team. NFL teams are not required to pay base salaries to players placed on the reserve/non-football injury or reserve/non-football illness lists. Notable examples Willis McGahee spent his entire rookie season on the Buffalo Bills' non-football injury list due to the major knee injury he sustained in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl while in college.

Linked to the Nouvelle Droite (ND), he was a member of the now disbanded neo-nazi CEDADE.  Biography  He was born in 1950. In his youth he served as chief of the Madrilenian delegation of the Barcelona-based neo-nazi organisation CEDADE, established on 30 March 1973; he shared membership with his brother Jes√∫s, responsible for the Foreign Relations department of the organisation. He was editor along his brother of the national-socialist magazines Ruta Solar and Cuadernos de Cultura Vertical. He worked as secretary of Jorge Verstrynge during the latter's spell in People's Alliance. He has studied in deep the work of Japanese author Yukio Mishima. He was a founder and chief editor of the esotheric magazine Punto y Coma (1983‚Äì1989),; as well as other publications such as Graal (1975‚Äì1977), Veintiuno (1989‚Äì2003) and Proximo Milenio (1994‚Äì1996). In Punto y Coma, Palacios does not fully assume the ideas of the French Nouvelle Droite vis-√†- vis its neopagan matrix, to the extent the latter considers Christianism an usurper, as Palacios rather espoused a balance between paganism and christianism. Between 1989 and 2003 he gave summer courses in Sciences of Communication at the Complutense University of Madrid. A member of the new- rightist Grupo Aurora and Hesp√©rides, he was editor of the esoteric Pr√≥ximo Milenio until 1996 (he remained as standout collaborator then). He was also editor of the M√°s All√° magazine in the 1990s. He endorsed the 2002 \\"Manifesto Against the Death of the Spirit and the Earth\\" manifesto (although he is not featured as signatory). Described as a figure \\"with an ample experience in the diffussion of an autochthonous new-right discourse\\", Palacios formed along Abel Posse, Aquilino Duque, Fernando S√°nchez Drag√≥ and Jos√© Javier Esparza the coalescing nucleus of the \\"Grupo Manifiesto\\", while also collaborating for the El Manifiesto magazine. Palacio has been a fellow participant in Radio Nacional de Espa√±a programmes and has collaborated in TV shows presented by S√°nchez Drag√≥.

The symphony is dedicated to Russian music critic and teacher Semyon Kruglikov. History =Background= After contracting tuberculosis in 1893 while serving as conductor of the Maly Theatre in Moscow, Kalinnikov moved to Yalta for a more salubrious climate. It was there that he composed his first symphony. Upon completion in 1895, the symphony‚Äôs score was sent to its dedicatee Kruglikov, who was both Kalinnikov's teacher and financial benefactor. Kruglikov recommended the work to the country's leading conductors. =Premiere= The symphony was premiered in 1897 at the Russian Music Society in Kiev. It was conducted by Alexsandr Vinogradsky and was received well by the audience, who gave the second and third movements an encore. The success of the premiere was followed by performances in Vienna, Paris, London, and Berlin.  Instrumentation  The symphony is scored for: Woodwinds: :piccolo :2 flutes :2 oboes :cor anglais :2 clarinets :2 bassoons Brass: :4 horns :2 trumpets :3 trombones :tuba Percussion: :timpani :triangle Strings: :harp :violins I, II :violas :cellos :double basses Form The symphony is in four movements: The first movement is in sonata form and opens with the main theme played in unison strings. The second theme is also presented by the strings, with woodwinds in the background. The development section is contrapuntal in nature, reminiscent of the fugues Kalinnikov composed in the 1880s. The second movement opens with an ostinato of the harp and first violins that leads into a solo for the cor anglais. Then the movement's main theme is played by the oboe to pizzicato strings. The third movement, a scherzo, contains Russian folk-music influences and melodies and includes a trio played in the woodwinds. The Finale opens with the first movement's main theme before revisiting and transforming themes from all previous movements as well as incorporating new themes derived from old ones.

Since September 2016, the organization has been led by Yohan Benizri. The organization is a member of the World Jewish Congress and the European Jewish Congress.  Foundation  The CCOJB was founded in Brussels on 26 March 1969 as the Belgian Section of the World Jewish Congress. The aim of the organization was the \\"defense, study and development of Jewish values in Belgium and the world\\". In 1984, the organization changed its name to the Coordinating Committee of Jewish Organizations in Belgium.  History  = Assassination of Joseph Wybran = h√¥pital universitaire √ârasme assassin√© le 3 octobre 1989 In December 1988, Joseph Wybran, head of the Immunology department at Erasmus Hospital, became president of the CCOJB. One of the key moments of his presidency surrounded the controversy of the Auschwitz cross, a moment that led to one of the largest crises in Judeo-Christian relations since The Holocaust. On 3 October 1989, Wybran was leaving the hospital when he was attacked in the parking garage. Struck on the head, he died from his wounds the night of 3‚Äì4 October. Quickly the motive was deemed to be antisemitism, with the Abu Nidal Organization and Polish Catholic extremists being the first suspects. It wasn't until 18 February 2018 that more facts were determined in the case. Due to a hack in Morocco against a terrorist network led by Belgian Moroccan Abdelkader Belliraj, a dossier was on the murder of Wybran surfaced. Since then, Belliraj has confessed to personally killing Wybran. After several delays, a trial for Belliraj and 34 other Islamists began in Rabat on 26 December 2008. = Response to Anti-Israel protests = Protests in Brussels following the 2008‚Äì09 War in Gaza marked a turning point for the organization. Then-president of the CCOJB Maurice Sosnowski said \\"While some people called for the deaths of Jews, minimizing the Holocaust and presenting Jews as the true masters of the world, what was more shocking to us was not the appearance of Belgian democratic representatives in the crowd but the absence of a political reaction to these anti-Semitic protests of another age. Radical Anti-Zionism is antisemitism because of the calls of hatred of Jews.\\" Affirming that the majority of Belgian Jews supported the idea of a \\"free, independent, and sovereign Palestine\\" , Sosnowski suggested that a United Nations vote on the Recognition of a Palestinian state does not obscure the fact that Hamas is inspired by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Following a 2011 protest in front of the Israeli Embassy in Brussels, the CCOJB \\"called on protesters to focus their energies on those who want to see Palestinian and Israeli children grow up with mutual respect and accepting one another's differences.\\"  The \\" Psychodrame Nakba \\" Affair  Psychodrame Nakba √† Nivelles On 24 May 2008, pro-Palestinian activists organized a performance theatre piece called \\"Psychodrame Nakba\\", meant to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the exodus of 725,000 Palestinian civilians from their homes by Israeli soldiers. During the demonstration, Belgian MP Th√©r√®se Snoy (Ecolo) denounced the plight of the Palestinians, the inaction of Europe and the \\"pressure of certain Jewish groups\\" that operate \\"at all levels\\". Andr√© Flahaut, Parti Socialiste MP and former Minister of Defence said \\"I am determined to fight against all forms of extremism, Nazism, Fascism, whenever and wherever they occur. That's why I'm here.\\" Psychodrame Nakba √† Nivelles The CCOJB filmed the protest and shared the video. Numerous Jewish organizations condemned the protest, including the Israeli Embassy. Feeling unjustly painted as anti-semitic, Flahaut sued the CCOJB and its president in court. He received one Euro (plus interest) in damages, while the CCOJB and its president aimed to appeal the decision. Snoy declared that she had made \\"absolutely no antisemitic remarks\\" and categorically rejected the grave accusation. A later appeal would definitively rule against Flahaut in his case against the CCOJB and its president Jo√´l Rubinfeld. \\"The Court recognizes that Andre Flahaut's remarks draw a parallel between Israeli policies and Nazism. On the other hand, neither the CCOJB nor its ex-president accused Flahaut of anti-semitism. In the esteem of the court, they did not violate their freedom of expression.\\" The court ruled that Flahaut had to pay the costs for the proceedings. In 2011 a similar performance piece took place in downtown Brussels and at Brussels Airport which included the simulated murder of Palestinian children at the hands of actors dressed as Israeli soldiers. This led to criticism of Brussels-Capital Region' s Council, who authorised the event while at the same time banning a Jewish counterprotest \\"for fear of not being able to ensure its security\\" = Nazi apologists =  The Canvas/Hitler Scandal  On 28 October 2008, the Flemish television channel Canvas planned to broadcast an episode of their culinary show Plat pr√©f√©r√© on the favorite meal of Adolf Hitler. Many people, organizations and channels were critical of the program putting the former Nazi leader on the same level as Jacques Brel, Salvador Dal√≠, Maria Callas or Freddie Mercury. The night before Canvas aired the episode, the CCOJB released a statement denouncing the \\"indigestible and irresponsible mix of genres that contribute to the banality of a person who symbolizes absolutely evil\\" and \\"the shocking lack of sensibility that those who conceived of this episode\\" and called upon the channel to pull the program. Hours before the show was set to air, Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie, the Flemish public broadcasting authority and Canvas' parent company, announced that the episode would be pulled from the air. On 1 December, the VRT made a similar decision to pull an episode of the satirical series Man bijt hond, explaining the cancellation saying the episode followed a \\"powerful Semite\\" and mocked the Jewish community's emotional response to \\"an innocent gas kitchen\\". Canvas would find itself in the news a few weeks later, this time for its show Weg met De Soete. For the 27 November 2008 episode involving a guided tour of Berlin, Canvas took out print advertisements in five Flemish newspapers with the show's host Tomas De Soete as a \\"Chippendale Nazi\\" with a Hitler mustache and doing a Nazi salute. Reacting to this new situation, the CCOJB decided to send their dossier to the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism to have them examine the evidence. In a press release on 25 November 2008 said \\"the banalization of Nazi iconography used for a visit to the German capital\\" noting that \\"the satirical exploitation of Nazi symbols and their irresponsible diversion testify to the distressing degree that our sensibilities and our civic culture can relapse\\". After questions from the media, the VRT explained that the advertisement was from a second source and said they would no longer use the illustrations at the center of the controversy. The German Embassy in Brussels released a statement \\"deploring the inflammatory use of Nazi symbols\\". This new scandal made its way into Belgian political circles as well, and on 27 November 2008 five Senators from the cdH proposed a law banning the use of Nazi insignia for \\"propaganda and publicity\\" purposes.

From 1943 until his retirement in 1961, Nicholson served in the Historical Section, Canadian Army, where in 1959 he succeeded Colonel Charles Perry Stacey to become the section's second director. Nicholson authored numerous histories of Canada's military. He is best known for his 1962 book Canadian Expeditionary Force, 1914-1919, the only official history of Canada's participation in World War I.  Early life  Gerald William Lingen Nicholson was born on 6 January 1902 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, to Arthur Thomas Nicholson and Caroline Dora Middleton (1860-1932). He had a twin brother, Arthur Edmund Delabere ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Nicholson (1902-1971), as well as an older brother Harry Sholto Nicholson (1893-1975). Nicholson attended Barnstaple School in Barnstaple, Devonshire, the same school John Gay had attended in the 1690s. Arthur Thomas Nicholson died during World War I, and in 1919 Caroline moved her twin sons to Canada, joining her older son Harry, who had settled on a farm near Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan. After graduating high school Nicholson attended Saskatoon Normal School, and in 1922 began his career as a school teacher in Foam Lake, Saskatchewan. Nicholson taught school for five years before becoming a principal in 1927. His principal appointments included Foam Lake High School (1927‚Äì30), Wynyard High School (1931‚Äì35), Battleford Collegiate (1935‚Äì40), and Biggar High School (1941‚Äì42).Tunnell, Arthur L. (editor). Canadian Who's Who: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Living Men and Women. Volume XII, 1970-1972. Who's Who Canadian Publications, 1972. p. 840. Nicholson attended Queen's University where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1931. At Queen's he met Edith Ashcroft (1912-1998) of Kingston, Ontario, whom he wed on 10 August 1936 in Kingston. Gerald and Edith had two daughters, Dora and Sylvia. Several years after graduating from Queen's, Nicholson returned to school and in 1935 obtained a Bachelor of Paedagogy degree from the University of Toronto. Once Nicholson finished his degree in Toronto the couple returned to Saskatchewan, where Gerald took a job as the principal at Battleford Collegiate Institute.  Military career  At the time of Canada's entrance into World War II, Nicholson was serving as the principal at Battleford Collegiate. In 1940, at the age of 38, he joined the Canadian Army and was commissioned into the Prince Albert and Battleford Volunteers, a Non- Permanent Active Militia regiment. In April 1941 the Battleford component of the regiment was separated and converted to infantry, and the name of the remaining component reverted to the Prince Albert Volunteers. A year later, on 5 March 1942, the 1st Battalion, Prince Albert Volunteers was activated and transferred to Vernon Military Camp as part of the 19th Infantry Brigade. Nicholson, who by this time had moved to Biggar, Saskatchewan, joined the battalion in mid-April. Upon his departure, a reporter for the Saskatoon Star- Phoenix noted, \\"Mr. Nicholson will be missed in Biggar, as in a short time here he has taken part in public activities, serving as president of the Canadian Club, leader of St. Paul's Church choir, and taken an interest in the dramatic and musical life of the town. He had also been connected with military organization in Bigger and was in charge of the local unit of the Reserve Army. He was also instrumental in forming a cadet corp in Biggar.\\"\\"Biggar Principal Called to Service.\\" Saskatoon Star-Phoenix. 13 April 1942, p. 10. In 1943, Colonel Archer Fortescue Duguid (1887-1976) of the Canadian Army Historical Section requested Nicholson's transfer to Ottawa to join the Section. This request was based in part on a confidential report on Nicholson's character that Duguid had read. The report described Nicholson as ::a confident, inspiring leader, poised, reasonably aggressive and self- assured [...] He is an excellent lecturer, which is backed up by a fine educational background and educational training as a High School Principal. He is a hard and conscientious worker and a good learner. Quite original, resourceful, and has an excellent ability. He has a charming, agreeable personality, optimistic nature, cheerful outlook [...] An artistic nature, rather than practical; is sympathetic, tactful, diplomatic, loyal, co- operative, high spirituality and sense of duty.D.W. MacKendrick and J.C. Hedson, \\"Confidential Report, Administrative Wing,CSAA,\\" 29 January 1943, MG31 G19, G.W.L. Nicholson Papers, Volume 6, File:\\"Personal Correspondence, 1972-75,\\" Library and Archives Canada. Shortly after his appointment to the Historical Section, Nicholson was appointed as the narrator for Pacific Command. In the wake of Operation Cottage in August 1943, he traveled in U. S. Army aircraft through the Aleutian Islands. While covering the Pacific, Nicholson was a passenger in the first American plane to land on Kiska after its capture from the Japanese.Ketchum, W. Q. \\"Faces of Ottawa: G. W. L. Nicholson.\\" Ottawa Journal. 26 September 1964, p. 2. Following the cessation of hostilities in September 1945, in early 1946, new Director of the Historical Section Colonel C. P. Stacey (1906-1989) appointed Nicholson the Officer-in-Charge of the Historical Section at Canadian Military Headquarters in London. During his time in London, Nicholson gathered documents pertaining to Canada's role in the Battle of Hong Kong of December 1941. This work resulted in the 1946 pamphlet entitled Canadian Participation in the Defence of Hong Kong, December 1941. In 1947, Nicholson returned to Canada where he was appointed Deputy Director of the Historical Section, Army Headquarters, Ottawa. During his time with the section, Nicholson authored two full-length books. The first was Marlborough and the War of the Spanish Succession, published in 1955. His next work, published a year later, was the second in the three-volume Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War. Nicholson's volume, The Canadians in Italy, 1943-1945, dealt exclusively with the Italian Campaign. On 1 August 1959, Nicholson took over from Col. Stacey as the director of the Historical Section. At this time he was promoted from Lieutenant-Colonel to Colonel.\\"New Historical Director.\\" Ottawa Citizen. 20 February 1959, p. 7.  Retirement and later years  On 1 September 1961 Col. Nicholson retired from the Canadian Army.\\"Historian Quits Army to Teach School Here.\\" Ottawa Citizen. 4 July 1961, p. 3. Upon his retirement in September, Nicholson joined the staff of Nepean High School in Ottawa's Highland Park neighbourhood, where he taught English for a single year. The 1960s were a prolific period for Nicholson. The first book he published in the new decade was his official history of Canada's participation in World War I, released in 1962. In the introduction to the 2015 reissue of the book, Mark Osborne Humphries notes, \\"[b]etween 1918 and 1962, there were three abortive attempts to write Canada's official history of the Great War, but successive historians found it impossible to escape backroom intriguing, personal rivalries, and funding cuts.\\"Humphries, Mark Osborne. \\"The Origins of Nicholson's Canadian Expeditionary Force, 1914-1919.\\" In, Nicholson, G. W. L. Canadian Expeditionary Force, 1914-1919. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2015. p. xiii. In November 1956 Nicholson had publicly announced that immediately after Christmas he would begin work on the history.\\"Plans History of First War.\\" Ottawa Citizen. 16 November 1956, p. 23. After more than five years of work, the book was released in 1962 to much acclaim. W. H. S. Macklin reviewed the book in the Ottawa Citizen in January 1963, where he wrote, ::Perhaps it was worth waiting so long to get the book that Colonel Nicholson has written. I suppose it might be possible to find some faults in any work so massive and comprehensive. In the space allotted for this review I find room to mention none. The author has discharged his task with scrupulous care for accuracy, great literary skill, and above all a sympathetic understanding of the gigantic sacrifice he was called upon to record.Macklin, W. H. S. \\"A Belated War History Does Canada Justice.\\" Ottawa Citizen, 26 January 1963. The 1960s saw Nicholson release three more books. These included two volumes on the Royal Newfoundland Regiment (released in 1964 and 1969), and a history of St. John's Ambulance in Canada (released in 1966). In the 1970s, Nicholson wrote three more war histories, including works on the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, nursing sisters, and the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. He also wrote a guide to Canadian war memorials in Europe. Nicholson's final monograph was the humorous memoir Keep Your Forks: Fifty Years at Red Pine Camp, published in the fall of 1979, months before his death. Beginning in 1943 the Nicholsons stayed annually at Red Pine Camp, a summer resort on Golden Lake in the Ottawa Valley. Nicholson's book was published to celebrate the camp's golden jubilee in 1978, and recounts light-hearted episodes from his time there. G. W. L. Nicholson died in Ottawa on 28 February 1980 at the age of 78. The funeral was held at the Anglican Church of St. John the Evangelist.

Description Generally similar to other Galaxias of the olidus species complex with a stout, moderately long tubular body and fins fleshy at the bases, especially the mid body fins. Length commonly , maximum recorded . Upper surface usually flattened forward of the pelvic fins with the area between the eyes distinctly flat or concave. Cheeks bulging below the eyes with a long snout and a short head behind the eyes. Anal and dorsal fins are moderately long with short fin bases, usually roughly equal. Fins generally rounded, with the pelvic fins at the mid point of the body and the pectoral fins paddle shaped and low on the body. The caudal fin is relatively short. The body of the Shaw galaxias is mainly grey-brown to grey-tan on the upper surfaces and the sides above the lateral line and over the head and snout. Lower surfaces are creamy brown to cream or white. The upper surfaces of the body and head and the upper sides are overlain with dusky grey shading with dark, almost black, blotches and stripes. Gill covers are translucent with a golden patch. The iris is coppery gold and the fins are translucent. Distribution Distribution of Galaxias gunaikuimai At present, only known from one locality, Shaw Creek in the Macalister River catchment of Gippsland in the state of Victoria. Limited to a small catchment of about , however, historic data indicates that the species was previously more widespread in this system, at least a further downstream during the 1960s. The presence of introduced brown trout had reduced the distribution to above a small instream barrier by 2002, and by 2012, trout had colonised above the barrier to the stream's source restricting the Shaw Galaxias to a small side tributary. Habitat In 2002 only found in one small stream (about wide and deep) made up of pools (on average deep), glides and riffles over a substrate consisting of bedrock, boulder and cobble. Also smaller areas of pebble, coarse gravel and sand. The stream is only shaded by the banks and adjacent grasses. In winter the area is generally snow covered to varying amounts. Lifecycle/Reproduction Spawning period unknown but presumed to be winter to early spring with running ripe males and ripe females collected during May and the smallest presumably young-of-the-year collected during April-May being around in length. The fish can withstand very cold water, less than over winter. Unlike many other Galaxias, this species does not undergo a downstream migration to the sea or brackish water and is confined to freshwater for its entire lifecycle. Within its range, the Shaw Galaxias is the only native fish found. Conservation Critically endangered, protected under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

Since the end of 2009 when the government began soliciting expert opinion for the Animal Protection Act, the focus of public debate has always been on whether one should be eating cats or not, or whether cat-eating is a Chinese tradition or not. There are even people who would go as far as to say that the call to stop eating cat meat is \\"imposing the will of the minority on the majority\\". Yet the \\"majority\\" does not understand the complete truth of cat-meat trading chains: cat theft, cat trafficking, killing cats, selling cats, and eating cats, all the various stages of the trade and how they are distributed across the country, in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Rugao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Hebei.

The video was a reconstruction of Ai's experience in prison, during his 81-day detention, and dives in and out of the prison's reality and the guarding soldiers' fantasies. He later released a second single, Laoma Tihua, on 20 June 2013 along with a video on his experience of state surveillance, with footage compiled from his studio's documentaries. On 22 June 2013, the two-year anniversary of Ai's release, he released his first music album The Divine Comedy. Later in August, he released a third music video for the song Chaoyang Park, also included in the album. Other engagements Ai is the Artistic Director of China Art Archives & Warehouse (CAAW), which he co- founded in 1997. This contemporary art archive and experimental gallery in Beijing concentrates on experimental art from the People's Republic of China, initiates and facilitates exhibitions and other forms of introductions inside and outside China. The building which houses it was designed by Ai in 2000.Kunsthaus Bregenz, \\"Ai Weiwei: Art/Architecture\\", Bregenz,2011. On 15 March 2010, Ai took part in Digital Activism in China, a discussion hosted by The Paley Media Center in New York with Jack Dorsey (founder of Twitter) and Richard MacManus. Also in 2010 he served as jury member for Future Generation Art Prize, Kiev, Ukraine; contributed design for Comme de Garcons Aoyama Store, Tokyo, Japan; and participated in a talk with Nobel Prize winner Herta M√ºller at the International Culture festival Litcologne in Cologne, Germany. In 2011, Ai sat on the jury of an international initiative to find a universal Logo for Human Rights. The winning design, combining the silhouette of a hand with that of a bird, was chosen from more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries. The initiative's goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement.[98] In 2013, after the existence of the PRISM surveillance program was revealed, Ai said \\"Even though we know governments do all kinds of things I was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, Prism. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights.\\"[99] In 2012, Ai interviewed a member of the 50 Cent Party, a group of \\"online commentators\\" (otherwise known as sockpuppets) covertly hired by the Chinese government to post \\"comments favourable towards party policies and [intending] to shape public opinion on internet message boards and forums\\". Keeping Ai's source anonymous, the transcript was published by the British magazine New Statesman on 17 October 2012, offering insights on the education, life, methods and tactics used by professional trolls serving pro-government interests. Ai designed the cover for 17 June 2013 issue of Time magazine. The cover story, by Hannah Beech, is \\"How China Sees the World\\". TIME Magazine called it \\"the most beautiful cover we've ever done in our history.\\" In 2011, Ai served as co-director and curator of the 2011 Gwangju Design Biennale, and co-curator of the exhibition Shanshui at The Museum of Art Lucerne. Also in 2011, Ai spoke at TED (conference) and was a guest lecturer at Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In 2013, Ai became a Reporters Without Borders ambassador. He also gave a hundred pictures to the NGO in order to release a Photo book and a digital album, both sold in order to fund freedom of information projects. In 2014‚Äì2015, Ai explored human rights and freedom of expression through an exhibition of his art exclusively created for Alcatraz, a notorious federal penitentiary in San Francisco Bay. Ai's @Large exhibit raised questions and contradictions about human rights and the freedom of expression through his artwork at the island's layered legacy as a 19th-century military fortress. Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei has used thousands of life jackets in two different installation to draw attention to refugees who have drowned while trying to reach Europe. In February 2016, Ai WeiWei attached 14,000 bright orange life jackets to the columns of the Konzerthaus in Berlin. The life jackets had been discarded by refugees arriving on the shore on the Greek island of Lesbos. Later that year, he installed a different piece, also using discarded life jackets, at the pond at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna.

It was created pursuant to Virginia state law and is headquartered in Front Royal, Virginia. It is jointly funded by the town of Front Royal and the county of Warren. The purpose of the WCEDA is to foster and stimulate industry and economic development within Warren County and the town of Front Royal.  History  The WCEDA was authorized in December 20, 1994, by an act of the Virginia General Assembly and derives its power from the Front Royal Town Council and the Board of Supervisors of Warren County, Virginia. Its stated goal is to expand investment and create jobs, and since it was established in the mid-1990s it has created over 2,500 jobs and generated $500 million in investments in the Route 340/522 corridor. The work of the WCEDA became especially salient for the region's residents after the closure of its largest taxpayer and employer, Avtex, following severe environmental contamination issues at its main plant, including wastewater runoff into the Shenandoah River and clean air violations. Most notable among the development activities undertaken by the agency are the successful repatriation of the former Avtex plant, which had been made into an EPA Superfund site following its closure. The site, which the EPA returned to the control of the WCEDA in 2014, was successfully remediated and became the agency gained control of 162 acres of industrial plant site, 240 acres of conservation land, and 34 acres devoted to recreational activities. The remediation work was coordinated between the WCEDA and several outside entities, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA, and the FMC Corporation, a chemical manufacturing firm based in Philadelphia. The WCEDA has been credited with attracting new businesses and investment activity to the Front Royal-Warren County area, including the restaurateur Chick-Fil-A, the hotel chain Marriott, and a brewing company. In 2019, the WCEDA became embroiled in what some have described as the largest embezzlement scandal in Virginia history. The scandal involved a massive embezzlement scheme involving a director of the WCEDA, a Washington-area developer, and numerous other local government officials and their associates. According to the allegations, the developer falsely promised to build a data center and retail complex that would attract 600 jobs and fund other development within the county. The project never materialized, but was instead used as a vehicle to embezzle $21 million in funds. The fraud scheme was uncovered by the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation's Culpeper Field Office, which launched a probe in 2018 into the business practices of the EDA in conjunction with the Front Royal Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the fallout of the scandal, 14 current and former municipal officials were indicted and are facing criminal charges, including the entire Warren County board of supervisors as well as the former Warren County Attorney and the head of the Warren County schools division. In addition to the criminal cases, civil lawsuits were filed by the Town of Front Royal seeking $15 million in damages from the WCEDA and the former directors. A special grand jury has been appointed to investigate the matter.  Organizational structure  = Board of directors = The authority is governed by a seven-member board of directors, appointed by the Board of Supervisors of Warren County. The board meets on a monthly basis but additional meetings can be called by any two directors on an ad hoc basis. = Officers = The Board is led by a chairman, chosen from among the directors by the other directors. Other officers include a vice-chairman, a secretary, an assistant secretary, and a treasurer. The chairman and the other officers serve for one fiscal year, with elections taking place during the last regular meeting of each fiscal year. The Board can also create executive committees which are composed of the chairman, vice- chairman, secretary, treasurer, and additional members as chosen by the Board.

Description Similar to other members of the species complex with a long tubular body, commonly to a maximum recorded of , moderately deep and laterally compressed behind the pelvic fins. Upper surface evenly arched from the nape to the beginning of the tail fin, the belly follows a similar profile but less pronounced. Caudal peduncle is relatively shallow and strongly laterally compressed. Head medium sized, noticeably wider then deep and slightly to moderately wedge-shaped when viewed from the side. Eyes relatively large and set high on the head. Mouth positioned at the end of the snout, medium sized with a shorter lower jaw. Fins fleshy at the base, less so in paired fins. Anal fin has a long base whereas the dorsal fin base is short. Fins rounded, dorsal fin medium length, anal fin about 10-20 percent longer than the dorsal fin. Leading edge of the anal fin usually at a position about half way along the dorsal fin base. Pelvic fins medium sized, and positioned low at about the mid point of the body with the anal fin positioned half way between the pelvic fins and the tail. Pectoral fins medium sized, rounded to paddle shaped, positioned low on the body with the upper edge even with or slightly higher than the rear end of the mouth. Tail fin is moderately long, weakly forked and usually longer than the caudal peduncle. Flanges medium height and length and quite well developed on the caudal peduncle, often extending as far forward as the rear of the anal fin. Galaxias oliruos is mainly olive to grey-brown over the back and sides extending over the head and snout, fading to cream or white to silvery below the lateral line and silvery on the belly. The base colour is overlaid with a pattern of small to medium sized dark irregularly shaped blotches with many joining up to form uneven vertical bands. These markings are more closely spaced over the upper surface including the nape but are not present on the head and snout and sometimes are very faint. Sometimes a medium thick row of copper to gold spots extends over the upper surface from the nape to the dorsal fin and occasionally there may be a slight scattering of small gold flecks over the head and snout. The gill covers are translucent with a large gold to silver or turquoise patch. Fins light grey to olive and translucent. Distribution Distribution map of Galaxias oliros, the obscure galaxias The obscure galaxias is found at a wide range of elevations from in the Murray river system in Victoria and southern New South Wales as well as south of the Great Dividing Range in western Victoria including all tributaries to the Wimmera River and several tributaries to the Murray River within the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. The fish is also recorded from coastal drainages in western Victoria including the Corangamite Basin, the Hopkins River and extending through to Mosquito Creek within the Bool Lagoon catchment in South Australia. Additionally, the fish is found very close to the sea in the Merri River and the Darlot/Fitzroy River systems in western Victoria. Habitat Mainly inhabits lowland to foothill reaches of a diverse number of stream types including clear to turbid, medium to large wide rivers, smaller () gently to faster flowing creeks as well as anabranches, billabongs and occasionally wetlands. Juveniles are often found in shallow riffle zones around the edges of pools with adults in deeper pools and more open areas. Usually found taking cover in heavy macrophytes or woody debris, but sometimes found in open water or near the surface. Can be very abundant in swamps. Lifecycle/Reproduction The obscure galaxias lives its entire lifecycle in freshwater. It has high tolerance for water conditions being found in very turbid or highly saline pools or stagnant water with high amounts of organic material. Spawning generally occurs from late May to early July but sometimes as late as August. Eggs are quite small and the females are relatively fecund for members of the species complex, for example one {convert105.6mmin}} female was recorded with 2057 eggs. Conservation Least Concern. Utility to humans Not an angling target due to small size.

It was initially published by Demetrius Nicolaides, an Ottoman Greek. It was initially only in Ottoman Turkish, though it later also had content in French. It was mailed to people in Constantinople (now Istanbul) and people in Anatolia, with twice weekly distribution to the latter.Balta and Kavak, p. 43. Servet-i F√ºn√ªn was originally a supplement of Servet. (info page on book at Martin Luther University) // Cited: p. 29 (PDF p. 31). History Initially he wished to publish a newspaper, Asya, in Karamanli Turkish, or Turkish in the Greek alphabet. He applied to the Ottoman Press Office for permission to publish the newspaper around November 1887,Balta and Kavak, p. 40. with permission granted in December of that year. He had to publish from Babƒ±ali as he could not produce the paper from Galata during the day, and Ottoman authorities did not permit the production of newspapers in Galata at night. In 1888 the Ottoman authorities informed Nicolaides that he could not use the name Asya and that he needed to use Perso-Arabic characters, instead of Greek characters. Nicolaides was still interested in publication in Ottoman Turkish with any newspaper name,Balta and Kavak, p. 41. so Servet ultimately became the publication's name. The Ministry of the Interior received Nicolaides' request for publishing the paper in January 1888,Balta and Kavak, p. 42. and around February of that year the newspaper began distribution. Evangelina Baltia and Ay»ôe Kavak, authors of \\"Publisher of the newspaper Konstantinoupolis for half a century,\\" wrote that they could find no information explaining why Nicolaides' proposal for a Karamanli newspaper was turned down; at the time other publications in the empire in Karamanli Turkish existed. They also could not find any evidence explaining why Nicolaides accepted having an Ottoman Turkish publication. During the tenure of Nicolaides as owner, The newspaper revealed a criminal scheme to create fake currency, and it reported on the termination of Minister of Finance ; Balta and Kavak wrote that the newspaper had a \\"militant\\" point of view on the latter.Balta and Kavak, p. 44. In addition the newspaper had received official rebukes for stating negative information about Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdulhamid II and for also doing so against a high school teacher, ≈ûerif Efendi, who was later cleared by an investigation in the Ministry of Education; the publication had to retract articles about the latter. It began receiving a monthly 1,000 piastre benefit after applying for it in 1891.Balta and Kavak, p. 45. After translator Ahmed ƒ∞hsan suggested having a supplement each week, Servet began running Servet-i F√ºn√ªn from 1891 to 1892 with Abdulhamid II's approval after Nicolaides, in late 1890, applied to create a supplement about industry and science. Nicolaides decided to sell the supplement to ƒ∞hsan as he believed not enough copies were being purchased. The supplement became its own publication which ran until 1944.Balta and Kavak, p. 46. In 1895 Servet began publishing content in French also after Abdulhamid II's affirmation; Nicolaides had applied to the Interior Ministry for this in August 1895. Tahir Bey became the publisher in 1897, and the owner in 1898, the latter with approval from Abdulhamid II, after Nicolaides agreed to transfer it to him for 50 years. Tahir got permission to include pictures, and he also split the Ottoman Turkish and French portions into separate editions. Contents The publication not only covered general empire news but also news about the Rum Millet and its institutions, as well as the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Baltia and Kavak argued that based on a statement by Ali Arslan comparing the editorship to the office of the patriarch and the Tower of Babel that the newspaper's content \\"was disorganized.\\" Ahmed ƒ∞hsan translated much fo the content into Turkish.

It drains an area of the Canadian Shield plateau into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The terrain includes large areas of bare rocks, as well as forests dominated by black spruce and balsam fir. Location The Bouleau River rises on the Laurentian Plateau and empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence about east of Sept-√éles. Its source is to the north of Lake Bigot, west of Lake Nipisso. It rises at an elevation of , flows south for about , and has two major tributaries. The watershed covers . The bedrock is Precambrian, covered in typical boreal vegetation. The mouth of the Bouleau River is in the municipality of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre in the Minganie Regional County Municipality. The drainage basin covers parts of two regional county municipalities, within which it covers parts of four smaller administrative units: *Sept-Rivi√®res Regional County Municipality (92.9%) **Unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Nipissis, Quebec (85.3%) **Town of Sept-√éles (7.6%) *Minganie Regional County Municipality (7.1%) **Unorganized territory of Lac- J√©r√¥me (4.0%) **Municipality of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre (3.2%) Name The name \\"Bouleau\\" (Betula) means birch, a tree that grows in cold and temperate regions, with white bark and small leaves, whose wood is used in carpentry, cabinet making and for the manufacture of paper. The name was made official on 5 December 1968. Terrain The bulk of the watershed is on the rugged Laurentian Plateau, with elevations of . The highest point is in the northeast, at . The plateau has hills or ridges with steep slopes and is cut by valleys whose sides are over deep in places. Further south there is a piedmont sector about wide with altitudes from . The piedmont has rounded hills and wide valleys. The coastal plain between the piedmont and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence is no more than in width. It is relatively flat, sloping from inland down to along the sea, where the shoreline is formed by an escarpment almost high. The bedrock of the watershed, which is mostly exposed in the northern part, consists of deformed magmatic rocks. The north is dominated by gabbro, pyroxenite, troctolite and amphibolite. The south has granite, pegmatite and migmatite. The rocks in the south are partially covered by glacial till that is rarely more than thick. The coastal fringe shows the influence of the postglacial Goldthwait Sea, which left large quantities of marine clay and silt sediments. These have often been covered in sandy deltaic sediments. The valley of the Bouleau holds glaciofluvial sediments. Environment The Matamec weather station, west of the river, records an annual average temperature of and average annual rainfall of . A climate model indicates that annual average temperature would be in the northern part of the watershed, while average annual rainfall would be about throughout the watershed. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Bouleau in sub- regions 6j-S, 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. Forest cover consists of black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), with black spruce dominant on the coastal plain and north of the watershed, and mixed spruce/fir in the central region. There was a large infestation of hemlock looper moths (Lambdina fiscellaria) in the late 1990s and early 2000s that significantly damaged the fir trees. Hydrology The watershed is very elongated, along a north‚Äìsouth axis of . Its greatest width is in the center section, where it reaches . About 6.85% of the basin is covered by water bodies, the largest being Lake Bigot in the north with an area of . Due to the sloping terrain in most of the basin, wetlands such as ombrotrophic peatlands cover only 0.46% of the basin. The network of streams and rivers is angular, conforming to fractures in the hard bedrock, with straight segments between right-angled forks. In the plateau the rivers flow through narrow V-shaped valleys with very steep slopes. In the piedmont the valleys have the U-shaped profile typical of glacial valleys, and the rivers wander through the glaciofluvial deposits. The Bouleau River has a length of and vertical drop of . The most important tributary is the Chiskal River, which drains the northwest of the basin. The lowest part of the Bouleau River flows in a straight line through the coastal sediments in a narrow valley with sides of over , emptying into a wide estuary with brackish water, partially blocked by a ridge at its entrance with an opening wide. Tides reach inland from the mouth to about . About above the head of the tidal area there is a long stretch of powerful rapids that may block the further upstream progress of Atlantic salmon. Below these rapids the river has a gradient of . There are a few pool areas, but this section mainly consists of rapids flowing over gravel, large rocks and bare rock. The annual average discharge is , varying from . Fish The river holds anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and less commonly American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). There are also alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The upstream section of the river is considered an exceptional habitat for young salmon. However, the large rapids from the mouth limit their migration. In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec. In 2017 all salmon, large and small, had to be released on the Malbaie (Gasp√© Peninsula), Pigou, Bouleau, Magpie, Coacoachou, N√©tagamiou, Little Mecatina and V√©co rivers. Only young salmon could be retained on 51 rivers, and limited retention of large salmon was allowed on 19 rivers.

Consul The consuls of the previous year, Titus Romilius and Gaius Veturius Cicurinus had defeated the Aequi at Mount Algidus, but were now prosecuted for having sold the captured material and equipment in order to replenish the treasury, without having received the approval of the troops, who would otherwise have been entitled to a share of the proceeds. The former consuls were tried and fined for their misappropriation. This occurrence appears to have led to the passage of the lex Aternia Tarpeia, regulating the payment of fines, and fixing the maximum fine which magistrates could impose.Marcus Tullius Cicero, De Republica ii. 60.Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae xi. 1. Aternius and Tarpeius also maintained the opposition of the Senate and the patricians to a law passed two years earlier by the tribunes of the plebs, opening the Aventine Hill to settlement. With the two orders deadlocked, an agreement was forged to appoint a body consisting of both patricians and plebeians, which should pass measures for the benefit of all. Three envoys (all patricians) were sent to Athens, to study the laws of Solon and Greek political institutions, and report their findings upon their return. This settlement led to the creation of the Decemviri Legibus Scribundis, who held power from 451 to 449, and established the Twelve Tables of Roman law.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita iii. 31, 32 ff. The Decemvirate failed to bring about the reconciliation of the orders, and was itself abolished, as the consulship was re-instituted in 449. A plan was then proposed by which the senate would accede to the illegal re-election of several of the tribunes, if the consuls should also be re-elected. The object of this scheme was to discredit both the tribunes and the consuls, who had previously earned the people's trust. However, the president of the elections, Marcus Duilius, himself a former tribune, secured the pledge of the consuls not to accept a second year in office.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita iii. 65. Duilius then called for the election of the tribunes, and refused to acknowledge the re-election of the tribunes of 449. As only five other men were elected, Duilius announced that the legally-elected tribunes should appoint five others to fill the vacancies, thereby frustrating the tribunes whom the senate had sought to return to office for a second year. As a concession to those patricians who had supported the peaceful resolution of the conflict, the tribunes chose two patricians, Tarpeius, and his colleague Aternius, to fill two of the vacant positions. This was the only time that patricians were permitted to hold this office, in consequence of which the plebeian tribune Lucius Trebonius Asper succeeded in passing the lex Trebonia, requiring that in the future, votes should continue to be called until the full number of tribunes had been elected, thereby preventing future tribunes from appointing colleagues who might be opposed to the interests of the people.

Colour tan to brown on the back and sides continuing over the head and snout, fading to creamy white on the lower surfaces. Base colour overlain with closely spaced dark blotches, some joining together to form unevenly shaped vertical stripes generally extending well below the lateral line. Some fish show a thin line of gold spots in the middle of the upper surface with a diffuse band of gold to coppery spots mostly below the lateral line and more prominently towards the rear of the fish. Gill covers translucent with a large golden spot. The eyes have a gold iris. Distribution Distribution map of the ornate Galaxias The ornate Galaxias is mainly confined to coastal systems south of the Great Dividing Range at elevations of and probably up to in Victoria between Wilsons Promontory and Cape Otway with a small population north of the Great Dividing Range in a minor creek in the upper reaches of the Yea River, a tributary to the Goulburn River system. Habitat Galaxias ornatus is usually found in clear, cool and well shaded upland creeks along mountain ranges and in lager streams at lower elevations. Such streams are commonly wide (up to ) and deep with pools of about in depth. The stream beds are usually complex, varying from clay and sand to boulder, pebble and bedrock. In-stream cover is mostly provided by rock, large and small woody debris, aquatic and riparian vegetation as well as overhanging stream banks. To the north and west of Melbourne in drier systems such as the Maribyrnong, Plenty and Werribee rivers the fish persist in ephemeral tributaries as well as in large and small isolated, sometime stagnant, pools. To the north east of Melbourne at higher elevations such as in the upper Yarra catchment the species withstands periods of varying times during winter with the streams covered in snow. Lifecycle/Reproduction Spawning occurs from June to mid August with adults ripe and near spawning from mid April. The fish remains confined to freshwater and does not migrate downstream to the estuary or the sea like many other Galaxias species. Conservation Least concern.

Description The most distinct member of the mountain galaxias species complex, whilst still sharing the usual Galaxias body form of a long tubular body and rounded fins. G. terenasus differs from other members of the complex by its relatively small size (females larger then males) distinctive colouration and pattern on the body, thin fins and a rounded snout profile when viewed from the side. Eyes set high on the head; centre-line fins somewhat fleshy at the base, paired fins less so. Pelvic fins small and set low with their leading edge roughly at the mid point of the body. Pectoral fins medium sized and paddle shaped. Tail fin moderately notched. Maximum recorded size , commonly . Mainly olive brown on the back and sides above the lateral line and over the head and snout, lighter on the lower part of the body and silvery on the belly. Base colour is patterned by small dark and closely packed blotches especially over the back, sides, head and snout. Many of the blotches join together to form uneven vertical bars. These dark markings are occasionally obscured by a fine dark stippling. Gill covers are translucent and have a small gold spot. Fins clear to a translucent tan; iris is a coppery gold. Distribution Distribution of Galaxias terenasus Occurs in Far East Gippsland in Victoria and the extreme southeast of New South Wales in the mid reaches of the Snowy, Cann and Genoa river systems.Little historical data is available, however, specimens were captured from Curry Flat at Nimmitabel in 1914, near Bombala in 1938 and from Church creek near Delegate in 1965-6. The fish's presence in the Bombala and Church Creek catchments was reconfirmed in 2002-3. Habitat G. terenasus is generally found in streams ranging from creeks to larger rivers, wides and deep, with slow to medium speed clear water. Pools range in depth from . Surrounding areas are lightly to heavily forested and shaded. Occupied habitat consists mostly of pools, glides and riffles with smaller areas of backed up still water. Stream bed consists mostly of bedrock, boulder, rounded stones and gravel. In stream cover is mostly rock, woody debris and a small amount of macrophytes, leaf litter, undercut stream banks and overhanging vegetation. Lifecycle/Reproduction The roundsnout galaxias lives its entire life cycle in freshwater. It has been found in waters also inhabited by a number of native species: longfin and shortfinned eel; River blackfish; common freshwater shrimp; East Gippsland spiny cray; variable spiny crayfish; and, a native bivalve mollusc. In addition it is found in water inhabited by the alien species brown trout, however, it is considered likely that G.terenasus occupies a separate habitat niche to trout. Spawning season for this fish is unknown but believed to be spring to early summer. Gravid females have been found with 220-240 quite small unshed eggs, in diameter on average, indicating a low fecundity for the species. Conservation Endangered, protected under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Utility to humans Not an angling target due to small size and conservation status.

He leads Argonne's atomic layer deposition (ALD) research program, where he directs research and development and commercialization of thin film coating technologies for energy applications. Elam is a fellow of the Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering, and staff member at the Center for Molecular Engineering at Argonne. He also manages the Functional Coatings Group in Argonne's Applied Materials Division and holds leadership roles in two DOE Energy Frontier Research Centers: the Center for Electrical Energy Science, and the Advanced Materials for Energy-Water Systems Center.  Education  Elam graduated Cornell University with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, and The University of Chicago with a PhD in physical chemistry. Elam pursued postdoctoral studies at the University of Colorado where he developed ALD thin film growth methods.  Research  = Oleo Sponge = Elam co-invented the Oleo Sponge, a polyurethane foam engineered to absorb oil from water. Researchers engineered the material to be oleophilic and hydrophobic using sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS), a patented-material synthesis method Elam co-invented that has been cited by multiple companies. SIS was used to coat the interior surfaces of the foam with a thin layer of metal oxide ‚Äúprimer‚Äù that acts as a glue for attaching a monolayer of oleophilic molecules. The result is a reusable sponge capable of adsorbing up to 90 times its weight in oil. = Large Area Microchannel Plates = Elam was part of the team that developed the world's largest microchannel plate (MCP), a solid- state, 2-dimensional electron amplifier critical to a variety of imaging and sensing applications. This was achieved by using ALD nanocomposite coatings to create a manufacturing strategy for MCPs that drove down cost, improved performance, and widened applications. The ALD coatings have been implemented by Incom, Inc. to manufacture large area MCPs and are being incorporated into large area photodetectors. The patent for fabricating the technology has been cited by more than a dozen companies, including Samsung, Nova Scientific and Nissan. = Scale-up of Transparent Conducting Oxide Coatings = Elam led a team to create ALD methods for depositing ITO films, a common transparent conducting thin film found in devices such as solar cells, flat panel displays, and touch screens, onto nanoporous supports and over large substrate areas. One patented method, which used two oxygen-sources ‚Äúsynergistically‚Äù to allow materials to grow at lower-than-normal temperatures, proved capable of coating nanoporous materials with high precision and uniformity.  Publications  Elam has authored over 250 papers on the subject of ALD, his work has been cited over 22,000 times. His most cited study, published in 2003, demonstrated the growth of Al2O3 ALD films‚Äîwhich have the potential to coat thermally fragile substrates such as organic, polymeric, or biological materials‚Äîat temperatures as low as 33 ¬∞C. His research group has amassed over 50 inventions in ALD coating technology and holds numerous patents.  Honors  Elam is a fellow of the American Vacuum Society. In 2017, he received the ALD Innovation Award from the AVS for original work and leadership in ALD. In 2019 he received a lifetime achievement award from Argonne.

In 1776 he took a position as first violin in the Italian opera troupe of Teresa Taveggia, which was touring Spain at the time. The company suffered a number of setbacks thanks to ecclesiastical authorities, but even so Xim√©nez was so well-regarded that Carlos III invited him to spend a year at the royal court. At the end of the sojourn he returned to Alicante to his position at the chapel of San Nicol√°s, remaining there until his death. As a composer Xim√©nez composed music along classical lines. Among his compositions were a set of sonatas for violin and basso continuo and four trios for guitar, violin, and basso continuo, published in Paris in 1789. Several of these have been recorded on the Hungaroton label, coupled with similar works by Isidro de Laporta. Xim√©nez was the brother of composer Joaqu√≠n Nicol√°s Xim√©nez Brufal; several of their works have recently been republished.

By the mid-1930s, the company began to directly manufacture its own furniture from its factory on West Century Boulevard, producing dinette sets for restaurants and consumer homes, chrome- plated chairs for offices, and beauty-parlor equipment. During World War II, the company became a significant supplier of furniture for the military, providing furniture for the sleeping quarters and mess halls of US Navy ships, and thousands of bunkbeds for US Army and Marine barracks. Even after the conclusion of the war, the company remained a significant military contractor, while also expanding further into the consumer furniture market. However, due to a disagreement between the brothers, Julian Virtue left the company. After dividing their assets, Julian got a check for $1,000,000 and Philip continued to run Virtue Brothers. In February 1950, Virco was founded by Julian Virtue in Los Angeles, California, opening its first factory on Vermont Avenue. To avoid starting his new business entirely from scratch, Virtue also purchased the Slauson Aircraft Company in 1950. Despite its name, in the post-World War II peacetime economy, Slauson Aircraft had become a school furniture maker and held a lucrative contract with the Los Angeles School Districts. This acquisition quickly allowed Virco to become the leading manufacturer of school equipment in the Greater Los Angeles area. = Growth and expansion = Virco further expanded in 1954 with the purchase of the Dunn Furniture Company in Conway, Arkansas. This purchase established a nationwide presence for the company, allowing for sales along both the East Coast and West Coast and increasing their sales volume significantly. Julian's son Robert joined the company in 1956, after having graduated from college and serving in the navy. He rose up the corporate ladder and began working quite closely with his father in the management of the company. In 1964, became a publicly-traded company, selling its shares on the over-the-counter market. With increasing competition and rising labor costs hurting profit margins, the company decided to expand its operations internationally. In 1971, they opened a new factory in San Luis R√≠o Colorado, Mexico directly across the border from Yuma, Arizona. This new facility, operated under the maquiladora concept, helped to drive down labor costs for the company. This, in turn, increased company profitability and allowed it to grow large enough to be listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1977. The 1980s and early 1990s were a time of continued growth for the company, as well as leadership change. Facilities in Conway not only had their manufacturing capacities increased, but also became distribution and packing centers. Meanwhile, the factory in Mexico grew to nearly 1,200 workers. The company also purchased a 55,000 square foot facility in Newport, Tennessee from the struggling Heywood-Wakefield Company in 1984. This facility, used for the manufacture of melamine plastic chair seats, soon employed 200 workers. Julian Virtue also semi-retired from the company, with his son Robert becoming president in 1982. Julian died in December 1991, with Robert having taken over as CEO and Chairman of the Board in 1988 and 1990, respectively. = Recent struggles = In recent years, the company has struggled financially due to the declines in public school funding. The company has also faced increased competition as school and government contracts have increasingly been awarded to local furniture suppliers. As a result, company revenue and profitability has fluctuated greatly over the past twenty years. The company relocated to its current facility in Torrance in April 1994, shutting down two Los Angeles area facilities in an effort to reduce handling and distribution expenses. These facilities, a 200,000 square foot warehouse and a 160,000 square foot manufacturing facility, were sold off in April 2000 and November 2003, respectively. In 1995, the factory in Mexico was shut down after being damaged by a minor fire in 1993 and in an effort to further reduce operating margins. The companies facility in Newport was shut down and donated to the Newport Cocke County Economic Development Commission in 2002.  Corporate affairs  =Finances = In fiscal year 2019, Virco had net sales of around $191 million with a net income of approximately $2 million. In the preceding fiscal year, the company had net sales of $201 million, with a net loss of around $2 million. The company has occasionally distributed dividends, with five distributions between December 2017 and December 2018, after 7 years without such distributions. Virco primarily operates in two countries, the United States where it derived 93.6% of its revenue and Canada which was responsible for much of the remaining 6.4% of revenue. Virco reportedly supplies between 50-60% of school furniture within Los Angeles County. It was estimated in 1997 that Virco controlled a majority of the educational furniture market in the United States. =Financial struggles = Virco peaked financially in the late 1990s, reaching a record stock price of $17.50 a share in February 1998. Profits also peaked in 1998, with the company turning a profit of nearly $18 million on revenues of $275 million. Revenue continued to grow until 2000, when they peaked at $287 million. Since 2000, however, the company has struggled to remain profitable and has seen its revenues significantly decline. In the past 20 years, revenue has fluctuated between a low of $158 million in 2012 to $229 million in 2007, averaging around $200 million a year. In the seventeen years since 2002, the company has only turned a profit in seven years, with losses exceeding $20 million in 2003. These financial woes significantly reduced the number of permanent employees as well. The number of employees peaked at nearly 2,950 in August 2000. A voluntary separation program in 2003 led to the departure of 485 employees while an additional 160 employees were laid off. Further cost- trimming measures instituted by cutting labor costs brought the number of employees from 1,045 in 2011 to 825 at the beginning of 2020, a more than 70% workforce since 2000. The company supplements this reduced full-time workforce with temporary workers that help with seasonal production bumps in the summer months, sometimes utilizing around 200-300 temporary workers. = Management = Robert Virtue is the current Chairman of the Board and CEO of Virco. Born in 1932, he joined the company full-time in 1956 and is the son of the company's founder, Julian Virtue. Douglas (Doug) Virtue, the son of Robert, is the current President of the company, having been appointed to the position in 2014. He joined the company in 1984. In 2014, the Board of Directors was reorganized and reduced in size to five seats from nine seats. However, by 2020 there were eight seats on the board of directors. =Environmental initiatives= Virco has engaged in a number of environmental initiatives, with these efforts receiving recognition from local, state, and federal authorities. Doug Virtue, Virco's President and a director on the Mono Lake Committee, has been influential in this drive towards more environmentally conscious business practices, stating in 2002 that sustainability is \\"the state towards which all business must evolve.\\" The company began a recycling program in 1989, and by 2010 the company had processed over 313 million pounds of recyclable materials spanning more than 40 categories. Virco has made significant efforts to restrict chemical emissions from its products, becoming the first classroom manufacturers to have their product lines to meet GREENGUARD indoor air quality certification for children and schools. By 2005, hundreds of the companies products were indoor air quality certified with these products accounting for 75% of the company's sales volume. With a desire to become largely waste-free, Virco also completed a transition from wet paint lines to powder by 2002. At the local level, Virco has been recognized by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County as a \\"Good Corporate Citizen\\" in limiting its wastewater discharge and maintaining their environmental equipment without any violations. At the state level, Virco has repeatedly been recognized by the California Integrated Waste Management Board in their Waste Reduction Awards Program for its efforts to recycle waste and success in diverting waste from landfills. Finally, Virco is a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's WasteWise program, joining as a charter member in 1994. Virco remains an active member in the WasteWise program, receiving numerous awards and being selected as one of the first three charter members in the WasteWise Hall of Fame in 2003. Virco has also received environmental awards from the United States General Services Administration, Sierra Club, and National Recycling Coalition.  Facilities  Virco currently has manufacturing facilities in two states, California and Arkansas. In Torrance, California, the company has leased a 560,000 square foot facility since 1994 which includes the corporate headquarters and a showroom. The facility is also used for manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing. In Conway, Arkansas, the company owns three facilities for manufacturing and distribution. The primary facility contains 1.2 million square foot and is used for warehousing, manufacturing, and office space. The company also owns a 375,000 square foot factory in Conway, purchased in 1954, used for chrome plating, manufacturing steel components, and plastic molding. The third property owned in Conway is a 175,000 square foot facility used for the manufacturing of hard plastic mold components and was purchased in 2017.

Maynard is the Dr Myung Ki Hong Professor in Polymer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. She works on protein-polymer conjugates and polymeric drugs. Maynard is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life and education  Maynard became interested in chemistry during junior high. She decided she wanted to become a Professor of Chemistry at the age of 12. She studied chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She earned her bachelor's degree with honours at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara for her Master's studies in materials science. After earning her master's degree in 1995 Maynard joined the California Institute of Technology, where she worked in the research group of Robert H. Grubbs. She moved to ETH Zurich as an American Chemical Society Fellow with Jeffrey Hubbell.  Research and career  In 2002 Maynard joined the faculty at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She started her career at the UCLA as the first Howard Reiss Career Development Chair. In 2005 she took part in a National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering symposium that shared technical research between the United States and Japan. She was promoted to Full Professor at UCLA in 2012. Her research considers polymer materials, including arrays, films for patterning, bioactive proteins and new ways to develop protein- polymer conjugates. These conjugates are used in medical therapeutics to treat a range of diseases, and are synthesised by polymerising from proteins and amino acid-reactive initiators. Maynard has considered the mechanisms that underpin the function of known therapeutics. This includes the development of new synthetic pathways, such as controlled radical polymerization and click chemistry, to make polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and anchoring sites for particular surfaces. Using controlled radical polymerization. Maynard has shown it is possible to use the fluorous content of poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate), fluorous methacrylate and ketene acetal 5,6-benzo-2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane co-polymers to determine whether self assembly results into single or multi-chain nanoparticles. The fluorous content controls the degradation of nanoparticles; high fluorous content results in smaller degradation rate constants. Maynard integrates polymeric materials with biologically derived molecules. She has designed nanogels and polymers to stabilise biomolecules to temperature variations and agitation. She has also investigated trehalose glycopolymers that contain pendant pyridyl disulfide groups. If polymers only contain side-chain trehalose, they can stabilise a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and degrade via hydrolysis. If they containpyridyl disulfide groups they can be cross-linked into nanoparticles using peptide glucagon, made bioactive in vitro, neutral to pH and protected from making aggregates. She developed a range of polyethylene glycol nanoparticles that can be cross-linked using hydrazone and oximes. The choice of crosslinking agent determines the degradation of the hydrogels and nanoparticles. These systems can be modified to incorporate chemicals for agricultural applications that require controlled delivery. In 2016 she was selected as a Fulbright Foundation New Zealand scholar, where she worked on biohybrid polymer materials at the University of Auckland. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2006 Alfred P.

Driver was self-taught and worked in a variety of media including painting, sculpture, collage and assemblage. His work was often recognized for its use of everyday or vernacular materials. Driver is associated with New Plymouth, having moved there with his family in 1944. He was educated at New Plymouth Boys‚Äô High School and worked as a dental technician during the 1940s and 1950s before a lengthy period working at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery (1969 to 1992). His 1966 mural commemorating the 1933 trans-Tasman flight of Charles Kingsford-Smith featured at New Plymouth airport from 1967 to 2019. Driver's sculpture Cats was installed in New Plymouth's Pukekura Park during the 1960s. In 2013 a replica of the work was installed in its place. Driver's work often attracted controversy. In 1981 the National Art Gallery in Wellington commissioned Driver to produce an installation. The resulting work, Ritual (1982), consists of ten 44-gallon drums topped by children's dolls with goat- skull heads holding pitchforks, all mounted on a cart. The work attracted criticism for its bad taste and embrace of the occult. In 1983 following its own display of the work, the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth tried to acquire Ritual for its collection. The acquisition proposal met stern opposition from civic council politicians who objected to the offensive nature of the work and ultimately failed. Ritual was subsequently acquired in 1989 by the National Art Gallery (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). At the time National Art Gallery curator Robert Leonard described Ritual as \\"one of the most controversial and despised works of New Zealand art history\\". In 2013 filmmakers Paul Judge and Bridget Sutherland produced the documentary Don Driver: Magician.
