It is located south of Barlow Pass along the Mountain Loop Highway near the Monte Cristo area. It is situated on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain is named for a mining claim on the mountain's slope.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. The nearest peak is Gothic Peak, to the southwest, and Foggy Pass is the low point between the two peaks. Foggy Lake lies in Gothic Basin below the south face of Del Campo Peak and collects precipitation runoff which ultimately drains to South Fork Sauk River via Weden Creek. Runoff from the west side of the mountain drains into the Sultan River, and the north side drains into headwaters of the Stillaguamish River. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are July through September. History The mountain's name was submitted in 1917 by Dr. Harry B. Hinman, Chairman of The Everett Mountaineers. The name was officially adopted in 1918 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1912 by J.A. Juleen. Climate Del Campo Peak with Foggy Lake Del Campo Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Del Campo and Morning Star Peak seen from Mt. Dickerman The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is east-northeast of Del Campo Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Early life  Charles Cajori was born in Palo Alto, CA to Florian Cajori and Marion Huntington Haynes. They moved to Wayne, PA when Charles was one year old. Florian Cajori was a bio-chemist and taught in the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. Marion was a pianist and educator who gave piano lessons and started a school inspired by John Dewey‚Äôs philosophy of inclusion and social reform. Cajori went to school on the Main Line in the western suburbs of Philadelphia before enrolling in Colorado Springs Art Center in 1939 and the Cleveland Art School from 1940-42. He was drafted in 1942, and spent four years in the US Air Force. Upon his discharge, he went to Columbia University on the G.I. Bill and studied there with Jack Heliker. He attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture of in the summers of 1947 and 1948. Early on Cajori discovered New York's downtown scene, and began attending the lively (and sometimes feisty) gatherings at the Cedar Tavern and the panels at the fabled Eighth Street Club. He became especially close to Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, and in 1952 he joined with Lois Dodd, Angelo Ippolito, William King and Fred Mitchell to found the Tanager Gallery on East 10th St. The gallery was to become central to the lives of many of the contemporary working artists. In 1950 he began his teaching career at Notre Dame University in Maryland, and by 1956 he was teaching at The Cooper Union. He was awarded a Fulbright Grant to Italy in 1959. After returning to the states, he resumed his life in New York. In 1959-60, he taught at the University of California at Berkeley, where he regularly joined Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff in figure drawing sessions. He met his wife, Barbara Grossman, at Cooper Union and they married in 1967. They had one child, Nicole Antonia born in 1969. In 1972 they moved to a rural farm house with land in Connecticut where they could both have large studios.  Career  In the 1950s Cajori had solo exhibitions at the Tanager Gallery, Bertha Schaefer Gallery and the Oakland Art Museum. His work appeared in numerous group shows including annual and biennial shows at the Stable Gallery, the Whitney Museum, the Brooklyn Museum and the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 1964, joining with former students of Pratt Institute and several artists including Mercedes Matter, Sidney Geist, Georgio Spaventa, and Esteban Vicente, he founded the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. He was to teach at the school for the remainder of his active years. For 20 years he taught also at Queens College, and was a visiting artist at numerous other schools, including Yale University, Dartmouth College and Cornell University. He retired from full-time teaching in 1986 to devote his time to painting and drawing. Cajori exhibited in New York City at the Howard Wise Gallery, Ingber Gallery, Lohin-Geduld Gallery, and at the Gross- McCleaf Gallery in Philadelphia as well as numerous colleges and universities, including Dartmouth College, American University, Cornell University, Wright State University, the New York Studio School, Central Connecticut State University, Cincinnati Art Academy, University of Texas at Austin, Bennington College, and the University of Washington at Seattle.  Legacy  Cajori was recognized as an important second-generation Abstract Expressionist. His work was reviewed in all the major art journals and newspapers of the day. The paintings of Cajori, with the exception of his early formative work, always revolved around the figure and the space. He keenly focused on the ideas about perception and the way we as humans are encompassed by the environment we found ourselves in. Thus the figure‚Äîalways female, for Cajori‚Äîwas activated by our vivid experience of occupying a section of life. All of his images were invented, using color and drawing to concretize this experience. Cajori drew from the model all his life. He drew about once a week in his studio, hiring people with whom he often developed friendships. He exhibited those drawings along with the paintings and sometimes mixed-media inventions. He relished working large and could work on paintings over a long period of time, sometimes going back in to them long after declaring them ‚Äúfinished.‚Äù He lived his life as an artist, preferring the studio to any other place. In 2011, Cajori submitted a statement to E. Ashley Rooney for inclusion in his book on New England artists: ‚ÄúFirst is the acknowledgment of chaos: its contradictions and wayward forces. Then the struggle for coherence. Not a coherence of illusion but one of time and space‚Äîof form. The mode of attack is improvisational, multileveled, and non-rational. The resulting structures may seem complete, but they contain a hint of another stage. New attacks are called for. Structures evolve endlessly.\\" Reviews of Cajori's work appeared in the New York Times, The New York Observer, Art News, Art in America, Arts Magazine, Art New England, Review, SoHo Weekly News, Art International, The New York Post, The Brooklyn Rail and artcritical.com, among many other publications. Cajori's work is represented in numerous public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Whitney Museum, the Denver Art Museum, the Walker Art Center, the Weatherspoon Art Museum, the Arkansas Art Center, the Honolulu Art Academy and the National Academy of Design. In addition to his Fulbright grant, Cajori was awarded a Distinction in the Arts by Yale University, a Longview Foundation Purchase Award, a Ford Foundation Purchase Award, several awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (the Jimmy Ernst Award, the Arts and Letters Award, and three Childe Hassam Purchase Awards), the Louis Comfort Tiffany Award, a National Endowment for the Arts Grant, several awards from the National Academy of Design (the Henry Ward Ranger Fund Purchase Award, the Ralph Fabri Prize, and four Benjamin Altman Prizes) and a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1982 he was elected as an Academician of the National Academy of Design.

Its author is identified in a 9th-century manuscript (Codex Vaticanus 6018) as a German archdeacon named Theodosius. The work includes a list of places and routes, and occasionally commentary on relevant biblical passages, combining the genre of itinerarium with stories reminiscent of a modern travelogue.Tobias Nicklas in: C. R. Moss et al. (eds.), The Other Side: Apocryphal Perspectives on Ancient Christian ‚ÄúOrthodoxies‚Äù (2017), p. 26. It was compiled after 518 and before 530, as the author is aware of the construction work done under Emperor Anastasius I (), but not of that done under Justinian I (). Theodosius' additional sources Tsafrir (1986) has argued that the topographical information in the work is based on maps used by tour guides, also reflected in the Madaba Map of the same period. The author inserted additional information based either on his own travels or on accounts by other pilgrims. Contents The text is divided into 32 sections or paragraphs. *Sections 1-6, 27 and 32 have the character of an Itinerarium. *The holy sites in Jerusalem are described in sections 7‚Äì11, 17, 21 and 31), *interspersed with descriptions of holy sites in Asia Minor (12‚Äì13, 15, 26), Egypt (14), the Jordan Valley (18‚Äì20), Phoenicia (23) and Arabia (24). *The biblical geography of Jordan is given in section 22, *a biblical geography of Paradise in section 16. *A list of provinces in the Holy Land is given in section 25. *Three sections are short narratives: on Urbicius and the Seat of Mary (28), the Sassanid Persians in Dara (29), Eudoxius on Melitene and Susa (30). Survival, manuscripts, and modern editions The work was known to the 6th-century Gallo-Roman historian and bishop Gregory of Tours. It was also included in the Otia Imperialia by Gervase of Tilbury (c. 1211). Notable manuscripts include codd. Guelferbytanus (Weissenburg 99) (8th/9th c.), Haganus 165 (8th c.), Vaticanus 6018 (9th c.) and Parisinus 4808 (9th c.). The text was edited by T. Tobler (1865), T. Tobler and A. Molinier (1879), J.

Zhirinovsky's positions trend towards the far-right of Russian politics. Zhirinovsky's positions have been seen as fascist, however, Zhirinovsky himself has sharply objected to such a characterization. In addition to being seen as a fascist, Zhirinovsky has also been regarded to be an ultranationalist. His views have also been described as chauvinistic and imperialistic. Zhirinovsky's plans for reshaping the presidency essentially have been to mold it into a dictatorship. The LDPR defined its members as being individuals who do not separate their personal interests from those of the motherland, a \\"creator capable of carrying out the priority tasks of the motherland aimed at preserving peace and raising the standard of living of all the population of our vast country.\\" Zhirinovsky had, during the 1993 legislative campaign, referred to LDPR as the, ‚Äúcenter-right party‚Äù, and claimed that its views were such that it could potentially be allied with Women of Russia and Civic Union in the State Duma. Zhirinovsky has a flair for demagoguery. His written policy positions have, at times, been more moderate than those he has espoused in speeches and interviews. While Zhirinovsky and the LDPR formed a component of the political opposition to Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, members of the LDPR largely voted against impeaching Yeltsin in 1999. In more recent years, Zhirinovsky and the LDPR have often supported the agenda of Vladimir Putin's government when voting in the Duma. Zhrinovsky's support for Putin dates back to Putin's early presidency. Domestic policy In the early 1990s, the LDPR declared itself to have, \\"a program for the development of our society in accordance with its own needs without any interference from the outside.\\" This lightly appealed towards the Marxist concept of self-development. The LDPR platform declared that, \\"the political activity of the LDPR is directed toward the restoration by peaceful means and the preservation of the Russian state that was created over the course of centuries; the restoration and guarding of the borders of the country, the realization within the country of the peaceful coexistence of all the populations inhabiting it‚Äìboth small and large‚Äìwith the right of preservation of traditions and customs, and the development of each individual's national culture and religion. Russia is a motherland for all, without any kind of discrimination.\\" Zhirinovsky blamed the nation's struggles on various sources, scapegoating the peoples of the Caucasus, Jews, neighboring nations, and the West. Zhirinovsky's overall vision has long been to reestablish the Russian Empire through \\"imperial reconquest\\".Stephen E. Hanson, Post-Imperial Democracies: Ideology and Party Formation in Third Republic France, Weimar Germany, and Post-Soviet Russia (2011). Cambridge University Press. Zhirinovsky desired for the inner-boundaries to not be ethnically based, and for all inner regions to be subordinate to a strong central government in Moscow, creating an authoritarian Greater Russia.Hans- Georg Betz, Radical right-wing populism in Western Europe (1994). Palgrave Macmillan: p. 23.John B. Dunlop, The Rise of Russia and the Fall of the Soviet Empire (2011). Princeton University Press, p. 167. However, in 1996, he temporarily began moving in support of Yeltsin's vision to allow independence of former Soviet republics. However, he spoke in support of seeing regions inhabited by ethnic Russians secede from the Republics and join Russia. Despite having since taken many positions to the contrary, during his 1991 presidential campaign, Zhirinovsky stated that he saw a need for Russia to rapidly transition to a, \\"European model of society: free economy, human rights in first place, and civil society.\\" =Cultural preservation= The LDPR places an emphasis on the preservation of Russian culture. Zhirinovsky is against the use of foreign words in the Russian language. Because of this, has proposed renaming the office of president to the \\"Supreme Ruler\\". In his 2018 campaign, he proposed banning foreign-language signage, and issuing penalties for every foreign word uttered by the media. Zhirinovsky has advocated for Volgograd to again be renamed Stalingrad, not because of his ideological position but out of respect for history.–ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–∏–ª –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∏–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –í–æ–ª–≥–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ –≤ –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥ He has also proposed that other cities also restore their Soviet- era names. In August 2014 Zhirinovsky proposed restoring Russia's Imperial flag and anthem. =Ethnic diversity= Zhirinovsky, in 1993, stated his belief that the western powers had divided Russia by splintering its ethnic groups, fostering nationalism among the many minority nationalities in Russia. Zhirinovsky was reported to have declared in the early 1990s, \\"Dark-skinned street vendors in Moscow make it look like a non-Russian city. This is a black stain that should be eradicated.\\" He was also reported to have declared, \\"United States is being overrun by blacks and Hispanics. You and us, the Russians, share the same threat from the dark-skinned people from the Third World.\\"\\" In 2004 Zhirinovsky declared, \\"The white race is perishing. Every day there are fewer and fewer of us. We are half as many as we were 40 years ago. We must unite against the yellow peril and the green menace,\\" referring to Asians and Islam. =Economic policy= Zhirinovsky's economic stances in the 1990s were characterized as 'economic populism'. During his 1991 presidential campaign Zhirinovsky vowed to remove all limitations from all forms of economic activity and to influence such activity only through taxation. Zhirinosky also promised to lower prices on alcohol and to demand its sale in all commercial outlets. He summarized this campaign pledge by promising cheap vodka, \\"at every corner, around the clock if I win.\\" He stated, \\"Vodka is the national drink. It will be cheap when I come to power, and it will be sold at all retail outlets.\\" In 1991 he also promised that he would provide the leadership needed to revive the Russian economy. During the 1993 legislative elections, LDPR believed that privatization should be limited to small or medium-sized business, land should remain under state ownership, industry should be state-controlled and all forms of ‚Äúspeculative trading‚Äù should be prohibited. During the mid-1990s, the LDPR platform was very vague on economic policy, giving no clear indication as to whether it championed a move towards either socialism or capitalism. Instead, the party platform declared that it aimed, \\"to create conditions in the country for the free exercise of the creative powers of the populations inhabiting it, and the assiduous utilization of the natural resources of our country.\\" The LDPR platform also stated that \\"the aim of the LDPR's economic policy is to create a worthy and happy life of dignity and prosperity for every inhabitant of Russia‚Äìgradually without 'revolutionary leaps' and convolutions...without any prompting, or granting of enslaving credit, 'from the outside'.\\" The LDPR advertised that its economic program would bring a supposed \\"100% improvement\\" to the lives of Russians. In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky pledged to crack down on oligarchs if elected president. He additionally proposed restricting speculative investments in housing. Zhirinovsky also proposed removing all restrictions on travel abroad for those with debt. He also proposed banning private debt collection activities, arguing that the exaction of debts owed should be carried out through the legal system and not by private individuals. Additionally, he proposed redenominating the ruble and nationalizing large business chains. =Family and marriage= During his 1991 campaign he promised to provide women with husbands. In 2013 Zhirinovsky declared that the northern caucuses should be surrounded with barbed-wire fence and that its residents should have to pay a tax if they have more than two children (a two- child policy). In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinvosky advocated banning marriages of convenience. He also argued that children should only be born with the consent and will of both parents. =Government reform= Governmental structure of the RSFSR In his 1991 presidential campaign Zhirinovsky vowed to stop the disintegration of the USSR, indicating intention to keep the RSFSR as part of the Soviet Union and halt the decline of the Soviet government His 1991 campaign program also vowed that he would reject the policy by which Russia and the center (i.e. Moscow leadership of the USSR) are placed in opposition with each other. In his 1991 campaign Zhirinovsky also vowed to adopt a new constitution and a new system of legislation. Zhirinovsky promised to \\"resolve national problems as they are resolved throughout the world, that is, by rejecting the division of the country on the basis of ethnic territories and switching instead to a system of division into regions and providences\\". During his 1991 campaign he proposed ending ethnic conflicts by partitioning Russia into gubernii (similar to US states) rather than national- territorial regions. He also proposed creating highly centralized government authority. Governmental structure of the Russian Federation Throughout the existence of the Russian Federation Zhirinovsky has taken a variety of positions on the governmental structure of the Russian government. Zhirinovsky has been an ardent critic of the modern state structure of Russia. In particular, Zhirinovsky has criticized the Federal structure of Russia. In 2003 he proposed merging the then 89 regions of Russia into just 15 providences with leaders directly appointed by the president. During his 2012 campaign, Zhirinovsky stated that he believed that, \\"Russia should be a centralized state without regional princelings\\". In his 2018 campaign Zhirinovsky argued that Russia should be a unitary country that consists of 40 Governorates.–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∏–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é In its 1995 legislative campaign the LDPR promised to preserve Russia's multi-party system if it were to come into power. In 2003, Zhirinovsky proposed getting rid of the Federation Council which he called, \\"irrelevant\\". Zhirinovsky has also proposed reducing the number of members of the State Duma from 450 to 200 and abolishing the Federation Council in order to establish a unicameral parliament.–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–æ–±–µ—â–∞–ª —Å–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —á–∏—Å–ª–æ –¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ —Å–ª—É—á–∞–µ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥—ã –Ω–∞ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ö In August 2014, he argued that Russia should abolish political parties and adopt an autocratic system in which the leader would be chosen by the \\"five to six thousand wisest people\\" in the country. In 2018, after the conclusion of that year's presidential election, he stated that he believed that by 2024 Russia would transition from an elected presidency to an appointed state council. Presidential authority In the early 1990s, Zhirinovsky made it clear that he desired to bring a dictatorship to Russia. He has long advocated for the centralization of power. In contrast with the Communist Party (which was critical towards a \\"strong presidency\\"), the Liberal Democratic Party heavily supported having a \\"strong presidency\\". Zhirinovsky and the LDPR advocated for strong executive authority and a weak legislature. Zhirinovsky sought to enact a strong presidential authority, in essence, a dictatorial/autocratic leadership. The LDPR strongly supported the authority of a president to dissolve parliament, to call for new elections, and to veto laws. In 2003 he proposed establishing an \\"authoritarian regime\\" in Russia. In his 2012 presidential campaign, he reversed his previous positions, proposing that several presidential powers be transferred to the Duma. He also proposed that a new office of \\"tzar\\" be created to serve as Russia's ceremonial head of state. In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky reverted to his earlier stance on presidential authority, pledging to create a \\"brutal dictatorship\\" if he was elected president. =Healthcare= In 1995 the LDPR promised that they would increase the lifespans of Russians. In 2006, Zhirinovsky's proposed solution to deal with the global spread of H5N1 (also known as \\"bird flu\\") was to, \\"shoot all the birds\\" migrating into Russia.Action for protection of birds from Zhirinovsky to be held in Moscow. News.rin.ru. In the 2010s, Zhirinovsky recommended that ways the general public could improve their health included abstaining from alcohol and tobacco, eating less meat, and having less sex. In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky proposed banning the import of genetically modified organisms, which he blamed for health maladies and disease. In 2020, while discussing the coronavirus pandemic, he suggested using Russian prisoners for experimenting with the vaccines of COVID-19.https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest- of-the-world-news/russian-politician-suggests-using-inmates-as-guinea-pigs- for-covid-19.html =Immigration= In the early 1990s Zhirinovsky was reported to have remarked, \\"United States is being overrun by blacks and Hispanics. You and us, the Russians, share the same threat from the dark- skinned people from the Third World.\\" Zhirnovsky has expressed hostility towards Asian immigrants. In his 2008 campaign, Zhirinovsky spoke of locking down and closing all of Russia's borders immediately after the election. Zhirinovsky declared, \\"If you think that these are the actions of a police state, well, be my guest. I promise that I will take these actions.\\" In 2013, Zhirinovsky recommended for all illegal immigrants to leave Russia within a three-year timeframe. In 2013, Zhirinovsky advocated stricter rules regarding the employment of migrant/foreign workers. In September 2016 he proposed building a border wall and banning Muslims from entering Russia. =Law enforcement= The LDPR's platform has proclaimed the primacy of law. During his 1991 presidential campaign Zhirinovsky vowed to adopt effective legislation to defend citizens from the criminal elements. Zhirinovsky vowed to abolish the so-called \\"war of laws\\" in which local authorities were passing laws conflicting with those adopted by the central government in Moscow, and vice versa. He alsopromised to ruthlessly punish crime, including through on- the-spot executions without trial or investigation (summary executions). In the mid-1990s, LDPR sought to launch a dedicated war on crime, targeting all of the several-thousand known gangs in Russia. He proposed creating martial law courts that would carry out summary executions. During the 1993 legislative elections, Zhirinovsky claimed that Russia would see a major increase in national revenues as a result of his proposals to eliminate crime. In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky proposed establishing martial law courts across the whole country, similar to what Pyotr Stolypin did when he was Prime Minister of Russia. He also proposed implementing a general amnesty and humanizing the Criminal Code. He proposed that prisons should only be populated by murderers, robbers, drug dealers, big scammers and thieves. Despite his tough-on-crime stance, Zhirinovsky and his son Igor Lebedev have been accused of selling LDPR seats in the Duma to shady businesspeople in a ploy to help shield the businessmen from criminal prosecution via parliamentary immunity. Zhirinvosky has had a reputation for being involved in corruption. =Media censorship= In a 1994 interview with the Washington Post, Zhirinovsky threatened to prosecute and imprison journalists who \\"interfere with my private life\\" and \\"inflict moral damage on me.\\" Zhirinovsky has directly threatened harm to reporters who have asked him unflattering questions. For instance, on live television in April 2014 Zhirinovsky ordered his aides to rape a journalist who was six-months pregnant. In his 2018 campaign Zhirinovsky pledged that, if elected, he would restrict the amount of negative news coverage the media would be allowed to broadcast at a maximum of 10% of their total news coverage. He would also issue a fine for every foreign word that the media uttered. =Religious freedom= Despite being of Jewish heritage, Zhirinovsky has a history of adopting antisemitic stances. Zhirinovsky is also reported to have once declared, \\"Jewish children are going to school, while our children are hungry and forlorn. If you vote for me, it will stop.\\" Zhirinovsky has proposed placing barbed wired fences along areas of southern Russia where significant Muslim populations live and banning Muslims from entering Russia. =Taxes and funding= Appealing towards ethnic resentments, in one of his televised monologues during his 1996 presidential campaign, Zhirinovsky pledged to end policies that were being carried out, \\"at the expense of the Russian people.\\" Zhirinovsky alleged that the ethnically- defined regions in the Russian Federation, such as the republics of Tartarstan, Yakutiya and the northern caucuses, paid less in taxes and yet received more money from the federal government than other regions did. Zhirinovsky said, =Welfare= During the 1993 legislative election campaign, Zhirinovsky promised that he would provide cheaper vodka to men and better lingerie to women. In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky supported increasing the government assistance provided to single mothers. Foreign policy Zhirinovsky's 1991 presidential campaign program vowed to alter the direction of foreign policy in order to allow all necessary material resources to enter Russia and to guarantee the security of foreign investment. Zhirinovsky also vowed to demand that foreign nations repay or refinance loans they received from both the Soviet authority and Russia. In the fall of 1991, commenting on what he feared to be a future in which Russia had been destroyed by democratic rule would look like, Zhirinovsky predicted , \\"Iran and Afghanistan can drag Central Asia over to its side, Turkey is settling scores with the Transcaucusus; Poland and Romania will take care of Ukraine and Moldova. That leaves an embittered Russia which will torment itself with China and Japan, with the Yakuts and Buriats, with the Volga Region, in an eternal knot of insoluble problems. There are nuclear weapons, and the military factories, and the tanks, and the disgruntled army, returning home from all over : from Germany, the Baltics, Transcaucusia. And all of them are going to Russia.\\" In 1993, Zhirinovsky stated his belief that Russia should not accept foreign financial aid from the west, declaring, \\"Russia without much effort could become a normal civilized state and does not need anyone's help. We don't need humanitarian aid. We Russians don't need leftovers and hand-me-downs.\\" The Liberal Democratic Party's 1996 platform focused more extensively on foreign policy than the Communist Party's (and its candidate Zyuganov's) platform did.The 1996 Russian presidential election / Jerry F. Hough, Evelyn Davidheiser, Susan Goodrich Lehmann. Brookings occasional papers. Additionally, the Liberal Democratic Party's foreign policy stances were more extreme than those of the Communist Party. In a late-January 1996, speech Zhirinovsky delivered to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, Zhirinovsky derided the organization as being a \\"slime pond for defunct politicians entitled to free meals.\\" He remarked that a rejection of Russia's then-pending membership application would drive Russian voters into his party's ranks. Zhirinovsky has been believed to consider the former Central and East European satellite states of the Soviet Union to be part of the Russian sphere of influence. The LDPR sought to end all Russian economic aid to other countries. Zhirinovsky had spoken openly of expanding Russia's territory vastly, including to such lands as Alaska and Finland. In the early 1990s, a frequent backdrop he used for speeches and press events was a map of Russia expanding east through Alaska and west through Finland. Zhirinovsky has had a penchant for geopolitical domination. He believed that it was Russia's destiny to dominate the largely Muslim territories the lie between the former Soviet republics and the Indian Ocean. Zhirnovsky has stated a strong desire to remove Muslim influence in the world. In 1994, while expressing his desire for Russia to capture islamic nations such as Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia for their oil supplies, Zhirinovsky stated that, \\"the whole world should think that if Russia needs it, it is for the best.\\" Zhirinovsky declared that, \\"the majority of mankind is interested in dissecting the Muslim world. The Muslim peril has to be eliminated.\\" He stated that he believed that the Russian army's, \\"last march to the south would lead it to the shores of the Indian Ocean and to the Mediterranean, and mean liberation for 20 million Kurds, hundreds of thousands of Baluchis (and) Pushtuns.\\" He also declared that, \\"the ringing of the Russian Orthodox bells on the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean would be the sound of peace for the people of the region.\\" In 1994 Zhirnovsky wrote that, \\"Russia reaching the shores of the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea is a task that will be the salvation of the Russian nation.\\" Zhirinovsky believes that Russia's possession of nuclear weapons (and the threat of their use) would prevent other nations from stopping expansionist moves on their part. Zhirinovsky is a rather undiplomatic individual. Zhirinovsky has, however, forged relations with far-right and ultranationalist movements abroad, such as the National Revival of Poland, German People's Union, Jean-Marie Le Pen's French National Front. Zhirinovsky was also friendly with foreign strongmen, such as Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Zhirinovsky and his party have opposed NATO expansion, particularly that involving former Soviet republics. In March 2000 Zhirinovsky declared the importance of Russia establishing a military bloc to counter NATO. He stated that such a bloc would, \\"consist of the military forces of Russia, Belarus, and the Republic of Yugoslavia. All Orthodox people should unite, since the Western civilization has united against them,\\" as have \\"the Muslims from the east and south.\\" He also quickly added Ukraine and Bulgaria as nations that he believed would be part of such a bloc. In 2004, Zhirinovsky declared that the west should partner with Russia to expunge the threats of islamic extremism and Asian immigrants. Zhirinovsky declared, \\"The white race is perishing. Every day there are fewer and fewer of us. We are half as many as we were 40 years ago. We must unite against the yellow peril and the green menace. We both have the same problem: the invasion of the Asians. You have Pakistan and India, we have central Asia and the Caucasus. Washington, London, Moscow and Tel Aviv need to form a common front. If we don't, the terrorist attacks we see today will continue for another 50 years.\\" In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky expressed intentions to pursue an aggressive policy, but normalize relations with the West.–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π: —è –±—É–¥—É –∑–∞—â–∏—â–∞—Ç—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≤–µ–∑–¥–µ  I will protect Russians everywhere . LDPR official website. Published 28 October 2016. Retrieved 7 May 2017. Zhirinovsky has promised to return Russia's borders to that of 1985 Soviet boundaries. During his 2018 campaign, he stated that he would accomplish this by demanding referendums in former Soviet republics. =Baltic states= Zhirinovsky has expressed a strong desire for reuniting Russia with former Soviet states in the Baltics. In June 1991 Zhirinovsky expressed that he would be willing to allow Lithuania independence, but only because he believed that Lithuanians would quickly discover that, \\"nobody in Europe will buy Lithuanian cheese,\\" thus Lithuanians would not remain independent very long. He also stated that he would only allow an independent Lithuania that is, \\"a small independent state, an enclave.\\"Leningradskaya pravda,\\" 25 June 1991 However, in August he expressed plans to annex Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and have them form a single gubernii of Russia. In October 1991, Zhirinivsky expressed a willingness to take far more extreme measures, threatening to bury nuclear waste along Russia's border with the Baltics, and blow radiation into the Baltics utilizing fans. Zhirinovsky declared, In December 1993, Zhirinovsky stated that he believed that Estonia would be forced back into union with Russia by \\"economic means.\\" He elaborated that, \\"If they don't behave, we'll switch off their lights.\\"\\"La Stampa,\\" 16 December 1993 In the same month, Zhirinovsky expressed a willingness to allow an independent Baltic state, but one that is, \\"reduced to the size of Liechtenstein\\".\\"Frankfurter Allgemeine,\\" 16 December 1993 In January 1994, Le Monde published a Zhirinovsky-autographed map that showed the Estonian capital, Tallinn, and Lithuania's former capital of Kaunas, as free city-states, with the rest of the Baltics as a part of Russia. Around the time of his 2008 campaign Zhirinovsky encouraged ethnic Russians living in the Baltics to pursue separatist movements. In August 2014 Zhirinovsky threatened to carpet bomb the Baltics. =Bulgaria= In January 1994 Zhirinovsky was expelled from Bulgaria for insulting their president, Zhelyu Zhelev. Zhirinovsky had insisted that Zhelev needed to resign from office and be sent away to Siberia and that Zhirinovsky's former economic advisor Svetozar Stoilov, who had been involved in founding a Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party in 1989 led by Veselin Koshev, should replace him as president. Other comments Zhirinovsky made at this time include insisting that Thrace and historical Macedonian territory needed to be returned by Greece to the control of Bulgaria, as did the Romanian northern part of Dobruja. =Georgia= In 1994, Zhirinovsky wrote, \\"Georgia is an impediment to us. We must change our border.\\" =Finland= Zhirinovsky has previously suggested that Russia should expand its territory by annexing Finland. Particularly in the early 1990s, he frequently suggested that Finland (which had been a part of the Russian Empire prior to 1917) should be returned to Russian rule. In May 1991, during his first presidential campaign, he promised to return Finland to Russian control as soon as he was inaugurated. After he lost the election, he continued to use the slogan \\"a Russian Finland\\" at rallies. In May 1992 he declared to a Finnish reporter that he saw the future of Finland, \\"only as a component of a renewed powerful Russia.\\" In response to this, Finnish defense minister Elisabeth Rehn responded to this by saying, \\"Zhirinovsky is regarded in Finland as being something of a harmless loudmouth, but that he is not. I see the national chauvinism stirred up by Zhirinovsky as a threat to Finland.\\" =France= In 1995 Zhirinovsky sent France a letter of congratulations about their nuclear tests. In February 2015 Zhrinovsky advocated burning down Paris. =Germany= In his 1991 presidential campaign, Zhirinovsky promised that he would feed Russia within 72 hours of taking office by using military force to coerce Germany into supplying them with food, saying, \\"I'll bring troops into former East Germany ‚Äîa million and a half people, they'll rattle their weapons, including nuclear ones, and everything will appear.\\" In the early 1990s Zhirinovsky issued threats to nuke Germany. In late 1993 he stated that he would nuke Germany if they ever interfered in Russian affairs. Zhirinovsky made comments stating that he preferred to see a Germany that was, \\"as small as Austria\\". These comments are believed to have spurred the dissolution of an allegiance that once existed between the LDPR and the far-right German People's Union. In February 2015 Zhirinovsky advocated the destruction of Germany. =Greece= In January 1994 Zhirinovsky insisted that Thrace and historical Macedonian territory needed to be returned by Greece to the control of Bulgaria. =Iran= Zhirinovsky once proposed removing restrictions on arms sales to Iran.Zhirinovsky: Russia's political eccentric, BBC News, 10 March 2000 Zhirinovsky has also, previously, discussed a desire for Russia to capture Iranian territory. In 2019, Zhirinovsky called for Russia and Iran to establish a joint military base. =India= In 1995, Zhirinovsky condemned the partition of India during a visit to the country and called for India to reclaim the lost territory, drawing criticism from Pakistan and Bangladesh. He also called for donating Russian arms to India, greater imports of \\"high quality Indian foodstuffs and consumer goods\\" instead of \\"third class goods from Muslim countries\\", and expressed support for the Indian position on the Kashmir conflict.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/03/08/zhirinovsky- in-india-offers-suggestions-for-redrawing-asian- map/7d2bc238-d74c-4052-b807-2a561c1976f7/ =Relations with Israel= Zhirinovsky and the LDPR were initially anti-Zionist and frequently espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories about \\"Zionist plots\\". LDPR has actively courted antisemitic voters. Zhirinovsky visited Israel for the first time in 2003. An LDPR affiliate party was also established that year in Israel to represent Israelis of Russian descent. In 2004, Zhirinovsky called for a \\"common front\\" between Russia and Israel against Islamic extremism. During a trip to Israel in 2006, Zhirinovsky declared his support for closer ties with Israel and stated that \\"Russia will never allow any kind of violence against Israel\\".–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π: —è ‚Äì –Ω–µ \\"—Å—ã–Ω —é—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞\\". –†–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± –æ—Ç—Ü–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏: 25 –∏—é–Ω—è 2006 –≥, Newsru.co.il–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –≤ –ò–∑—Ä–∞–∏–ª–µ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –æ–± –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–∏–∑–º–µ –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ 25 —Ñ–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—è 2014 –≥., 21:14, NewsRU.co.il =Japan= In the early 1990s Zhirinovsky issued threats to nuke Japan. He was reported to have, in the early 1990s, remarked, \\"I would bomb the Japanese. I would sail our large navy around their small island, and if they so much as cheeped, I would nuke them.\\" In late 1993 he stated that he would nuke Japan if they ever interfered in Russian affairs. Zhirinovsky once proposed selling Russia's claim to the disputed Kuril Islands to Japan for 50 billion USD. =Poland= In August 2014, Zhirinovsky threatened to carpet-bomb Poland. =Serbia= Zhirinovsky vocally supported the Serbian forces in the Bosnian War. In January 1994 Zhirinovsky declared that, \\"We are supporting the Serbs and our standpoint is that the Serb lands--the Serbian Republic and the Republic of Serbian Krajina should be within the Republic of Serbia.\\" He also declared that he would be, \\"happy if Russia and Serbia had a common border.\\" =Turkey= Zhirinovsky once wrote that Russia should annex all Turkish countries because, the Russian soldier \\"must clean his boots in the Indian Ocean.\\" By 2008 Zhirinovsky was supporting Russia's efforts to lure Turkey away from Western allegiances. Zhirinovsky advised the Turkish to, \\"Learn Russian, don't look to the West, look north. The EU doesn't want you, but we want you. We'll give you gas, you give us nuts!\\" Deriding NATO (of which Turkey is a member) as an \\"imperialist club\\", Zhirinvosky urged Turkey to forget about Europe and construct an alliance with Russia. In November 2015, after an incident in which a Russian bomber was shot down by a Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet after an air-space violation, he stated in a speech to the Duma that Russia must detonate a nuclear bomb on the Bosphorus to create a 10 meters high tsunami wave that would wipe out at least 9 million Istanbul residents. In 2018, Zhirinovsky attended President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's inauguration ceremonyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO_gYZCoE-g and praised the improved ties between Russia and Turkey.https://www.dw.com/en/the-dagger- in-our-backs-is-forgotten/a-36513714 Zhirinovsky subsequently claimed Erdogan had expressed interest in withdrawal from NATO.https://hawarnews.com/en/haber/russian-partys-head-erdogan-informed-me- of-his-willingness-to-get-out-of-nato-h10313.html =Ukraine= In the 1990s Zhirinovsky rejected Ukrainian independence, believing Ukraine to be a part of the Russian state. Zhirinovsky strongly supported the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. When, in the wake of the 2014 Crimean crisis, franchises of the fast-food restaurant McDonald's were unable to continue because they had been cut off by their Ukrainian franchisor. Zhirinovsky suggested that McDonald's \\"should be evicted from Russia\\" for the affront. In July 2014, amidst an armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry launched criminal proceedings against Zhirinovsky and Communist Party of the Russian Federation leader Gennady Zyuganov for \\"financing actions aimed at changing the boundaries of the territory and the state border of Ukraine\\".Ukraine opens criminal cases against Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky for funding separatism, Interfax-Ukraine (25 July 2014) In May 2015 Zhirinovsky declared that former President of Georgia (and then-governor of Odessa, Ukraine) Mikheil Saakashvili, should be killed. \\"We will shoot all of your governors, starting with Saakashvili, then they'll be afraid. And there will be a different situation in Europe and Ukraine. ... Let's aim at Berlin, Brussels, London, and Washington.\\" He then said Ukrainian political prisoner Nadiya Savchenko should be shot and hanged in Belgrade. In July 2017 Zhirinovsky remarked that ‚Äúthe final result‚Äù to unrest in Ukraine would be that the country would be divided after many rounds of negotiations. He remarked that the, ‚Äúsouth- eastern Ukraine and the Russian population will go to Russia, but the north- west will become a nationalist state of seven to eight million people ‚Ä¶ will become a member of NATO and the European Union.‚Äù In February 2018 Zhirinovsky proposed deploying a nuclear bomb in Ukraine in order to kill Petro Poroshenko remarking that Russia should drop, \\"a tiny bomb. Not a big Hiroshima, but a small one. Right there where the residence of Ukrainian President Poroshenko is.\\" =United Kingdom= Zhirinovsky has stated that the United Kingdom has been Russia's, \\"worst enemy of the last few centuries,\\" while adding that, \\"in the 20th century the USA took Britain's place\\". Around the time of his 2008 campaign, Zhirinovsky suggested dropping nukes into the Atlantic in order to cause a tsunami that would flood Great Britain. Around the same time, Zhirinovsky organized an anti-British rally outside of the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow. In 2019, Zhirinovsky and the LDPR endorsed Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson in order to \\"quickly bring Britain out of the European Union\\".https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/12/12/russian- nationalist-party-leader-endorses-johnson-in-uk-election-a68588 =United States= Zhirinovsky has held a very hostile stance towards America, blaming it for all of the world's war and disease, particularly AIDS. In 1991 he threatened to, if the United States would not stop supporting separatist movements in the Soviet Union, establish an independent state within United States territory populated exclusively by African Americans. Zhirinovsky regarded American president Bill Clinton to be a weak president. Zhirinovsky was bitter that Clinton failed to meet with him during his trip to Moscow in early 1994. However, Zhirinovsky had also suggested that he would be able to get along well with Clinton if they met. Zhirinovsky made the suggestion that he would take the American president to one of Russia's brothels and make him forget all about his wife Hillary. In his 1996 campaign, Zhirinovsky's broader foreign policy objectives would require the United States' position in the world to be undermined in order to restructure the existing world order. Zhirinovsky and his party opposed the START II treaty, claiming that it made Russian a secondary state. According to Zhirinovsky, his party only supported agreements, \\"that do not humiliate, insult, or limit Russia as a great nation.\\" Zhirinovsky believed that there was far too much American culture on Russian television, particularly violent programming and advertising. In the 1990s, Zhirinovsky intended to negotiate an arrangement to purchase Alaska back from the United States. He has continued to encourage Russia to take back Alaska. In 2002 Zhirinovsky made an, evidently drunken, speech against America's war in Iraq (a country led by Zhirinovsky's personal ally Saddam Hussein) in which he issued particularly harsh and profain suggestions about the United States and its leaders. He referred to the counrry as a ‚Äúsecond- hand goods store‚Äù filled with ‚Äúcocksuckers, handjobbers, and faggots.‚Äù He issued an outlandish threat, declaring that he would alter the gravitational field of the Earth in order to sink the entirety of the United States into the oceans. Zhirinovsky proclaimed that American president George W. Bush (son of former president George H. W. Bush) had \\"daddy issues\\" and was an ignoramous who could not count or say much. He issued horrendously racist and sexist statements about then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice saying, In 2006, he again disparaged Condoleezza Rice (by then America's Secretary of State) by issuing sexist and ageist remarks saying, Zhirinovsky thought poorly of Bush's successor Barack Obama. Zhirinovsky was known to have told obscene jokes and made derisive remarks about Obama. Zhirinovsky condemned the 2012 reelection of Obama, saying that it signaled the beginning of a, \\"slow self- isolation,\\" for the United States and that indicated that the United States would be, \\"doomed to stagnation\\". In early 2014, Zhirinovsky suggested that Obama should divorce his wife Michelle so that he could become a more effective leader, arguing that national leaders should be celibate and focus only on their job. However, later that year, Zhirinovsky expressed admiration for Michelle Obama's focus on improving the nutrition in the lunches provided to students at American schools, and even expressed his interest in having a dialogue with Michelle Obama about the subject of school lunches and childhood nutrition. In 2014, he also argued that Barack Obama should be stripped of his Nobel Peace Prize. That same year he also threatened to attack Washington, D.C.. During the 2016 US presidential election, Zhirinovsky actively supported then-candidate Donald Trump. Trump was running against, and ultimately defeated Hillary Clinton, wife of former president Bill Clinton. Zhirinovsky had voiced his personal distain for both Clintons since the early 1990s. Zhirinovsky's support of Trump was due to the fact that, in Russia, Trump was often compared with Zhirinovsky, mainly because of the similarity of their style of performance. Zhirinovsky said that he hoped to improve relations between the US and Russia if Trump became President. Zhirinovsky promised that, in the case of a Trump victory, he would drink champagne for him. After the victory of Donald Trump in the election, the Liberal Democratic Party organized a celebratory banquet for 100 thousand rubles (US$1.5 thousand).Donald Trump \\"America's Zhirinovsky\\"? - See what Zhirinovsky says about this comparison–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π: –ø—É—Å—Ç—å –±–∞–±—É—à–∫–∞ –•–∏–ª–ª–∞—Ä–∏ –æ—Ç–¥—ã—Ö–∞–µ—Ç However, after the US missile strike on Syria in April 2017, Zhirinovsky said that Trump's foreign policy does not match the one for which his voters voted and that he will drink champagne for his impeachment.–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∑–∞—è–≤–∏–ª, —á—Ç–æ –≤—ã–ø—å–µ—Ç —à–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞ –∏–º–ø–∏—á–º–µ–Ω—Ç –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø–∞–ñ–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–∑–æ—á–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª—Å—è –≤ –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø–µ, –ø—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∏–≤—à–∏—Å—å –ø–∏—Ç—å —à–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞ –µ–≥–æ –∏–º–ø–∏—á–º–µ–Ω—Ç In his 2018 campaign, Zhirinovsky promised that would be able to normalize relations with the United States. =Trade= During the 1993 legislative elections Zhirinovsky proposed ceasing assistance to other countries in order to invest more funds in improving Russia's economy. He also advocated increasing arms sales abroad in order to raise Russia's national revenue. In his 2012 presidential campaign Zhirinovsky proposed implementing agricultural import and export bans. In his 2018 campaign he argued that all of Russian citizens should have access to its gas before any of it is shipped abroad. Military policy Zhirinovsky had long been an ardent backer of Russia's defense industry. Since its founding, LDPR sought to enact a military policy that would fund a strong military force. The party sought to an end to the conversion of military industry to civilian uses. It also sought to transition the nation's military into a fully professional force by ending conscription. In the late 1980s Zhirinovsky spoke at rallies, delivering speeches urging a withdrawal from the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. He criticized Gorbachev, who he had previously been praiseful of. During his 1991 presidential campaign he vowed to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet army. In his 1991 presidential campaign Zhirinovsky vowed to gradually eliminate the policy of conscription, transitioning Russia's military into an entirely professional force. He also pledged, \\"If I win, I will raise the monetary compensation for an officer to four thousand rubles.\\" He vowed to fund this by selling arms to other nations and by using the hard currency which Soviet military people received for serving in the United Nations' troops. In his 1991 campaign he additionally promised to provide land to returning troops. In the 1990s the LDPR voiced its intent to avoid using the Russian military to solve the problems of other nations, arguing that this lowers the prestige of the military. In the 1990s Zhirnonvsky planned to use the military as a tool to unify the nation and strengthen the power of the LDPR, and intended to bridge the divide between the civilian and military populations by uniting both around a common \\"foreign enemy\\", such as the United States or \\"zionist\\" ideology. Zhirinovsky has had a tendency to make inflammatory and frightening statements about military hostility and aggression.Moscow Izvestia, January 21, 1994 pages 1-2Moscow Izvestia January 24, 1994 pages 31-33Interview by David Frost of CNN with Zhirnovsky March 25, 1994Washington Times, December 14, 1993 A14 Many have regarded Zhirinivosky's attitude towards war to be frighteningly cavalier. During the 1990s Zhirinovsky supported military action in Chechnya. In fact, in his speech at the 1996 LDPR congress, Zhirinovsky went as far as to argue that Russia should drop napalm on Chechnya. In 1994, Zhirinvosky declared, \\"The new military can be reborn only in the course of a military operation. An army degenerates in the barracks. It needs a goal, a great task. It needs to exercise its muscle.\\" That year he also wrote, \\"New armed forces are only born in combat operations. You cannot build an army in commissariats and barracks.\\" References Category:Vladimir Zhirinovsky Zhirinovsky ","title":"Political positions of Vladimir Zhirinovsky"},{"id":"57920577","text":"Smokey Haangala (1950‚Äì1988), born Edwin Haakulipa Haangala, was a Zambian poet, writer, composer, musician and journalist.

It was designed by Designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet and built by Gatby and Flock. The property is owned by Australia Post (Federal Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  = Background = The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived, however this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW. In 1863, the Postmaster General WH Christie noted that accommodation facilities for Postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The first telegraph line was opened in Victoria in March 1854 and in NSW in 1858. The NSW colonial government constructed two lines from the General Post Office, Sydney, one to the South Head Signal Station, the other to Liverpool. Development was slow in NSW compared to the other states, with the Government concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban ones. As the line spread, however, telegraph offices were built to accommodate the operators. Unlike the Post Office, the telegraph office needed specialised equipment and could not be easily accommodated in a local store or private residence. Post and telegraph offices operated separately until 1870 when the departments were amalgamated, after which time new offices were built to include both postal and telegraph services. In 1881 the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney, three years after the first tests in Adelaide. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in country NSW from the late 1880s onwards. Again the Post Office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, further emphasising its place in the community as a provider of communications services. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period featured in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the 1890s Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975, the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department. This was the creation of Telecom and Australia Post. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings towards smaller shop front style post offices. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = Junee Post Office = On 20 January 1862, the residents of Junee (now Old Junee) petitioned the Postmaster General to have a post office established there. Junee was the largest town in the district known collectively as The Levels, and its central position in the district aided in its choice as the post office site. The petition was successful with a post office established at Junee on 1 May 1862 in the store of Mr Edward Smith, who was also appointed postmaster on a salary of ¬£12 per annum. The post office continued to operate from Smith's store until November 1867 when it moved to Mrs Dacey's Inn. The operation of the post office from the business premises of the postmaster or postmistress was common practice prior to the restructuring of the Postal Service into a professional government agency in 1862. Junee continued this tradition due to the town's small size in the 1860s, which did not justify the construction of a separate office at this time. In May 1878, in anticipation of the opening of the new railway (Main South railway) linking Sydney to Junee (opened 6 June 1878), the residents of Junee, Boree and Wantabadgery requested that a new office be opened at Junee railway station. A receiving station was subsequently opened at the station on 12 June 1878 in George Dobbyns' store near the station, just six days after the opening of the railway. Dobbyns also had the contract to transport the mail between the station and the Junee township for ¬£25 per annum until November when it was transferred to Denis Kaveneh. In November a petition was forwarded requesting that money order facilities be provided at the Railway Station Post Office, as they were from 5 May 1879. In July 1881 Junee Railway Station Post Office was renamed Junee Junction Post Office, with a branch of the Government Savings Bank opened there on 1 July 1882. The \\"junction\\" referred to the junction of the south western railway and the main southern railway around which a small township had developed. In March 1883 a portable wooden building was purchased for ¬£135 to be used as a temporary telegraph office at Junee Junction. The telegraph had operated in Junee since 1878 with Francis Turner as the telegraph master at Junee. The new \\"American Cottage\\" style telegraph office was converted in August 1883 to serve as the post office as well. The local residents petitioned for the postmaster, Mr Mann, to be retained as Postmaster after the move, which he was in the position of Temporary Postmaster. The staff at Junee Junction consisted of Mann on ¬£104 plus ¬£12 porterage allowance per annum, a telegraph master on ¬£104 and a messenger on ¬£26 per annum. Later, in 1883, Junee Junction became an official post office with Mr Mann as the first official postmaster. An assistant, A. Henriques, joined Mann in October 1884, after requesting help to cope with the increasing business at Junee Junction. Mann reported that the population of Junee Junction, taking in the three settlements of Crawlys Town, Dobbyns Town and Loftus, was 1100 adults. In September 1884 the Junee Junction Progress Committee recommended that a post and telegraph office be erected on land adjoining the railway station. As Junee Junction grew, the residents of old Junee began to call for the name to be changed. In June 1886 Mr S Storey, a storekeeper from Junee, complained that it was a great nuisance to have the Junction called by the same name as the town that had been in existence since the 1850s. A report noted that at this time the Junction had a population of 2000, while old Junee had approximately 100 people. With the growing population, pressure to build the new post office increased and in 1886 the PMG approved construction of the new building. A site was purchased from the Railway Department for ¬£700 on Lorne Street. The block had a frontage of seventy five feet to Lorne street and was 100 feet deep. The Colonial Architect, James Barnet, forwarded the plans for the post office to the Works Department on 11 January 1887. As the building was to be attached to a railway premises, the Railway Department took charge of the construction and advised the cost would be approximately ¬£1200. The tender for the construction was given out to Messrs Gatby and Flock by the railway department for ¬£1304.18.6, with construction completed and the building occupied by 11 July 1888. In August 1888 it was again suggested that the name of the post office be changed, this time to Junee which was the Borough name. However, the Department of Railways objected and so no change was made. In October 1891 a Postal Inspector visited Junee Junction Post and Telegraph Office reported that the hours of the telegraph operators were too long, as there was only two in the office. As Junee was an important telegraph junction and relay station for messages the two operators often worked from 7.30am until 8.15pm, while taking turns working on Sunday. In contrast, the post office work was fairly distributed between the postmaster and his operators. From November 1893, following representations from the Junee Municipal Council, the name of the Junee Junction Post Office was officially changed to Junee. During the same year repairs were carried out costing ¬£124. Further repairs and alterations were carried out on the building in 1897 by DH Taunton for ¬£773.17, finished in 1898. This work included the enlargement of the public lobby with a new twelve foot long counter opposite the entrance. The lobby was divided with the postal department on one side and the telegraph department on the other. In December 1898 the Department of Works decided to erect a balcony the full length of the Post Office instead of a verandah along half of it as had been originally contemplated. In June 1899 a proposal for the erection of a clock at the office was discussed. Initially it was suggested that the clock could be placed in the fanlight of the office, but this was rejected on the basis that the position would block airflow to the office. It was decided that instead the clock would be erected on the verandah to the left of the entrance. Repairs to the ceiling of the old portion of the post office were carried out on 18 July 1899. D. H. Taunton was again employed to replace the old ceiling, part of which had fallen in, with boards, and to reinstate the counter, glass screens and folding doors. A single-storey addition to the northern side of the post office was constructed in , with the front awning extended along the full length of the building at the same time. Further alterations were made to the office in 1927 by A. S. Fairweather. The first- floor balcony was removed and the French doors replaced with double hung sash windows during the 1960s. The post office was repainted in the early 1990s, and the interior retail area was changed at around the same time.  Description  The Junee Post Office is a prominent two-storey painted brick building (excepting the face brick rear wall), constructed in the Victorian Regency Style and built in 1888. It has a predominantly hipped, corrugated iron roof and there is a parapeted gable end to the single-storey northern addition. The roof is punctuated by a total of five chimneys with rendered and ornately moulded tops on face brick bodies, four located on the two-storey section and one on the single-storey section. The outbuildings feature skillion roofs. Several documented additions have occurred to Junee Post Office since first construction. These include the extension of the northern side of the two storey-section in -9, the addition of the verandah and a first floor balcony at about the same time, the extension of the verandah with the single storey addition to the north and the removal of the balcony . The eastern facade has an unusually wide, pavement-width verandah on the ground floor which has a low pitched roof clad in corrugated iron with a heavy, dentilled entablature, supported by paired, green painted cast iron posts. The pavement is a combination of bitumen and brick pavers and the soffit is green painted corrugated iron with an ovolo cornice, exposed beams and attached fluorescent lighting. Junee Post Office is a cream painted brick building of various different types of brickwork, including English bond on the northern facade, Flemish bond on the eastern facade and Colonial bond on the southern facade. Posts, soffit and window sills are detailed in dark green, with cream painted window frames. It is a simply detailed building overall, with bracketed window sills and bracketed eaves. The most elaborate items noted are the elaborately moulded chimney tops. The interior ground floor of Junee Post Office comprises four main areas. These include: the residence at the rear, containing vinyl tiled kitchen, tiled laundry, carpeted lounge and pantry; the carpeted retail area at the northern end; the vinyl sheet mail room at the southern side; and staff amenities at the centre rear. Ceilings of the ground floor are varied. The retail area, kitchen and laundry have board and batten ceilings with a moulded cornice. The pantry and rear entry porch have a boarded ceiling, the mail room and north western store room have plaster ceilings with a wide moulded cornice and the kitchen has a plasterboard ceiling. The residence stair hall retains a plaster ceiling with an ornate moulded cornice. The ground floor has suspended and attached fluorescent lighting and some ceiling fans. The architraves of the ground floor appear to be original or early with some modifications. There is original skirting in the stair hall and lounge, with a later, plain picture rail in the lounge and cut render dado line in the kitchen. Modern skirting and details are part of the standard Australia Post fitout of the mail room and retail area. There are predominantly single pane upper and lower sash windows, with some internal glazing within partitions. Internal doors are four panel within the residence and later modern flush doors in the Post Office section and modern front door. There are fanlights over some internal doorways. Walls to the ground floor are rendered and painted brick in a grey colour scheme in the retail area and cream scheme to the remainder. There is a standard Australia Post fitout of the retail area, including partition walls enclosing the office and storage space of the retail area. The five fireplaces of the ground floor have been bricked in and gas taps have been installed, with a single marble surround retained in the lounge room. The main stair appears to be original, with polished and painted, turned timber posts and balusters. The stair is fully carpeted, with carved timber brackets and original skirting that has been painted white. The first floor comprises the residence bedrooms and lounge room, fully carpeted excepting the tiled bathroom and toilet in the north western corner. Ceilings of the first floor include square set plaster in the western bedroom with a moulded ceiling rose, pressed metal in the lounge room, stair hall and landing, board and batten in the eastern bedroom and boarded ceilings in the hall, bathroom and toilet. The first floor has predominantly attached fluorescent lighting. Architraves on the first floor appear to be original, with simple picture rails in the corner lounge room, western and eastern bedrooms. There is original or early skirting on this level, excepting the bathroom and toilet additions. Windows are predominantly early, single pane upper and lower sash windows, with original or early four panel doors with fanlights, and modern flush doors to the bathroom and toilet. Walls on the first floor are rendered and painted brick, in a cream colour scheme with plasterboard or masonite partitions in the bathroom and toilet and later board and batten wall between the eastern bedroom and hall. The two fireplaces of the first floor have been boarded over and the surrounds have been retained. Signage of Junee Post Office is limited to the lettering \\"Junee Post Office\\" centred on the eastern face of the awning entablature, and a standard Australia Post sign below the entablature of the northern end of the verandah. Junee Post Office is located on the main street of historic Junee in a prominent position opposite a major intersection. It is surrounded by predominantly single to two-storey, late nineteenth to mid-twentieth century retail and commercial buildings, with a Victorian cottage to the south of the building. There are mature trees within the rear yard of the building and there is a bitumen carpark to the west of the site, servicing the nearby historic railway station and associated buildings. There are several outbuildings within the site area. These include the most recent weatherboard and fibre-cement sheet shed in the south west corner of the site and early weatherboard shed to the west of the laundry, both in fair condition. There is an intrusive modern, white painted brick telephone booth shelter to the north of the Post Office, in front of the intrusive Telstra building. There is also a face brick pre-1917 store and former mechanics room to the north west of the site in good condition. The condition of the post office was reported as good as at 5 July 2000, with the archaeological potential of the site is regarded as high. As there have been a series of additions and alterations to Junee Post Office, the remaining original interior fabric on the ground floor has been altered substantially. The exterior has also undergone a series of changes over time. However, Junee Post Office retains the features which make it culturally significant, including architectural details such as the wide ground floor verandah and the hipped corrugated iron roof, as well as its overall form and style. = Modifications and dates = The original Junee Post Office building was completed in July 1888, comprising a simple two- storey face brick building with a hipped roof and classically-styled entrance. In 1893 unspecified repairs were completed. During 1897-9, alterations and repairs were carried out. These included the enlargement of the public lobby, the installation of a twelve-foot counter, new glass screens and folding doors, front awning and balcony construction, installation of the clock below the awning to the left of the entrance and the ceiling of the old Post Office portion was removed and boarded. This is probably when the two-storey section of the building was extended to the north, if not earlier. The date of this addition has been determined from early photos and plans, where the original form of the building is the southern side and its two front chimneys can still be clearly seen. (See Images 7, 8 & 11.) The single-storey addition to the northern side was constructed and the front awning was extended to the full length of the building, . During 1927, unspecified alterations were carried out. Removal of the first floor balcony occurred , which saw the replacement of the French doors with double hung sash windows. Repainting occurred by Australia Post in sympathetic colours, and at about the same time, the standard Australia Post retail fitout occurred.

It was the first wind farm to be built in North Yorkshire in over 15 years, and was believed to be the first time that civilian air traffic was considered in the planning permission process. History The proposal to build a wind farm on the site was first unveiled in 2003 when 6,000 homes in the area were leafleted with information about the wind farm. At that early stage, many objections were registered, including one from the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE). Planning consent for the wind farm was rejected by Harrogate Borough Council in November 2004. The management team at Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA), whose runway is only south of the site, stated that the farm would have a detrimental effect on air traffic control as it could create false indications of aircraft. Other objectors pointed out that the site of was only away from the Nidderdale AONB. Npower appealed against the decision and the application then went before a public enquiry, which gained government consent in September 2005. The objection by LBA towards the wind farm is believed to be the first time that civilian air traffic paths have featured in an onshore wind farm consent inquiry. The planning inspector also rejected the idea of affixing red lights to each tower as it was thought that they could interfere with drivers concentration on the adjacent A59 road. Building of the ¬£13 million wind farm west of Harrogate in Felliscliffe by the A59 road, was started in March 2007, completed by the summer of 2008 with full commissioning of the site starting in November of the same year. The wind farm consists of eight towers which are high, with the addition of the rotors, the full height that they extend to is . The site covers an area of at an elevation of above sea level, so they can be seen from some distance away. Each generating unit was constructed by Senvion and is capable of generating 2 MW of power with the whole farm itself generating 16 MW in total. This provides enough electricity per year to power 7,000 homes and offsets over of carbon dioxide going into the environment on an annual basis. One of the turbines caught fire in January 2017 and had to be extinguished by North Yorkshire fire service. Each unit operates in tandem with three others (the Knabs Ridge site has eight units, which operate in two groups of four) which resulted in all four generating units being turned off. Seven months after the fire, the owners were seeking to overturn a condition in the planning permission of the site that was set in 2005. If a turbine was to not generate power in over twelve months, then the owners are required to remove the tower and return the land to grazing purposes for cattle. By October 2017, the tower was still not active.

His career was associated primarily with Athletic Bilbao, winning the national championship in 1984 as well as the Copa del Rey, in which he scored the winning goal in the final. He also featured in La Liga for Real Valladolid. He later served a spell as manager of amateur club CD Getxo. Playing career =Athletic Bilbao= Born in Bilbao, Biscay, Basque Country, Endika was a graduate of Athletic Bilbao's youth system. He made his senior debut with the reserve team, Bilbao Athletic, in the regionalised third tier during 1979‚Äì80. Midway through his second campaign, he made his league debut for the Athletic senior team on 30 November 1980, a 4‚Äì1 defeat away to Real Sociedad, scoring a late consolation goal for his side. He was promoted at the start of the following campaign, but only made seven league appearances and three in the Copa Del Rey, usually appearing from the bench or himself being substituted. Under coach Javier Clemente, Athletic were beginning were one of the most successful periods in club history, in which they were champions of Spain in 1982‚Äì83 and 1983‚Äì84 before finishing third in the next two seasons. Endika missed the first of those league wins, having been loaned back to the third tier to play for AD Ceuta for the whole of 1982‚Äì83. On his return to Bilbao, he began to feature more regularly and appeared 23 times as they retained the championship. He played and scored in the second leg of the 1983 Supercopa de Espa√±a which Athletic lost on aggregate to FC Barcelona, and featured in six matches during the run to the 1984 Copa del Rey Final including both legs of the semi-final in which Athletic overcame Real Madrid C.F. on penalties. He was then selected to start the final against Barcelona, and scored what would be the only goal of the match in the 14th minute with a left-footed shot. However, his achievement was overshadowed in the reporting of the match due to the violent scenes after the final whistle between both sets of players. Athletic were awarded the Supercopa automatically the following year having won the double, and at the end of the season they reached the 1985 Copa del Rey Final, this time losing 2‚Äì1 to Atl√©tico Madrid ‚Äì Endika was brought on as a substitute with his team chasing a two-goal deficit. In 1986‚Äì87, Endika posted his best figures for Athletic (30 league matches, completing 90 minutes in half of those), benefitting from a serious injury to fellow forward Jos√© Mar√≠a Noriega. However, he only scored five goals, with his final appearance for the club being a 2‚Äì1 win away to UD Las Palmas on 20 June 1987. =Later years= In summer 1987, Endika signed for top division side Real Valladolid, making 24 league appearances but scoring only three time and falling out of favour towards the end of the season. He moved on to second tier RCD Mallorca, playing less often ‚Äì 626 minutes from 15 matches, two goals ‚Äì but helping the club achieve promotion in 4th place. Endika again moved clubs that summer, returning to the Spanish mainland and dropping down to Segunda B to play for H√©rcules CF. In Alicante he featured regularly, but the club finished only 13th, and he transferred to neighbours Benidorm CF who had been 5th in the same group. In his final season as a professional, Endika made 32 appearances and scored 4 goals as Benidorm achieved a respectable 10th place. =International= As an emerging player at Athletic Bilbao, Endika was selected for Spain Under-19 in 1981, and later played two matches for the Under-21s in 1984. He was never selected for the senior team. Coaching career Endika studied in sports medicine while still playing, and after retiring he became a physical education teacher at an ikastola in Sopelana, as well as a football coach. He had a spell as manager of amateurs CD Getxo (his childhood club as a player), taking over in 2011 after previously coaching its youth teams and winning promotion from the Biscay Divisi√≥n de Honor to the Tercera Divisi√≥n (regionalised fourth tier) at the first attempt, with his son Markel among the players. However the club were relegated back on the final matchday of the 2012‚Äì13 season after rivals SD Balmaseda won their fixture. Personal life Endika is the uncle of footballer Iker Guarrotxena, who also came through the ranks at Athletic Bilbao but played professionally for teams such as CD Mirand√©s. He has been involved in politics, favouring left-wing organisations such as EH Bildu (a coalition of Basque nationalist parties); in 2012, he coached one of the teams in an Athletic Bilbao vs Real Sociedad veterans match for the benefit of ETA prisoners.

Life Maran was a second child of Elfriide Maran, who later become a sculptor, and a police constable Alfred Maran. In the year 1938 Elfriide Maran moved to Tallinn with her two children, there Olav Maran started a Secondary School at Tallinna 10. keskkool, where he graduated from in 1953. After that he began his studies at the Estonian Academy of Arts of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Maran studied together with Peeter Ulas, Herald Eelmaa, Heldur Laretei and Sylvia Liiberg, who later become his wife. In 1959 Maran received an MA in Graphic arts. Between the years 1959-1965 he worked as designer and caricaturist for the journal \\"Pikker\\". Pikker Nr.4 1957 His mother was sculptor Elfriide Maran, and his wife graphic artist Sylvia Liiberg. Career Maran started to participate in exhibitions in year 1959. He has mainly done paintings, and very few graphic works e.g. a ply wood cut (‚ÄûThe Street‚Äú, 1960).(3) In the beginning of his career Maran was very interested in modern art movements. He executed his first abstract paintings between 1957-59, the first surrealistic work ‚ÄûProspect‚Äú was painted in 1959. He was then inspired by Herbert Read‚Äôs book ‚ÄûModern Art‚Äú, that had been published before World War II and an article by Ilmar Laaban in the journal ‚ÄûEstonian Youth‚Äú. He received some information about western culture also through the art magazines of socialist countries. In the 1960s Maran experimented with different modern styles, wanting to introduce the experiences of modern art into Estonian art. His main medium was oil painting, but he also used gouache, tempera, pastel and collage. Being one of the leading avant-garde artist, Maran gave lectures and published articles about modern art. At that time, Maran exhibited in public exhibitions mainly with simplified-form townscapes and still life paintings. His motifs have been taken from the less representative areas, especially these from the beginning of 1960s, when he lived close to Paper Mill and painted the factory itself and the surrounding neighborhood. These ‚ÄúSevere Style‚Äù paintings express the characteristics of that time period: the gloominess and bleakness, propensity to avoid capturing the beautiful and idyllic (‚ÄúAutumn Sun‚Äù 1961, ‚ÄúWinter Townscape‚Äù 1962). From the time Olav Maran lived in Lillek√ºla, he executed ‚ÄûMoon over Roofs ‚Äú 1966, ‚ÄûOver the Fence 1970‚Äú. Maran continued painting townscapes also in the later periods of his artistic career, as an example: ‚ÄûWinter Suburb Motif ‚Äú 1981, ‚ÄûDull Winter Day‚ÄúMart Lepp, Tallinn Olav Marani loomingus - Sirp ja Vasar, 4.02.1987 In his portraits, artist concentrates mainly on form and colour, not as much on the psychology of man. In 1968, Olav Maran experienced a religious turn, that changed his understanding of the world and artistic values. From that period he has mainly depicted realistic landscapes, flowers - amaryllises, lilies, peonies and still lifes in the style of old old masters. In these paintings he shows his regard towards the nature and ordinary objects, giving them inner harmony and deeper-ethical meaning. Olav Maran‚Äôs masterful painting technique makes the objects seem real in everyday environment. In his few portraits, \\"Graphic Artist Sylvia Liiberg\\" 1981, is probably the most notable. In his ascetic nature paintings, artist is realizing his philosophical aspiration to show the great through small and complexed through ordinary. These simple compositions convey the overall notion of truth. Mari N√µmmela, M√µtteid Olav Maranist - Edasi, 14.12.1982 These simple compositions convey the overall notion of truth.

For over fifty years before the coming of local television in 1964, cinema, as in other country towns, cities and suburbs, would provide not only entertainment but tacit cultural learning in behaviour, design, fashion, and current events. All the cinema venues in Junee would also provide the facility for live entertainment and social events, such as balls and receptions, since all possessed \\"flat\\" floors. The Globe theatre in Junee was showing films by 1917, screened on Tuesday and Saturday in a small hall in Lisgar Street. By 1922, Lyceum Pictures were also showing in the larger Lyceum Hall, also in Lisgar Street The Globe appeared to disappear from the available local newspaper advertisements from 1924 while the Lyceum continued with films and live shows.JSC, 12/10/27 The Cummins' family of Junee owned the Lyceum. Ben Cummins decided to seek a partnership with some local cinema entrepreneur to build a new picture theatre. He consulted a brother-in-law, Jack Cavellas (who himself was a cinema entrepreneur and subsequently merged his assets with Hoyts Theatres). It seemed that Cavellas had misgivings about Ben Cummins forming a partnership with Nicholas Laurantus, but Cummins did, resulting in his becoming a \\"silent\\" partner in the deal. The new theatre would be under the control of Nicholas Laurantus, but with the day-to-day management by his younger brother, George. George settled in Junee as soon as he married in 1928.P.L. 2003 He assumed management of the Lyceum Theatre. The theatre was in wide use for live shows, benefits and dancers, featuring performances by artists such as Gladys Moncrieff.JSC, 28/11/29 Approval was given for erection of the new theatre on 1 May 1929. The architects, Kaberry and Chard, wrote to say the theatre was about half completed by early July. George Laurantus, from his office at the Lyceum, wrote on 5 October seeking permission to open on the 10th of that month. The local police, representing Theatres and Public Halls, were asked to make an inspection to see that the theatre complied with the Departments requirements, and if so, allow it to open that day.(telegraph T&PH;, 10/10/29) The full report by the police at Junee on 17 October gave the seating capacity as dress circle 410 and stalls 600. A licence was granted to G. Laurantus for general entertainment purposes from 10 October 1929 for 1010 persons. Notes from Les Tod indicate the builder to be J. Nyssen. Peter Laurantus related that from the opening until the birth of their first child in 1931 his father and mother did everything his father doing the sign-writing for the film attractions (on the front of the awning), booking films, despatching them and projecting them. His mother sold tickets and retained the records for the entertainment tax and film hire (particularly percentage) charges. In 1931, Blanche Heffernan, formerly Cummins became employed in the ticket office. She was the seventeen-year-old daughter of Ben Cummins (the \\"silent partner\\" in the venture), and remained working at the theatre until she married in December 1936. The theatre opened two weeks before the New York stock market crash, and the Great Depression that followed. But the taxable admission figures for 1928 were showing a decline in admissions to picture theatres before the Depression. Perhaps the novelty of silent films was wearing thin, particularly as wireless was now developing. The Laurantus' had to work hard, but fortunately, after an initial poor quality, sound films rapidly improved and even with the Depression attendances quickly rose. From Census figures for income and employment for 1933, Junee was in a considerably better position than many other towns and shires. Even so, Blanche Heffernan remembers how itinerants, looking for work, but only being allowed to stay in a town for one or two nights before being moved on, were allowed to come into the theatre and stand at the back for a while in order to warm themselves up. Farmers, who were possibly \\"doing it tougher\\" than, say, railway employees, were allowed to come in at half time and half price to see the main movie. In one of the regular police reports to T&PH; (11/2/38) on maintenance of the theatre, it was noted that movies were shown six days a week except for about seven times a year when dances or concerts were held (on single nights). In a note by George Laurantus, he says that the theatre is used for a Saturday matinee and every night.T&PH;, 8/10/38 With the Sunday Observance Act in operation at the time this would mean Monday to Saturday for showing films with perhaps a free event such as a concert by one of the church choirs on Sunday. Blanche Heffernan remembered that every church had a ball, the ambulance would present plays, Sorley's touring variety show would perform at the theatre, as too would McKays'. The locals put on The Mikado one year. As late as the 1960s, White Horse Inn was being performed for a three-night season.Junee: Speaking of the Past, Vol. 3: 144, 145 Of course during World War II, the only visual news was via the filmed newsreels, both Australian and International editions; there were also special advertising films and foyer posters to encourage patrons to buy War Bonds and War Savings Certificates; and there were the patriotic balls, concerts and competitions such as the Spitfire [fighter aircraft] Queen Competition of 1941, with its crowning ceremony at the Athenium Theatre.Junee: Speaking of the Past, Vol. 3: 192 The theatre was also used during the daytime, its flat floor in the stalls being suitable for dancing lessons. Blanche Heffernan taught ballet there two days a week until she married and moved to her husband's farm. Since its opening George Laurantus had an eye for good publicity. Advertisements in the local newspaper became large with large type so they could not be missed. He would shift his programs to suit the films available and his audience. By the start of 1935 he was having a \\"bargain night on Monday with one program, a second program on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and a third program on Friday, Saturday. Each would be a double-bill feature program with newsreel, travelogue or carton, a serial for the weekend, and of course, trailers for coming attractions. All films were transhipped by train to and from different distributors, and to and from different towns, with about 50 percent coming from and being despatched back to Sydney. This meant receiving and despatching from Junee station some fifteen or sixteen films per week. The Athenium had another link with the railway (apart from film delivery). In the Junee Southern Cross for 11 February 1935 there is an advertisement for the Junee Railway Jubilee Gala Performance for Wednesday 20th of that month. There was to be a film at 7:00pm, followed by presentation of service medals to railway employees by the Chief Commissioner of New South Wales Government Railways, then a concert and dancing until 1:00am the next morning. The last included the finals and judging of the National Dancing Competition. This six hour marathon concert illustrates how the Athenium Theatre doubled up as a town hall. Picture theatres, in those times, did not possess their own candy bar. Often there would be a small shop in the theatre building that was a milk-bar, but this could rarely cater for the crowd that rushed out at interval between the two feature films. At Junee, Allan McEwan, Dal Eisenhauer and Blanche Heffernan remember how a few early exiting patrons would get into the small milk-bar in the shop next to the theatre lobby, but the great rush was across the two roadways and the garden strip to the Allies Cafe in the Broadway Stores building to get a milkshake, cordial drink, ice cream, a bar of chocolate or packet of Minties (no popcorn or coffees). Sensibly, the same Greek proprietor ran both milk-bars, thus maximising his business. George Laurantus renewed the licence in 1938, still a manager, but in September 1940, the renewal application is by Robert Tilby Begg as owner.T&PH;, 17/2/38, 8/10/38, 19/9/40 Upon calculating from the year of birth of his daughter and her age when she left Junee, the Laurantus family would have left the town around the end of 1939.Paula Tumley, formerly Laurantus, 31/8/03 In 1941 the toilets were supposed to be connected to the recently reticulated town sewer.T&PH;, 10/10/41 In 1942 Robert Begg was castigated by Theatres and Public Halls for changing the seating plan without prior approval. He reduced the stalls to 475 and the circle to 386.T&PH;, 27/3/42; 15/5/42 Once the toilet situation was mentioned in 1941, it became a saga with the authority which wanted changes and upgrades. It was finally settled in 1947 according to a July police report on the T&PH; file. On 29 March 1950, Begg agreed to transfer the licence (No 50580 for the Athenium Theatre) to R. J. and E. E. Pollard, another husband and wife team who write to say they are the owners.T&PH;, 11/4/50 Mr and Mrs Pollard renamed the theatre the Broadway, according to the licence issued on 10 October 1950 (T&PH;). The Pollards said they were the owners on 11 April that year, but it is on 8 March 1952 that the Pollards sign under the letterhead banner of the Broadway Theatre Company. They were reporting the destruction of a spool of film by fire in the top magazine of the projector (T&PH;). The Pollards sold the theatre to Albert Thomas Manion on 28 September 1954 (T&PH;) for ¬£28,000 ($56,000) according to his daughter in law.YK-A, 2003 As with earlier owners it was a husband and wife team who operated the theatre. They were Albert Manion's son, Kevin, and his wife Yvonne, Kevin Manion selecting films and projecting, while his wife worked in the ticket box and did the accounting (although once she made a wide projection screen by joining two screens on a Singer Sewing Machine with two men supporting the large heavy material). Chairs were becoming \\"tatty\\" and inspections showed that some needed reupholstering.T&PH;, 11/1/57 On 29 December 1958 the Fire Brigade, in one of its regular reports, noticed the proscenium opening being enlarged to permit a wider screen, Theatres and Public Halls wrote back to Mr Albert Thomas Manion, as licence-holder, pointing out that work could not proceed without approval.T&PH;, 14/1/59 Earlier in 1958 the Registrar General's Land Titles Office showed a transfer to the Broadway Theatre (Junee) Pty Ltd (with a mortgage to the Commercial Bank of Australia) on 30 May.T&PH; Item file 81/0109 From a letterhead for correspondence about the theatre, dated 5 February 1959, the company directors are shown as T. A. Wah and K. C. Manion (T&PH;). Yvonne Kingsford-Archer says that this new arrangement was organised when Mr Manion senior wished to withdraw. She had reservations about Tom Wah since he seemed to lack any suitable skills for theatre operation, so she left the theatre for another business occupation, the local newsagency. Sometime in the first half of 1959 Tom Wah bought out Kevin's shares in the company. In applying for a renewal for the licence on 10 October 1960, Wah is described as managing director. (A search of computerised company records indicated that it had been wound up many years ago.) The problem of the widened proscenium was only concluded when the Junee Council's building inspector was asked to report. The reply (1/12/60) to T&PH; stated that the reinforced truss, to increase the stage opening from 27 ft 4ins to 36 ft 4ins was structurally sound. On other matters, the place seemed to deteriorate, yet local television had not yet commenced - it would in 1964. Sgt C. E. Riordan of Junee Police reported (15/12/63) \\"In my opinion, Wah is making little or no effort to complete the outstanding items\\" of repairs. It then became a saga of decline. In 1966 the Junee Municipal Council toyed with the idea of buying it, but did not.T&PH;, 17/6/66 The licensing authority became more frustrated with Thomas Wah's procrastination and his ideas that never came to fruition. On 15 July 1969, the Police reported that Wah could not make the required alterations to the theatre due to financial problems. Certainly, attendances for films had dwindled and they were only being shown a couple of times a week until a local police sergeant made his report on 21 December 1970: \\"I have to report that the Broadway Theatre, Junee, is now closed and has been so for a period of about two months. The proprietor, Mr T. A. Wah has left Junee and is now residing in the Sydney area.\\" The NSW Fire Brigades subsequently obtained advice from Miss L. Wah, sister of the previous correspondent, Mr T .A. Wah that the building \\"is now closed and no continuation of the licence is required and that the premises are up for sale\\".T&PH; file, letter dated 15/6/71 Theatres and Public Halls then cancelled the theatre's license as of 21 January 1971. The file was closed. The Junee and District Development Association (JADDA) was formed at a public meeting on 25 October 1975 to \\"promote social, recreational, cultural and commercial activities within the Junee and Illabo local government areas\\" (according to its Constitution). On 25 November 1977, JADDA bought the Athenium Theatre, with the Junee and Illabo councils jointly accepting trusteeship of the property. The purchase price of $20,000 was provided exclusively by the Association with no money put in by the councils. In an application for a licence,T&PH;, 26/5/78 note was made that the cost of building works for repairs to ceiling, floor, painting etc. was $45,000. This together with the $20,000 purchase price accords with the $60,000 claimed to have been raised from the community by Alan McEwan and Dal Eisenhauer (in their interview, 2003). Because of the trusteeship vested in the local councils, it virtually meant that the community had given some $60,000 to the councils. JADDA wrote to the Theatres and Public Halls administration on 7 December 1977 seeking the reopening of the building as a theatre. In December 1978 there was a letter suggesting that JADDA wished to screen 35mm films again.T&PH;, 1/12/78 The projection box regulatory standards had changed since the theatre was previously licensed, thus requiring enlargement for re-use. Although plans were prepared for a smoke-lock to the projection box (13/11/81), the changes and proposal to show films was dropped. However, there were subsequent issues with a secretary not replying to mail, a mass resignation by the organisation's executive, and further non-response to inquiries by Theatres and Public Halls. This promoted the authority to seek a search of the property's title by the Registrar General's Office in 1985. Because of organisational difficulties the Theatres and Public Halls authority decided (after the titles search) to correspond with Junee Council (11/3/85). As a result of the community group having faltered, the Junee Council took control of the building. A report from the Government Architect noted that, under the regulations in existence in 1985, the exits only allowed for a capacity of 350 in the dress circle and 400 in the stalls.T&PH;, 23/4/85 A photograph, attached to a report (28/5/86), shows the colour scheme of 1978 grey, blue and white. Alterations in 1986 reduced some of the decorative qualities of the interior and exterior perhaps attempting to \\"modernise\\" the building. At that time there was little knowledge of heritage (unless it was an early 19th century building), the Heritage Act for NSW only recently coming into effect. Lights and neon was stripped from the facade, dark tiles on the shop fronts were overpainted, the ticket box was removed, the timber decoration on the ceiling was either covered over or removed, the side-wall shutters were replaced by windows, and the lights on the Art Deco back plates, and dress circle balustrade vine and trellis motifs, were removed. The 1908 Theatres and Public Halls Act and the Public Halls (General) Regulation, 1977, were repealed in 1990. New legislation, the Local Government (Theatres and Public Halls) Amendment Act, 1989 came into effect. It transferred licensing inspection etc. responsibilities to councils. In 1998 the exterior was painted, and additions made to the shop that had become the kitchen. This was undertaken partly with a grant from the NSW Heritage Office, the total cost, according to the Heritage Office being $28,000. Due partly to insurance \\"problems\\" that plagued community groups and councils, following the collapse of the HIH Insurance Group, the theatre closed as a general recreation centre. In 2003, the Junee Shire Council sought to demolish the building to build a new medical centre. After public controversy, the building was given an interim heritage listing in May and saved from demolition when it was listed on the State Heritage Register in November. The building was subsequently reopened, refurbished to a modern standard, and reverted to its former name of the Athenium Theatre. In 2016, the theatre received donations of a new screen and grand piano. In 2017, members of the local community renovated the theatre's dress circle, which had been out of bounds for more than 20 years. In 2018, it received $48,800 in funding to install new lighting and sound systems. As of 2018, the building is available for hire as a community hall. ;Role of Greek immigrants in the cinema industry The Athenium Theatre represents Greek immigrant interest in operating cinemas in NSW for 50 years from The immigration of Greek nationals to NSW showed marked differences in economic sustainability for those who came before 1950 compared to those who arrived during the mass immigration period following World War II. Prior to World War II the numbers of Greek immigrants were small and followed a system of chain migration. That is, one or two members of a family arrived, worked for other Greeks, set themselves up in some form of business, then sponsored one or more members of the family or friends, to come out and work in that business. Businesses were not set up to service other Greeks but to serve the Anglo-Celtic population. These immigrants frequently went to country towns to set themselves up in a small catering type of business - food shops or cafes that prepared Australian-style meals. A number then moved into motion picture presentation in the same towns, again providing fare for the Anglo-Celtic population. Becoming managers of picture theatres also provided Greek immigrants with greater standing in town communities and allowed them to be better integrated into those communities. Greek immigrants of the 19th and early 20th centuries mainly came from islands, (particularly Kythera), coastal towns and inland villages with what is described as a peasant background, often with little, if any, formal education. Between 1911 and 1947 almost half of those who arrived in NSW settled in non-metropolitan areas. From around 1915 to the early 1960s 116 country picture theatres in NSW were at some time operated by 66 Greek immigrants in 57 towns. Thirty-four new picture theatres were built by Greek exhibitors in these towns. It is known that at least 61 of these immigrants were proprietors of their own food businesses by the time they branched into the motion picture exhibition business. The Laurantus brothers fitted this model of arrival. Nicholas went to a Greek-run country cafe. George worked in Sydney until Nicholas bought the cafe, then he went to work for his brother, who although looked after the family was domineering like a father. George arrived from the island of Kythera in 1908/9. By the 1920s Nicholas had bought the Globe (later Plaza) Theatre, Narrandera; it burnt down in 1925 and the new one opened in 1927. This would be where George developed his flair for showmanship. He taught himself violin, would perform, and generally loved show business. He married in 1928 and settled in Junee to look after Nicholas's cinema interest in that town. It was a partnership with Ben Cummins, a local businessman. The three of them leased the Montreal Theatre, Tumut, then handed its operation over to a brother-in-law of the Laurantus'. They did the same with the Gundagai Theatre. In 1935 the Rio Theatre was built by Nicholas or the two brothers in partnership (depending upon what story is related). In 1936 Nicholas built the Rex Theatre at Corowa. in 1939 he wanted to pull out of the cinema. Whereas other members of the family stayed at Gundagai and Tumut, Nicholas required George to give up Junee and look after a property he owned out of Narrandera. It would be five years before George could leave and obtain a picture theatre at Liverpool, Sydney, on his own terms. According to his son and daughter, George was quite bitter, resenting his having to leave Junee. He loved the town and the Athenium Theatre. He painted all the billboards that announced the films for the wide fascia on the awning. He enjoyed setting up promotional floats and events. For On Our Selection (made 1931) he had a Dad, Mum and Dave with horse and old fashioned plough standing on the wide nature strip in the centre of the Broadway. Huge billboards covered the sides of a truck to advertise Janet Gaynor in Delicious (booked for four nights c.1932). A float that completely covered a small truck drove around town advertising Motion Picture Art in the Musical Gem, City of Song with Betty Stockfield. It is obvious from these examples from photos in Peter Laurantus's possession, and the gusto with which benefits and gala nights were organised, that George was an asset to Junee. Where Greek immigrants had picture theatres they controlled their town's principal entertainment at a time when the overall population attended the cinema on average from 20 to 31 times a year at a time. It was also at a time when there were no registered clubs, no evening opening of hotels, no television, and virtually no professional sport. They [the Greek showmen] had direct input into the moral and social values of the communities in which they operated. They brought national and international events to the rural areas in the form of feature films, newsreels and documentaries.(Cork,1998)  Description  The Athenium Theatre possesses a wide, imposing front, similar to many theatres that used to exist in towns that were mostly larger than Junee and in the more populated suburbs of Sydney now almost all gone. Its landmark quality is observed when one enters the town from the north and glances across the railway crossing. ;The Exterior: The building is substantial, built in brick with a cement-rendered facade. There is a hung cantilevered awning with a deep fascia, below which are two shopfronts and doors to the theatre. The awning fascia and soffit appear to have been replaced in recent years. The shops have glass show-windows and tiled piers and plinths which have been over-painted. Glazed doors to the theatre are at the north-western end of the front and, if not original, appear to contain original leadlight upper panes. Above the awning are double piers (or \\"slimmed-down\\" pilasters) at each end supporting an entablature and small cornice. A little below the entablature is a row of seven windows. Two, each end, light the rear of the dress circle; the central three (the central one currently blocked out) are for the projection box. In size, they are all functional, but their composition, in relation to the whole facade was originally dependent upon the theatre sign, on a dark panel, with one lamp above, and bracketed lamps between the twin piers at each end. If the proportion of some of the windows may seem strange today, there was originally a unifying effect through the repetition of the same pane proportion and size. Each window was a multiple of the same size and shape pane in what appear to have been steel framed, modern industrial-type windows of the time (1920s). Apart from one being blocked out completely, most of the others have had large pane replacements, quite unsympathetic to the original. The pane proportion on the original was important for it is close to those in Georgian buildings in NSW, such as Macquarie Fields', or Glenfield houses. But unlike the windows in these early 19th century houses the repetition of panes is different. The Georgian examples are three across and four up, whereas those larger of the seven windows at the Athenaeum Theatre have four across, to suit the casement of steel framed windows, and four up. The multi-pane windows should be reinstated to suit the classical style of the building. Apart from the spherical opalescent ball lamps bracketed out from the facade wall, there were originally three more, supported on metal decorative standards, about one metre tall off the top of the parapet wall.These are visible in photos of the Broadway , and Only one existed on the parapet in a 1954 photograph. In addition, the parapet was outlined in neon tubing, as too was the sign-panel, together with vertical decorative neon on each of the four piers. Around the outer edges of the underside of the awning was a continuous white-way strip of neon (according to Mrs Kingsford-Archer, formerly Manion, who operated the theatre from 1954‚Äì59). The sides of the building did not originally possess windows but, instead, had vertically sliding timber framed and sheeted panels (or shutters). The position of the runners can be seen on the brickwork. The panels would be slid down partially or wholly at night for ventilation, the total opening being the size of the current glazed area. The panels were also divided into timber \\"panes\\" of Georgian proportion. The present aluminium- framed windows appear serendipitous, without much consideration for the original design. Over the 74-year history of the building the toilets, at the rear, have \\"progressed\\" from unsewered outhouses to sewered brick additions with access from within the building. ;Architectural style of the exterior: The facade of the theatre is what might be termed \\"slimmed-down classical\\". Before Art Deco style hit Australia this earlier design expresses that transition between Classical and lack-of-decoration Functional. It was obviously not influenced by theatre architecture of USA which was overlaid with decoration and, by 1930, was just beginning to change Classical, Renaissance, Mayan, Spanish, Tudor, Moorish and Chinese decor to Art Deco without a pause for the Modern Movement that emanated from Europe. It would be 1932 when USA recognised the Modern Movement that they termed the \\"International Style.\\"Hitchcock and Johnson, 1932/1966 Even in Britain only a few picture theatres were being designed with more simplicity in 1929. There was the Pavilion at Shepherds Bush, London, in 1923 it winning an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) with large expanses of plain brick walling beneath its classical cornice. The Odeon at Kensington, London, (1926) showed a design style moving away from classical, but still with a cornice and entablatureAtwell, 1980:54,58 As many Australian architects belonged to the RIBA or subscribed to English architectural journals, Kaberry (originally an Englishman) and Chard may well have pored over these \\"less pure\\" and somewhat simplified classical designs. Depending upon the journals seen at the time it may have been that the architects were more influenced by Swedish design which went from classical adornment to minimalist classical, almost unadorned buildings, from 1925 to 1930.Furberg, 2000: 237,150,165 Certainly such simplicity preceded the arrival of the Modern Movement Expressionist designs of Eric Mendelsohn the most influential being the Universum Cinema, Berlin, of 1928 that so influenced Guy Crick and Bruce Furse in their Kings Theatres designs from 1935 (Thorne & Cork, 1994: introduction). ;The Interior: The front lobby is small with the principal stair to the dress circle to the right, against the sidewall. The original ticket box, (of glass front and sides above a small \\"counter\\", about 900mm cross, 1300mm deep and a shade over two metres high) was freestanding in the space.YKA, 2003 It was removed in 1978. There is, at present a \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" ticket window in the wall of the stairway. Plain wide double doors provide access to the stalls level of the auditorium. The stalls floor is timber, flat for dancing and indoor sports activities (from 1978). The portion of the dress circle cantilevered over the back stalls is supported by a deep, plated rolled steel joist (T&PH; files), spanning some 12 metres or further if the walls to the two rooms each side of the back stalls are not structural. The architects have used an unusual method of \\"hiding\\" the beam by curving the ceiling down from the rear stalls wall to the soffit of the beam, then curving up again to the edge of the circle. The plan shape of the dress circle is typical of the work of the architects, Kaberry and Chard. In the early 1920s, their circle balustrade designs (with their straight central portions curved around each side to side boxes) were in plaster with swags of classical ornament and cartouches. From about 1927 they simplified the design to unadorned flat panelling (as at the Magnet Theatre, Lakemba demolished; Montreal, Tumut). The panels here at Junee have been decorated by persons other than the architects. The side boxes designed by the architects in their theatres finished or abutted theatrically false splayed walls in some classically-based design, as is here these comprising only one of two examples that still exist (the other being the Roxy, Leeton). The original proscenium was a \\"picture frame\\", using diagonal strapwork as the decorative motif. In 1959 this was removed, together with the required amount of wall, to widen the opening by close on 3 metres for Cinemascope presentations. At the same time the height of the opening was lowered. This was constructed in lightweight materials. Some form of applied panelling would alleviate the \\"plain-ness\\" and better fit in with the general theme of the interior. The walls are rough-cast plaster with classical \\"egg and dart\\" on an ovolo cornice moulding. The inside of the wall shutters are marked out in battens with a typical geometric pattern, as used since Roman times. It is the same as on the upper panes of the street doors a cross, over which are diagonals. (They are seen on grillework as painted on walls depicting theatres in Rome and Pompeii, and used by Richard C Beacham in his replicas of early Roman stages at Warwick University). In the introduction of the Movie Theatre Heritage Register for New South Wales, 1896 1996 five stages of building development for cinema design are described. In the teens and early twenties of the 20th century in NSW, most suburban and country cinemas had the rooftruss structure fully visible with either no ceiling or one immediately beneath the roofing material. This was the case for the early version of the Enmore Theatre, the Australian cinema at Spit Junction (demolished), and Odeon, Randwick (demolished). This was referred to as Stage Three development. Stage Four development occurred from the late teens, up until the Great Depression. It was when some theatrical decoration was being added. The Movie Theatre Heritage Register particularly mentions the architects, Kaberry and Chard as key people in this development. They brought the ceiling down to be at the level of the lower chord of the truss, but still expressing that chord as a \\"beam\\". It was, however, almost universal not to take the lower chord to the springing point off the walls but connect it some three or four metres along the upper chord of the truss. This provided the necessary height for projection from the rear dress circle over the audience, and for an imposing proscenium. As a result, there is a sloping segment of the ceiling each side of the central flat section. It also meant that side walls could be lower than if a complete flat ceiling was designed, and of course, it was more economical, something of which Kaberry and Chard were well aware of (see K&C;, 1936). This technique, however, produced the risk of the extension of the upper chord beyond the lower chord (of the truss) deflecting and pushing the side walls out. To prevent this, these and other architects installed tension rods from the springing point up, on a more shallow rake, to be fixed some distance along the lower chord of the truss. These rods were exposed as at the Athenium Theatre. It was only after the Great Depression when a new style of decorative architecture later known as Art Deco took hold, that the whole truss, including the tension or tie rods, were covered beneath by generally, plaster ceilings. (The sloping side segments including the tie rods were now hidden by stepped plasterwork). The other rather clever solution to the economic confines, presented by suburban and country cinema designs, was to visually express the subsidiary beams that tied the trusses together, and the system of panelling required for the lining material. This was done at the Athenaeum with all the structural and panel-framing picked out in a dark tone so the whole became a decorative geometric pattern. The horizontal section of the ceiling was divided into three segments across the width of the building. In the opposite direction the five roof trusses formed four segments, thus 12 panels were formed. In each there were nine smaller panels a large central panel of lattice-work surrounded by four small square corner panels and four elongated rectilinear side panels. Wooden lattice-work had been used for centuries in middle-eastern (Arab) countries, but appeared as a form of decoration in England in 16th century windows and in 18th and 19th century furniture. It was used in ceilings of picture theatres as a means of allowing stale hot air to escape into the roof space and through roof ventilators. Unfortunately this decorative ceiling was compromised in, it is assumed, 1978, when a plain ceiling lining either covered it or replaced it. The remaining elements of the interior are the stage, dress circle and conversion of the two shops as annexes to the auditorium. The stage is relatively small to avoid the stringent rules for fire control, yet provide enough space for live performance. The widening of the opening in 1959 permitted a screen size larger than that in many suburban, country and even capital city theatres. The dress circle with access from the lobby on one side, possesses an emergency exit stair on the other, also against the side wall. Whereas the stalls only ever had removable seating in banks (to clear away for social functions), the circle has upholstered fixed seating with wooden arm rests as was typical for the 1930s. The capacity for this portion of the auditorium commenced at some 400 but has been reduced to somewhere between 200 and 300. The seats need re-upholstering and repair. The projection box was minimum in size when constructed, and would need to be extended sideways to provide adequate facilities for projection and lighting control for live shows. The two shops at the side of the theatre entry have been converted into a store for chairs, mainly, and a kitchen / refreshment bar that opens into the back stalls area. The latter work and some external painting was completed in 1998 at a cost of $28,000, some of which funds was from the NSW Heritage Office. Decoration: The architects had, at the time of construction of the theatre, great integrity in the use of classical style and its ornamentation. They were also being slightly influenced by Functionalism, but only slightly. What has been confusing to observers of the interior are two elements of Art Deco style, and embellishments to the panels on the balustrade-front of the dress circle, and on the false side-of-stage walls. It is contended that the Art Deco dado moulding and centre-piece of side false- wall panels (and as a ceiling rose in the lobby) were added after construction. Art Deco decoration did not become apparent in theatres in Australia until after the Great Depression (i.e. from 1933 onwards) yet this theatre was designed in late 1928 to early 1929, being completed in October that year. The corner and central motifs of the dress circle panels are of an impression of trellis-work over which is a spray of vine leaves. The central motif had an inverted shell-like light fitting affixed, as seen in 1954 photographs. These photographs depict a sheen in these panels that appears metallic. Blanche Heffernan (formerly Cummins), related that the decoration was \\"all gold\\".B.H. 2003 Peter Laurantus (in 2003) mentioned that his father, George, and mother worked hard together without employees to get the theatre up and running during the Depression (it commencing in New York only two weeks after opening the theatre). Although the Depression may have had an effect on attendance, Entertainment Tax receipts showed a decline in audiences across Australia towards the end of the 1920s. Perhaps the enthusiasm for silent films was waning. However, despite the Depression, receipts began to grow soon after sound films were introduced (1929 30, depending upon the theatre). By 1934 new cinemas were being built to cater for the growing trade. In 1935 George Laurantus and his elder brother, Nicholas, had obviously accumulated profits from their theatres, and wanted to be in this expansion, so built the Rio Theatre at Lockhart. It possessed stock Art Deco ornamentation, one of which is identical to that at the Junee theatre. Another, a strip as diaper decoration, is similar to the second Art Deco ornament at Junee the dado line. The Lockhart theatre had other painted decoration and rough-cast plaster in free swirls that appeared to be very Mediterranean, most possibly Greek in character. (The Laurantus brothers were born on the island of Kythera and came to Australia as immigrants). The trellis and vine motifs may represent basket willow (or similar) trellises upon which grape vines were trained in the 19th and early 20th centuries in Greece. According to the Australian Greek architect, Chris Tsioulos, the vine (and these appear to be akin to Shiraz grape vine leaves) is a traditional feature of Greek life and decoration. Certainly Charles Pickett, architecture curator at the Powerhouse Museum has not so far been able to identify the motif from the Wunderlich pressed metal catalogues. When Albert Thomas Manion purchased the theatre from Mr and Mrs P ollard in 1954 for his son, the then Mrs ManionY.K-A, 2003 asked about this unusual decoration and was told that it was put there by \\"the Greeks\\", meaning George Laurantus, or he and his older brother Nicholas. (From conversations with George's children it was Nicholas who called the shots until after World War II when George bought into a theatre on his own). It is contended that the dado decoration (possibly replacing a timber dado moulding similar to that at the Montreal Theatre, Tumut), the second Art Deco motif (used as a centre- piece backing plate for lamps on the false splayed walls), the vine-leaf elements and the rough plasterwork above the dado moulding, and as backing for the vine-leaf elements, were all added around 1935. The less-rough plaster below the dado moulding is similar to that at the Tumut theatre, the material above is quite different. Judging by its covering some of the edge of the egg- and-dart cornice moulding it would appear to have been added after that moulding had been affixed (i.e. in 1929). Peter Laurantus has told me that his father loved managing the Junee theatre. Perhaps, when attendances picked up, with the establishments of sound films, and funds became available, he wanted to put his \\"Greek stamp\\" on the theatre. In the late thirties he wanted to remain at the theatre but the elder brother, to put it in his son's word, forced George to leave and work on Nicholas' property outside of Narrandera. The name of the theatre, albeit a corrupted spelling, also has Greek connotations being the temple of the goddess Athene, which was used for teaching. Within the original proscenium hung deep blue curtains with a large applique of overlapped letters, A and T in a highly decorative form on each of the two drapes. They also had a wide gold band a little up from the hemline. From an early photograph, a valance appears to have three crossed-hammer motifs on it. The arches in the false splayed walls had full length dark blue repp fabric curtains with bottom gold fringe and draped gold cords and tassels near the top. The present curtains are blue for the stage and nothing in the archways. The former heritage adviser for Junee Shire Council, David Scobie, believes the present colouring of the false splayed walls and dress circle front was done at the time of the making of the film The Crossing (1990). A photo on the Theatres and Public Halls administration files, taken after it had become the JADDA Centre, shows a colour scheme of grey, white and blue (the dado moulding being blue). In The Crossing, for the dancing competition scene, the dado moulding is bright red and the walls white to off-white. The dress circle front is not shown in the film but its current finish certainly appears to have been done by a scenic artist to provide an \\"antique\\" metallic impression. The dado moulding has returned to being blue (with earlier gold showing through) but the lower portions of the walls are cream. The ceiling and upper walls appear to be as when painted (for the JADDA). The integrity of the item has only been compromised by superficial alterations (such as change of windows and removal of light fixtures on the facade;; replacing side wooden shutters with windows; changing the original proscenium for a wider \\"plain\\" stage opening; and relining the ceiling). The principal parts of the building are intact, thus retaining its original theatrical aura.  Heritage listing  Due to its now rarity, as a building-type, the Athenium Theatre symbolises, for the State, an association with past events, persons and groups who contributed or participated in an important and cultural phenomenon of the 20th century, namely \\"movie going\\". Due to its rarity it symbolises the use of a cinema building as the social centre of a town with its being surrogate town hall. This and the role of the community (JADDA) organisation from 1976/7 accord the building the status of social significance for the State. The building is highly representative as a good example of the design-work of theatre architects, Kaberry and Chard it being one of only three remaining relatively intact out of a large body of work across the State. The building has as association with Greek immigrant business and benefactor, Sir Nicholas Laurantus, and through its rarity, symbolises his interests in cinema operation in the Riverina region. It also is one of the few remaining buildings in NSW that has a direct connection with Gladys Moncrief OBE, and the country touring that she and lesser Australian stage artists did in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. Of the 116 movie theatres operated by Greek immigrants in NSW, this one unusually possesses added decoration (presumably by George Laurantus, brother of Nicholas) in the form of a trellis and vine leaf motif. It provides a \\"Greek overlay\\" to portion of the auditorium. This exhibits significance in aesthetic terms in relation to the importance of the Greek contribution to developing cinema operation in NSW Athenium Theatre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 January 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is important in the course or pattern of NSW's cultural history because, like the very few remaining picture theatres of its era it is of historic, social and cultural significance due to \\"its association with past events, persons and groups who contributed or participated in an important social and cultural phenomenon of the 20th century, namely \\"movie going\\". The importance of such historical phase or phenomenon may be gauged. . .by its physical manifestations, including the number of theatre buildings then existing [from 1910 to 1960], the amount of employment created, the fact that \\"picture going\\" was second only to sport as a leisure time activity, ands by its impact on popular taste of the time where concerned with fashion, design generally, language, music and behaviour\\".Simpson, 1986:109 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building has an association with Sir Nicholas Laurantus, Greek immigrant, businessperson and philanthropist, for this and other cinemas in the Riverina Region of NSW. The theatre generally exhibits the early 20th century efforts of Greek immigrants (with George Laurantus) to integrate into and supply entertainment facilities for the Anglo-Celtic population. The building has an association with Gladys Moncrief, OBE, who was the most famous soprano in Australia since the retirement of Florence Austral, for the period of the 1930s to the end of the 1940s. The building symbolises those lost country theatres, in NSW, in which Moncrief appeared in major Sydney-produced productions on tour. At a local level it has an association with the present Heffernan family through the grandfather (Ben Cummins) and great-grandfather of Senator Heffernan, for their involvement in cinema at both the Lyceum and Athenium Theatres. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The theatre building stands out and is recognisable as a theatre. This visually important element used to be a feature of many towns but the list of picture theatres in NSW towns at 1951 demonstrates that it is now rare. That is, it possesses landmark quality. The layering of the vine and trellis decoration uniquely exhibits the influence of the management of a Greek immigrant, providing a flavour of the \\"peasant\\" population of the island of Kythera that existed at the turn of the 19th into the 20th century. In 1929, the architects were developing towards a Functional architecture, away from the revivalist styles of the twenties and former decades. It was in the mould of that development in Sweden, but whereas Sweden continued on the road to Modernism, Australia, like USA, temporarily deviated into the style that would later be known as \\"Art Deco\\". It demonstrated what was a forward thinking process by these architects. The use of structure and construction, through simple carpentry, to provide a decorative ceiling (not now visible) also fits this assessment of Functionalism used by Kaberry and Chard. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. From entertainment tax receipts, cinema attendance was greater than all other paid-for activities - sport, racing, concerts, dancing, live theatre etc., combined. The Athenium Theatre (now Jadda Centre) possesses social significance for Junee being one of the very few, and first towns in NSW where the population came together as early as 1976/7, to buy the town's theatre for community use. Total funds were raised for purchase and rehabilitation (at that time) from the local population, through the organised community group, the Junee and District Development Association which generously vested ownership in the Local council(s). The building provides great social significance in an historical sense to the town. Commissioner Simpson, in his Inquiry into the Regent Theatre, Sydney (1986) reported: \\"It is of historic, social and cultural significance because of its association with past events, persons and groups who contributed or participated in an important social and cultural phenomenon of the 20th century, namely \\"movie going\\". It also has social significance for its other role as virtual town hall - the social centre of the town. Collectively in Junee, the pubs (and former hotels), the three quarter century old shops and the Broadway Stores, the theatre, the railway station, the banks, the post office, the engine roundhouse, the former printery, the mansion on the hill (Monte Christo), the former flour mill, all provide a social history of a town that is unique in New South Wales. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. For this assessment a table of all country theatres in NSW was revised to omit areas now incorporated into Sydney or Newcastle where comparison of Census data becomes impossible. The year 1951 was taken as being a high attendance time before television, and without new post-War World II theatres being built or old ones being closed down. There were 351 cinema venues in 289 towns in NSW (excluding Sydney and Newcastle). A column was added to the list showing present 2003 status. Less than 10 per cent \\"exist\\" as spaces recognisable as original theatres (that is, only 31). Only 11 of those exist with some form of obviously decorative interior and theatrical exterior. The Junee theatre is one of those eleven or one of only 3.1 per cent of the body of country cinemas that existed in 1951, comprising picture theatres built in the heyday of the silent and sound movies. Of the 57 theatre commissions identified for the work of the major theatre architectural firm of Kabbery and Chard in NSW, only three remain without being demolished, or considerably adapted. Those three are in Junee, Tumut and Leeton. Junee and Leeton possess the side-of-stage splayed false decorative walls, used as a feature by these architects. Only Tumut has an original proscenium. All three should be listed. The picture theatre/social centre for the town is a rare example that \\"provides evidence of a [virtually] defunct custom, way of life\\".Assessing Heritage Significance, p.22 The Junee theatre is rare across the total number of towns in NSW (excluding Sydney and Newcastle). It provides accurate evidence of a significant human activity. Combined. It shows evidence of a rare significant human activity important to a community. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. With its wide frontage and substantial, imposing, but modest facade, the Junee theatre is a superior building to most constructed at the time in towns of up to four thousand people, and which, in 2003, have either been altered for other uses or demolished. In relation to the large body of theatre work of the architects, Kaberry and Chard, it is very typical, or in other words, an excellent example - as good as these architects designed for larger towns. The integrity of the item has only been compromised by superficial alterations (such as change of windows and removal of light fixtures on the facade;; replacing side wooden shutters with windows; changing the original proscenium for a wider \\"plain\\" stage opening; and relining the ceiling). The principal parts of the building are intact, thus retaining its original theatrical aura. Conclusions on Heritage Significance The Jadda Centre building is likely to be of State significance. It meets six criteria for listing on the SHR.

He was killed by an unidentified shooter who was never apprehended or publicly named, though authorities have said at least three people were involved in the assassination. Halili was the second Tanauan mayor assassinated, the first being Cesar Platon, who was assassinated in April 2001 by the communist militia New People's Army while campaigning against Hermilando Mandanas. Background The victim of the assassination, Antonio Halili was the mayor of Tanauan, a city in the northeast of Batangas province. In 2016, he garnered wide public attention for his \\"Walk of Shame\\" campaign which involved publicly parading drug suspects, who were made to wear cardboard signs that read \\"I'm a pusher, don't emulate me.\\" The act raised concerns from human rights officials. Halili publicly supported President Rodrigo Duterte's national campaign against illegal drugs, but believed that drug kingpins should be the main target of the police operations. Allegedly, Halili himself was involved in the illegal drug trade according to police. The politician strongly denied the claim, and said that he would resign and have himself publicly paraded as a drug suspect if the police was able to come up substantial evidence for the claim. The Mayor was stripped of supervisory powers over the local police in October 2017 due to the proliferation of illegal drugs in his city. Assassination The assassination of Tanauan Mayor Antonio Halili took place on July 2, 2018 at the Tanauan City Hall. Halili was attending a flag raising ceremony together with around 300 government employees and newly elected barangay officials before he was killed. Then-Tanauan Vice Mayor Jhoanna Villamor was standing beside Halili at that time. The killing took place during the singing of the national anthem. A single gunshot was heard disrupting the flag raising ceremony. The incident was inadvertently recorded on the video in different angles. The bullet pierced into Halili's left chest. Halili was rushed to the CP Reyes Hospital, but was declared dead at 8:45 a.m., less than an hour after he was shot. Investigation PNP PRO4-A Acting Regional Director Police Chief Edward Carranza announced in a press conference on July 9, 2018 at Camp Crame in Quezon City, that personal security personnel, and the police, were responsible for the close-in security of Halili when he was shot during the flag raising ceremony at the Tanauan City Hall. Philippine National Police Chief Oscar Albayalde ordered the creation of a special investigation task group with Calabarzon regional director Edward Carranza acting on the order. =Suspects= The police has identified two \\"persons of interest\\" who are suspected of playing a role in Halili's killing. A third suspect was also in the process of identification. All of these people are said to be involved in the illegal drug trade. The gunman who killed Halili is suspected to be working with accomplices. On August 22, CCTV footages were revealed showing a white car owned by a suspected gunman parks near the gasoline station ‚Äì about 1 kilometer away from the incident ‚Äì dated July 2. A man emerges from the car wearing a black T-shirt and green cap, and, not less than ten minutes later, returns to the car and drives away. Another showing the car driving back-and- forth at the memorial park near the City Hall where the incident took place. Soon after the incident, another CCTV showed the same car driving the expressway; it was revealed that the plate number of the car was changed, suspected that it is the getaway vehicle, and, according to the police, the plate number seen in the gas station was actually not issued by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). The man is yet to be identified by the police. =Possible motive= The police is considering the motive of the assassination to be related to the illegal drug trade, due to the identities of their designated \\"persons of interest\\" although they are not ruling out political motives for the killing. According to Philippine National Police Chief Oscar Albayalde, the police are also looking into a land dispute and a feud with a former high-ranking general in relation to the motive of the crime. =Circumstances of the killing= The police held a reenactment of the crime on July 5, 2018. A spent shell of a bullet was found by the police on an empty lot where the unidentified gunman positioned himself for the hit. The police has not ascertained that the bullet came from the gunman's weapon. The weapon is concluded not to be a sniper, since the gunman decided to hit Halili in the chest and was viewed as not \\"confident\\" enough to aim for the mayor's head. It was initially reported that the distance between the gunman and Halili was but was later established by the police to be just . The gunman was also concluded to have positioned himself on a higher elevation than the ground the mayor was standing.  Aftermath  On April 3, 2019, at least 19 armed men disguised as police abducted two of Halili's aides, Allan Fajardo and Ricky Atienza, at the hotel in Santa Rosa, Laguna. The authorities said that they did not conduct any operation against Fajardo, who is a top aide of Halili. The suspects escaped using a white van with no license plate.

The perpetrator, Mateus da Costa Meira, then a 24-year-old medical student, killed three people that were in the room and injured another four.Veja cronologia do caso que envolve o \\"atirador do shopping\\" Folha de S. Paulo Meira was initially sentenced to a 120-year imprisonment, a term that was later reduced to 48 years. After he attempted to kill another prison inmate, it was determined in 2011 that he had to be moved to a psychiatric hospital, where he remains to this day. He is known in Brazil as the \\"shopping mall shooter\\" or the \\"cinema shooter\\". The screen in which the shooting occurred was permanently closed. The cinema closed its three remaining screens in 2012, freeing up space for new stores at the mall. Perpetrator's background In November 1999, Mateus da Costa Meira (born April 4, 1975) lived alone in an apartment in S√£o Paulo and studied medicine at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of S√£o Paulo's Holy House (FCMSCSP), a well-regarded institution; he was in his sixth and last year, only 15 days from graduating. His wealthy family (including his father, a doctor) lived in Salvador, his hometown, and Mateus regularly received money from his parents in order to live a comfortable life. He played \\"violent\\" video games (particularly Duke Nukem 3D) and owned a vast collection of illegally-copied software. He was known to send viruses and pornography to users of internet provider Magiclink in Salvador since January 1997. He was described as shy, introverted and apathetic and had a poor academic performance. He has schizoid personality disorder. After refusing to do mandatory work at the medical school, he was sent to the institution's psychology division. By other sources, however, he was described as a gentile, calm person who changed his personality months before the attack and started to skip classes and get closer to drug traffickers. Prior to the massacre, he already owned a pistol, but chose to obtain a more powerful weapon: a MAC-11 submachine gun, which he acquired illegally from Marcos Paulo Almeida dos Santos for R$ 5,000. Meira said he employed Santos as a driver since he did not know how to drive the mechanic car his insurance company gave him following a crash that destroyed his automatic Chrysler Neon. The police investigated him for two additional crimes: drug possession and CD falsification. In his apartment, they found equipment for CD piracy, cocaine, crack and ammo. Meira told the police that he had been planning the attack for seven years and that he chose Fight Club because the main character suffers from schizophrenia. The crime Meira entered room number 5 of the movie theater at Morumbi Shopping at around 10:10 p.m. of November 3, 1999, approximately 55 minutes after the movie, Fight Club, had started. He watched the movie for 15 minutes and then went to the toilet, where he shot the mirror with his submachine gun. Back in the theater room, he stayed in front of the screen and shot to the ceiling, but that did not scare viewers since they believed it was an effect from the movie. He then shot against one of the walls, causing frightened viewers to hide behind seats. He subsequently aimed and shot at a group of people, three of which died. As he tried to reload the gun, one of the viewers stopped him. The shooting lasted about 3 minutes. Casualties One victim died at the scene and two more in local hospitals. * Herm√® Luisa Jatob√° Vadasz, 46 years old, employee at Young & Rubican publicity agency.

Later, in 2009, he was moved to a penitentiary in Salvador, his home town, following requests by his family. On May 8, 2009, Meira tried to kill a cell mate, the 68-year-old Spaniard Francisco Vidal Lopes, with scissors, apparently because the television's volume was too loud.\\"Atirador do shopping\\" tenta matar colega de cela em Salvador (BA), diz secretaria Folha de S.Paulo He was put into trial but absolved later in 2011 since he was not considered imputable anymore due to his mental diagnosis.

The organization is therefore concerned with privacy. The duties of the AP derive from the Data Protection Directive that applies to all countries of the EU. This directive has been replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation. The Implementation Act General Data Protection Regulation has replaced the Personal Data Protection Act and appointed the AP as supervisor. All EU Member States have their own body, similar to the AP. Legal task The Authority for Personal Data has the statutory duty to assess whether persons and organizations comply with the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act including government organisations. The AP also supervises compliance with the Police Data Act, the Municipal Personal Records Database Act and all other statutory regulations concerning the processing of personal data. Name changes The organization was called the College bescherming persoonsgegevens (CBP) until 2016. The CBP followed the Registratiekamer in 2001. With the change of name as per 1 January 2016, the body was granted the power to impose fines for violations of the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp). These changes were a result of drastic changes to that law.CBP krijgt boetebevoegdheid en wordt Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl, 28 december 2015 In fact, the name change of 2016 only applies to 'in society', according to article 51 of the Wbp. That article still gives 'College bescherming persoonsgegevens' as a formal name.Artikel 51 Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens, wetten.overheid.nl. Geraadpleegd op 14 januari 2016 Supervision of compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act The Personal Data Protection Act means that an organization may only process personal data that is demonstrably necessary for the organization and for which no explicit prohibition exists. Examples of this are medical, sexual, political data and data about membership of a trade union. For governments, the term 'demonstrably necessary' means that there must be a legal basis for the processing of data The supervisory functions mean that the Dutch Data Protection Authority can compel companies and governments to comply with the requirements of the Wbp. The AP can impose periodic penalty payments for this. Furthermore, the AP has a public register of data processing if it deviates from the usual processing. The AP can impose an administrative fine for not registering non-exempt processing. In all cases are supervised by court which makes the final decision. In addition, the AP has the task of advising ministers and the House of Representatives, both solicited and unsolicited, on legislative proposals, in the light of the Wbp or other applicable rules. The obligation to report data leaks by data controllers and processors to the Dutch Data Protection Authority is regulated by the inclusion of additional provisions in the WBP per 1/1/2016. Members The first members of the Data Protection Board were Peter Hustinx (chairman), Ulco van de Pol and Jan Willem Broekema (both vice-chairman). Hustinx and Van de Pol came from the Registratiekamer at the establishment of the Dutch DPA. Broekema came from the business sector. Hustinx later became the privacy supervisor for the European Union . At the end of 2004, Jacob Kohnstamm, former politician, became chairman of the Dutch DPA. The chairman is appointed by royal decree for a period of six years, the two members for four years. On 1 August 2016, Kohnstam was succeeded by Aleid Wolfsen.

It leads from Landsberger Stra√üe in the north to Ridlerstra√üe in the south and is located in the district of Schwanthalerh√∂he. The formerly referred to as Sendlinger way road, was named in 1883 after the lawyer, historian and archivist Michael Adam von Bergmann (1733-1783), who was city chief judge starting in 1762 and then became mayor in Munich.  Location  The Bergmannstra√üe is located in the district Schwanthalerh√∂he and in the district of Westend, a classic working-class district with cooperative buildings from the period around 1900. The district is, with about 30,000 inhabitants in an area of just over two square kilometers, one of the most densely populated districts in Munich. The proportion of foreigners is 34.5% (as of 2015), one of the highest in the city. The rental prices here in comparison with the other municipalities of Munich are at a medium level. The Bergmannstra√üe is centrally located in the district and runs in a north-south direction for a length of almost 900 meters. The western parallel road is the Trappentreustra√üe, part of the Bundesstra√üe 2 R, but mostly runs underground through the Trappentreutunnel. North of the Bergmannstra√üe runs the multiple track railway lines from about 1.5 kilometers east of the M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof (main train station), south of the Bergmannstra√üe the branching tracks of the Munich South Ring run towards the Munich East station and from there, on towards Rosenheim and Salzburg. The Theresienwiese, where the annual Munich Oktoberfest takes place, is located about 800 meters east of the Bergmannstra√üe.  Road direction  Bergmannstra√üe branches off to the south of Landsberger Stra√üe, a major arterial road that runs parallel to the Munich- Augsburg railway line, connecting the city center with the western districts and continuing in the direction of Landsberg am Lech. The northern part of the Bergmannstra√üe is dominated mostly by simple four-storey to five-storey rental units and individual small businesses. In the middle part of the street, on the western side, lies the Gollierplatz, a green area of about 10,000 square meters. On the east side of the street is a historically listed multi-storey residential complex from the early 1920s. South of it stands the Ledigenheim (asylum for unmarried people), which was built as a Rohziegelbau (brick building) in the new objectivity style under the direction of the architect Theodor Fischer, originating from Lower Franconia, in the years 1925-1927. On the west side of the road, just south of Gollierplatz, is the building of the elementary school (now a primary school) from 1889 to 1891, built in Neo- Renaissance style. A little further south is a three-winged complex arranged around a forecourt, built in factual forms with slightly expressionistic impact in the years 1928 to 1931 and also called Green Block due to the light green color. Further south, on the east side of the street, there is a post office from the years 1926 to 1928 in the new objectivity style. At the southern end of the Bergmannstra√üe, on the west side, are several rental units from the years 1898 to 1909, built in the Neo-Baroque style or in Art Nouveau style. The Bergmannstra√üe connects at its southern end, to the Ridlerstra√üe which runs parallel to the railway line of the S√ºdring, which leads from the main station to Ostbahnhof.  History  As long as Neuhausen was not a parish of its own, the Sendlinger Weg was also the Kirchweg, since baptisms, weddings and festive church services took place in the Sendlinger parish church of St. Margaret. It was not until 1871 that the Winthirkirche became a vicarage church and finally in 1882 a parish church. The paved dirt road ran like today's Donnersbergerstra√üe, leading slightly to the east at the height of the present Richelstra√üe, crossing the railway tracks at the height of the Maillingerstra√üe and then leading on to the later Bergmannstra√üe to the old Sendlinger church. With the extension of today's Maillingerstra√üe, the Bergmannstra√üe was also extended to the Burgfriendensgrenze (border of the castle precincts) from 1846 to 1852. Since today's Bergmannstra√üe was on the municipal boundary of Neuhausen and Sendling, there was still paving duties charged in 1865, for example, when a wedding party wanted to cross the border. In 1877, the Sendling community was incorporated, as a result, the dirt road came into the Munich city planning sovereignty. After the renaming of Haderer Weg in Westendstra√üe in coordination with the incorporation of the town, the designation of Bergmannstra√üe followed in 1883.

Biography He was born in Buberki to an undistinguished family and studied in Zamosz, where he also taught at a yeshiva. At the same time he occupied himself with the study of secular sciences, particularly with mathematics, and while there wrote many notes on the Yesod Olam of Isaac Israeli ben Joseph and on the Elim of Joseph Delmedigo. During his residence at Zamosz he also wrote his Arubbot ha- Shamayim, a work on descriptive geometry and astronomy. Zamosz first gained fame with the publication of his Ne·∫ìa·∏• Yisrael in 1741, which took the form of a traditional text discussing topics addressed in the Talmud, but innovated by interpreting numerous passages from a mathematical and astronomical viewpoint. About 1742, after he had published his Ne·∫ìa·∏• Yisrael, Zamosz settled in Berlin, where he remained several years, living in poverty. There he instructed Aaron Solomon Gumperz and Moses Mendelssohn in mathematics and logic, and his scholarship was much appreciated by Lessing. Work Zamosz was a versatile writer, his knowledge comprising rabbinics, religious philosophy, and secular sciences. The only works of his published during his lifetime were the Ne·∫ìa·∏• Yisrael (1741) and his edition of the Rua·∏• ·∏§en of Ibn Tibbon or Jacob Anatoli, to which he appended a commentary of his own (1744).

Moores Memorial Natatorium', also known as the Moores Park Pool, is a natatorium located at 2700 Moores River Drive in Lansing, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The pool at Moores Park was the prototype of what became known as the \\"Bintz Pool,\\" an oval structure located entirely above ground, which was particularly suited to urban areas. History J. Henry Moores arrived in Lansing in 1865, and through various business interests became one of the wealthiest men in the city. He spent much of his money establishing a public park system in Lansing. One of those parks was Moores Park, which he donated to the city in 1908. In the early 1920s, Wesley Bintz came to work in the city engineer's office, only a few years after receiving his degree from the University of Michigan in 1918. In 1922 he became the City Engineer, and in that capacity he designed this natatorium, which was constructed in 1923. Bintz resigned later that year, and began a career devoted to designing swimming pools. The natatorium has been open every season, save when it was renovated in 1980. It may be the oldest continually operated municipal pool in the United States. Description The Natatorium is an ellipsoidal, above-ground structure constructed of reinforced concrete with a rubble-stone facade. The entrance is on one end through two pairs of metal doors, flanked by plaques which read \\"DESIGN SUPERVISED BY W. BINTZ, CITY ENGINEER, SWIMMING POOL DESIGNS, 1922\\" on one side and \\"J.H. MOORES MEMORIAL NATATORIUM. A.D. 1922\\" on the other. Decorative parapets project on each side of the entrance. Original window openings have been filled in. A balustrade of reinforced concrete runs along the top, with lamp posts at regular intervals. The interior contains two levels: an upper level formed by the deck surrounding the pool, and a lower level consisting of the interior space beneath the pool deck. The deck is 15 feet wide and runs around the pool. Bleachers, built into the natural hillside, are at one end. The interior also contains men's and women's dressing areas, an office, a storage room, and staff rooms.

Vandals of the Void is a young adult science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance, published in 1953. It was his first novel, although he was already known for his many short stories. Vandals involves the adventures of teenager Dick Murdock, who travels from his home on Venus to work with this father at an observatory on the Moon. Dick's ship is attacked by space pirates and he becomes involved in the effort to stop them and their mysterious leader, The Basilisk. Plot Fifteen-year-old Dick Murdock lives in Miracle Valley on Venus. He is invited to spend his summer holidays with his father Paul, who was recently promoted Chief Astronomer at an observatory on the Moon. At the space dock he hears hushed conversations among the passengers about the space liners Canopus and Capella being attacked. As he boards the African Star, he learns their sister ship, American Star, is missing. During the voyage, they come across the hulk of the American Star, adrift in The Graveyard of Space with everyone aboard dead. Another passenger bound for the Moon, Sende, appears to know more about these events than he is willing to admit. Dick reaches the Moon without further incident. While shuttling down to the observatory they fly over the ruins of a former United Nations Security Station missile base, long abandoned as war is no longer a problem on Earth. Dick is sure he sees a light in the Station, but Sende dismisses it as a reflection. Shortly after arriving, a newly built UN corvette arrives and informs them of the presence of space pirates who attack the liners and then return with a prize crew to modify them into warships. They ask the observatory to keep track of ships moving through The Graveyard, hoping to spot the pirate ships and find their base of operations. Dick makes friends with a prospector, \\"Crazy Sam\\" Baxter, who takes Dick on prospecting trips on his rocket sled. When later questioned by the UN crew, Sam claims he has met native moon people who live underground in tunnels. Later, Dick is listening to his radio when he hears a broadcast consisting of letters and digits, some form of code. The next morning he learns the African Star has been attacked. Dick attempts to decode the message and realizes they were entries in a new star atlas being developed at the observatory. The message indicates the route of the Star. Days later, Sam is killed in an accident and Dick retrieves his maps of the natural tunnels under the UN base. Dick returns to the observatory to find his father has been called away to Venus to tend to his mother. He realizes this is a ruse and flies the sled to the ship. He commandeers the liner, changing course just before they are intercepted by two of the pirate ships. They return to the observatory where they are once again met by the UN crew. They note that the radio messages Dick heard were not being heard on Earth, meaning they must be short range signals. Dick realizes the pirates are in the Security Station. He sneaks out of the observatory and uses Sam's maps to enter the base unseen. As he watches the pirates eat, the Basilisk arrives, a man with enormous yellow hypnotic eyes. Dick is enthralled and captured, but later escapes with a photograph of the Basilisk. He returns to the base to find everyone is out looking for him. While he develops the photograph, he is approached by Professor Dexter, the base's second-in- command. Dick recognizes his eyes as those of the Basilisk. Dexter realizes he has been identified and attempts to kill Dick by locking him in the darkroom with prussic acid, but Sende arrives and interrupts Dexter's parting evil monologue. Dexter rockets to the Security Station and launches his pirate ships to attack a city on Mars. Dick and Sende, revealed to be a UN operative, are picked up by the newly forming Space Navy as they attempt to intercept the pirate fleet. They meet over Mars, where the small Navy ships are outgunned by the much larger pirates. A running battle ensues, and the tide is turned by the arrival of a much larger Navy cruiser, fresh from the shipyards. Dexter attempts to escape in a small ship, but Sende shoots it down with a single well-aimed shot. In the aftermath, the Commodore of the Navy invites Dick to join their forces once he is old enough. Reception Given Vance was already fairly well known at the time as a short story author, it is surprising that the novel seems to have seen little coverage in the press when it was published. It is mentioned in more recent works; Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review, which calls it \\"mediocre fiction\\" and \\"badly dated\\". James Reasoner reviewed it in 2013 as part of a \\"lost novels of...\\" collection, concluding that \\"I would have absolutely loved this book when I was twelve years old. Heck, I enjoyed it a lot now, and I'm considerably older than twelve.\\" References External links * Vandals of the Void Category:Novels by Jack Vance Category:1953 science fiction novels ","title":"Vandals of the Void"},{"id":"57922095","text":"–®–∞—Ö Shakhtau() - one of the four shihans, located in Ishimbaysky District, on the border with the Shakhtau microdistrict of the city Sterlitamak.

Like the other shihans, the remainder of the Permian period (late Paleozoic) reef massif formed over 230 million years ago in the tropical sea.

The fate of Shakhtau can comprehend several similar shihans.Steppe nature monuments can be destroyed in Bashkiria / Preservation of the Russian Steppes, 16.09.2011 In Bashkortostan there is a campaign for the conservation of natural monuments. Activists consider the act of destroying Shakhtau as an example of a barbaric attitude toward nature, and a quarry formed in its place is called a scar on the face of Bashkortostan.  Physiographic characteristic  Shakhtau - a short ridge with a length of , a width of , stretched in the north-west direction. Rises above the level of the river. White (before the development) at 210 m ( above sea level). Located on the right bank of the river Seleuk. The Shakhtau massif consists of limestones crumpled into a fold of a submeridional strike, the axis of which rises in a southerly direction; the eastern slope of the massif is vigorously blurred in pre-Darth times and accordingly on the eastern wing there is a sharp inconsistent overlap of the Upper-Atian sediments to the Asselian and Sakmarian. The formation of the tectono-sedimentation structure of the reef deposits of the Shakhtau massif was also influenced by the regional dislocations of the Southern Ural and, in particular, the formation of the Shikhan upraised horst, which has punctured and elevated single mountains by , in comparison with the same-aged massifs of the western side of the marginal trough. The combination of the primary capricious accumulation of precipitation of reef facies and superposed tectonic processes led to the formation of a body that is very complex in its internal structure. The limestones of Shakhtau are characterized by the usual qualities of limestones of organogenic structures: chemical purity, light coloration, massiveness, lack of stratification, textural heterogeneity of various scales (spotting), a wide variety of rock types, and their frequent change. In addition to pure limestones, dolomitic limestones of clearly secondary origin are found in the massif. The limestones of Shakhtau are extremely rich in the remains of various organisms of excellent preservation. Shakhtau is now a limestone quarry, officially a \\"limestone deposit\\", for the Sterlitamak soda-cement plant (OJSC Soda). The development of limestone began in 1950. By 1975, the top part of Tsar-Gory was reduced by more than . By now, there is almost nothing left of the mountain.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —à–∏—Ö–∞–Ω–∞ –®–∞—Ö—Ç–∞—É  History  A detailed study of the mountain began in the 19th century. Vannheim von Kvalan in 1842 published the first information about the Shihan. Earlier (1841), Schachtau was visited by Roderick Murchison and Edmund Verney, who compiled a profile through Shakhtau in the form of a brachyanticlinal fold, complicated by a fault. Subsequently, paleontological materials on shihan were processed by S. Kutorga, V. Miller, H. G. Pander, and others; F. Chernyshev and N. Gerasimov gave the most complete description of the brachiopods of Shakhtau. By the beginning of the 1930s, three points of view on the genesis of the Shihans were emerging: a) brachyanticlinal folds, b) erosional remains, and c) reef massifs. The work of a number of geologists, conducted in 1936-1939, made it possible to firmly establish the reef nature of shihans. The second stage of the study of massifs began after the discovery of oil in the Southern Ural. The similarity of Shakhtau and the buried oil and gas bearing arrays made him turn to many stratigraphs. During the war years, geologists from the Bashkir oil expedition of the USSR Academy of Sciences repeatedly turned to shihan to find out the features of the facies and the history of the formation of oil and gas bearing burials of massifs Ishimbayskoye Priuralie. Detailed exploration of Shakhtau with mass drilling was started in 1950s to determine its suitability for soda-cement plant in the city of Sterlitamak. A large number of wells was drilled, which made it possible to compile a geological map of the array and a series of profiles through it. This revealed the complex structure of the array - its dislocation, the presence of intraformational erosion, in some areas - a cloak-like occurrence. It was found out that the array is reefogenic, but crumpled into a crease and was significantly eroded, that is, as if excluding each other's assumptions about the genesis of the massif were all partially justified. In 1959, on the eastern slope, a cemetery dating from the 13th and 14th centuries was discovered. In the 1960s and 1970s, many geologists visited the mine of Shakhtau, mostly paleontologists to collect comparative material. Data on Shakhtau were also used to understand the reservoir properties of reef-based limestones. VK Gromov and RK Petrova identified two types of cracks, differing in extent and degree of openness, forming in aggregate four intersecting systems of cracks. Microfracturing of the rocks was studied by AM Tyurikhin, who traced three times the time boundaries of microcracks - the oldest resemble styloliths, the middle age ones have bituminous or mineral fill, and the youngest ones are open. Mt. Shahtau was the object of an excursion to the VIII International Congress on Stratigraphy and Geology of the Carboniferous in 1975.

It was designed by Tamworth Council and Community and built during 1936 by Tamworth Progress Association, Tamworh Rotary, Tamworth Community and Council. It is also known as Lower Nemingha Road. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 March 2014.  History  =Establishment= The history of the avenue was found amongst various newspaper articles on microfiche (dating from 1936) and historical publications held at the Tamworth Regional library. Further articles were supplied from members of the public. On 29 February 1936 at the request of the townspeople, the Mayor of Tamworth convened the first public meeting to decide on a memorial to King George V. The idea to establish a living memorial to the late king by planting an avenue of English oak trees was discussed and a memorial avenue was thought to be a fitting tribute to the much loved king as he had been a lover of trees. It was also thought that the avenue should be of English oaks which, even though they are slow growing, they live to a great age, were beautiful trees and also symbolic of the link to England. Oak trees were also used as a symbol of honour for the English monarchy. Originally it was planned for the avenue to run from town along the Upper Nemingha Road (now the New England Highway), across the Two Mile Bridge over the Peel River, back along the Lower Nemingha Road (now King George V Memorial Avenue) and into town over the river via the Paradise Bridge. It was estimated that 318 trees would be required and the cost was going to be A‚Ç§300. This was felt to be an amount that was well within the means of the community of Tamworth. The population of Tamworth in 1936 was 11,000 and the committee felt that the cost of 15 shillings per tree was small and that perhaps school children and other organisations in town would desire to be represented. School children were seen to be important to be involved for it was they who would take up the task of caring for the avenue in the future. The location of the avenue was selected for a number of reasons. Firstly the Lower Nemingha Road was chosen as it was not a Main Roads Department road. This meant the trees could be planted close enough together to form an effective avenue. At that time NSW Main Roads required all roadside trees to be planted at least a chain distant from the road on each side and the effect of this on an avenue would be disheartening. It was also noted that as the Lower Nemingha Road was on a flood plain with the excellent soils and regular flooding it would be a place where English oaks would grow well. The committee decided that the trees would be planted at a distance of apart with a gap of for the roadway and at these distances it was expected that the foliage would interlace overhead forming a cathedral like arch. By April 1936 99 trees had been promised by Tamworth residents, businesses and community groups including the CWA, RSL and the Light Horse Brigade. Around this time the Main Roads Department of NSW announced that they were currently surveying all main roads from Sydney to Wallangarra with the intention of planting trees along the main access roads into towns. This changed the decision to plant the oaks on the main northern entrance road into town and the committee decided instead that signposts were to be erected on the highway so tourists could take a scenic detour into town via the avenue. This detour was called the \\"Round Drive\\" and the lower Nemingha Road was renamed King George V Memorial Avenue. By 25 June 1936 there were only 15 trees left to source and then the work on the avenue would start immediately. It was announced at that meeting that the opening and dedication of the avenue would occur during the Tamworth's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in October 1936. Tamworth City Council donated the remaining 15 trees. =Subsequent developments= In the 1950s the Paradise Tourist Park was built by Tamworth City Council at the end of the avenue and King George V Memorial Avenue has been used ever since as a recreational amenity by thousands of townsfolk and visitors each year. The devastating 1955 floods washed away the Two Mile Bridge which has never been replaced. The community of Tamworth turned out to clean up the debris from the avenue as part of the post flood clean up. Since then the only access to the avenue has been via the Paradise Bridge (next to the Paradise Tourist Park) close to town. This meant that King George V Avenue became more important as a quiet place to be visited and the avenue has become one of the main wedding and school formal photographic sites in town as well as being a quiet place for workers to have their lunch under the trees. In 1988 Tamworth City Council and the Department of Environment and Planning contracted Jonathan Falk Planning Consultants Pty Ltd to conduct a heritage study of Tamworth. Their report states that the avenue was also an important memorial to servicemen killed in World War I. In 1936 the Northern Daily Leader reported that the RSL and the Light Horse Brigade donated monies to purchase some of the trees for the avenue. In 1992 after years of public pressure Tamworth City Council agreed to establish an official register of significant trees. The Council called on members of the public to advise on which trees they believed should be protected and the reasons why. After much community consultation EJE Landscape Consultants from Sydney produced the Register of Significant Trees for Tamworth City Council in 1993 which included the King George V Memorial Avenue of English Oaks. In March 2004 Tamworth City Council proposed to remove the trees on the avenue due to ongoing decay of the trees and the forward planning for an access road to future subdivisions at Calala. The plan was to remove the trees and replant with high English oaks at a cost of $350 - $2500 each. This caused huge public outcry and a petition of 3,000 signatures was quickly collected resulting in no further action being taken. In August 2010 a development application (DA) was lodged with TRC to use King George V Avenue as the access route for a major subdivision of 500+ lots. This proposal spurred an ongoing campaign by the community and its visitors to save this much loved and historic avenue. Due to the age of the trees and the narrow distance between the trees any increase in traffic flow would mean eventual road widening and loss of the trees as well as the loss of the peace and tranquility afforded by the trees and quiet location. In November 2011 another DA was lodged with council to trench through the root protection zone of the trees in order to place a wastewater pipeline. The decision whether to approve this pipeline was deferred in December 2012 pending a comprehensive arborist report as the initial report submitted with the DA did not comply with the Australian Standard AS4709 2009 Protection of Trees in Development zones. The DA was subsequently withdrawn. In 2011 a valuation, commissioned by the community, by Thyer Amenity Tree Valuation Services valued the avenue to be worth millions of dollars to the community for its amenity, aesthetics and historic value. Its aesthetic values is evidenced by its prolific uyse as a backdrop for commercial and personal photography and its amenity values lie in its use for personal and club fitness activities. Over the years this avenue has become one of the most beautiful tourist attractions Tamworth has to offer. In February 2013 the National Trust of Australia (NSW Branch) listed the avenue as one of State significance as a rare example of an avenue of English Oaks in NSW and the only one carefully planted to grow and produce an interlocking cathedral like effect from the branches joining overhead. It is of historical significance as it was planted as a memorial to King George V in 1936 from the last of the eras when English Oaks were used for street tree plantings and commemorative plantings. From the first decision to plant the avenue to their care and now the current campaign to save the trees King George V Memorial Avenue has been an important part of Tamworth's history for 77 years. It represents a time in history after the Boer War and World War 1 when avenues of honour were popular with communities. After WWI the interest in living memorials waned. It is also a representative of the last era when English Oak trees were commonly used for road side plantings, their use declining due to the difficulty in selecting areas where they would grow successfully. In March 2014 the avenue was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.  Description  The surrounding land consists of flat alluvial flood plain used for a variety of agricultural purposes, including grain crops, lucerne and livestock grazing. Some of these fields are irrigated using water drawn from the adjacent Peel River. A small number of farm houses are located along the roadway. ;Avenue: The original planting in 1936 comprised 318 trees which were planted along the Lower Nemingha Road (renamed King George V Memorial Avenue). King George V Avenue is divided into two sections - the main section runs for from the south east end of the main street (Peel Street) heading in a south easterly direction. This section comprises 200 trees of which 140 are of the original planting as well as 60 replacement trees of varying ages. There are 99 trees on the western side and 101 on the eastern side. These trees form a nearly continuous cathedral-like canopy for as per the original concept ) for the planting.Northern Daily Leader, 29 February 1936. ;Secondary Avenue: After the avenue takes a 90 degree turn to the north- east and runs for in a straight line to the Peel River, where the road used to cross via the Two Mile Bridge onto the Upper Nemingha Road (now the New England Highway). The bridge was closed to vehicles sometime between 1936 and when it was washed away in the 1955 floods). Since that time this section of the road has been closed off and used to graze stock. This section of the avenue still has 41 of the original 70 trees. No replanting of the trees in this section has been undertaken. The trees are planted apart with a gap of for the roadway. The trees are planted 1m off the road. The growth of the English Oak is such that the foliage has interlaced overhead forming an arch as per the original intent of the avenue. The avenue then used to extend from Two Mile bridge to the Upper Nemingha Road until recently when the trees were removed in 2012 to make way for a carpark and entrance to a church. = Condition = As at 22 April 2013, the condition of the avenue ranges from excellent to fair depending on the tree. As a whole the avenue is in good condition despite the poor care and management practices to date. In 2009 the Australian Tree Consultants (ATC) were commissioned to assess the first half of the longer section of the avenue and found by them to be in varying conditions of health. In their opinion the trees examined ranged in condition from excellent to over-mature. They also found that the main reason for the relatively recent reduction in the health of the trees has been due to the inappropriate tree lopping practices by energy companies. These lopping practices are still being carried out and despite assurances in writing, that the trees would only be pruned in winter to minimise the damage, once again Essential Energy tree crews were pruning the avenue in the recent spring. This is despite their own vegetation management plan which states in section 7.1 \\"Significant, special character, protected, memorial and heritage trees may require more frequent trims to minimise impact or the consideration of alternative solutions as detailed in the section of this plan called Alternatives to Pruning. Australian Tree Consultants reported that an ongoing program of care and replacement would ensure the avenue could be maintained in good condition for many years to come.Taylor 2010 Port Arthur has historic oak trees that are estimated to be 150 years old and despite health issues caused by soil compaction (from tourist access) - they were assessed to have at least another 50+ years left if cared for appropriately. The second and shorter section of the avenue has 40 of the 70 original trees still in existence. These trees were grazed on by stock until steel barriers were installed some years ago. Since that time the trees have partially recovered with some magnificent specimens. They also do not have the regular poor pruning practices carried out by the power companies contributing to their damage. In October 2015 an inspection by Andrew Morton of Earthscape Horticultural Services revealed that sections were succumbing to significant decline in health, evidenced by: * a number of completely dead trees; * substantial crown dieback; * production of epicormic growth; * substantial pest infestation which has led to branch failures and in the worst cases, collapse of all major primary limbs. There is also evidence that trees have been declining for some years, indicated by a large no. of gaps in the original avenue (particularly in the section of unformed road running perpendicular to the main avenue) and a number of recent plantings undertaken to fill the gaps left by trees that have been removed. The integrity of the avenue is good. = Modifications and dates = Since the planning and subsequent 1936 planting of the avenue by the community of Tamworth, the following modifications have been made:Northern Daily Leader, 1992. *Early 1950s to present dayParadise tourist park opened at the end of the avenue. Thousands of visitors each year enjoy the shade and amenity of the avenue *1955Loss of the Two Mile bridge at the other end of the avenue which stopped the road being used as a detour tourist route into town *1955major floods leaving masses of debris along the avenue *196070sinstallation of high voltage power lines along both sidea of the avenue *1970spresent daydamaging tree lopping practices by the energy companies *1988Tamworth Heritage study by Falk Consultants Pty Ltd found that the avenue is also an important memorial for WWI *1992Tamworth City Council (TCC) responded to community concerns about loss of trees in town by calling for submissions for trees to be added to a significant tree register citing King George V Avenue as the example of trees to be registered *1993TCC significant tree register (STR) published. The normal practice from here is for the trees to be placed on the LEP as heritage items. This has not been done to date *Mid 2000major upgrade to high voltage powerline along the eastern side of the avenue with the resultant ongoing reduction of the canopy by pruning *2009metal barriers erected to protect the 40 remaining trees on the shorter section of the avenue. This was done before this section was allowed to be closed off and used to graze stock by the two adjacent farms. The road has been kept as a designated public road to allow visitors to access the trees *2010submission of a DA to use King George V Avenue as the major access road to a planned residential subdivision with a traffic flow predicted in excess of 3,000 cars per day. The arborist report with the DA stated that the avenue would not sustain constant use as a major traffic route *June 2011submission to council for an upgrade to the power lines that run both sides of the avenue to enable power to be sold to developers *November 2011submission to trench a waste water pipeline beside the avenue for its entire length without the appropriate arborist reports showing compliance with the Australian Standard for the Protection of Trees in development zones AS4970 2009. This pipeline DA was considered by the Joint Regional Planning Panel in December 2012 and decision deferred pending a complete and appropriate arborist report *2012the last remaining oak trees from the other side of where the Two Mile bridge used to be up to the New England Highway were removed to make way for a carpark and entrance to a church. *August 2012TreeAH was used as a tool to evaluate the heritage significance of the avenue. This was presented at the International Society of Arborists annual conference in Portland by Mark Wadey from Barrell Tree Consultancy *September 2012extensive tree pruning by Essential Energy contractors in spring despite a letter from the company stating they will only do these damaging practices in winter when the trees are dormant *November 2012DA for stage 1 of the Peel River Estate approved by Tamworth Regional Council for the first 104 lots. Second DA up for public exhibition (closing date 7/1/13) for the next 46 lots. Once 150 lots are approved the Peel River Estate must decide on a second access road to the planned development of 500 lots. To date the traffic plans submitted with the DA's are to use King George V Avenue as the major access to the development. The road in its current form does not comply with AMCORD regulations for road safety and its use as an access will necessitate road widening with the removal of 100+ trees At various dates the community have replanted trees as evidenced by the differing ages of the replacements and there is a regular watering program of the younger trees carried out by the community during dry periods. Adjacent lucerne farmers allow irrigation water to go over the fence to water the avenue. Major floods have occurred approximately every 3 ‚Äì 5 years apart from years when there are long and severe droughts. The oak trees have survived many floods and numerous droughts since their planting and the major cause of their ill health and loss over the years has been the poor pruning practices by the energy companies. They now face an even greater threat from the proposed access road and pipeline. = Further information = The integrity is good to excellent. At the first public meeting about the avenue on 28 February 1936 the townspeople and the Town Beautification and Progress Association agreed that a memorial avenue of English oak treesshpould be planted in honor of King George V. It was also decided that for an avenue to be effective the trees should be planted close to the roadway. The Lower Nemingha Road (later renamed to King George V Avenue) was selected because the trees could be planted close enough to the road so that when they reached maturity they would join overhead to form a cathedral-like canopy. The avenue has formed this desired canopy and it is still nearly continuous along the . The 1936 meeting also decided that the town to create a scenic drive close to town to which visitors could be taken. The \\"Round Drive\\" still exists but the final section is no longer driveable due to the loss of the Two Mile bridge back over the river in the 1955 floods with this portion of the road subsequently being closed to traffic. Changes since 1936 have been: # The installation in the 1960-70's of substantial high voltage power lines along the both sides of the avenue. This has necessitated the subsequent extensive and damaging lopping by the energy companies; and # The use of the avenue by the occasional high vehicle has also resulted in damage to the canopy.  Heritage listing  The Avenue is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic values as the carefully planned planting has allowed the distinctive growth habit of oak trees to form a cathedral or tunnel like effect as the branches have grown and interlocked over the roadway, making the avenue aesthetically distinctive. It is also one of the longest avenues in NSW being long. Being the only avenue of oak trees planted in NSW, the avenue is aesthetically distinctive and has unique landmark qualities. The King George V Memorial Avenue of English Oaks of State heittage significance for its rarity values as the only Avenue of Oaks in NSW. It is the only avenue of oaks dedicated as a living memorial to King George V from the last era where avenues of trees were used to mark historic events and people. It is a rare example of a substantially intact avenue of oaks still surviving in NSW and possibly in Australia. Its rarity values are enhanced as the avenue is one of only two memorial avenues to King George V in NSW, the other being an avenue of poplars in Braidwood which does not have the same aesthetic qualities as the avenue of oak trees. The item is of state heritage significance as a good representative example of a memorial avenue where this type of planting was enthusiastically embraced by Australian communities for commemorative plantings. King George V Avenue of Memorial English Oaks was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 March 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The avenue is of local heritage significance as a memorial planting planned and organised by Tamworth Council and community as an expression of their appreciation of the benevolent rule of the British monarch King George V after his death in January 1936. The avenue planting project, actively supported by Rotary, and the Tamworth Beautification and Progress Association, is also of local historic significnace as the first community project by any service clubs in Tamworth. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The historic significance of the King George V Memorial Avenue of English Oaks is enhanced through its association with the local community and its expression of admiration and respoct for King George V after his death in 1936. It is also locally important through its association with the local service clubs as their first community project. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Avenue is of aesthetic significance at a State level as the carefully planned planting has allowed the distinctive growth habit of oak trees to form a cathedral or tunnel like effect as the branches have grown and interlocked over the roadway, making the avenue aesthetically distinctive.

It is also known as St Nicolas' Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The convent was established by the Dominican Order and built during 1880 and 1882. Built of exposed variegated brick laid in English Bond, of three stories and in the Victorian Free Gothic style. The roof was originally galvanised iron. The balconies feature cast iron columns between which are long bent timber brackets meeting to form in effect pointed arches which impart a strong ecclesiastical flavour to the building. In the open spandrel to each arch is an infill of a timber ring in four segments. The convent building was originally designed to accommodate nuns on the ground and first floor with a dormitory for boarders on the top floor. Extensions to the original building were made in 1903-04 and the Chapel opened as a memorial to celebrate the golden jubilee of the profession of Mother Mary Regis, who was the first Mother Superior. The school grew and comprised the entire site now occupied by the K-Mart complex with the exception of a small parcel of land at the intersection of Peel and White Streets. In the 1970s the convent was in a deteriorated condition after the closure of the school, the land was sold for the development of a K-Mart complex, and the building was marked for demolition. A group of local citizens, recognising the historic significance and potential of the old convent, began strenuous efforts to have the building retained. The National Trust was alerted, and the building was classified, which authenticated the claim of its significance. While classification gave official recognition to the heritage value of the building, this alone could not have prevented its demolition. Representations were made to the Heritage Council of New South Wales and the Council placed a Conservation Order on the Convent, the Chapel, and the fence, describing the complex as ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù. Ownership of the site was transferred to the Minister for Planning and Environment. In July 1980, the Public Works Department prepared feasibility for possible uses of the building. The Heritage Council selected an option that would provide accommodation for the Tamworth Office of the Public Works Department, the Tamworth Regional Music Centre and the Tamworth Art & Craft Society. The Public Works Department then undertook the construction phase of the project. The restoration involved some skill not commonly used today. These included matching the elaborate timber mouldings, architraves and doors and the painting of stencilled designs on the walls. The external fa√ßade of the building was cleaned and all painted surfaces were repaired and painted using the original colours. The total cost of the restoration was $620,000, a modest amount compared with the cost of building such facilities from scratch. In 1993 the Public Works Department vacated the building and ownership of the building was transferred to the University of New England. The Tamworth Regional Conservatorium of Music leased the building for a peppercorn rent, with responsibility for the maintenance of the building. In 2003 ‚Äì 2004, the Conservatorium undertook major repair work on the stained glass windows in the Chapel. The windows were removed and transported to a workshop in the Kangaroo Valley where they were cleaned, broken glass replaced, re-leaded and rebuilt prior to being returned to Tamworth. In 2003 restoration and refurbishment of the Chapel roof was undertaken and part of the exterior of the building was repainted. In 2006 the exterior painting was completed.

History  = Formation = The seniority of the regiment was traced back to the formation of the Reval Regiment of the Reval Garrison in 1711. The garrison also included the Estonia and Dorpat regiments. The three-battalion Estonia Musketeer Regiment was formed on 17 January 1811 at Reval from six companies of the Reval Garrison Regiment and three companies each from the Pernov and Narva Garrison Battalions. Each battalion included one Grenadier and three Musketeer companies, and the regiment was authorized 2,459 personnel, including 61 officers, 120 non-commissioned officers, and 1,980 privates. Its chef was Major General Gothard Helfreich from formation. On 22 February it was redesignated as the Estonia Infantry Regiment when the Imperial Russian Army replaced the Musketeer designation. A fourth reserve battalion of 559 personnel was added to the regiment on 19 November. = French invasion of Russia = At the beginning of 1812 it was part of the 2nd Brigade of the 14th Infantry Division, commanded by General Ivan Sazonov. Between 1812 and 1814 the regimental commander was Lieutenant Colonel Karl Ulrichsen, promoted to colonel on 18 October 1812. At the beginning of the French invasion of Russia, the active battalions of the regiment were part of the 14th Division in the 1st Infantry Corps of the 1st Western Army. The reserve battalion was to form the 30th Infantry Division, but instead became part of the Dunamund fortress. With the detachment of General Fyodor von L√∂wis it fought in the Battle of Ekau and did not join the regiment until July 1813. The grenadier company of the 2nd Battalion became part of the Combined Grenadier Battalion of the division. A reserve battalion was formed at the Staraya Russa recruit depot and was to help form the 39th Infantry Division, but instead joined the Riga fortress garrison. During the 1812 campaign, the regiment fought in the battles of Boyarshchina, Golovshchina, where it lost 160 men, and Svolne, where it lost 200 men. During the First Battle of Polotsk on 18 August, described as its first major engagement, it lost fourteen officers and more than 400 men but managed to repulse several French attacks and maintain an orderly retreat. Wounded twice during the action, Ulrichsen remained with the regiment and led counterattacks during the retreat. For their actions on that day, 43 men of the regiment were decorated, while the regiment received one white and five colored standards for its actions. The Estonia Regiment then fought at Chashniki and Smoliani. In September it was reinforced by the 8th host (druzhina) of the Saint Petersburg militia. = War of the Sixth Coalition = In the 1813 campaign it fought in the Siege of Danzig, the Siege of K√ºstrin, the Siege of Spandau, the Battle of L√ºtzen, and the Battle of Bautzen. As part of the 1st Infantry Corps of General Peter Wittgenstein in the Bohemian Army it fought in the Battle of Dresden after the resumption of hostilities with Napoleon. During the Battle of Kulm, the regiment participated in the loss and recapture of Cotta, but lost six officers and 260 men ‚Äì a third of its strength ‚Äì while fighting on the Kohlberg and at the Gie√üh√ºbl defile. The regiment fought in the Battle of Leipzig, during which Napoleon was decisively defeated, and was granted the right to march to the drumbeat reserved for grenadier regiments for its courage on 4 March 1814. In the 1814 campaign it blockaded Kehl, then advanced into northwest France. As part of the advance guard of General Peter von Pahlen, the regiment was caught by overwhelmingly numerically superior French forces under Napoleon himself on 17 February at the Battle of Mormant, and was surrounded and almost completely destroyed with a loss of 338 men, leaving only three officers and 69 men in the ranks by the end of the day. The remnants of the regiment, now less than a company, participated in the Battle of Paris. = 1815 to 1918 = The reserve battalion of the regiment was disbanded on 8 August 1814, and regimental strength increased to 3,558. The position of chef was removed on 10 July 1815 as it proved unnecessary due to the wartime promotion chefs to higher commands. The strength of the 2nd Battalion was reduced by 600 privates on 25 August 1817. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions switched designations on 26 March 1824. The 1st and 2nd Battalions were designated active battalions on 9 May 1830, and the 3rd Battalion became the reserve battalion. The active battalions numbered 2,272 personnel, while the reserve battalion would expand to 1,116 personnel in event of war from a peacetime strength of 488. On 28 January 1833, as part of a reorganization of the army, the 4th Jaeger Regiment was merged with the regiment, redesignated the Estonia Jaeger Regiment. The reorganized regiment included four active battalions and two reserve battalions. During peacetime, the reserve battalions were consolidated into a single unit. The regiment now had a strength of 5,351 in peacetime and 6,588 in wartime. The 6th reserve battalion was abolished on 28 February 1834, leaving the 5th reserve battalion with a peacetime strength of 472 to be expanded to 1,088 in wartime. The St. George Standard of the regiment awarded for its actions in the Russo-Turkish War The regiment was redesignated as the Estonia Infantry Regiment on 17 April 1856 and was numbered as the 8th Estonia Infantry Regiment on 25 March 1864. On 6 January 1885, it received a St. George standard with inscriptions \\"for courage in the Turkish War of 1877 and 1878\\" and \\"1711‚Äì1811\\", along with an Alexander jubilee ribbon.

Biography Destined for the rabbinate by his parents, Ensheim left his native Metz against his father's will, and for many years led a wandering life. From 1782 to 1785 he was tutor in the family of Moses Mendelssohn in Berlin, having special charge over the education of Abraham Mendelssohn. On leaving Mendelssohn's house he returned to Metz, where he struggled hard to make a living by teaching mathematics. Being a Jew, he was rejected for the position of professor of mathematics at the newly founded √âcole centrale de Metz. Ensheim was a prominent member of the movement instituted by the Me'assefim. In 178, he published a volume of Hebrew riddles. In 1790, Ensheim published Shalosh ·∏§idot, a satire against billiards card card games, and two hymns: Al-ha-Va'ad ha-Gadol asher bi- medinat ·∫íarefat, addressed to the National Assembly in Versailles, and the triumphal song La-Mena·∫ìe'a·∏• Shir, which was sung in 1793 in the synagogue at Metz to the tune of La Marseillaise. He was an intimate friend of Abb√© Gr√©goire, and helped him with the preparation of his 1788 essay in defense of the Jews. His Recherches sur les calculs diff√©rentiels et int√©grals (1799) was highly praised by Lagrange and Laplace, with whom he was personally associated. His last years were passed at Bayonne as a tutor in the home of Abraham Furtado, his leisure being devoted to Talmudical studies. Before his death in 1839 he gave 12,000 francs, one-fourth of his fortune, to the Jewish elementary school of Metz.

His younger brother Pietro was also a minor artist. Erardi married Caterina Buttigieg, and their son Alessio Erardi also became a painter. His works may be regarded as either late examples of Mannerism or early Baroque. Mannerism was outdated by Erardi's lifetime, but he probably became familiar with this style through studying paintings located in churches and collections in Malta. Erardi might have also been influenced by the works of Baroque artists such as Caravaggio, Domenichino and Guido Reni. Erardi was favoured among the government and church authorities, and consequently his paintings may be found in many churches and collections around Malta. He also had connections with Sicily, Naples and Rome which were secured by the Order of St. John and the church.

It is a term often misused as a generic noun for plastic film. Polyane is a range of insulating and waterproof plastic films. It is used by building and public works professionals.  History  = Piat, pioneer of the profession (1954-1964) = Henri Piat, a mechanical enthusiast, finds that his bicycle's brake cables are poorly protected. The question then arises of covering them with polyvinyl chloride (PVC). But to get the necessary compound, the problem was to find a company that used it. That's what √âtablissements B. do, they inject it to make bicycle handlebars. But √âtablissements B. don't want to sell him their compound. Then, he bought it thanks to a third person the handlebars sleeves to crush them and thus recover the compound which he needs. To protect his brakes, Henri Piat had to develop and build an extruder. The two PVC manufacturers of the time ‚Äì Rh√¥ne-Poulenc and Saint-Gobain ‚Äì appreciated this dynamism and Piat began to think that covering brake cables and electrical wires were not two such different activities. Then, he built an extruder with a square head to solve this problem. This one even competes with the C√¢bles de Lyon and its business works so well that offers are presented to him. Then he ended up selling. At the beginning of 1954, during the Marist alumni dinner, Piat met up again with J.-E. Mazuyer who had also launched himself into plastics with the creation of his company, the Soci√©t√© Plastique Soud√©. He buys gaines to Plymouth, Laroche and La Cellophane, then transforms them into sachets. The two colleagues decide to create together the Company of Transformation of Synthesis Products, more famous under the name of Prosyn. With a capital of fifty thousand old francs and located rue des Forges in Saint-√âtienne, Piat holds 60% of the shares, Mazuyer owns 40%. For eight years, the company grew considerably. It was in 1954, during a trip to Atlantic City, the packaging capital, on the occasion of the Packaging Show, when Piat came up with an idea about the equipment to be used to launch Prosyn, and he turned to the Italian L. Bandera to buy him an extruder of the same name, machine three times cheaper than the one proposed by the Americans, and half cheaper than that of the Germans. To acquire it, he commits almost all of Prosyn's capital and must obtain an import licence. Prosyn's early difficulties were technical, but this was one of the characteristics of French industries during the 1950s. In addition, there were three main competitors on the market: La Cellophane, Plymouth and Laroche Fr√®res. But Prosyn is already on the move and continues to develop. Its production is more important, more diversified, so it is necessary to buy new machines, enlarge the premises, employ new workers, etc. The company moves a first time towards the station Ch√¢teaucreux in Saint-Etienne. Piat and Mazuyer have started a great business but they are both very pragmatic, if two or three of their ten customers stopped placing orders, the company could not last. So, they weren't closed to a sale. = The SNPA, the arrival of a giant (1964-1999) = Since the early 1950s, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des P√©troles d'Aquitaine, part of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes CRRA Research Centre, has been interested in polymers by creating a specialised service. In 1964, they jointly and equally acquired a stake in Prosyn with Lafarge. Both had an interest in buying Prosyn; Lafarge to increase the waterproofing of its cement bags, the SNPA to be able to develop and promote the use of polyethylene films. Under this impulse, the company is moved to Saint-Chamond on a site of more than 27 000 m2. The company's production rose from 600 tonnes in 1957 to 15,500 tonnes in 1970. Subsequently, the SNPA took over the entire capital of Prosyn and in the 1980s, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des P√©troles d'Aquitaine became the Elf Atochem group. Prosyn then becomes Prosyn Polyane and the group launches an unprecedented marketing strategy around the use of plastic films. In the momentum of this exponential growth, the Polyane brand was born in 1965. Over the years, the brand expanded to include a complete range of polyethylene films adapted to different uses, with more advanced technology and technicality. Elf Atochem has created many new plastic applications and, to meet the growing needs, the group has invented many new businesses. The company reached its peak in the 1980s, when it employed over 800 people. Characterized as a development unit, it designs several products: * stretch film; * garbage bag; * printing on plastic film; * agricultural film; * technical film; * building film. In the 1990s, notably the printings on plastic films in 1995 and rubbish bags in 1999. = Verdoso, the Luxembourgian industrial group enters France (1999-2001) = In 1999, the company employs only 150 employees and it meets great difficulties of profitability; Elf Atochem always seeks to sell it for several years. In 1998, it generated a turnover of FRF 230 million (EUR 35.06 million) and nevertheless generated a negative result. Its annual production was 26,000 tonnes. Elf Atochem then sold the latter to the Luxembourgian industrial group Verdoso in 1999. The latter holds 55% of the capital of Soci√©t√© de Production de Films Plastiques (SPFP), which has taken over Prosyn Polyane, and the remaining 45% belong to a French industrialist: Jacques Valette, who will be appointed new CEO of the acquired entity. This is the first industrial site in France for Verdoso, which already controls the British adhesive tape manufacturer Sellotape. His main objective is to develop at Prosyn Polyane the manufacture of film for industry and agriculture. With this sale, Elf Atochem signs its withdrawal from the polyethylene transformation sector, a sector in which it was no longer in a strong position. Six months earlier, he had already sold Alplast, of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (Haut-Rhin), which manufactured plastic bags for mass distribution, to Natexis Investissement. = ADELPRO, the intervention of an agricultural specialist (2001-2004) = The company was bought again in October 2001 by the Adelpro group, a specialist in agricultural film, giving birth to a French number one,. Adelpro is a holding company comprising three polyethylene processing units with a capital of 5.2 million euros. The three companies constituting this holding company are: Addem Plastiques (Firminy, Loire), the former agricultural division of the British group Autobar Flexible France, which was then called Deltal√®ne (Sainte Sigol√®ne, Haute-Loire) and Prosyn Polyane (Saint-Chamond, Loire). Two former Autobar executives controlled this group and they were keen to develop it on the French agricultural and horticultural market, for greenhouses, silage, mulching and plasticulture in general. The group then had a volume of 43,000 tonnes, a turnover of 55 million euros and employed 210 people. Each processing unit will remain legally and commercially independent, which will generate greater purchasing power from the holding company, since it is a business where the raw material weighs heavily in the final cost of production. The joint export development of products for livestock farming and market gardening will also give the group a European dimension by remaining the market leader and developing highly technical products. In July 2003, the group acquired Ribeyron (Sainte Sigol√®ne, Haute-Loire),. At this moment, ADELPRO represents a production volume of 66,000 tons, a turnover of 94 million euros and employs 296 people. It became the French leader and one of the main players in the design and manufacture of agricultural films. Its activity can be divided into four categories: * agricultural films 50%; * technical films 20%; * 20% bagging; * building films 10%. Prosyn Polyane expects a turnover of 70 million euros when it is bought in 2001 and the company changes its name and becomes Polyane. = Prolene, a springboard to business resumption (2004-2006) = Adelpro having been in receivership since November 2003, the commercial court of Saint-√âtienne decided to stop the group's activities. The garbage bags, technical films and checkout bags business had already been sold to Ribeyron SAS in May. In order not to completely cease the group's activity, the court agreed to keep Deltal√®ne and Polyane together, and the new company will be called Prol√®ne and will be managed by Jacques Valette, former CEO of the entity owned by the Verdoso group. Jacques Valette then undertakes to repay all his debts over eight years and his production estimates amount to forty million euros. Despite these forecasts, the company remained under observation by a judicial agent and was ordered to wait for the court's agreement for each of its purchases. As the company could not honour its debts, it found itself on the verge of bankruptcy. It is then that several proposals of repurchase are made by great professionals on the plastic market: Plastika Kritis, Hyplast and Ginegar. The latter two understand that they will not stand alone against the Greek group. They then choose to join forces to face the latter, but the court makes its decision and opts for the proposal of repurchase by Plastika Kritis. = Plastika Kritis, number two in the world (2006-today) = Plastika Kritis is one of Europe's leading producers of masterbatches and agricultural films. It has an international orientation with affiliated companies in France, Romania, Poland, Russia, Turkey and China and exports to over sixty countries. It has been listed on the Athens Stock Exchange since 1999. In 2006, Plastika Kritis acquired the assets of two famous and historic French agricultural film producers, Polyane and Deltal√®ne, and combined them into a new company, Agripolyane. Today, Agripolyane, the company behind this brand, has become the French leader and one of the main world players in the design and manufacture of greenhouse cover films. It is also one of the few companies in this field to develop its own additives. In addition, the company has an innovative machinery park on an industrial site of more than 27,000 m2, some of which are the largest in the world, and a market extending over more than sixty countries. The Polyane brand is now recognized in its sector as the leading brand of building films. Victim of its success, the term Polyane is often used as a generic term to evoke plastic although this one is not an authentic Polyane. Subject to many counterfeits, the company tries to fight to keep its industrial property.  Products  = Manufacturing process = Polyane films are manufactured using the extrusion-inflating principle. = Types of finished products = Polyane plastic films are divided into several broad categories, themselves separated into numerous subcategories according to the type of plastic, its properties, the desired application, location, etc. Here is the list of the main categories that can be found: * construction range ** protective film ** sealing film ** TRIDALL film ** asbestos removal film * agricultural range ** greenhouse film ** mulching film ** semi-forcing film ** silage film ** special film for livestock buildings * industrial range ** shrink film ** protective cover ** packaging film  Annexes  = Patents and trademarks = The Polyane trademark was registered in 1965. Since then, the company has changed its name from Prosyn Polyane to Agripolyane. It has also diversified its activity to include agriculture, construction, industry and geomembrane. The company wanted to protect its name by registering several dozen trademarks that it has created in its main markets, both nationally and internationally, with organizations specialized in intellectual property such as the INPI (France) or the OHIM (European Union). The company has also developed new products and filed patents to protect its innovations.

Trevor Phillips, when chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said in 2006: \\"Asquith's stand against discrimination brought to light the inadequacy of early race discrimination laws and persistent widespread discrimination faced by ethnic minorities.\\" A plaque at the station commemorates his achievement. Early life Xavier was born on 18 July 1920 in Dominica, which was then a British colony. He was a member of the Windrush generation of British African- Caribbean people who migrated to the United Kingdom after the Second World War to fill vacancies in service industries. Discrimination Xavier joined British Railways. In 1966 he was working as a guard at Marylebone station in central London. He applied for a promotion and transfer to work at Euston station, but was rejected. A letter from a staff committee at Euston‚Äîwhich was dominated by members of the National Union of Railwaymen‚Äîexplained that it was because of his colour. Unions and management had informally agreed in the 1950s to ban non-white people from jobs at Euston involving contact with the public; they could be cleaners and labourers, but not guards or ticket collectors. The Race Relations Act of 1965 had made discrimination on \\"grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins\\" unlawful in public places in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland). Xavier could not use this legislation to further his case as it did not cover workplaces. Xavier persisted. A union official publicised the rejection by writing a letter of protest to the head of the National Union of Railwaymen on his behalf. Two members of parliament wrote to the secretary of state for transport, Barbara Castle, to ask her to direct British Railways to end racial discrimination. On 15 July 1966 British Railways announced that colour bars at stations in London had been abandoned. Xavier was offered the job with his pay backdated to May, the month when he had been originally rejected. Xavier could not take up the job immediately because he was recovering from hospital treatment for an ulcer. He received hate mail and death threats, and asked for police protection. He started work on 15 August 1966.

The colonial-era double storey mansion was constructed in the early 20th century. Despite the building's status as the official residence of Penang's head of government, the building has been left unoccupied since 2009 due to its dilapidated condition. This changed in 2019 when Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow moved into the premises on July after assuming office following the historic 14th General Election in 2018.  History  The double storey mansion, known at the time as the State Guest House, was built in the early 1900s. Its architecture was believed to have been inspired by the German-born designer, Henry Alfred Neubronner. Upon the independence of the Federation of Malaya in 1957, the building was renamed in Malay as Rumah Tetamu. It was inhabited by the first Chief MInister of Penang, Wong Pow Nee, during his tenure between 1957 and 1969. When Koh Tsu Koon succeeded Lim Chong Eu as the Chief Minister in 1990, the former opted not to move to the mansion, choosing instead to stay in his private residence. Thus the building was left vacated until 2008, when Koh, in turn, was replaced by Lim Guan Eng as the Chief Minister. Although Lim initially moved into the mansion, he was then taken aback by its state of disrepair. Extensive termite infestation forced the then Chief Minister to instruct the state's Public Works Department (JKR) to conduct termite inspection and to repair the mansion, which was simultaneously renamed Seri Teratai. However, the exorbitant repair costs and the building's structural damage led to Lim eventually moving out in July 2009; Lim subsequently resided in his private residence at Pinhorn Road for the remainder of his tenure. Although the current Chief Minister, Chow Kon Yeow, had expressed his intentions of moving into the mansion in 2018, his move has similarly been hampered by the building's repair costs, estimated at RM1.2 million.

It was commissioned by The Brett Valley Society of the Arts with Arts Council assistance. The story is the slightly altered true story of Margaret Catchpole, a young Suffolk girl employed by the Cobbold family, who fell in love with a smuggler (William Laud), stole a horse in a desperate attempt to meet him in London, was tried and sentenced to death but reprieved and sent to Australia.  Full synopsis  = Act 1. = Preparations for Harvest Home are in progress at Priory Farm when the servant girl, Margaret Catchpole, is surprised by a sudden encounter with her smuggler amour, Will Laud, whose fatal attraction for her provides the dramatic mainspring of the famous story. Although she expresses her dislike of Laud's chosen profession, she turns down an offer of marriage by John Barry, the local miller's son, and agrees to meet Laud on the river bank that night. She slips away unnoticed by the revellers. But incensed by her refusal to elope clandestinely, Laud, abetted by his villainous companion, John Luff, attempts her abduction. This is foiled by the intervention of Barry. The smugglers escape, but Barry is left wounded on the beach, watched over by the half-crazed fisherman ‚ÄòCrusoe‚Äô. = Act 2. = Mrs. Cobbold has taken Margaret into service in her prosperous Ipswich household. Barry, now recovered, pleads with Margaret to marry him, but her belief in Laud's fundamental goodness cannot be shaken; she concedes only the evil of his occupation and companions. Barry, upset, resolves to emigrate. In her desperation to have news of Laud Margaret causes friction in the household and is rebuked by her kindly employer for inviting unsavoury seamen into the kitchen to enquire after Laud. This is followed by Margaret's contemptuous words conveyed via the kitchen maid to the very next caller, before Margaret is aware of his identity. When he leaves a bag addressed to her, she realises, horrified, that the visitor was Laud, now an officer in the King's Navy. Meanwhile, the relationship between Laud and Luff has soured, and mostly on Margaret's account. Luff hits on a scheme to be rid of them both in a single act of treachery. A forged note persuades Margaret to steal a horse and ride to London. = Act 3. = The courtroom judge sternly reminds Margaret that horse-stealing is a capital offence. The excellence of her character, however, secures a reprieve, and looks likely to shorten her days in prison. Two years pass. Unluckily she chances to meet Laud in the yard on his way to freedom after a brief spell inside. The fatal attraction is as strong as ever. She climbs the wall that night to join him. A radiant dawn greets them on the river bank, but the boat Laud expects is unaccountably delayed and they are overtaken by the pursuit. Refusing to give Margaret up Laud defies the guards and is shot dead. Back in the courtroom, Margaret rails against the ‚Äòjustice‚Äô that has killed the man she loved. This time, Margaret is initially sentenced to death but the sentence is then commuted to transportation for life. Margaret considers this a ‚Äòliving death‚Äô but Mrs. Cobbold comforts her with words encouragement. = Act 4. = Australia. Mrs Palmer, the head of a girls‚Äô orphanage, is visited by John Barry who is now the local Governor's agent and a great benefactor. He asks after a servant she had previously recommended for his brother-in-law. She explains that the girl was transported to Australia a year earlier for stealing a horse in Suffolk to join her lover but that she has proved nothing but loyal, trustworthy and devoted since. She is due to return to Mrs Palmer from a housekeeping job that very day. Barry realises with wonder that it is none other than his beloved Margaret and tells Mrs Palmer he feels sure he can gain her a pardon from the Governor. A week later, Mrs Palmer tells a surprised Margaret that a friend of the Governor has obtained her liberty. Barry himself appears and offers the contrite and grateful Margaret his love and a life with him once more but then bashfully also offers her the freedom to return to England or live life freely in Australia. Margaret throws herself into his arms. In the final scene, in an idyllic setting reminiscent of their home in England, Margaret and Barry cradle their baby, muse on correspondences from their friends in Suffolk and revel in the pure joy of the life they have together.  Background to composition  As a young girl, Stephen Dodgson's wife Jane Clark Dodgson who lived in Suffolk, loved her first edition of the novel The History of Margaret Catchpole (London, 1845, reproduced 2018 by Outlook Verlag, GmbH) by Richard Cobbold. When she met Stephen Dodgson, she passed on this passion on to her husband and Dodgson decided to set the story to music. When writing of the fourth act, Stephen Dodgson himself described it as follows: Except for the brief radiance of that one blinding dawn in Act 3, the musical landscape has thus far been sombre. Now, all of a sudden, the sun shines brilliantly. A new happiness is embodied in Mrs. Palmer, head of the girls‚Äô orphanage in Sydney, where Margaret‚Äôs work and character win golden opinions. Her horse-stealing and transportation to Australia are true history. But the figure of John Barry and his timely reappearance as the means of a happy ending are pure fiction; invention of that very same Mrs. Cobbold‚Äôs son, Richard, whose novel, ‚ÄòMargaret Catchpole‚Äô was a runaway best seller in Victorian times, and which is the basis of Ronald Fletcher‚Äôs libretto. The last of three distinct scenes is introduced by a long flute solo over a single quiet harmony. It is a far- off reminder of the Harvest Home of Act 1. Margaret gazes from the balcony of her new home. The scene is so alike: a similar slope to the river ‚Äì a full moon! Gradually a flood tide of emotional recollection engulfs her. Even ‚ÄòCrusoe‚Äô (‚Ä¶.‚Äúwho strangely saw my story to its close‚Äù ‚Ä¶.) is inextricably mixed up in it. But the full moon is also finally consoling as she struggles to overcome her past and ‚Äú‚Ä¶.make my two worlds one‚Äù. Documents supplied by Stephen Dodgson's widow, Jane Clark Dodgson  Performances  The opera was first performed June 1979 in a short run in Hadleigh, Suffolk. Dodgson subsequently rewrote the fourth act in order to tighten it up and it was this version that was then performed at the Wangford Festival in July 1989. The opera will be performed again as a concert performance and recorded live (for Naxos) in its native Suffolk at Snape Maltings, the home of the Aldeburgh Festival, on 5 July 2019.

The university was formed by the amalgamation of three existing institutes of technology in the Dublin area ‚Äì Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and Institute of Technology, Tallaght, and it is the second- largest third-level institution in Ireland based on student population of 28,500, behind University College Dublin. It is the eighth university in Ireland, and the fourth in the Dublin Region, following Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, and Dublin City University. The institution's history stretches back to 1887, with the establishment of the first technical education institution in Ireland, the City of Dublin Technical Schools. Professor David FitzPatrick is the inaugural president of TU Dublin. History =City of Dublin Technical Schools= TU Dublin has its origins in the City of Dublin Technical Schools, with a Technical College founded at Kevin Street in 1887 by poet, songwriter and novelist Arnold Felix Graves. =Amalgamation of Institutes of Technology= In 2014, the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (ITB) and Institute of Technology, Tallaght (ITT) jointly entered into a formal process to merge into a university. At the time, following the \\"Institutes of Technology Act of 2006\\", there were fourteen IT's in Ireland, and a political appetite emerged to amalgamate several to form a more advanced third-level institution, known as a technological university, similar to that of Delft and other technological universities in Europe. The Dublin bid, proposed by the three institutes, eventually coalesced in 2014 to seek designation as a technological university under the project title \\"Technological University for Dublin Alliance\\" / \\"TU4Dublin\\". A final application was submitted in April 2018, following the signing into law by President Michael D. Higgins of the \\"Technological Universities Act 2018\\". The formation of the Technological University of Dublin was approved in July 2018, and the university was formally established on 1 January 2019, on which date the preceding institutions were dissolved. In April 2019, TU Dublin sold its Kevin Street campus to York Capital and Westridge Real Estate for ‚Ç¨140 million. In March 2020, TU Dublin put the Aungier Street campus up for sale. Facilities The university consists of three main campuses, located in Grangegorman (\\"City Campus\\"), Blanchardstown, and Tallaght - the campuses previously of DIT, ITB, and ITT respectively, the institutes which have amalgamated. The Grangegorman campus will complete ongoing relocation of activities at Kevin Street and Cathal Brugha Street, expanding its capacity to 10,000 students, while development is planned for the other two campuses during the formative years of the university. According to then Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the new university will have an \\"entrepreneurial ethos\\", and offer degrees and programmes ranging from Level 6 to Level 10 in the National Framework of Qualifications. While having an emphasis on computer science and STEM subjects, given its status as a technological university, the then Minister for Education and Skills Richard Bruton stated that the university would aim to sit at \\"convergence of the arts, business, science and technology\\". European University of Technology The Technological University Dublin is one of the eight holders of the European University of Technology, EUt+https://www.univ-tech.eu/ with the Technical University of Sofia (Bulgaria), the Cyprus University of Technology (Cyprus), the Hochschule Darmstadt, University of Applied Sciences (Germany), the Technological University Dublin (Ireland), the Riga Technical University (Latvia), the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (Spain), the University of Technology of Troyes (France) and the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (Romania). The European University of Technology, EUt+ is the result of the alliance of eight European partners who share a common vision. Innovation The Grangegorman campus includes the Greenway Hub, which is a \\"state-of-the-art facility for research and innovation that has been developed on the new TU Dublin campus at Grangegorman\\". It is home to the Environmental, Sustainability and Health Institute (ESHI) and to DIT Hothouse. Students' Union The Technological University Dublin Students' Union (TU Dublin SU) was established by referendum in February 2019 as the amalgamation of DIT Students' Union, IT Tallaght Student Union and Institute of Technology Blanchardstown Student Union. The TU Dublin Students Union began operating on 1 July 2019. Other Technological Universities In January 2021, IT Tralee is due to merge with Cork IT to become Munster Technological University.

The station was owned by the Northern Radio & Electric Company, however both its studio and transmitter were located at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer building, and the newspaper was responsible for most of its operations. KFC was one of the earliest broadcasting stations authorized in the United States, and was also the first in the state of Washington. In addition, there had been a series of earlier broadcasts made by the Northern Radio & Electric Company in conjunction with the Post- Intelligencer, beginning in July 1921. History =Preliminary broadcasts= June 1922 station advertisementNorthern Radio & Electric Company (advertisement), Seattle Star, June 5, 1922, page 9. KFC received its first formal broadcasting license in December 1921. However, the station's history dated back to a series of broadcasts begun the previous summer as a joint effort by the Northern Radio & Electric Company and the Post-Intelligencer newspaper. In the early 1920s radio broadcasting began to gain popularity, as the development of vacuum-tube transmitters made audio transmissions practical. In June 1921 the Post-Intelligencer developed a plan to broadcast round-by-round results of the July 2, 1921 \\"Fight of the Century\\" heavyweight boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Carpentier being held in New Jersey. The newspaper arranged for summaries to be telegraphed across the county to their 600 Pine Street offices, where the information would be posted on a bulletin board located outside the building and megaphoned from the second floor, in addition to the radio transmissions. The newspaper enlisted a local radio expert, Roscoe W. Bell of the Northern Radio Company, to set up a radio transmitter at the newspaper building. Arrangements were also made for the local Navy radio station, located at the L. C. Smith building, to participate by sending fight summaries via radiotelegraph, which had a much greater coverage than the radiotelephone station, although limited to listeners able to read Morse code dots-and-dashes. The reported wavelength to be used for a July 1 radiotelephone test transmission was 340 meters (882 kHz).\\"Post- Intelligencer to Flash News by Wireless Telephone\\", Seattle Post- Intelligencer, July 1, 1921, Part 2, page 1. The next day the newspaper reported that the test went well, so, beginning at 11:00 a.m., the radiotelephone broadcast would be sent on 275 meters (1091 kHz), while the Navy's radiotelegraph reports would go out on 600 meters (500 kHz).\\"Radio Ready to Flash Big Fight Report\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 2, 1921, Part 2, page 1. The fight broadcast was carried out as planned, and the paper declared the overall effort a success, with the transmission heard as far away as 50 miles (80 kilometers) by Father Sebastian Ruth at St. Martin's College in Lacey. In between the fight bulletins, \\"a talking machine supplied by the Hopper-Kelly Company was played into the instrument, and thus fight fans who were listening in were treated to a concert\\". A technical description of the transmitter described it as \\"two five-watt Pliotron tubes, one as an oscillator and one as a modulator, employing the Heising system of modulation\\".\\"Post-Intelligencer Radio Service Pleases Fight Followers\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 3, 1921, Part 2, pages 1, 17. In September 1921 Roscoe W. Bell and Henry S. Tenny incorporated the Northern Radio & Electric Company,\\"Industrial Incorporations\\", Pacific Builder and Engineer, September 16, 1921, page 4. located at 418 Union Street. Bell was company president, and Tenny, described as having served as a \\"chief electrician in the Adriatic service\\" during World War One,\\"New Apparatus and Supplies from the Radio Manufacturers\\", Radio, December 1921, page 212. was the manager. In December the company moved to 606 Pine Street,\\"Manufacturer, Dealer and Jobber Activities\\", Journal of Electricity and Western Industry, February 1, 1922, page 126. and the leasing agent, Henry Broderick, Inc., took out a small advertisement stating that \\"Last night, for the first time in history, a property deal was announced by Wireless Telephone\\", claiming an audience of \\"2,000 Receiver-Phones\\".\\"Out of the Air\\" (advertisement for Henry Broderick, Inc.), Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 17, 1921, page 3. There were no immediate attempts to continue broadcasting following the fight broadcast, however, in early September the Post-Intelligencer announced that it would be making a major return to the airwaves, with daily broadcasts starting on the 5th. This was again done in conjunction with Northern Radio & Electric. The station was constructed at the newspaper's Pine Street building, and included a \\"standard five-watt radiophone transmitter, using two Cunningham pliotron transmitter tubes\\".\\"Post-Intelligencer News by Radio Phone Starts Monday\\", Post-Intelligencer, September 4, 1921, Part 2, pages 1, 15. Newspaper publicity consistently referred to the station as the \\"Post-Intelligencer radiophone\\", however the newspaper did not hold a radio station license at this time. H. S. Tenny did have an amateur station license with the call sign 7FW,\\"Seventh District\\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States (edition June 30, 1921), page 136. The \\"7\\" in 7FW's call sign indicated that it was located in the seventh Radio Inspection district, and the fact that the \\"F\\" fell in the range from A-W indicated that it was operating with a standard amateur station license. and a contemporary company advertisement also listed 7FW as Northern Radio & Electric Company's \\"radio call\\".\\"Northern Radio & Electric Company\\" (advertisement), Radio, November 1921, page 166. The debut program was described as being transmitted on the wavelength \\"ordinarily employed by amateurs\\", which at the time was 200 meters (1500 kHz).\\"Wireless Phone Nightly Service Starts Tonight\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, September 5, 1921, Part 2, page 1. The broadcast started at 9:00 p.m. and lasted a half hour, and consisted of news items interspersed with phonograph records. The newspaper reported overall success, and Father Sebastian Ruth at St. Martin's College in Lacey again reported reception, this time said to be 68 miles (110 kilometers) away. It was also announced that starting the next night the newspaper planned to continue the half hour programs on a daily basis.\\"Hundreds Get Post-Intelligencer Radio Bulletins\\", Seattle Post- Intelligencer, September 6, 1921, pages 13, 17.\\"Seattle's Radiophone\\" by Howard S. Pyle, Radio News, October 1921, page 296. One of the more ambitious programs presented during this era were continuous reports of the October 22, 1921 football game held at Oregon Agricultural College in Corvallis against the University of Washington. A special telegraph line was installed at the site of the contest, where telegraphed summaries were sent to the Post- Intelligencer, typewritten, and then broadcast.\\"Monthly Broadcast of Radio Newslets\\", Radio, December 1921, page 205. A crowd of 1,000 students gathered at the University's Meany Hall listened to the bulletins describing their team's eventual 24-0 loss.\\"Radio Brings News of Game to University\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, October 23, 1921, page 1. =KFC= Final program listing (December 30, 1922). The station license was canceled the next month.\\"KFC Post-Intelligencer Radiophone\\" (program schedule), Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 30, 1922, page 14. Initially there were no formal standards for radio stations making broadcasts for the general public, and a variety of stations, most operating under Experimental or Amateur station licenses, conducted broadcasts on a regular schedule. On December 1, 1921 the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted the first regulation formally establishing a broadcasting station category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment broadcasts, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for market and weather reports.\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. The Northern Radio & Electric Company was among the first to apply for one of the new authorizations. Its first broadcasting license, with the randomly assigned call letters of KFC, was issued on December 8, 1921,\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #244, issued on December 8, 1921 to the Northern Radio & Electric Company in Seattle, Washington for operation on 360 meters for one year period. which authorized operation on the 360-meter \\"entertainment\\" wavelength. This was one of the earliest broadcasting grants issued in the United States, and the first in the state of Washington. (KJR didn't receive a broadcasting station license until March 9, 1922, but maintained it should still be credited as the region's pioneer radio station, based on broadcasts dating back to 1920 made under an Experimental license.) In January 1922 the newspaper worked with the Northern Radio & Electric Company to upgrade the operations. New 100-foot (30 meter) towers were built supporting the antenna on the Post-Intelligencer building, amid ongoing plans to upgrade the transmitting power from 5 to 100 watts.\\"Huge Radiophone to Open Tonight\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, January 9, 1922, page 1.\\"Seattle's Radiophone Improved\\" by Howard S. Pyle, Radio News, March 1922, pages 833, 860. Because there was only the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters available for use by multiple broadcasting stations, each region had to set up a timesharing agreement to allocate individual timeslots. On June 23, 1922 there were three Seattle stations taking turns operating from noon to 10:30 p.m., with KFC dominating: it was allocated six timeslots totaling 6 hours.\\"Radio Broadcasts\\", Seattle Star, June 23, 1922, page 2. On September 12 the station's transmitter was further upgraded to 300 watts.\\"Broadcasting Stations' Power Increased\\", The Music Trades, September 30, 1922, page 21. For the remainder of the year the Post-Intelligencer regularly supplied a wide variety of programing for KFC. However, without explanation, the station abruptly ceased broadcasting at the end of December, and was deleted from the Commerce Department's list of stations on January 23, 1923.\\"Strike Out All Particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 1, 1923, page 7. A few months later the Post-Intelligencer worked with the Northern Radio & Electric Company to construct a new station, KFJC, but this time it was licensed to the newspaper.\\"Post-Intelligencer Radio Open Monday\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 15, 1923, page HH. KFJC made its debut broadcast on the evening of July 16, 1923\\"P.

Life  Waldtraut Lewin was born in Wernigerode, a small town on the northeastern flank of the Harz Mountains, roughly equidistant between Hanover and Leipzig. Her mother was a singer. On leaving school she enrolled at the Humboldt University of Berlin where till 1961 she studied Germanistics, Latin and Theatre studies. She worked between 1961 and 1973 as a music-dramaturge and stage director at the Regional Theatre (as it was then known) in Halle, in a team that also included Horst-Tanu Margraf and Rudolf Heinrich. Her daughter Miriam Margraf, subsequently notable in her own right as an author and music critic, was born during this period in 1964. Another achievement during the time she worked in Halle involved the translation of the libtretti of sixteen Handel operas from Italian. She was awarded the city's Handel Prize in 1970. Lewin moved in 1973 to the Rostock People's Theatre, taking a position as an opera producer and chief dramaturge for music theatre. Between 1977 and 1979 she wrote the libretto for Rosa Laub, East Germany's first rock opera, which had its premier at Rostock,Joe Schaffer: Erste Rock-Oper der DDR, In: Melodie und Rhythmus, Berlin (Ost), Heft 9/1979 although by this time Lewin was no longer among the theatre's permanent staff, having turned freelance in 1977. She published her first novel in 1973. \\"Herr Lucius und sein Schwarzer Schwan\\" is, like many of her subsequent books, an historical novel. Her next book, also an historical novel, was Die √Ñrztin von Lakros, and appeared in 1977. The focus of her professional career was as a freelance author after 1977. Her own website, consulted shortly after her death, stated that she had published around 70 titles, including twelve written jointly with her daughter. There were several biographies, notably of George Frideric Handel and of Julius Caesar. As her writing career progressed she increasingly specialised in works for younger adults and teenagers. There were also radio plays, libretti, and screen plays. Her published translations took in works previously accessible in French, Russian or Italian. Waldtraut Lewin died in May 2017 in Berlin. She had celebrated her 80th birthday \\"still in good health, in Israel\\" a few months earlier. During the closing days of the East German dictatorship officers of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) took frantic steps to destroy the records that the ministry had accumulated during the previous forty years. Angry protesters took steps to prevent the destruction of the records, which were believed to evidence forty years of domestic espionage by a principal East German government agency devoted to controlling and monitoring people in the name of \\"security\\". The Stasi were diligent in their record keeping: there were a lot of files. Many survived. It is not known how many were destroyed. The Stasi files are preserved by the Stasi Records Agency, headquartered in Berlin, accessible to scholars, journalists and others interested. Search of the Stasi archives disclosed that Between 1975 and November 1988 Waldtraut Lewin was one of several hundred thousand Stasi informers. The code name by which she is identified in Stasi files is \\"IM Wald\\". A sympathetic commentator observes dryly in an obituary piece that Waldtraut Lewin would undoubtedly have been able to come up with a better code name for herself, had she been invited to do so. The same commentator quotes another sympathetic source insisting that it abundantly is clear from the thick Stasi files on Waldtraut Lewin that no one suffered damage because of her reports on them. Nevertheless, a number of major publishers stopped publishing her works after receiving reports of her Stasi connections.  Personal  Both Waldtraut Lewin's children, Miriam Margraf and Niklas Lewin, are writers.

Similar to the Theremin, the Theremini does not require physical contact to play it. Rather, the device gauges the proximity of the performer's hands to determine the parameters of a performed note. The left hand controls the amplitude (volume), and the right hand controls the frequency (pitch). Unlike the original Theremin, this unit is designed to be easier to play, as it also features pitch correction. Physical features The mast-like pitch antenna is removable and can be securely clipped into a recessed space on the underside of the device, while the amplitude antenna is incorporated into the case design and can double as a carrying handle. A 3/8‚Äù threaded socket is provided on the base so that it can be mounted on a mic stand or tripod for interference-free playing, although the instrument can also be played on a table top. Audio output The unit features a built in speaker, although quarter inch jacks are also included to connect to a loudspeaker or amplifier. Patches The unit features pre programmed 32 patches (wave or wavetable- based patches). Control interfaces The Theremini has a single scalable CV (control voltage) output from either the pitch antenna or the amplitude antenna, enabling it to control many modular analogue synthesisers. As with most other Moog equipment a 0.25‚Äù mono jack socket is used. The device also has a single USB-based MIDI output port with two assignable control channels, one for each antenna.

The final battle of the Monmouth Rebellion, is often cited as the last battle on English soil. The local museum makes the lesser claim that it was the last \\"major battle\\" on English soil \\"when Englishmen took up arms against fellow Englishmen.\\" * Battle of Preston, Lancashire, England, 9‚Äì14 November 1715. Fought during the Jacobite Rising of 1715, it is claimed by some sources to be the last major battle to be fought on English soil; other authors regard it as a siege rather than a battle. * Clifton Moor Skirmish, Westmorland (now Cumbria), England, 18 December 1745. Also known as \\"The Battle of Clifton Moor\\", this was the last action of the Jacobite rising of 1745 to take place in England, and the last time English and Scottish armies clashed on English soil, but it is debated whether this counts as a full battle or just a \\"skirmish\\". * Battle of Culloden, Scotland, 16 April 1746. The final confrontation of the Jacobite rising of 1745, this was the last large scale pitched battle fought on British soil, and in many sources the last battle of any sort fought in Great Britain. * Battle of Fishguard, Wales, 22‚Äì24 February 1797. The most recent landing on British soil by a hostile foreign force, and thus is often referred to as the \\"last invasion of Britain\\". * Battle of Bossenden Wood, Kent, England, 31 May 1838. The battle, if it was such - some sources refer to it as an \\"armed rising\\" - was fought between a small group of labourers from the local area and a detachment of soldiers sent from Canterbury to arrest the labourers' leader. * Battle of Graveney Marsh, Kent, England, 27 September 1940. The last ground engagement involving a foreign force to take place on the mainland of Great Britain, was an encounter between the crew of a downed German aircraft and British soldiers training nearby.

Extending north and west from the junction of Colony and West Main Streets, this area was developed commercially after the arrival of the railroad line which runs just to its east. Despite some redevelopment, the historic commercial and mixed residential-commercial buildings convey the appearance of a typical late 19th or early 20th-century downtown. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Since its listing, a number of the historic buildings have been demolished. Description and history Meriden's early town center was located at the junction of Main and Broad Streets, with West Meriden a lesser center of economic activity. In 1838, the railroad line was run nearer West Meriden (after a protracted battle between competing municipal interests), kicking off a commercial development boom there. Colony Street was by 1875 lined with commercial buildings, many of which were redeveloped later in the 19th century or early 20th century in late Victorian and other styles. West Main Street was developed mainly in the early 20th century, with either single or two-story commercial blocks, or larger mixed residential-commercial buildings in a diversity of styles. The south side of West Main Street was in the mid-20th century subjected to urban renewal, resulting in the demolition of most of the older buildings there. With The historic district extends west along West Main Street as far as the YMCA building, and is limited to the north side except for a few buildings on the south side. The district extends north along Colony Street to the Gothic Revival First Congregational Church on the west side, and the former post office on the right. Much of the west side of the street has been redeveloped, while vacant lots now dot the landscape on the east side, where there once was an unbroken line of historic buildings.

The union stated that it was founded in 1858, although the Board of Trade claimed that it had been founded in 1856. It was originally named the Accrington Power Loom Weavers' Association, and worked closely with the Accrington Co-operative Society. Its founders, Richard Lord, James Parkinson and Thomas Parkinson had previously worked in Settle. By 1863, the union had 550 members, and it affiliated to the East Lancashire Amalgamated Weavers' Friendly Association. It undertook a major strike in 1878, but was defeated after nine weeks, and lost most of its membership. However, the union survived, and by 1884 it had rebuilt its strength, for the first time employing a full-time general secretary. That year, it became a founder member of the Amalgamated Weavers' Association. Membership of the union continued to grow, reaching 4,500 in 1910, the large majority of whom were women. In 1930, it simplified its name by removing the word \\"Friendly\\". It began losing members, as the Lancashire cotton industry declined, and in 1949 the Church and Oswaldtwistle Weavers', Winders' and Warpers' Association joined it, forming the Accrington, Church and Oswaldtwistle Weavers', Winders' and Warpers' Association.

Medical career  Trained in London and from 1898, she worked in a practice with her fellow student, Dr Helen Boyle in Brighton after moving from Hull and then moved on to Glasgow in 1908. Although Dr Jones initially handled the routine cases in Hove, Brighton, the clinic was focused in treating women and it was mostly female led. Jones was also noted for helping others who were sympathetic to the cause. > \\"Dr. Mabel Jones did very well in helping the boys to get over their little > colds and fevers. ... illustrate how genuine a feminist Paschal had become > between two ardent suffragists, his wife and mother, he too called on Dr. > Mabel Jones' services\\"  Queen Elisabeth Medal (Belgium)  It is reported that Jones either worked in Belgium or attended Belgian wounded in Scotland during World War I and was awarded the Queen Elisabeth Medal and this was sent on her sudden death to her medical colleague Dr Helen Boyle of Brighton  Frances Gordon's case  Jones evaluated the health state of suffragette Frances Gordon after she was released from Perth prison. A part of the report she produced was quoted in a letter to the Glasgow Evening Times: > \\"I saw her (Miss Gordon) at Midnight in July 3. Her appearance was > appalling, like a famine victim: the skin brown, her face bones standing > out, her eyes half shut, her voice a whisper, her hands quite cold, her > pulse a thread.\\" This quote and the Press exposure of pictures of women on stretchers after release from prisons led to questions in the House of Commons, giving voice to the female suffrage cause. In the book Martyrs in our Mydst, Leah Leneman openly questions the level of accuracy of Dr Jones report on Frances Gordon and also challenges the official version: > \\"Comparing the [prison] medical officer's daily reports with Frances > Gordon's story as related by Mabel Jones, it is clear that the later did > indeed contained a good deal of distortion, but a far greater distortion was > the version of the events provided by the medical officer and Chairman of > the Prison Commission to the Scottish Office\\"  Supporting other suffragettes  It is uncertain if Jones went to London to meet the Pankhursts to protest that Janie Allan was removed from the West of Scotland branch of the WSPU. The Women's Library Archive has a printed leaflet of a visit by Dr Jones to Mrs Pankhurst in a cell at the Central Police Station. She did also co-examine the gynaecological damage done by the violent use of rectal feeding on Fanny Parker and reported in the WSPU newsletters about other cases.

In 1661 she was accused of causing the collapse of a coal pit through witchcraft. Little is known about her life before that, although there are reported disputes with neighbours that allude to a quarrelsome attitude.  Background  Leslie was married to William Moffat. It is not known if they had any children. She lived in Blackcoat in the parish of Newbattle, Midlothian. She worked as a midwife and described during her trial how she used a knife and salt in a protective ritual during childbirth. Considering her advanced age, she was likely a skilful midwife. At the time of her arrest, Leslie would have been around 84 years old. There are several reports that note her as argumentative. Some reports state that she uttered curses during certain disputes, after which several women claimed to have suffered harm and loss. These likely will have contributed to her conviction. Leslie had acted as midwife for William Young and Agnes Acheson. They testified they were terrified of Leslie after their friendship had broke down; both had had nightmares that Leslie was devouring them. Indeed, when Leslie had quarreled with William Young and his wife it was \\"that same verry night, the said William Young awakened out of his sleep, in a great affrightment and sweat, crying out, that she with a number of catts wer devouring him.\\" For historian Anna Cordey \\"the fact that Leslie had been Acheson‚Äôs midwife did not make them trust and respect her once the relationship had failed; rather, it caused further unease because they were aware of her abilities.\\"  Trial  Leslie stood on trial in Dalkeith in 1661, a year in which many witches were prosecuted in the Lothians. She was tried together with five other women. The trial began on 20 July 1661 and concluded on 3 August 1661. The accusations brought against her included malefice (evil harm) and demonic witchcraft. The accusation was that two girls who had angered Leslie were killed by using witchcraft to cause the roof of a coal pit to collapse on them. The witch- pricker John Kincaid investigated Leslie by subjecting her to at least two ordeals. Firstly pricking, during which the accused was pricked with needles in several places in order to find a devil's mark. The second ordeal was the bierricht, where the accused was made to touch the corpse of their alleged victim. If upon their touch the corpse would start bleeding again, the accused was found guilty. The written records mention the two girls only bled when Leslie was made to touch their corpses. During the ordeals, Leslie confessed to meeting the devil twice, once in the shape of a brown dog and once as a young man, agreeing to be his servant and being given the new name 'Bold Leslie'. However, she claimed to not have renounced her baptism.  Execution  With the confession gathered through the ordeal she was found guilty and ordered to be executed. She was strangled and burned on 3 September 1661.  Historical significance  A few aspects of Beatrix Leslie's case are of historical significance. Firstly, her confession to a 'demonic pact', albeit as a result of her torture, and the fact she was tried as part of a group of women during a year when a great many witches were prosecuted. The nightmares experienced by Acheson and Young may be further evidence of the effect of the frightening symptoms of sleep paralysis on early modern witchcraft. Cordey also records that with Leslie's ordeal: > \\"This leads on to the issue of ‚Äòcharmers‚Äô in the sense of people who offered > their services as healers and diviners. Charmers were distinct from witches; > they were self-professed, whereas witches were labelled by others. For most > people, the local healer or charmer offered the only medical attention they > could ever hope to receive. Nevertheless, a charmer could sometimes acquire > a reputation for witchcraft.... In Dalkeith, it is clear that the > authorities saw charming as suspicious: scratch the surface and it was > likely that something more damning was going on. And charming and midwifery > seem to have been linked.\\"  References  Category:1577 births Category:1661 deaths Category:17th- century Scottish women Category:17th-century Scottish people Category:People executed for witchcraft Category:People executed by Scotland by burning Category:Midwifery in the United Kingdom Category:Scottish midwives Category:People executed by strangulation Category:Witchcraft in Scotland ","title":"Beatrix Leslie"},{"id":"57923723","text":"There is a defined process for initiatives and referendums in the District of Columbia.

Biography  Maud Galt lived in Kilbarchan, Scotland in the mid 17th century. She hid her sexual identity by marrying John Dickie, a wright. The couple lived with their two servants. Galt had a relationship with one of her servants, Agnes Mitchell. She was accused of witchcraft when Mitchell lodged a complaint against her employer at a Kirk Session in September 1649. Mitchell claimed that Galt had been: > ‚Äòabusing ane of hir servants with ane peis of clay formed lyk the secreit > member of ane man‚Äô At the Kirk Session, Mitchell presented several of their neighbours with the clay phallus Galt supposedly used on her. She stated that the shame of the 'injury done to her' had hindered her from reporting any of this to the local laird. > \\"Women throughout Europe had been burned for possession of such prostheses, > especially when used while cross-dressed. This specifically represents the > idea of ‚Äòcounterfeiting the office of husband', a type of deception in which > the woman threatened to replace the man, not only economically but > sexually\\". Two neighbours testified to Mitchell's complaint. Marion Semphill had intervened in an argument between Mitchell and Galt to discourage Mitchell going to complain to the laird. Several people also reported 'suffering misfortune' following crossing Galt, suggesting she could have been an assertive character.  Charged with witchcraft  The charges against Galt ran to several pages, with Mitchell describing multiple instances in which Galt allegedly attempted to rape several servants, and the servants of her neighbours also. Having listened to these allegations, the Privy Council abandoned the issue and decided to investigate the case under the charge of witchcraft. For historian Julian Goodare, Galt's case demonstrated \\"the shocked authorities found the idea of witchcraft easier to cope with than lesbianism.\\" The presbytery of Glasgow sent the witness testimonies and a supplication to 'the rycht honorable Comite of Estaites or Lords of His majesties Priwie Council' requesting a commission to try Maud Galt. However, there is no evidence of a commission being granted for her trial so the case may have been dropped. Yet, handling requests to try accused witches could be a lengthy process, not least as a result of uncertainty at a local level about which central government body was responsible for granting commissions. No further legal action in regards to Maud Galt is recorded. She died c. 1670.  Historical significance  Given that women were burned to death elsewhere in Europe when faced with similar allegations, Galt's case resulting in no legal ramifications in 17th century Scotland is all the more surprising and unusual. Beyond this, Brian Dempsey, Lecturer at the University of Dundee wrote for History Scotland that: > \\"Although Scotland possesses rich sources for lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or > transexual (lgbt) history, this is a sadly neglected aspect of our national > history... Women-loving women are particularly difficult to find in the > Scottish records\\". The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women only records eleven entries under 'sexuality'. Jackie Foster is the only entry positively identified as a lesbian with Maud Galt, Jane Pirie and Marianne Woods (whose story was made famous as the inspiration for Lillian Hellman's 1934 play 'The Children's Hour') \\"accused\\" of lesbianism. In this context, Galt's case has significance and \\"has the potential to inform Scottish social history in general\\".

It is a necropolis from the Late Bronze Age. The oldest tombs are from the 14th century BC, the last traces of the use were found from the end of the 13th century, the beginning of the 12th century BC. The settlement, associated with the necropolis, has not been found. Many of the burial offerings were made in the Mycenaean style, so that the Mycenaean cultural circle probably also (see also History and archaeology Pierias) extended over the border of Thessaly to Pieria.Poulaki-Pandermali, Efi.

The burial site runs from northeast to southwest direction.  Excavation history  Necropolis Spathes In 1975, the relevant archaeological authority was informed that several tombs (at least 12 to 13) were destroyed when a firebrake was cut. A bronze sword was found then. Further information revealed that trade was operated with the burial objects from this site. 1985 began trial excavations, which were continued in 1986. The excavations brought to light 34 tombs, which were partly destroyed and plundered. A part of the stolen goods was later found in the storehouse of the Archaeological Museum in Dion. In 1985, some of the stone slabs that covered the tombs were stolen by unknown culprits. A part of the slope was brought to a drop by heavy snowfalls. In the years 1987 and 1988 the slope was terraced and stabilized by a wooden construction. Near the excavation site Spathes, 1987 more tombs were discovered, presumably from the same epoch. Six stone seals were recovered from them, further excavations were not held.Poulaki- Pandermali, Efi. Makedonikos Olympos.

The type of these tombs is known from southern Greece. The length of the tombs is approximately 2.40 meters, the width 1.50 meters and the depth between one and 2.50 meters. The bottom of the tombs was covered with a 10 to 20 centimeter high clay layer, the side walls were framed with stone slabs. The graves were intact except for penetrating roots and natural deposits of the building materials. The number of buried persons found in the intact tombs is 52. It is unusual that in each of the tombs several people were buried, presumably they were family tombs. They were buried next to each other, partly also upon one another; In addition to the skeletons of adults, the remains of children were also found.Poulaki-Pandermali, Efi. Makedonikos Olympos. Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport, 2013, page 54  Finds  Bronzen Sword, found near Platamonas In addition to weapons and jewelry, the deceased was mainly given pottery. However, some of them were broken by the kind of burial of several people within the same tomb. The vessels were partly handmade, partly they were modeled with a potter's wheel. The most important finds were made in a tomb, in which apparently high ranking personalities were buried. Two skeletons, one male and one female, found themselves alongside rich burial gifts. Remnants of a spear, a bronze sword, painted and unpainted vases and perfume bottles, jewelry and stone seals (partly with animal motifs) were discovered. The sword is somewhat smaller, but resembles in the kind of swords found in Mycenae and Crete (Knossos, Heraklion). A bronze sword found in another tomb is of the same making as swords discovered in Athens, Crete, Kos and other locations. Recently, excavations on the southeast side of Olympus, to the west of Platamonas, have revealed an identical sword.

Frances was largely home schooled, though attended a finishing school in London in 1861. She first engaged with the women's rights campaign while visiting relatives in the USA in 1867-8, where she and her sister met Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1872, Frances married David Murray, a prominent Glasgow lawyer. This had followed a lengthy courting period, attributed in large part to the value she placed on her own independence. In a letter to her mother in 1867, she wrote: > \\"Indeed, here as at home, I find a woman better not have too decided views > on any matter, literature, historical, social, reform or politics, if she > wishes to be a man's favourite.

She also authored books in variety genres, including in travel and poetry.  Campaign for women's education  Frances and David Murray shared an interest in various aspects of women's rights and were supporters of the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women. Frances attended many lectures at the University of Glasgow and also delivered some on Scottish song and tradition. She wrote about how far women's rights had improved in her lifetime in terms of education: > \\"The Victorian Era burst through this bondage, and now we have schools and > colleges for girls and women\\".  Political involvement  Murray is quoted in her daughter's memoir as saying: > \\"Before I die I look forward to the fulfilment of sex equality\\". She and both her daughters were members of the Women's Freedom League. In 1910, Murray attended a suffrage demonstration in Edinburgh where she led one of the processions. She also encouraged her daughters to take up opportunities she was denied as a young woman. In a letter to Eunice, she wrote: > \\"Go ahead my daughter - you possess on both sides fighting blood.\\"  Death  Murray died in Cardross on 3 April 1919 - but she had managed to vote in the 1918 UK election, the first time women could do so.

He served in several conflicts, including World War I, and received the Distinguished Service Medal. Biography Hale was born on July 10, 1861, in Knoxville, Illinois. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1883. Hale was originally commissioned in the 12th Infantry Regiment and was stationed at Fort Niagara. He and his regiment went to Fort Bennett in 1886, and he participated in the Sioux Wars while there. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, though he ultimately did not receive it. Hale was in charge of Sioux prisoners in 1891, and he served as an aide to Wesley Merritt from 1893 to 1899, meaning he served in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He also served as an aide to Arthur MacArthur Jr. Hale commanded the 44th Volunteer infantry during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and he commanded Bilibid Prison in 1902. He also served as the acting commander of the 20th Infantry Regiment during the Battle of Luzon. After serving on the General Staff in Washington, D.C., from 1903 to 1906, Hale returned to the Philippines for another three years. In 1910 and 1911, he was the Adjutant-General of the Department of the Lakes and the Department of the Missouri. Hale commanded the 17th Infantry Regiment along the border with Mexico in 1914, and he commanded the 20th Infantry Regiment in 1915. Also in 1915, Hale was sent to China to command the 15th Infantry Regiment, though he returned shortly afterward in order to organize the 84th Division at Camp Zachary Taylor. After going to France in 1917 as a combat observer, Hale returned to the U.S. and took the 84th Division to France. Hale was promoted to the rank of major general on August 5, 1917, shortly after his promotion to brigadier general, and he received the Distinguished Service Medal for his command of the 84th Division. After World War I ended, Hale assumed command of the 26th Infantry Division and brought it back to the U.S. from France. After this, he commanded the 1st Infantry Division and then was the commanding general of the Sixth Corps Area in Chicago. Hale received an LL.D. from Knox College in 1923, and he retired in 1925. Hale lived in Palo Alto, California, or Rockville, Maryland, during his retirement, and he died on March 21, 1946. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

The reserve consists of Crown Lands in the municipalities of Gravenhurst and Muskoka Lakes. It is notable as the first dark-sky preserve in Canada and for its geological and environmental features. History In 1870, the Musquash Colonization Road was built, connecting Gravenhurst to Musquash Falls (now Bala). This road was the first in the area and some segments are still in use. However, the portion that bisects through the reserve is no longer in use and is a separate nature reserve, the Musquash Road Nature Reserve. In 1992, its significant natural values were identified, and additional studies described the aesthetic and recreational importance. In 1995, the Ministry of Natural Resources proposed to protect the area and public consultations began. The reserve was established in June 1997 under Ontario Regulation 259/97, and as a result of its favourable conditions for astronomy viewing, it was recognized as a permanent dark-sky preserve in 1999, the first in Canada. Geology Pond at the Torrance Barrens The reserve straddles the edges of the Moon River Domain (Parry Sound Terrane) and the Go Home Domain (Algonquin Terrane), structural subdivisions of the Grenville province of the Grenville orogeny. It is characterized by low elongated ridges of Precambrian bedrock with little topsoil and scattered boulders. The ridges are granitic gneisses and migmatites of varied origins, separated by wetland, ponds, and peat-filled hollows. The geology represents the Grenville Province continental accretion theme and is therefore locally significant. Environment While the Torrance Barrens are part of an intermittent band of granite barrens stretching from Eastern Ontario to Georgian Bay, it is rare this far south in Ontario, and therefore the environment and flora of the reserve are unique and distinct in its location. =Flora= The vegetation can be divided into three types: acidic rock barrens, wetlands, and upland forests. The barrens have herbaceous shrubs and graminoid heaths, with pockets of white and red pine, white and red oak, aspen and birch. The wetland consists of swamps, fen, and marshes with graminoid shrubs and peat, as well as mixed hardwood and coniferous trees. The upland forests are characterized by mature mixed coniferous and deciduous trees. In all, 463 native vascular plant species have been identified in Torrance Barrens. This includes twelve Atlantic coastal plain species which are found in Canada in only two areas and are from their home ranges. Of the 463 species, 5 are rare and threatened: lance-leaved grapefern (Botrychium lanceolatum), panic grass (Panicum spretum), southern twayblade (Listera australis), white-fringed orchid (Platanthera blephariglottis), and halberd-leaved tearthumb (Polygonum arifolium). Of the 12 Atlantic coastal plain species, there are 4 rare and threatened species: snail-seed pondweed (Potamogeton bicupulatus), Carolina yellow-eyed grass (Xyris difformis), marsh St. John‚Äôs wort (Triadenum virginicum) and Virginia meadow-beauty (Rhexia virginica). =Fauna= Smooth green snake (Opheodrys vernalis) at Torrance Barrens 94 bird species, 19 mammal species, 28 butterfly species, 8 dragonfly species, and 18 reptile/amphibian species have been identified in the reserve. Of the 18 reptile/amphibian species present, 2 are of special concern: five-lined skink (Eumeces fasciatus ‚Äì Ontario's only lizard) and eastern ribbonsnake (Thamnophis sauritus); and 3 are threatened: eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos) and Blanding‚Äôs turtle (Emydoidea blandingii). The eastern bluebird and Cooper's hawk, both rare in Canada, can be found at Torrance Barrens. Dark- sky preserve The location and topography make the Torrance Barrens a suitable location for night-time sky viewing opportunities. There is no light pollution of nearby cities, and the reserve is mostly surrounded by undeveloped private lands and other parks, allowing it to retain the natural darkness of the night. Because of its barren bedrock, telescopes and cameras can be stationed on a solid base, immune to vibrations. Furthermore, the natural open spaces and lack of surrounding high hills provide an unobstructed panorama of the sky and horizon. Owing to these favourable conditions, the Andromeda Galaxy is visible with the naked eye from the Torrance Barrens, and with a simple telescope, the cloud bands of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn can be seen.

He is known for holding the journalist Ida B. Wells and her family in bondage. There is now a museum dedicated to her in his former home the Boling‚ÄìGatewood House. He is also remembered for his grand, columned, neoclassical residential buildings and his design for the Marshall County, Mississippi Courthouse in Holly Springs. His courthouse design was also used by the firm of Willis, Sloan, and Trigg for two other courthouses and featured in the work of William Faulkner. The Walter Place mansion he designed was home to Ulysses S. Grant and his wife for a period during the American Civil War. Originally from North Carolina, Boling lived in Ohio for a while before he moved to Holly Springs in 1845. He married a woman named Nancy who was originally from Virginia. Walter Place In 1858‚Äì1860, Harvey Washington Walter commissioned Boling for Walter Place, a mansion in Holly Springs, Mississippi. After the Civil War, one of his former slaves, Jim Wells (who was still living on the Boling property with his family), moved his carpentry business across the street after Boling urged him to vote for Democrats. Boling built and operated the Johnson‚Äôs Mill distillery at Randolph‚Äôs Springs behind his house where Spring Hollow Park is now located. Willis, Sloan, and Trigg was a short-lived partnership that contracted the courthouse as well as others. According to local preservationist Phillip Knecht, he also designed Montrose (Holly Springs, Mississippi) (1858) Athenia (1858), Wakefield (1858), and Pointer House (c. 1858 and eventually demolished). Before it was converted into an armory for the production and repair of guns, the Jones, McElwain and Company Iron Foundry in Holly Springs produced wrought iron adornments including gates and fittings that were used in some of the area's grand homes such as Boling's. In 2018 a monument was added to his gravesite at Hillcrest Cemetery by Hubert McAlexander, a historian, author, and emeritus professor of literature at the University of Georgia.

Fearing further industrial action, E. J.

It has been published weekly since its inception in 1929, and covers east Linn County. News historian George S. Turnbull opined in his 1939 History of Oregon Newspapers that despite the city's small size, the paper had been \\"lively and well made up.\\"  Regional renown  At the time of the New Era's founding, the Sweet Home had already attracted attention outside its immediate area. Turnbull noted the columns of Mrs. Ole M. Feigum, a \\"wide-eyed country correspondent\\" chronicling the local habitat, who had served for several years as a correspondent to Portland's much larger Oregonian, and who later earned national recognition as a \\"country correspondent.\\" In covering the New Era's launch, the Oregonian challenged the New Era to live up to Feigum's having \\"given renown to her dwelling place.\\" Newspapers from larger population centers in Oregon have continued to cite the New Era's coverage of the Sweet Home area since its establishment. The Oregonian cited the New Era's coverage of a local Stewart Holbrook speech, in analyzing the controversial nature of the writer's advocacy around migration to Oregon. Its publishers and journalists have been quoted numerous times by neighboring papers, as experts on Sweet Home news. New Era publisher Alex Paul was interviewed about his economic predictions for the region in 2000, and a 2017 story revisited that interview. Many smaller examples span recent decades.  Founding and ownership  The New Era was the first newspaper to take hold in Sweet Home. Prior to the founding of the New Era, the Intermountain Tribune was briefly based in Sweet Home in 1913 to 1914. Owner T. L. Dugger moved it there from Lebanon, and later moved it again to Scio. G. H. Crusen founded the New Era in 1929, as a weekly four page paper. John T. Russell was the publisher as of 1939; Turnbull identified his principal goal as preserving the town during the planning of dams for the Willamette Valley hydroelectric project. Russell, who had previously been in the newspaper business in Ohio, owned the paper until 1946, including a period of partnership with Dave MacMillan. William L. Dudley and A. E. Macoubrie were the publishers from 1946 to 1970, and later publishers included John & Jack Nelson, Connie Johnson, and David O. Cooper. In the late 1960s, \\"journalistic maverick\\" Bill Wickland served as the paper's editor, running a provocative column called \\"The Wacky World of Bill Wickland.\\" Circulation increased 25% in his first six months. But he was considered a \\"crazy radical,\\" and was dismissed after a change in management. Alex and Debra Paul bought the paper from the Coopers in 1985. Scott and Miriam Swanson bought the paper from the Pauls in 2005. Alex Paul went on to serve on the Linn-Benton Community College Foundation Board, and to work as a journalist at the Albany Democrat-Herald.

Career Baldwin was primarily known for his work in costume design for theatre, film and TV in the UK. His earliest known screen credit as a costume designer/consultant was for a 1963 TV adaptation of the play A Hole in the Head. His subsequent screen credits include the costumes for The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus (1968), the 1973 Vincent Price black comedy Theatre of Blood, the 1972 Bette Davis film Madame Sin, and numerous British TV series including Special Branch (1973), Within These Walls (1974), Mind Your Language (1978), Dick Turpin (1979), the sci-fi miniseries Quatermass (1979), an episode of Tales of the Unexpected (1980), the children's fantasy series Worzel Gummidge (1981), for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award, and the movie-length pilot of the cult TV series Max Headroom (1985). One of his last screen credits as a costume designer was for the Richard Stanley sci-fi film Hardware (1990). Baldwin also worked on the London theatre and burlesque scene as a writer, costume designer, director, actor and artist, as well as working in the theatrical agency business. He directed an erotic short film called Bronze and was a second unit director on the Australian WWII historical drama series Tanamera ‚Äì Lion of Singapore (1989). Music video work Baldwin worked extensively on the burgeoning UK pop music video scene of the 1980s, frequently acting as the costume designer for videos directed by Australian filmmaker Russell Mulcahy, who later formed the prominent video production partnership MGMM. In addition to his celebrated design work, however, Baldwin gradually acquired a peculiar pop-culture notoriety (albeit anonymous) because he began making cameo appearances in some of the music videos on which he was working. Baldwin in effect became a kind of visual \\"trademark\\" of the Mulcahy/MGMM videos; he can be easily recognised in nearly all his appearances by his receding grey hair, grey beard, and glasses, and he was repeatedly cast in authority roles such as a judge, a teacher, or a parent. However, his identity remained unknown to the general public until a year after his death, when writer Christopher Belkin published an article about him on the Dangerous Minds website, in which Baldwin was finally identified. One of Baldwin's first known appearances in a pop video was in Ultravox's \\"Vienna\\" in 1980. Between 1980 and 1983 he is known to have appeared as a featured extra in at least nineteen different Mulcahy/MGMM music videos, including Bonnie Tyler's \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\", Billy Joel's \\"Pressure\\", and ABC's \\"The Look of Love\\".

She is known as Madam Winge and was, alongside Else Hansen, one of only two women known to have been long term lovers of the king. Bregnsbo, Michael (2014) Til venstre h√•nd: Danske kongers elskerinder(Copenhagen: Gyldendal A/S) Biography Charlotte Amalie Winge was the widow of a priest when she became the lover of the king in 1762 during the time of his marriage to Queen Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. According to a traditional story, the king met Winge dressed as an Amazon on a walk at Bregentved manor, where he was staying with Lord Chamberlain Adam Gottlob Moltke. King Frederick brought her back to Copenhagen as his mistress, installing her in a house at Vandkunsten. If so, Moltke was likely the one arranging the meeting. Winge is not believed by author and playwright Dorothea Biehl (1731-1788) to have participated in the famously decadent Bacchus parties (Bacchusfesterne) of the king, but rather was seen as someone who could ease the king's mind and nurse him during his decreasingly ill health. It is noted that during the king's illness, Queen Juliane Maria often found Winge nursing the king when she came to tend to his health. Just as with the rest of Frederick's lovers, Winge was not an official mistress introduced at court, nor did she have any influence on state affairs. However, in contrast to most other lovers of the king, Winge managed to make him hand out favors to her relatives, and he gave her sister a pension, made her brother-in-law an official, and protected her two nephews in their careers was officers. The relationship between the king and Winge lasted until the king's death in 1766. After the death of the king, Charlotte Amalie Winge was granted a pension as long as she stayed unmarried.

He showed top-class form as a two-year-old in 1882 when he won the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket and the Prince of Wales's Stakes at York. In the following year he won the 2000 Guineas and then ran third when favourite for the Epsom Derby. His performances in these two races led to some questions regarding the integrity of his regular jockey Fred Archer. At Ascot Racecourse he recorded a hat-trick of wins when he took the Prince of Wales's Stakes, St James's Palace Stakes and Triennial Stakes. He was strongly fancied for the St Leger but his racing career was ended by injury. He had some influence as a breeding stallion through his son War Dance and his daughter Black Duchess. Background Galliard was a \\"very handsome\\" brown horse bred and owned by Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth. He was trained throughout his racing career by the veteran Mathew Dawson at the Heath House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. His sire Galopin was an outstanding racehorse who won the Derby in 1872 and went on to be a successful and influential stallion, being Champion sire on three occasions. Galopin sired numerous major winners, including St Simon, Disraeli, Galeottia and Donovan. Galliard's dam Mavis also produced the influential broodmare Rattlewings. Racing career =1882: two-year-old season= Galliard made his racecourse debut in the ¬£1370 Chesterfield Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 July and started the 4/6 favourite against six opponents. He had shown great promise in training and was described as \\"well-made\\" with \\"a deal of quality\\". Ridden by Fred Archer he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"in a canter\\" by one and a half lengths from the Duke of Hamilton's colt Export. Despite not having fully recovered from a respiratory infection, the colt returned to the track on 22 August when he was an easy winner of the ¬£1002 Prince of Wales's Stakes at York Racecourse. In the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September he started 3/1 second favourite behind Macheath, the winner of the July Stakes. With Archer again in the saddle he was always towards the rear and came home last of the five runners as the race was won by the filly Hauteur (later to win the 1000 Guineas). =1883: three-year-old season= Spring Fred Archer, Galliard's regular jockey In the spring of 1883, Galliard was regarded as a leading contender for both the 2000 Guineas and the Derby in what appeared to be a very open year. His reputation was enhanced when his stable companion Grandmaster, whom he had beaten \\"out of sight\\" in a private trial, ran out a decisive winner of the Craven Stakes at Newmarket in mid-April. On 25 April, over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket, Galliard was one of fifteen colts to contest the 75th running of the 2000 Guineas which took place in fine weather and attracted a very large crowd. Highland Chief started 11/4 favourite with Galliard, ridden by Archer, next in the betting on 9/2: he may have started favourite but for \\"ominous rumours\\", including the suggestion that Archer had place a wager on Highland Chief, who was trained by his brother Charley. The best fancied of the other runners were The Prince (11/2), Chislehurst (6/1) and Goldfield (100/9). Dawson opted to saddle his charge at the Ditch stable, thereby avoiding the noise and distractions of the \\"Birdcage\\" paddock. Galliard started well, but was restrained by Archer as the 100/1 outsider Auctioneer went to the front and opened up a huge lead. Auctioneer gave way to Montroyd three furlongs from the finish before Galliard gained the lead entering the last quarter mile with Goldfield and The Prince close behind. Goldfield took the advantage a furlong out but Galliard rallied strongly and after a \\"magnificent race\\" and a \\"desperate finish\\" he prevailed by a head from Goldfield with The Prince a neck away in third. Summer Galliard was stepped up in distance for the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 23 May and was made the 7/2 favourite against ten opponents. In the build-up to the race he had been closely guarded around the clock amid fears that he would be \\"got at\\" (deliberately attacked and injured) by parties who stood to lose financially if he won. Galliard was not among the early leaders but moved into second place behind St. Blaise as the field approached the final turn. He kept on well in the straight but was unable to overhaul the leader and lost second place to Highland Chief inside the furlong. He finished third, beaten a neck and half a length. As in the 2,000 Guineas there were \\"plentiful\\" rumours that Fred Archer had backed his brother's horse, this time to the tune of ¬£500. One report claimed that Galliard could have won the race but that Archer \\"stopped riding\\" when Highland Chief's challenge materialised. At Royal Ascot in June Galliard was in exceptional form, winning three races worth a total of ¬£4,121. On the opening day he started the 9/4 second favourite behind Lord Bradford's Laocoon for the ¬£2,675 Prince of Wales's Stakes over one mile and five furlongs. After turning into the straight in third place he took the lead a furlong out and won \\"in the commonest of canters\\" by a length from the Duke of Hamilton's Ossian (later to win the St Leger) with Laocoon a further three lengths back in third. He conceded 12 pounds in weight to the second and third. Two days later he reappeared for the ¬£1,650 St James's Palace Stakes over one mile and started at odds of 1/7 against two opponents. He took the lead in the straight and won very easily by length from Padlock with Potosi a distant third. In the Triennial Stakes (now the Jersey Stakes) over seven furlongs he won at odds of 4/7. Autumn Following his triumphs at Ascot, Galliard was installed as the 3/1 favourite in the ante-post betting for the St Leger. The colt, however, developed problems in training and by August he was restricted to walking exercise. He was withdrawn shortly before the race owing to what was described as \\"a weakness in his back tendons\\". In October it was announced that Galliard had been retired from racing and would be retired to stud. Stud record Galliard stood as a breeding stallion in England before moving to France, and later to Germany in 1895. His offspring included Gulliver (Richmond Stakes, Hardwicke Stakes), Beowulf (Bayerisches Zuchtrennen), Griffin (Mehl-M√ºlhens-Rennen), War Dance (Prix de Meautry) and Black Duchess (dam of Bay Ronald). War Dance sired Perth who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris before becoming the Leading sire in France on three occasions. Galliard was euthanized in Germany in 1903. Pedigree *Galliard was inbred 4 √ó 4 to both Birdcatcher and Voltaire, meaning that both of these stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Generally, rocks which are hidden are intended to be picked up, photographed and put on Facebook, and then re-hidden in a different spot. However, different rock groups may have different ideas; some might be asked to be taken as far as possible, and others hidden in the same city or general region. The Kindness Rocks Project encourages people to set up community Inspiration gardens. The painting rock trend was revived during the COVID-19 pandemic. = #Islastones = #Islastones was a rock-painting movement in support of Isla Tansey, a girl diagnosed with DIPG, a terminal cancer. Isla asked people to paint stones with the hashtag #islastones, take photos of them, and hide them. Isla died on July 10, 2018 at the age of 7, less than a year after her diagnosis.  International Drop a Rock Day  International Drop a Rock Day is an unofficial holiday celebrated on July 3rd, in which people are encouraged to leave a painted rock in a public space.  Reception  Some parks have objected to people leaving painted rocks on their grounds, including the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

The first musical unit of the Hellenic Navy was formed in January 1890 and consisted of 22 musicians who enlisted as volunteers. The unit became a permanent member of the Flagship of the Fleet. After the Balkan Wars, the number of musicians increased through the expansion of the navy and the enlistment of new volunteers as a result. In August 1925, the School of Musicians and Buglers was founded at the Administration Directorate of the Salamis Naval Base. From 1932 until 1936 the School of music was transferred on Poros, only to be transferred back to Salamis from in 1936, where it would stay until 1941, just before the Battle of Greece. During the Second World War and the Axis occupation of Greece, the band followed the Greek fleet's exodus to the Middle East, installed on the Ionia passenger ship (until 1943) and on the Greek cruiser Georgios Averof (from 1943 onwards). In 1946, the School moved to the Palaska Training Centre in Skaramanga, where it has remained until today.

It was first headed by Da Lam Tserenchimed, who later on became the first Prime Minister of Mongolia. In 1934, by resolution of the Council of People‚Äôs Ministers, the rules of procedure of the State Internal Security Protection stipulated that all security threat protection activities on the territory of the state shall be conducted by aforementioned laws. In the mid-1930s, Prime Minister Peljidiin Genden balked at recommendations by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to elevate the Committee of Internal Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic, at least 26 percent of whose staff were agents of the Soviet NKVD at the time, to an independent cabinet-level ministry. Frustrated by Genden's disobedience, Stalin promoted Marshal Khorloogiin Choibalsan as the new Minister of Internal Affairs. In March 1936, Choibalsan's Interior Ministry orchestrated the firing of his government and the removal Genden from the post of First Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party, due to his role in the deterioration of Mongol‚ÄìSoviet relations. Due to his status and the power of his opponents, namely the new head of government Anandyn Amar, Choibalsan and likewise the Ministry of Internal Affairs became the de facto most powerful body the country.Sanders, Alan J. K., Historical Dictionary of Mongolia, 1996, . Just two months later the ministry amended its rules to include the detention high ranking politicians and public figures without first consulting any of its party or political superiors, effectively increasing its influence over the country. Under the direction and guidance Choibalsan's Soviet handler Chopyak and other mentors from the NKVD, the ministry planned over the next three years to carry out the repressive purges on opponents of Stalin/Choibalsan, religious figures (mostly Buddhist Lamas) and enemies of the state.Baabar 1999, p. 353 Notable Russian aides to the ministry included Deputy NKVD Commissar Mikhail Frinovsky and NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov. When the purges ended, official blame was laid on the deputy minister of internal affairs Nasantogtoh, and his Soviet handler Kichikov. The Interior Ministry was later replaced by the Ministry of Public Security. The Ministry of Public Security of the MPR served as a catalyst for the republic's paramilitary forces, which totalled around 30,000 men by 1955.

Brown was highly successful at recruitment, raising membership to more than 12,000 by 1871. The union also affiliated to the more radical Amalgamated Association of Miners, although Brown personally favoured avoiding industrial disputes. By 1874, the price of coal had fallen, along with miners' wages, and union membership. Brown faced criticism for not taking a cut in his own wages. Some lodges left the union, but Brown kept the majority together, reorientating it back towards the MNA. In 1886, the union was a founder constituent of the Midland Counties Miners' Federation, and through this became an affiliate of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). Membership reached a peak of 16,709 in 1907, then gradually fell.

He wrote against the Union of Lyons, at first anonymously, then, when the union was abrogated under Emperor Andronikos II, he took an active part in the synods that enforced a restoration of Orthodoxy. Under Patriarch Gregory II of Constantinople (Gregory of Cyprus, 1283-1289), Moschabar served as chartophylax, i.e., patriarchal secretary, but, because of disagreements between him and the patriarch, he stepped down from that office and worked to bring about Gregory's resignation. Nothing certain is known about the years either of George Moschabar's birth or of his death, though he is last heard from in 1289, and by that time he was already an old man. Nor is it known where he was born. The name Moschabar is not of Greek derivation, which has led some to speculate that he was of Turkish or Semitic extraction.Laurent 1929, pp. 130-131Moniou, pp. 32-37. He also seems to have borne the name \\"Psyllos\\" or \\"Psilates.\\" He was often referred to, ironically, as \\"the philosopher\\" or \\"the Aristotelian.\\"  Works  Most of George Moschabar's works are polemical, aimed at combating the ecclesiastical union between Greeks and Latins agreed to at Lyons in 1274 and, in particular, condemning the doctrine of the Filioque. The following works are extant, although most of them remain unpublished: * A. Two dialogues, one with a Dominican, one with a Greek unionist, on the procession of the Holy Spirit. These were published anonymously during the 1270's. The dialogue with the Latin was reprinted in 1627 in Constantinople; in that publication, the work was ascribed to a contemporary Greek bishop named Maximos Margounios, who plagiarized Moschabar. * B. A work Against the Pneumatomachians, also published anonymously, probably in 1279 or 1280. In it, Moschabar equates supporters of union with fourth-century heretics who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit. John Bekkos, who was patriarch of Constantinople at the time and who supported the union, got hold of a copy of the treatise and wrote a refutation of it. * C. Antirrhetic Chapters against the Writings and Teachings of Bekkos, a work of 33 chapters, published in August 1281 under the patronage of Gregory, Patriarch of Jerusalem. In this work, for the first time, Moschabar felt safe enough to publish openly, affixing his own name to the treatise. It has recently been edited by Demetra I. Moniou. John Bekkos wrote a refutation of at least part of this work; he mentions particularly his reply to ch. 16, in which Moschabar gives an interpretation of Revelation 22:1. This refutation has not survived. * D. A critique of the authenticity of a phrase from St. John of Damascus's On the Orthodox Faith, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÄœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøŒªŒµ·Ω∫œÇ Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ ŒõœåŒ≥ŒøœÖ ·ºêŒ∫œÜŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫Œø·ø¶ Œ†ŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, \\"and the producer, through the Word, of the manifesting Spirit,\\" a phrase which had been appealed to by the unionists at the Synod of Blachernae in 1285 in defense of the orthodoxy of their position. Moschabar rejected the text as inauthentic. He wrote his critique probably before the end of 1286; an edition of it was published by Chrysostomos Sabbatos in 1998. * E. A declaration, acknowledging the orthodoxy of Patriarch Gregory II on condition that he step down from office, which was written in 1289 References  Literature   Makarov, Dmitry I. \\"The thirteenth- century prerequisites of St. Gregory Palamas' theology ,\\" Parr√©sia 9-10 (2015-2016), 99-112. * Margounios, Maximos ŒîŒπŒ¨ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒúŒ±ŒæŒØŒºŒøœÖ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒúŒ±œÅŒ≥ŒøœÖŒΩŒØŒøœÖ, œÑŒ±œÄŒµŒπŒΩŒø·ø¶ ŒöœÖŒ∏ŒÆœÅœâŒΩ ·ºêœÄŒπœÉŒ∫œåœÄŒøœÖ (Constantinople, 1627). * Moniou, Demetra I.

Pre World War II During the earliest days of McGregor, Texas, the future site of Bluebonnet Ordnance was the crossroads of two railroads in 1879 (Santa Fe Railroad and the Cotton Belt Railroad). The site that would become the plant had fertile, rich soil which contributed to its usages years later. Gradually the McGregor area grew by over 1200 citizens in the 1920s setting the foundation for the founding of the plant a decade later. World War II As the United States engaged in World War II, existing plants and equipment were considered for conversion to directly support the war effort. The National Gypsum Company of Buffalo successfully lobbied the United States War Department to purchase their 18,000 acre facility located near McGregor, Texas for the construction and operation of a munitions plant. On March 7, 1942; National Gypsum executives worked with Army engineers in Waco, Texas, to come up with the design and construction of the plant. The offices that were set up for this endeveour was located in the Armory and in the Waco library. The plant was operated by the National Gypsum Company but overseen by the military and was one of the four Ordnance plants in the United States during World War II. The army engineers were in charge of all plant construction while the Gypsum personnel and others worked out other strategies. Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant got its name from Major Paul Van Tuyl, who named the plant after the state flower of Texas (Bluebonnet). The munitions plant started production of bombs on October 16, 1942. Over 1100 automobiles and trucks went to and from the plant each day, taking workers to and from the plant. Many of the workers at the plant were from out of state, and even out of the region. The plant primarily manufactured TNT and ammonium nitrate used to fill bomb casings which were manufactured elsewhere. Production was focused on three bomb types: armor piercing, general purpose and fragmentation. Bluebonnet also produced other ordnance products, including 105-mm semi-fixed high explosive shells, bomb booster charges, and demolition blocks. At maximum production, the plant employed 5,732 workers. The plant ceased production on August 14, 1945. Post war After the war, the facilities were converted to support the development and manufacture of ammonium nitrate based solid rocket propellants and operated by a number of successive companies: Phillips Petroleum Company (1952‚Äì1958), Astrodyne Incorporated (1958‚Äì1959), Rocketdyne (1959‚Äì1978), and Hercules Inc. (1978‚Äì1995). In 1995 Hercules transferred their operations to the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory in West Virginia, ending the manufacture of energetic materials at the site. The overall size of the former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant was reduced over time by the rededication of land to agricultural research and conversion into an industrial park. The now defunct Beal Aerospace established rocket engine testing facilities within the remaining portion before going out of business in October, 2000. The upgraded facilities are now used by SpaceX as their Rocket Development and Test Facility. Some of the wood from the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant was used in the construction of a pizzeria in Waco in 2016.

It shares similarities with the better-known medal table found at most multi-sport events, but goes beyond the top three performers and assigns weighted scores to each athlete based on their overall final placing, then aggregates the scores of all athletes in a team to provide a final team standing. This system is most commonly found in the sport of athletics: both the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and European Athletics release placing tables for the major championships they organise. A typical system awards a decreasing number of points for the top eight finishers, with eight points for first place, down to one point for eighth place. Non-finishers and disqualified athletes typically receive zero points.European Athletics Indoor Championships - Glasgow 2019. European Athletics.

Hiraoka later moved to the United States in 1963 and eventually obtained American citizenship. In 1978, Hiraoka was awarded Japan's Order of the Sacred Treasure, 4th Class (Gold Rays with Rosette).

Family Born at Rempstone Hall in Purbeck, Dorset, Calcraft was the son of John Calcraft and Elizabeth n√©e Hales (daughter of Sir Thomas Hales, and the brother of Granby Calcraft. He married Lady Caroline Katherine Montagu, daughter of William Montagu and Lady Susan Gordon, in 1828, and they had three sons and four daughters, including: John Hales Montagu (1831‚Äì1868); Susan Charlotte (1833‚Äì1892); William Montagu (1834‚Äì1901); Henry George (1836‚Äì1896); and Georgiana Emily (died 1915). Upon his marriage, his father granted him an allowance of ¬£1,000 a year and allowed him to reside at Rempstone. Political career Elected to gentleman's club Brooks's in 1817, Calcraft was brought into Parliament for the first time at his father's borough of Wareham. Sitting as a Tory alongside his father (who was a Whig), he was described by Sir James Mackintosh as a \\"very sensible young man\\" and held the seat until 1826, although he often divided with the Whigs. However, his early parliamentary career was somewhat inactive with illness affecting his ability to vote on several occasions. Despite this, he voted against William Wilberforce's compromise motion on the Queen Caroline affair in 1820, for parliamentary reform in 1822, against the Irish unlawful societies bill in 1825, and for alteration for the corn laws in 1825. He had just one intervention during this period of his career, presenting a petition of the journeymen fishmongers of Westminster, who wanted to sell fish after 10:00. Falling ill again in early 1826, he retired from the seat. In 1828, he became deputy Postmaster General of the United Kingdom to his father, and then began to take part in local affairs, chairing the anniversary meeting of the Wareham Church Missionary Society in August of the same year. While he did not stand for election at Wareham again in 1830 or 1831, his brother Granby was elected a Whig MP for the seat in the later year. Following his father's suicide in late 1831, Calcraft returned to parliament in the same seat in 1832 as an \\"anti-reformer\\" and, becoming a Conservative in 1834, held the seat until 1841 when he was defeated. He once more returned to the seat, this time as a Whig, in 1857, and held the seat until the next general election in 1859 when he did not seek re-election. Later life After leaving parliament, Calcraft became High Sheriff of Dorset from 1867 to 1868, with his eldest son John Hales Montagu serving as Liberal Liberal MP for Wareham from 1865 to 1868, and his third son, Henry George, becoming permanent secretary to the Board of Trade from 1886 to 1893. Calcraft died in 1880 at St George Hanover Square, London, and was noted by The Times as a \\"fine example of the country gentleman and the squire\\", while the writer Jane Ellen Panton in 1909 said he was \\"one of the most old men that I have ever seen\\". His estate was inherited by his eldest surviving son, William Montagu.

The boat badge is in the shape of a boar and is in the collection of the National Maritime Museum.Official boat badge of HMS Tilbury, National Maritime Museum. Retrieved 17 July 2018. Design and construction The S-class were intended as a fast ( destroyer for service that would be cheaper than the large V-class destroyers that preceded them and so able to be ordered in large numbers. The ships were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . They displaced normal and deep load. Three Yarrow boilers fed Parsons geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, and generated , giving the required 36 knot speed. The design gun armament of the S-class was three guns and a single 2-pounder (40 mm) \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun. Torpedo armament was four torpedo tubes in two twin rotating mounts on the ships' centreline and two tubes at the break of the forecastle for easily aimed snap-shots in close action. The ship had a crew of 90 officers and men. On 23 June 1917, the Admiralty placed an order for 36 S-class destroyers under the Twelfth War Programme as a follow-on to the 33 S-class destroyers ordered in May that year under the Eleventh War Programme. Tilbury, one of three S-class destroyers ordered from Swan Hunter in the Twelfth War Programme, was laid down at their Wallsend shipyard in November 1917. She was launched on 17 June 1918 and completed on 17 September 1918. Service On commission, Tilbury was sent to the Mediterranean, and was at Mudros in the Aegean Sea at the end of the war. Tilbury continued as part of the Sixth Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet through 1919. The Royal Navy had a surplus of modern destroyers following the First World War, and by October 1920, Tilbury was listed as in reserve at the Nore. In 1923, she was in reserve at Portsmouth and in June 1928 was in Maintenance Reserve at Rosyth. Tilbury was sold to the shipbreakers Ward in February 1931 for scrapping at their Llanelly yard.

Sutton (syns. Diplodia maydis (Berk.) Sacc. and D. zeae (Schwein.) L√©v.) is a plant pathogenic fungus and causal organism of diplodia ear and stalk rot. Corn (Zea mays) and canes (Arundinaria sp.) are the only known hosts to date. No teleomorph of the fungus is known. Stenocarpella maydis can significantly reduce yield or grain quality (see ‚Äì Symptoms and Signs) as there is a decrease on kernel size, and lower test weight. If infection occurs early, some ears may not produce harvestable grain or seed vigor can be compromised. Delayed harvest and wet weather before harvest can allow fungal growth to continue, further reducing grain marketability. Further, some animals may reject contaminated corn-based feed. Stenocarpella rot has the potential to affect distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) composition, but not ethanol yield on an equivalent weight basis. Although not common, when the conditions are conducive, this organism can produce mycotoxins (see ‚Äì Importance), toxic compounds to mammals. Symptoms and signs If the corn plant becomes infected soon after flowering, the husks appear bleached to straw color. Mycelial growth on corn ears typically begin at the base of the ear. In advanced stages of disease, this can result in a light-weight mummified ears attributed to the release of extracellular hydrolytic activities of acid protease, xylanases, and cellulases. During late season, this ascomycete on the plant can be recognized by the production of small raised, black fungal reproductive structures (pycnidia) on infected kernels, cob, husks, or stalks giving it an irregular feeling when touched. When infection happens several weeks after flowering, ears may be asymptomatic, with a possible brown discoloration, or seldom show mycelium between kernels. Some isolates may cause premature germination of the corn kernels. In stalk infections, injury to the vascular system disrupts translocation and, thus, reduces grain size. Biology and epidemiology S. maydis overwinters on diseased plant debris (husks, stalks). During wet conditions, flask-shaped pycnidia embedded on debris produces two-celled conidia. Diplodia ear rot takes place when conidia are spread via rain and wind into the plant during early silking until two to three weeks after silks start to senesce. Alternatively, conidia can penetrate husks, typically at the base of the ear. Fungal growth is most common during milk, dough and dent stages. Diplodia stalk rot takes place mainly in the crown, mesocotyl, roots, and less frequently on the nodes between the crown and the ear. For both diseases, points of entry are facilitated by pest (e.g. bird, insect) damage, predisposing the host. Earworm (Helicoverpa zea) damage at the ear shank is often associated with the disease. Diplodia rot is most severe for mono cropping systems, or when wet weather occurs shortly after silking, particularly for susceptible corn varieties with upright ears and tight husks. S. maydis occurs in cool, humid temperate areas, whereas the closely related S. macrospora, with similar symptoms but whose only host is corn, tend to happen in warm, humid zones. File:Corn Diplodia disease cycle Crop Protection Network.jpg Corn Diplodia disease cycle Crop Protection Network Worldwide incidence The incidence of Diplodia ear and stalk rots is dependent of climatic factors. Epidemics have been associated with early droughts and late season rains. The incidence of infected corn in the field may range from 1-2% or as high as 75-80%. Some regions throughout the globe associated with Stenocarpella maydis include: * North America: Canada, Mexico (unconfirmed), USA (Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, South Dakota). * Central America: Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras * South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador * European and Mediterranean region: Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Russia * Africa: Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Zaire, Zimbabwe * Asia: China (widespread), India (unconfirmed), Iran, Taiwan * Oceania: Australia (New South Wales) Management =Cultural control= * Timely planting: Alternate planting dates when possible. Spreading silk dates will reduce the risk of Diplodia infection. * Crop rotation: Alternate non-host crops at least one year out of corn to decrease the presence of the pathogen resting structures in subsequent seasons. * Tillage: Removal/Degradation of corn residues during the fall can help reduce disease levels. * Irrigation timing: Overhead irrigation can splash disperse S. maydis spores from infected corn plants to adjacent healthy plants. * Grain drying and selection: Prior to storage, dry grain below 13-15% to halt mold growth. Prior to storage, clean dried grain by removing lighter, damaged kernels, cobs and fines. Routinely screen grain and store the most infected grain separately to reduce disease spread. * Others: Burying corn residue provides some degree of disease control. Cool infected grain below 50 ¬∞F (19 ¬∞C) soon after harvest and store at 30 ¬∞F (-1.1 ¬∞C) to delay the development of infection. =Host resistance= Corn hybrids vary in their susceptibility to S. maydis. Flint cultivars are more resistant than dent, and resistance breeding offers promise for control, however complete resistance (immunity) is not available. Some seed suppliers offer Diplodia rot resistance ratings for their hybrids. Further, resistance to insects can reduce damage and disease severity. Genetic resistance to Diplodia stalk rot is highly correlated with resistance to Gibberella stalk rot. =Chemical control= The potential benefits of fungicides to control Diplodia rot remain ambiguous. It is recommended to apply fungicides when foliar disease is evident at high levels to help minimize stalk damage during grain fill. Some experimental findings include: *Propiconazole and prothioconazole show promising results on a laboratory scale in reducing fungal growth under controlled conditions. In field applications, however, neither has shown successful Diplodia rot reduction. *Benomyl (Benlate) and mancozeb (Dithane M-45) have shown a degree of effectiveness in controlling S. maydis in the Nigerian Savanna. * A triazole product and a QoI strobilurin + triazole mix product tested by researchers at Purdue University did not consistently reduce disease severity. =Biological control= While not as commonly used as the previously described management strategies, several studies show promising results with a biocontrol approach. Examples follow: * Two Streptomyces sp. Isolates, designated DAUFPE 11470 and DAUFPE 14632, isolated from corn rhizosphere soil, significantly reduced S. maydis incidence by 93.2% and 92.3%, respectively. * Strains of Pseudomonas spp., P. fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, and Bacillus subtilis inhibited the development of this fungus for the production of compounds with antifungal activity. Importance Examples of Diplodia toxins. Structures of: A) diplodiatoxin, B) diplonine, C) stachydrine (proline betaine), D) chaetoglobosin K, E) chaetoglobosin L, F) chaetoglobosin O, G) chaetoglobosin M S. maydis is capable of producing mycotoxins, but no case has been reported regarding Diplodia rot in the United States and Canada. However, there have been some mycotoxicoses (Diplodiosis) in South America and Africa due to this fungus. This manifests as a nervous disorder (neuromycotoxicosis), characterized by neurological disorders such as ataxia, paralysis, and liver damage in farm animals fed or grazing on S. maydis-infected corn. Further, Diplodia-infected corn used in the chicken broiler and egg laying industries has resulted in reduced performance. Mycotoxins produced by this phytopathogen include diploidiatoxin, chaetoglobosins, and diplonine, to which all associated with diplodiosis. Moreover, Chaetoglobosin K has potential as an antifungal.

Following his completion of the painting, Vereshchagin dedicated his work \\"to all great conquerors, past, present and to come\\". Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a pile of skulls outside the walls of a city in Central Asia. It is considered part of Vereshchagin's Turkestan Series.  History  = Background = The Apotheosis of War was painted by Russian war artist Vasily Vereshchagin in 1871. At the time, Vereshchagin was residing in Munich, Germany, where he painted 13 works (including Apotheosis) of art depicting his earlier travelling with the Imperial Russian Army as it moved throughout Central Asia, fighting against various factions and conquering what would become Russian Turkestan. As a classically-trained war artist, many of Vereshchagin's works were centered around battle scenes between the Russian army and the forces of the Khanates of Khiva and Kokand. = Description = Apotheosis depicts a pile of human skulls set on the barren earth, the aftermath of a battle or siege. A flock of carrion birds are seen to be occupied with picking over the pile; some birds have already landed, while others are flying in or roosting in nearby trees. The ground below them is a sallow, earthy yellow covered with grass, complementing the dirty ivory color of the partially-bleached skulls. The shadow cast by the mound, coupled with the many black orifices created by empty jaws and eye- sockets, adds a sense of depth to the painting, further exacerbating the scale of the deathly pile. A range of mountains serves as a dividing line for the painting, separating the vastness of the steppes from the emptiness of the sky, while the city of Samarkand can be seen in the far right of the painting. The city's walls have visibly been breached, a reference to the Siege of Samarkand in the summer of 1868 in which the Russian garrison repulsed a Bukharid attack.Shahrisabz, Katti-Kurgan, Hussein Bek of Urgut, Omar Bek of Chilek, Jura Bek, Baba Bek and others. The pyramid-like pile of skulls is in reference to the Mongol conquests, as the Mongols were recorded as have built pyramids out of the skulls of their enemies. This was documented as having happened at Urgench, Kiev, Baghdad, and at Samarkand itself in 1220. On the work's frame, Vereshchagin inscribed that he dedicated the painting \\"to all great conquerors, past, present and to come\\". = Reception = Vereshchagin exhibited his art at a number of venues in the 1870s and 1880s. While his more traditional work was well received, two of his works from the campaign generated considerable controversy. Specifically, The Apotheosis of War and Left Behind were considered to be profoundly anti war and seen by some as portraying the Russian army in a bad light; this resulted in the Russian government preventing the two paintings from being shown at Vereshchagin's exhibitions in Russia. The artist experienced a similar backlash when he exhibited his work in Germany, notably when Apotheosis was viewed by German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. In a widely cited event, the painting provoked a confused, startled reaction from Moltke, who ordered that German soldiers be barred from seeing the painting. This order was seconded by the Minister of War of the Austrian Empire, who issued a similar ban. Vereshchagin was unconcerned with the viewership bans on his paintings, but was concerned with the growing number of accusations within Russia that he was slandering the Russian army. In response, the artist burned three of his lesser known paintings. Despite the controversy surrounding some of his work, Vereshchagin continued painting battles and their aftermaths until his death during the Russo-Japanese War.

Former president of far-right organisation Somatemps and director of the magazine Nihil Obstat. He also was one of the founders of Catalan Civil Society (SCC, Societat Civil Catalana). He has graduated in Biology at University of Barcelona, did a Master's degree in History of Sciences and obtained a PhD in Philosophy at Autonomous University of Barcelona. He has worked as a secondary school teacher of Natural Sciences. Other intellectual work involves publications related to Natural History, biotechnology, philosophy and politics. In 2015 Josep Alsina participated in a debate at Catalunya R√†dio with Jordi Borr√†s. In the debate Josep Alsina ideology and activism are discussed as well as Borr√†s investigation tasks. Alsina claimed that Borr√†s does tabloid journalism, while Borr√†s showed photographs of Alsina participating in events with people aligned with the far-right. Alsina's political past was also explained, talking about his membership to different far-right political parties. Nihil Obstat Holocaust denial was also discussed. Alsina defends that the magazine recognises it existed, but that it has been mystified because it has not been a unique event. Alsina stated that in history have existed many genocides. He also said that Hitler had the intention of creating a Jew State in Madagascar, that nazism did not think at first to commit extermination, but total migration (Madagascar Plan), extermination was not a must. During the debate Alsina denied that Juan Antonio Llopart, administrator of the publisher of Nihil Obstat, had been guilty of making Holocaust apology. Alsina alleged that after Llopart's condemn to two and half years by the Barcelona Court, he was absolved by the Supreme court of Spain. However, the supreme court alleged that the diffusion of ideas by Nihil Obstat justifying the Holocaust is only punishable if the text encouraged to commit them. In 2016 he received the award Ramiro de Maeztu. In May 2018 he received the award Pascual Tamburri Bariain to the best short essay, given by the publication Revista Raz√≥n Espa√±ola and Asociaci√≥n Cultural Ruta Norte.  Politics  At the age of 17 he entered the neo-Nazi NSSP, the National Socialist Spanish Party (Partido Espa√±ol Nacional Socialista in Spanish, PENS). Later on he left for New Force (Fuerza Nueva in Spanish). After New Force he entered the MSR and SyL. Around 2011 - 2013 he joined Somatemps. At the same time he contributed to the foundation Catalan Civil Society but left it shortly after. As part of his focus on nationalism he directs the far-right publication Nihil Obstat. His political claims revolve around the hispanity of Catalonia. He considers himself as hispanist, not constitutionalist. He describes the concept of hispanist as the person who believes in a Spain formed by a single political entity, which opposes the multiple nationalities and political entities of Spain developed through the centuries in the Iberian Peninsula: He also defends the theory of indoctrination into Catalan nationalism through the Catalan education system (\\"adoctrinamiento\\" in Castilian Spanish), theory supported by right-wing parties and associations of Spain. However, social studies do not find causality between children national identification and educational system.

They also support the black community with financial, educational and legal support.Belcher, Ellen H. \\"100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.\\" Encyclopedia of Race and Crime, edited by Helen Taylor Greene and Shaun L. Gabbidon, vol. 2, SAGE Reference, 2009, pp. 604-606. Gale Virtual Reference Library.  History  Based in New York City and founded by two black police officers Eric Adams and Noel Leader in 1995, this organization was created to address relations between the NYPD and the African American community. The NYPD administration has yet to acknowledge or authorize this group yet as of 2018 it remains active. In 2013, Adams stepped down as executive director to become the first African American borough president of Brooklyn. Most members are retired from their law enforcement agencies while remaining members of 100 Blacks.  Mission  As stated on the organization's website, their mission is as follows: # To fulfill our moral mandate to our creator, to enhance and cultivate the blessings that have been bestowed upon us # To serve as a model organization for individuals and other professionals in our communities so that we can again take our rightful place on the stage of history as a free, proud, and productive people # To offer (via non repayable grants) a minimum of $1,000 a month to a worthy cause in the African American community # To be the vanguard for justice on the behalf of those who traditionally have no voice in society # To vigorously challenge racism, sexism, and all of the debilitating ism's that retard the growth of today's global community # To economically empower our people by pooling our resources # To uplift our people through education  Relationship with NYPD  While 100 Blacks is not recognized by the NYPD, they continue to work to advance their mission. In 2002, the New York Civil Liberties Union, 100 Blacks and the Latino Officers Association wrote to Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Hector Gonzalez, the chairman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), to address allegations of misconduct involving 120 officers during January 2000 and June 2001. In addition there were further backlogs from 1998-1999 on reports of 18 additional police conduct complaints. CCRB data indicated that most cases of misconduct remained open at the department resulting from long delays from the NYPD. The reason stems from the police department disbanding the unit within the Advocate‚Äôs office which prosecutes cases referred to the NYPD sustained by the CCRB. Further discord between the 100 Blacks and the NYPD came to a head in 2003 when the advocate organization took the NYPD to federal court alleging the NYPD violated their rights by illegal wiretapping and biased investigations. 100 Blacks alleged the NYPD subpoenaed Verizon requesting certain telephone numbers. The case was later thrown out by the judge who stated the allegations were ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù and the suit was ‚Äútotally miscast‚Äù. In 2014, members of 100 Blacks held a vigil for Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, who were shot while sitting in their police cars.  Current Activities  In 2016, 100 Blacks teamed up with NYPD officer Edwin Raymond to combat quota based policing which requires officers to meet numerical goals for summons given and arrests made each month. The lawsuit made against the department by Raymond and 11 other officers said the department ‚Äúviolated a 2010 state ban against quotas and the 14th amendment which outlaws racial discrimination‚Äù.

With the arrival of the reinforcements, the AA defences on Malta were divided into two formations, 7 AA Bde covering the south half of the island while 10 AA Bde took the north. This arrangement was found not to work, and soon 7 AA Bde took over all the LAA and S/L defences, including 4th S/L Rgt RA/RMA, and 10 AA Bde commanded the HAA guns.Rollo, pp. 218‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol III, p. 179. Service personnel and civilians clear up debris on a heavily bomb-damaged street in Valletta, Malta, on 1 May 1942. In February, the Luftwaffe 's Fliegerkorps X was ordered to neutralise Malta, and it began a series of heavy bombing raids, mainly at night, accompanied by mine-dropping in and around the harbour. In the following months the Luftwaffe attacked by night and day, and the defences took a steady toll of its strength. By the beginning of June the depleted Fliegerkorps X handed responsibility back to the Italians.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 47‚Äì51.Rollo, pp. 214‚Äì8, 221. Malta was largely left alone during the summer of 1941, but attacks resumed in November after Fliegerkorps II arrived in Sicily. Air raids were increasingly common during November and December, and rations and supplies began to run short.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 108, 118, 174. 484 S/L Battery HQ at Naxxar was hit with the loss of three killed and two wounded. Increasingly, the Luftwaffe turned to Flak suppression, attacking the AA positions themselves with bombs and machine guns, and several S/L sites were hit.Rollo, pp. 237‚Äì41. Almost continuous attacks went on through early 1942, particularly aimed at airfields, shipping and port installations. Heavy raids were made by the Luftwaffe in daylight while smaller harassing raids were made by the Regia Aeronautica. By this stage of the siege, night bombers could be engaged by the HAA guns using visual height control at targets illuminated by S/L or by the GL Mark II gun- laying radar, or with predicted barrage fire. The S/L layout was at spacing and with the clear air of Malta 23 per cent of raids were illuminated at heights of up to . The lights were controlled by a searchlight controller in the RAF Fighter Operations Room. Until December 1941, when Junkers Ju 88s began night operations, RAF Hawker Hurricanes were able to destroy 40 per cent of Italian-manned aircraft that had been illuminated. By June, the size of night raids had grown to 90+ aircraft, while day raids were as few as eight aircraft. These raids were targeted at RAF airfields, but the raiders lost heavily and the scale of attacks dwindled in July. In the first week in August only seven bombers approached the island, the lowest number for everal months. However, the vital supply convoys came under heavy attack and suffered serious losses of ships and cargoes. However, the survivors of the 'Pedestal' convoy fought their way through the island between 13 and 15 August with just sufficient supplies to prolong the defence until December.Rollo, pp. 247‚Äì71.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 155‚Äì63, 178‚Äì89, 299‚Äì323. By October, the Luftwaffe had reinforced Fliegerkorps II, and a new round of heavy raids against the island began in an effort to restrict the RAF and Royal Navy's ability to interdict Axis convoys to Libya. The raiders employed new low-level tactics that lost heavily to the AA guns and RAF fighters. Night raids were mainly made by a succession of single aircraft at high level. However, the S/L crews were now much more proficient, achieving 37 per cent illuminations of aircraft crossing the coast, and these were heavily engaged. At last, a supply convoy got through in November. With the recent Axis defeat at Alamein and the Allied North Africa landings the same month, the siege of Malta was ended. The only enemy air activity for the rest of the year was occasional high-flying reconnaissances and one raid on Luqa in December.Anon, pp. 26‚Äì7.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 194‚Äì200.Rollo, pp. 272‚Äì4, 278. In May 1943, Axis aircraft reappeared in an attempt to disrupt preparations for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), but these raids caused little damage.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 427.Rollo, p. 285. After the Surrender of Italy on 8 September 1943 the defences of Malta began to be scaled back. Towards the end of the year, 484 S/L Bty was sent to Egypt to join Middle East Forces (MEF).Routledge, p. 174.Rollo, p. 287. Shortly after the battery left, 4 S/L Rgt RA/RMA was disbanded. Middle East 484 (Carmarthenshire) S/L Bty began arriving at Alexandria on 1 January 1944, and on 17 January was attached to 27th (London Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt. It had brought its own equipment, but took over 90 cm S/L positions from 304/27 S/L Bty and became operational along the Suez Canal on 24 February with Battery HQ at Ismailia under 78 AA Bde while 304 Bty was deployed to Tobruk. But there was little to do apart from training with the new Searchlight Control (SLC) radar. In May, 304 Bty returned to Ismailia and 484 Bty went a short way to Quassassin where it came under 21 AA Bde.484 S/L Bty War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 169/16264 The air threat to the Middle East bases had diminished by now, and the need to provide manpower for other tasks took priority. By June 1944, the AA defences under MEF had been reduced to a 'shell' to protect Alexandria and the Suez Canal. In July, the regiment was disposed as follows:Routledge, pp. 160‚Äì1; Table XXVI, p. 165. * RHQ, 306 and 484 Btys under 17 AA Bde in the Suez Canal area * 390 Bty under 1 AA Bde covering the Levant and Cyprus The following month, 484 Bty began to disband (which was completed during August; officially it entered 'suspended animation' on 10 September) and most of its personnel were sent to No 2 Depot Regiment, RA, for drafting to other units. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, it was at first proposed to reform the battery as a gun tractor battery, but that role was taken over by the Royal Army Service Corps, and instead 484 S/L Bty was reconstituted as 858th Movement Light Battery (Carmarthenshire Fortress), RA with HQ at Llanelli.850‚Äì870 Btys RA at British Army 1956 on.Litchfield, p. 83. With the advances in radar technology, AA S/L units were under-employed by the end of World War II, but during the campaign in North West Europe 21st Army Group had pioneered the technique of reflecting light off the cloudbase to provide 'artificial moonlight' or 'movement light' (also known as 'Monty's moonlight' after 21st Army Group's commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery) in support of night operations. This role was taken up by a number of independent S/L batteries (Moonlight Batteries) in the postwar era.Routledge, p. 317. On 31 October 1956, the battery was converted back to RE and amalgamated into 108 Field Engineer Regiment, RE (formerly 53rd (Welsh) Division RE). This regiment was later absorbed into the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers.80‚Äì117 Rgts RE at British Army 1956 on. Honorary Colonel Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel A.L.

Here are some good examples of different styles, in the order built: * The Stoughton-Falk house at 516 S. Page St. is an Italianate-styled cream brick mansion. Luke Stoughton, the city's founder, built the main block of the house in 1856, two stories tall with a hip roof and wide eaves supported by brackets. Stoughton originally had two wings attached to the main block. Around 1890 Ole Falk, the subsequent owner, removed the two wings and added the corner bay and the porches in the Queen Anne style which had become popular by that time. * The First Universalist Church at 324 S. Page St. is a smallish Greek Revival-styled brick church designed by Steven V. Shipman and built in 1858. The congregation had a female minister in charge in 1869, which was very progressive. The building now houses the Stoughton Historical Museum. * The A. Ovren house at 401 W. South St (pictured) was built in 1884, a late Italianate-styled house with a 2.5-story square tower with a mansard roof topped with metal cresting. * The West Elementary School at 400 Garfield St. is a 2-story, hip-roofed school built in 1886 and added to in 1899 and 1905. The styling is debatable, but the rough stone low on the building and the round tops on half of the windows are Richardsonian Romanesque features. * The George Ainsworth house at 409 W. South St. is a 2-story wooden home built in 1886 with a tower with oculus windows and mansard roof. Its massing is Queen Anne style, with its irregular plan and corner tower, but other stylings are in the direction of Carpenter Gothic: the emphasis on vertical, the scrollwork and stickwork in the gable peaks, and the window hoods. * The Evans house at 511 S. Page St. is another Queen Anne, 2.5 stories and built in 1889. This one has interesting corner bays and a Palladian window over the front porch. Unlike the Ainsworth house above, this design displays the usual Queen Anne concern with breaking up the wall surfaces with different textures: shingles in the gable ends, and bands of different colors as your eye moves up the wall. * The Homstad-Olson house at 417 W. South St. is another Queen Anne home built 1889 by John J. Holmstad, who built at least eight Queen Anne homes in the district. Like the Evans house above, it has corner bays and shingles in the gable ends. It also has bands of shingles halfway up the bays, and like the Ainsworth house above, elaborate stickwork in some of the gable peaks and the corner porch. The district has more Queen Anne houses than any other style. * The Mina Martin house at 501 W. South St. was built around 1900. It is rather simply decorated, classed as gabled-ell because the floor plan is in the shape of the letter L. * The Trulson house at 524 S. Page St. was built in 1903. It has American Foursquare-style massing, with its general cube shape and hip roof, and its styling is Colonial Revival, seen in the symmetry, the front porch with Doric columns and low balustrade, and the Palladian window on the side. Dr. Trulson was the city health officer. * The Methodist Episcopal church at 401 W. Main St. was built in 1904 - Gothic Revival-styled with a massive corner tower and large windows containing Gothic arches and stained glass. True to its style, the tower and various openings direct the viewer's attention to heaven. * The Bailey house at 308 S. Monroe St. was built in 1910, a Dutch Colonial Revival-styled house with the gambrel roof that is signature to the style. * The Schrode house at 408 S. Page St. is a brick Craftsman-styled house built in 1923. Characteristic of the style are the broad eaves and hipped roof. Mr. Schrode was a tobacco dealer.

Location  The mausoleum is located to the south of the medina of Sfax and overlooks three streets: it is bounded on the west by Nahj El Bey (the current Mongi-Slim Street), on the east by Scipion Street and on the north by El Issawiya Street, where the main entrance of the building is found.  History  Due to lack of written documents, the history of this mausoleum remained mysterious for a long time. It is mentioned for the first time in the inventory of monuments made by the students of the Bardo Military School in the middle of the 19th century. According to an epigraphic inscription on the front door, it was built in 1738. Some researchers mention that the prayer room was built even before the rest of the monument, during the Zirids reign (between the 11th and 12th centuries). Initially conceived as a simple oratory, it was transformed in 1863 into a mausoleum named after a local Muslim saint, Sidi Saada Kanoun. Since that date, the monument serves as the headquarters of the Sufi brotherhood of A√Øssawa. Sidi Saada mausoleum witnessed several extensions and renovation works.  Description  = Architecture = The mausoleum has the shape of a rectangle measuring 15.10 m long (North-South) and 12.20 m wide (East-West). Originally, it consisted of a rectangular prayer room and by an open courtyard. With the transformation of the building into a zaou√Øa, the courtyard got annexed to the prayer room, in which, next to the mihrab, stands the burial chamber of Sidi Saada. Next to the main entrance there is a small room for ablutions. = Construction mode = The monument is built of rubble with lime mortar. Its wooden joists roof is supported by semicircular arches, supported by squared columns with capitals of Zirid and Hispano-Maghrebi origin. = Main facade = Access to the monument is through a carved wooden door located in a richly decorated stone frame (moldings, geometric and floral motifs, earthenware tiles, epigraphic inscription, etc.). On either side of the entrance door, there are two symmetrical wrought iron windows with stone framing.

History The pillory at the foot of the municipal council hall with protective iron grate in 1863, erected to restrict access to the monument. The square and pillory consolidated into the traffic circle in the 1880s The pillory encircled by many of the multi-story buildings in the Pombaline Downtown Opposite the Navy Arsenal building The date of construction of Lisbon's first pillory is unknown, but was probably in or before 1179 following the granting of a charter to Lisbon by Afonso I of Portugal. The earliest written records date for that structure date to late 14th century. Later records place the pillory at various places in the city; but all traces of this and many other structures were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. On 31 August 1470, royal ordinance referred to affixing (notices) on the \\"local\\" pillory. The earliest record of this structure may have referred to a pillory located at the port customs house, referenced in documents during the reign of King John II. By the 16th century, the primitive pillory (Pelourinho Velho) was situated in the Pra√ßa do Pelourinho, alongside the Rua Bela da Rainha (today the Rua da Prata). The probable construction of the new pillory occurred in 1619, in the Pra√ßa do Pelourinho Novo, alongside the river. In the urban plans of Jo√£o Nunes Tinoco, dated to 1650, included the Pra√ßa do Pelourinho Velho and Pra√ßa do Pelourinho Novo. On 8 April 1633, the municipal government debated the construction of a spring in the Pra√ßa do Pelourinho Velho, in order to improve the quantity and quality of water in the city. Sometime in the 17th century, the Senate approved the demolition of the pillory. The municipality later (1690) authorized (by the monarch) to construct homes along the river. On 16 December 1705, D. Lu√≠s Baltazar da Silveira solicited authorization to build a home on the site of the old pillory, in which he would pay 50$000 r√©is annually and donation to the city of 600$000 r√©is. The King approved the rental on 4 February 1706. On 20 November 1738, the municipal council consulted the King to afix the pillory, with the usual locals debated: the Ribeira, Terreiro do Pa√ßo, Remolares, Boavista and Confeitaria. Before the earthquake of 1755, the Largo do Pelourinho was located at the place where the last block of the Rua do Com√©rcio is located, between the streets of Fanqueiros and Madalena. This border was delimited to the south by the Fernandine Wall and gave passage to the landfill of the Ribeira, through the Portas da Ribeira. Flanking this stood the customs house and \\"house of weights and measures\\", and the buildings that housed the Senate. On 1 November 1755, the Lisbon earthquake destroyed both pillory and square. During the course of the reconstruction, by 1783, the Largo do Pelourinho was constructed (along the old Largo da Tanoaria, delineated by Eug√©nio dos Santos. The only local execution at the site occurred in 1790, when a cadet was executed for murdering his brother. In 1808, during the course of the sack by French forces during the Peninsular War, Jean-Andoche Junot left the structure behind (although the General was interested in taking the structure) when they were expelled in 1808. The structure was vandalized in 1834, when the iron hooks (in the form of crosses) were removed (and had figured in early drawings of the structure in 1832). Civil authorities looked to an iron grate around the monument to protect the structure. On 24 March 1886, the square became known as the Pra√ßa do Munic√≠pio. In 1910, the Pillory of Lisbon was decreed to be a national monument of Portugal. In 1968, a study was issued to analyze the protection of the pillory and establish a protection zone. This interest in preservation lead to an initiative by the DRCLisboa on 22 August 2006, to define a Special Protection Zone (ZPE) along with the Saint George's Castle and its fortifications, the Pombaline Downtown and several other properties surrounding the lower quarter. The National Council for Culture () proposed archiving the ZPE on 10 October 2011, which was supported on 18 October by IGESPAR which agreed that the area required better definition. In the second half of the 20th century, the structure was cleaned and consolidated with iron framework. Architecture The triple-twist column of the pillory The pillory is located in the Pombeline urban area, implanted in the centre of a rectangular square, comprising a level platform decorated in triangular-shaped Portuguese pavement, circled by four roadways and buildings to the north and west (including the municipal council of Lisbon, the Church of S√£o Juli√£o and the Navy Arsenal. It consists of an octagonal platform of five steps of limestone, which support a sculpted pillar of marble, which supports a metal armillary sphere. The pillar is monolithic; that is, it is carved from a single piece of stone. It consists of a quadrangular base, an elaborate onion- shaped portion, an open threefold stone helix, and an upper octagonal platform. At one time, it had an iron crosspiece with hooks, and was surrounded by an iron railing.

It was added to the State Register of Historic Places in 1999 and to the National Register of Historic Places the following year. The first settlers arrived in Sun Prairie in 1839. In 1840 the road to Madison passed nearby. A sawmill was there by 1847, a hotel by 1850, and the railroad reached town in 1859. The village was incorporated in 1868. with In the late 1800s the village began developing public services. A volunteer fire department formed in 1891. In 1900 a private electric company hung electric wires along Main Street. Before 1899, people got their water from private wells and cisterns. In that year the village trustees and the Sun Prairie Countryman debated building a waterworks, arguing that: \\"To induce others to settle with us we must have the conveniences that they are used to. To get factories here we must have better fire protection and in order to better our facilities we must have a waterworks.\\" Fear of taxes weighed against. After much debate, a public waterworks was approved by vote. Stegerwald and Lessner, a local firm, won the bid to build a 60-foot stone tower to support the tank for $1750, and they built it in October and November 1899, re-using stone from the old Stevens Mill five miles northeast on the Maunesha River. The stonework is uniform and carefully done. At the base of the tower, a round-topped door is framed in radiating limestone blocks. Five windows allow light into the tower. A wooden tank originally sat on the tower, bought from Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company of Batavia. John M. Healy of Chicago provided pipe for the water system, and laid it. By 1911 the wooden tank was insufficient, and was replaced with a steel tank from Kennicott Water Softener of Chicago. Another flaw was that the original system only took water to homes; it didn't get waste water out of the homes. That problem was resolved in 1918 with a waste water treatment plant. The NRHP nomination considers the Sun Prairie tower significant for being built of stone, which is rare for a water tower in Wisconsin. It is also significant for its fine stonework, and as a symbol of the movement toward municipal services in the community.

Background Ixion in Heaven was published in two installments of the New Monthly Magazine in December 1832 and February 1833. Plot Ixion, the king of Thessaly (famous for its horses) marries Dia, daughter of Deioneus who steals some of his horses. Ixion invites Deioneus to Larissa (his capital) where Deioneus accidentally (according to Ixion) falls in a pit, whilst walking with Ixion, and dies. Dia accuses Ixion of murder and he flees to a neighbouring kingdom where his account of events is also disbelieved, so Jupiter takes him to heaven. alt=A young man of vaguely Semitic appearance, with long and curly black hair In heaven Ixion goes hunting with Mercury and at dinner meets various gods and goddesses including Apollo (a poet), his sister Diana and the Queen of Heaven, Juno, to whom he takes a fancy. Within three days, however, Ixion is unpopular with the likes of Mercury and Ganymede on account of his generally imperious behaviour. Ixion falls asleep in a field to be woken by Cupid to whom he confides his interest in Juno, who then appears on the scene. Cupid shoots his arrow through both their hearts. The couple are late for dinner, enraging Jupiter. After the meal Mercury and Ganymede tell Jupiter about Ixion's interest in Juno and all the gods head off in search of him. Cupid makes a cloud descend on the pavilion where Ixion is with Juno and in the fog secretly tells Juno to escape. When the cloud lifts, Ixion is alone and Jupiter then banishes him to Hades. Analysis Ixion in Heaven is a contemporary revision of the myth of Ixion found in the Greek poet Pindar‚Äôs Pythian Odes and in Apollonius Rhodius including Ixion‚Äôs murder of his kin, the temptation of Juno, Juno‚Äôs escape through a fog, and Jove‚Äôs binding of Ixion to a wheel and casting him out of heaven. When the novel was republished in 1853, Disraeli wrote that Jupiter represented George IV and Apollo Lord Byron. It has also been suggested that the novel depicts how Disraeli himself would have behaved in heaven. Reception Disraeli‚Äôs father Isaac, also a novelist, considered Ixion in Heaven and its follow-up The Infernal Marriage which was published the following year as his son‚Äôs most original contribution to literature. The novel was republished in 1926 as part of the Bradenham edition of all Disraeli‚Äôs novels, Philip Guedalia‚Äôs introduction describing it as ‚Äúa blend of gaiety and Lempri√®re‚Ä¶.its scheme, perhaps, and something of its tone were owed to Lucian.‚Äù Another review of the novel and two other early Disraeli works (Popanilla and The Infernal Marriage) which appeared at this time in The Spectator refers to Disraeli, ‚Äú invoking the satiric and the comic muse with a sure hand.‚Äù  References  Category:Novels by Benjamin Disraeli Category:1834 novels ","title":"Ixion in Heaven"},{"id":"57926231","text":"Robert Richard Rowland (October 8, 1917 ‚Äì January 6, 2003) was a major general in the United States Air Force.

It is one of 123 residences listed as part of the \\"Ancient Residences in Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces\\" entry in the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List in 2008 in the cultural category. History The compound was built by the county's Wang family, one of four historically prominent families in the county. The local Wang family traces to a migration from Taiyuan to Jinsheng in 1312 during the Yuan Dynasty. According to family lore the wealth of the family grew from selling bean curd. The local Wangs would reach its apex of wealth and power in 18th century after accumulating riches from business and government position. Over the course of several generations the compound was built on a grand scale during the period from the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1661‚Äì1722) to the Jiaqing Emperor (1796‚Äì1820). By the 19th century the fortunes of the family declined and some members took to degeneracy, opium smoking, and public corruption. The Wang family was ousted from the family compound during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Location The scattered site made up of several dwelling areas is built on the slope of the Mianshan Mountain on a loessial terrace and faces a river. The gardens are located on multiple levels at different elevations. The compound overlooks village homes of Jingsheng village, which is about away from the county seat of Lingshi. Jingsheng has a history of continuous settlement dating to the Neolithic age. Layout thumb As the building of the compound was a multi-generation endeavor, construction clusters arose one by one. The first two areas of opulent residences were in the Yongcui and Suorui lanes. During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, the Zhongling lane and Hongmen, Gongji, and Dongnan fortresses were also built. The Chongning Fortress was built during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor. The last residence area to be built was the Gaojiaya dwelling area from 1796 to 1811. In all there are 231 courtyards and 2,078 rooms on the site situated across 8 hectares. The courtyards are two stories and covered by slate gray roof tiles. The main area of the compound is symmetrical and divided by a moat over which crosses a stone bridge. The four circles of walls are multi-tiered, protecting different layers of dwelling areas from outside threats. Within the courtyards are rooms, kitchens, schools, and prayer pavilions. The ornate stone, brick and wood carvings have themes based on folk customs and folk arts.

Its first location was on the grounds of the local imaret, and its staff at the time consisted only of a foreign military doctor and two servants. He died in 1869, and was replaced by Dr. Robert Geiser, a Swiss national who was in charge of the hospital until 1877.

The complex is privately owned by area resident and businessman Tom Lenz. In a typical tournament season, the complex hosts approximately thirty events, in addition to several standalone college and area high school baseball and softball games. Its estimated yearly impact on the local economy is approximately $3M, according to Jacksonville's mayor, Andy Ezard. History The complex began as a single field, built to Little League standard dimensions that was completed in June 2007, at a cost of approximately $400,000. The original field, now known as Field #4 within the complex, is entirely artificial turf. The following year, a large tract of land across the street from the original field was purchased by Passavant Area Hospital, which in turn sold portions of that land to Lenz, who began construction on additional fields. By May of 2009, three additional fields - now known as Field #1, Field #2, and Field #3 - were ready for play, with the original field being renamed as Field #4. The final two fields would be completed in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Lenz has told the Springfield State Journal-Register that the tax credits put in place by President George W. Bush were a key part of his ability to expand the complex. Lenz Field is known regionally as a facility that is rarely impacted by inclement weather, with few rained out games and the ability to quickly make its fields ready for play after a heavy downpour.

NevStar Gaming Corporation initially proposed the NevStar 2000 hotel-casino and entertainment complex in 1998, but the project received opposition from nearby residents who did not want a casino in the area. NevStar Gaming filed bankruptcy in December 1999, and Station Casinos proposed the Mediterranean-themed Craig Ranch Station in March 2000. Because of continued residential opposition, the project's proposed location was changed to a vacant property at the nearby Craig Ranch Golf Course. Residents also opposed the new location, ultimately leading to the site's rejection by the Nevada Gaming Policy Committee in March 2001. After a weak financial quarter, Station Casinos chose to sell the original site, where it still had the option to develop the project. History =NevStar 2000= In October 1998, NevStar Gaming Corporation ‚Äì the owner of the Mesquite Star Hotel and Casino in Mesquite, Nevada ‚Äì proposed NevStar 2000, a large entertainment complex that would include a casino, a 200-room all-suite hotel, a 60-lane bowling alley, of meeting space, and between 12 and 18 movie theaters. The project would total , and was expected to have an entertainment or sports theme. NevStar 2000 was to be built at the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Coralie Avenue, south of the Martin Luther King/Craig Road intersection, in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The property had been purchased by Desert Mesa Land Partners Limited in April 1996, and NevStar had an option to purchase an indirect 20 percent stake in the property. In October 1998, despite complaints from local residents, NevStar won unanimous approval from the North Las Vegas Planning Commission for a use permit for the $140 million project. The project was expected to create 1,200 jobs, with the potential to bring nearly $1 million to the local economy of North Las Vegas. In November 1998, the North Las Vegas City Council denied a special-use permit for the NevStar 2000, after approximately 50 residents voiced their opinions on the project, with most of them opposed to it. Residents were concerned about increased crime and traffic that would be brought by the resort, as well as a drop in their property values. The primary concern was having a casino, along with its potential future expansions, so close to a residential area. North Las Vegas mayor Mike Montandon, who lived nearby, also opposed the project. However, Michael Signorelli, the chairman and chief executive officer of NevStar, said about the entertainment complex, \\"Only 10 percent of it is gaming, which is unheard of in the gaming industry. It is definitely user- friendly to the community.\\" Signorelli had hoped to have the project opened during the third quarter of 2000. NevStar Gaming filed a lawsuit in December 1998, requesting a reversal of the council's decision, with attorney Mel Close stating, \\"We feel it was an improper denial and that we met all the conditions of the North Las Vegas Planning Commission.\\" In January 1999, a District Court judge ruled in favor of the project and reversed the city council's decision, noting that the project was in compliance with the city's master plan as it would be located in a gaming enterprise zone. At that time, Close indicated that the project's opening was approximately four years away, because of design and financing requirements. The city council unanimously approved a use permit for the project in February 1999, without any opposition from nearby residents. In November 1999, NevStar sought a court order against Desert Mesa Land Partners and its partner, TSRS Incorporated. According to the lawsuit, NevStar was notified by Desert Mesa in September 1999 that its 20 percent stake option had become void. According to NevStar, the companies previously had an agreement that would allow NevStar until February 2000 to purchase its stake in the property. NevStar Gaming filed for bankruptcy in December 1999, and the project was cancelled. =Craig Ranch Station= In March 2000, Station Casinos announced plans for the Craig Ranch Station, to be built on the same property previously planned for the NevStar 2000. The Mediterranean- themed Craig Ranch Station would include a casino, a five-story 200-room hotel, a movie theater, and three restaurants. Although Montandon was still opposed to a casino being built at the location, he stated, \\"There's no question Station has the capacity to build a much better casino than NevStar could have ever considered. They have a much better track record.\\" Later that month, the planning commission approved Station Casinos' request to extend NevStar's use permit until February 2001, giving Station Casinos time to change the initial NevStar 2000 plans and to complete construction of the project. The resort was expected to employ approximately 850 people and generate more than $6 million in annual direct taxes, as well as $5 million in additional federal taxes. There would be the potential in the future to add an additional of gaming, restaurants, retail, meeting and entertainment space to the resort. By April 2000, Station Casinos entered a long-term lease with an option to purchase the property. Construction was expected to begin in September 2001, with completion scheduled before late 2002. The project, which would be smaller than Station Casinos' other Las Vegas resorts, was expected to cost between $100 million and $150 million. The city council approved the project in May 2000, despite opposition from nearby residents, who lived 60 feet away from the site. Thirty percent of the resort would be gaming, compared to the 10 percent that was planned with NevStar 2000. Station Casinos stated that a larger casino was necessary to ensure the resort's success. In June 2000, investors were planning to purchase the nearby Craig Ranch Golf Course on Craig Road from current owner Stimson Enterprises. As part of the planned purchase, the investment group would zone 30 to 40 acres of vacant land for gaming, as part of a plan for Station Casinos to develop the Craig Ranch Station there rather than the initial location. Montandon supported the idea to relocate the project. The deal and new location would allow Station Casinos to evaluate the area without rushing into construction on the initial site, which had a completion deadline of late 2002; after that, Station Casinos would lose the right to develop a resort on the land. The new location also received opposition from nearby residents, although the planning commission still approved the zoning change at Craig Ranch Golf Course. The project would be developed on of land, while the remaining property at the golf course would be redesigned to adjust to the lost acreage. Residents continued to oppose the project. In December 2000, 11 people opposed the project while 11 others supported it during a planning commission hearing. In February 2001, the city council voted unanimously to approve the golf course zoning change, turning the northwest corner of Commerce Street and Craig Road into a gaming district, allowing Station Casinos to proceed with the project. In March 2001, the reviews panel of the Nevada Gaming Policy Committee allowed four residents to express their opposition to the project. Later that month, a state ethics complaint was filed against Montandon, alleging that he broke ethics laws by voting in favor of the project, which would benefit his close friend and business partner. At the end of the month, the Gaming Policy Committee rejected plans for Craig Ranch Station, stating that the project would harm the quality of life for nearby residents. However, Station Casinos still had the option to develop the project on the original site. In July 2001, following a weak financial quarter, Station Casinos announced that the Craig Ranch Station had been cancelled, with plans to sell the original site for a non-gaming use. The second site at Craig Ranch Golf Course was proposed as the location for a new hospital. Both locations remain vacant as of 2018.

Wynn provides counterarguments to right-wing political argumentation, performed as various characters, often engaged in debate. Her videos have received positive critical response and have been praised for their intricately designed sets and costumes and their darkly humorous tone.  Early life  Wynn was born on October 21, 1988, in Arlington, Virginia, and raised in the same state. Wynn's parents are a psychology professor and a doctor. She attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and studied philosophy, then enrolled at Northwestern University in Illinois to pursue a PhD in philosophy, also serving as an instructor. Wynn left Northwestern, saying it had become \\"boring to the point of existential despair\\", and moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Wynn has written fiction, taught piano, and worked as a paralegal and copywriter.  YouTube career  Wynn started publishing YouTube videos in 2008, initially regarding religion and atheism. In 2016, she began the ContraPoints channel in reaction to the Gamergate controversy and the increasing prevalence of right-wing YouTubers, shifting her content to countering their arguments. Early ContraPoints videos also covered subjects such as race, racism, and online radicalisation. In her videos, Wynn uses philosophy, sociology, and personal experience to explain left-wing ideas and to criticize common conservative, classical liberal, alt-right and fascist talking points. Wynn's videos often have a combative but humorous tone, containing dark and surreal humor, sarcasm and sexual themes. Wynn often illustrates concepts by playing different characters who engage in debate. The videos have been noted for showcasing Wynn's production choices such as complicated lighting, elaborate costumes, and aesthetics. She takes aesthetic cues from drag performance, saying in a 2019 interview that if conservatives were going to call her a drag queen anyway, she decided to \\"be the most extravagant drag queen on YouTube.\\" In a 2018 interview for The Verge, Katherine Cross notes a significant difference between Wynn and how she presents on YouTube, explaining that the YouTube channel portrays an image of being \\"blithe, aloof, decadent and disdainful\\", while personally Wynn \\"can be earnest‚Äîand she cares deeply, almost too much.\\" The video channel is financed through the crowdfunding platform Patreon, where ContraPoints is among the top 20 creators on the site.Reeve, Elle (March 14, 2019). \\"Meet the YouTube star who's de-radicalizing young, right-wing men\\" . Vice News. Retrieved March 31, 2019. In February 2020, Wynn set all her videos from before August 2017 ‚Äî when she began her gender transition ‚Äî to private saying that they \\"no longer represent the person I've become\\". She posted transcripts of the majority of these videos on her website.  Reception  Wynn's videos have been praised for their clarity, nuance, and attention-grabbing sense of humor. Jake Hall, writing for Vice, called Wynn \\"one of the most incisive and compelling video essayists on YouTube\\". In an article contrasting her personal sincerity and her ironic sense of humor, The Verge describes her as the \\"Oscar Wilde of YouTube.\\" New York magazine states, \\"ContraPoints is very good. Regardless of the viewer's interest or lack thereof in internet culture wars, YouTube Nazis, or any of the other wide-ranging subjects covered in its videos, they're funny, bizarre, erudite, and compelling.\\" Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs calls ContraPoints a \\"one-woman blitzkrieg against the YouTube right,\\" describing her videos as \\"unlike anything I've ever seen ... She shows how debate should be done: not by giving an inch to poisonous ideas, but by bringing superior smarts, funnier jokes, and more elegant costumes to the fight.\\" Media often describe the channel's content as uniquely suited to a millennial audience, due to its humorous style and its direct attention to online culture. Wynn's analysis of fascists' use of memes and coded symbols has been cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center in an article explaining the right-wing use of the OK sign. Journalist Liza Featherstone recommends the channel as well, saying that Wynn does a \\"fabulous job\\" acknowledging her opponents' valid points while debunking weak arguments and revealing the influence of a sometimes-unacknowledged far-right political agenda. In November 2018, after a ContraPoints video about incels reached over one million views, The New Yorker released a profile of the channel, describing Wynn as \\"one of the few Internet demi-celebrities who is as clever as she thinks she is, and one of the few leftists anywhere who can be nuanced without being boring.\\" The Atlantic praised Wynn's use of \\"lush sets, moody lighting, and original music by the composer Zo√´ Blade\\" and opined of her videos that \\"The most spectacular attraction [...] is Wynn herself.\\" Polygon named her video on incels one of the ten best video essays of the year 2018. In May 2019, she topped the Dazed 100 list, which ranks people who \\"dared to give culture a shot in the arm.\\" In September 2019, Wynn described on Twitter feelings of awkwardness when asked in some contexts to describe her preferred gender pronouns. The tweets were criticized as dismissive of non-binary people who use pronouns other than \\"he/him\\" and \\"she/her\\". Contrastingly, professor Lal Zimman opined about pronoun introductions, \\"Wynn is absolutely right that people engage with that practice in ways that can be somewhat problematic\\". Following negative reaction, Wynn deactivated her Twitter account for a week, then posted an apology. In October 2019, Wynn's video \\"Opulence\\" featured a quote from John Waters read by transsexual pornographic actor Buck Angel, whose views on transgender people have attracted criticism, including by some who see Angel's views as being transmedicalist. Wynn was criticised for featuring Angel, including by journalist Ana Valens. In addition to criticism, Wynn and YouTubers associated with her were widely harassed. Wynn's January 2020 video \\"Canceling\\" addressed both criticism and harassment of her, and the broader context of perceived \\"cancel culture\\". It was praised by Robby Soave of Reason.  Personal life  Wynn is a trans woman, a matter that features heavily in her videos, and began her gender transition in 2017. Wynn previously identified as genderqueer. She is a feminist and a socialist. , she resides in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2020, Wynn came out as a lesbian in her video \\"Shame\\".

The project was announced in 1994, and construction was expected to begin in July 1996. The start of construction was delayed several times because of poor financial quarters for Santa Fe Gaming and because of the company not yet receiving financing for the project. Site preparation started in July 1998, with an opening date scheduled for December 1999, but construction never began. In 1999, the property was sold to Station Casinos, which sold the land a year later for use as a shopping center. History In March 1994, Sahara Gaming Corporation, which owned the Santa Fe hotel-casino in northwest Las Vegas, announced plans for a then-unnamed casino and 200-room hotel that would be built on of land at the northwest corner of Sunset Road and Marks Street in Henderson, Nevada, adjacent to the proposed Galleria at Sunset mall. Like the Santa Fe, the new resort would include an ice rink and bowling alley. By early 1996, Santa Fe Gaming (formerly Sahara Gaming) was planning the project as a second Santa Fe resort to be known as the Santa Fe Valley. The new project would be loosely patterned after the original Santa Fe resort. Features would include 300 hotel rooms; a casino with 1,600 slot machines and 37 table games; four restaurants; an ice rink; and an \\"adult playground\\" that would include basketball courts, hockey facilities, pool tables, and virtual reality games. The cost to build the new project was initially between $100 million and $120 million. Construction was expected to begin in July 1996, with completion scheduled for 18 months later. Later in 1996, the project underwent a design change to better compete against Station Casinos' new Sunset Station resort, located across from the planned Santa Fe site. The project was delayed several times because of poor financial quarters for Santa Fe Gaming. As of February 1997, the Santa Fe Valley was scheduled to begin construction in late summer 1997. By May 1997, the project was known as the Santa Fe Galleria Hotel, with plans to connect it to the adjacent Galleria mall. Santa Fe Gaming had yet to arrange financing for the project, which was expected to cost $130 million. By January 1998, construction had still not begun, and Santa Fe Gaming had yet to obtain financing or city approval for the project. Up to that point, the Culinary Workers Union, which was in a dispute with the northwest Santa Fe resort, gathered 2,500 community opponents to the concept of a casino connected to the mall. That month, Santa Fe Gaming chose to delay connecting the project to the mall until after the new resort was opened. The decision on whether to connect the properties was also predicated on the mall's expansion to include two anchor stores. The Santa Fe project was unanimously approved by the Henderson City Council in February 1998, with groundbreaking scheduled for May. The project would now include 300 hotel rooms in a 147-foot tower, a casino, an ice rink with seating for 886 people, and a 1,000-seat theater. The mission-style project would feature a total of , and would include an 85-foot bell tower. To alleviate concerns about children from the mall going into the casino, the ice rink was now planned to be built between the mall and the casino, and the rink and a planned arcade would have entrances separate from the casino. The ice rink would be the only one in Henderson, and mayor James B. Gibson considered it beneficial to the community. In June 1998, new plans were filed for the project, which would include 290 hotel rooms, a casino, five restaurants, a sports bar, two lounges, an arcade, a child-care center, an ice rink, and of retail space. Construction costs for the project were between $100 million and $130 million. Construction was expected to begin by late June 1998, with July 15 as a deadline; otherwise, Santa Fe Gaming would need to reapply for a special-use permit. On July 8, 1998, workers began preparing the site by leveling it and removing rocks and desert plants. A foundation permit was expected to be issued the next week, followed by a building permit approximately eight weeks after that. A sign on the vacant property promoted the project as \\"Santa Fe Valley\\", with an advertised opening date of December 1999; city records listed the project as \\"Santa Fe Galleria Hotel & Casino\\". The main hotel building would be located approximately 200 feet north of Sunset Road, while parking would stretch both north of the hotel building to Galleria Drive and east to Marks Street. The project was further delayed by Santa Fe Gaming not yet receiving financing. Site preparation was underway in December 1998, with digging for the hotel tower's foundation expected to begin at the end of the month, followed by concrete pouring two weeks later. An official groundbreaking was not scheduled until Santa Fe Gaming could obtain financing for the project. In November 1999, Santa Fe Gaming sold the 40-acre property for $37.25 million to Station Casinos, to help pay off a $57.5 million loan that was due the following month. No construction had occurred up to that point. In 2000, Station Casinos sold the property to Laurich Properties Inc., which subsequently built the $75 million, SunMark Plaza shopping center on the site.

Lomax Jr. (June 14, 1907 ‚Äì December 12, 1974) was an American folklorist, performer, and land developer. He co-founded the Houston Folklore & Music Society and contributed to the preservation and publication of folklore and folk music during the 20th century, continuing the work of his father and brother. Lomax once defined folk music as \\"a story in song written no one knows when, no one knows where, no one knows by whom or even why.\\"  Biography  John A. Lomax Jr. was born in Austin, Texas, United States. He graduated from West High School in 1924, earning a B.A. with a cum laude distinction at the University of Texas in 1928. He began postgraduate work at Harvard Business School, but the start of the Great Depression prevented him from continuing. He had a brief stint at a bank in Corpus Christi until the bank began to fail. In the early 1930s Lomax's mother, Bess Bauman Brown, died, sending his father into a depression. Lomax encouraged his folklorist father to embark on a second tour of the country, lecturing at universities and other groups while hunting down folk songs to add to his burgeoning collection. Lomax Jr. planned the tour and organised bookings, acting much like a manager for the folklorist family. After the folklore tour, Lomax Jr. worked as an auditor with the Federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation. As an auditor, his frequent travels across the country gave him the opportunity to find new folk songs, which he would send to his father to record for the Library of Congress. At the age of 34, Lomax enlisted in the Navy. Though he enlisted as a private, he rose to the rank of Chief Petty Officer and trained new recruits to swim. While in the Navy, he met men who taught him more folk songs. His family moved to Virginia, New York, California, and, eventually, back to Texas. After the Navy, Lomax turned to a career as a land developer. He and his partner, Earl Gilbert, built several subdivisions in southern and northern parts of Houston, most notably Melrose Park and Southbrook. Lomax eventually developed West Little York Place, made of affordable single-family homes. Lomax's first public performance was at Rice University on Dec. 8, 1950. His wife, Margaret, encouraged him to sing some of his favorite folk songs.This led to more performances over the years - including the University of California‚Äôs Folk Music Festival at Berkeley (1960), the first two Kerrville Folk Festivals, the Cullen Auditorium at the University of Houston, and countless hootenannies. In 1951, Lomax founded the Houston Folklore & Music Society with Ed Badeaux, Harold V. Belikoff, Howie Porper, Pete Rose, and Chester Bower. The HFMS sought to preserve and celebrate folklore and folk music with monthly meetings that were open to the public. Membership dues included a subscription to the Society‚Äôs monthly publication, The Cottonpatch Rag. At meetings, members would sing and play guitars, banjos, fiddles - no electric instruments or drums permitted. The HFMS‚Äôs ranks included Buster Pickens, Lightnin‚Äô Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb, Townes Van Zandt, Frank Davis, Lucinda Williams, Guy Clark, and K.T. Oslin. The group facilitated first meetings between many of these fledgling artists, in addition to giving them a space to play music and share songs. The HFMS staged group concerts in the Jewish Community Center and the University of Houston, while solo acts frequented the club circuit. Lomax was known for his rendition of Lead Belly‚Äôs \\"Take This Hammer\\" at HFMS meetings. The only accompaniment to his baritone voice was an axe and stump; he would punctuate the end of each line with a swing of the axe. Lomax was responsible for introducing filmmaker Les Blank to Lightnin‚Äô Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb, and Clifton Chenier. Blank made The Blues Accordin‚Äô to Lightnin‚Äô Hopkins, A Well Spent Life (on Lipscomb), and Spend it All (on Chenier). Lomax also managed Lightnin‚Äô for about ten years, starting in the mid-1950s. In 1956, Lomax made the John A. Lomax Jr. Sings American Folksongs album. He also performed with Ed Badeaux, Jim McConnell, Howard Porper, and Jim Rose, a group from the Houston Folklore Society, who called themselves The Tex-i-an Boys. The group was featured on the Songs of Texas album. Lomax is also featured on Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men, a raunchy folk album highlighted by Hopkins' delivery of \\"the dozens.\\" The album was never commercially released due to its collection of \\"dirty\\" songs. Lomax also contributed \\"Long John\\" to the 1972 album, Rod Kennedy Presents Kerrville Folk Festival, joining Peter Yarrow, Mance Lipscomb, Steve Fromholz, Carolyn Hester, and others. In 1967, Lomax discovered a lost manuscript that his father had written. Lomax wrote an introduction for the book and it was published as Cow Trails & Cattle Camps by William D. Wittliff's Encino Press. In 1969, Lomax recorded himself singing 160 of his favorite folk songs. His son, John Lomax III, eventually rediscovered these tapes and selected 16 to create the album FOLK in 2017. Lomax suffered a fatal stroke at home on December 12, 1974. His lifelong celebrations of folklore and music carry on through the still-regular meetings of the HFMS. His younger son, Joe, followed in his footsteps as a performer, often appearing with family friend Hally Wood. His older son, John M. Lomax (aka John Lomax III) and grandson, John Nova Lomax, continued the family tradition by writing extensively about music and musicians.  Family  John Avery Lomax, Jr. was the son of John Avery Lomax, the pioneering folklorist who collected and performed folk songs across America. He was a brother to Shirley Lomax, Alan Lomax, and Bess Lomax. John and his wife, Margaret, were parents to John Lomax III and journalist/publisher/photographer/filmmaker Joseph Franklin Lomax (1949 - 1988).

Plummer Mountain is the high point and eastern culmination of Miners Ridge. Image Lake on Miners Ridge provides a campsite from which to climb Plummer. Kennecott Copper Corporation, as of 1988, planned to dig an open-pit copper mine on the slopes of Plummer Mountain. However, protests by various advocacy groups prevented the plan from developing further.https://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2010/05/05/the-open-pit-is- finally-put-away/ Geology Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . The area was previously an oceanic environment, consisting mainly of sedimentary and volcanic rocks.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about . However, mountain building in the area did not begin until the miocene, approximately . Plummer Mountain is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith, an intrusive formation that was formed approximately , during the early miocene. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is south of Plummer Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Plummer Mountain, volcanic ash is quite common in the area. Throughout the ice age, the North Cascades were mostly covered in thick glaciers, extending to near Puget Sound. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by . As a result, valleys in the area are deep and u-shaped, and mountains tend to be rocky, with steep slopes and narrow summits. Climate Plummer Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Hiking Miners Ridge seen from Plummer Mountain The trail to Miners Ridge can be accessed from the Suiattle River Road. There is an alpine route with scrambling that leads from Miners Ridge to Plummer Mountain.

From 2005 to 2013 she was president of the Council of Consumers and Users of Spain. She is vice president of the Volunteering Platform of Spain and a member of the Platform of the Third Sector. Since May 2016 Sauquillo has presided over the Commission of Historical Memory of the City Council of Madrid appointed by mayor Manuela Carmena. Personal life On 16 July 1969, Sauquillo married the lawyer and activist Jacobo Echeverr√≠a-Torres Tovar (1942‚Äì2005) in the CSIC chapel in Madrid. They had two children, Javier (born 1978) and Jacobo (born 1980). On 7 April 1998 Javier, who suffered from anorexia nervosa, suffered a hypoglycemic shock in the Madrid Metro that plunged him into a state of semiconsciousness. Unable to move or speak, he was treated at first in the station's lobby and later was evicted by two guards at the request of the chief of security. The guards confused Javier for a \\"terminal AIDS patient\\", and he remained \\"thrown\\" for more than an hour in the mouth of the Metro station without any onlookers calling the S.A.M.U.R., said Francisca Sauquillo during the trial against the guards held in January 2002. Finally, the call came at about 1:30, but there was little the health workers could do. Javier went into a coma and died at 6:00 am at the Hospital de La Princesa. In February 2002, the Audiencia of Madrid sentenced the Metro's security chief and two Prosesa guards for failure to provide assistance, and ordered the Metro and Prosesa to compensate the family with 42,070 euros.

She was known for producing objects decorated with Celtic designs in a variety of media including leatherwork, jewellery, painted wood, embroidery, ceramics, repouss√© metalwork, and block prints. Early life Eva Kathleen McKee was born 28 July 1890, at 32 Lothair Avenue, Belfast. Her parents were James Henry McKee, a builder, and Jane McKee (n√©e Grogan). She began working in the Irish Decorative Art Association (IDAA) in the 1910s, a Belfast craftworkers organisation and later a cooperative society founded by Mina Robinson. Whilst working in the IDAA she attended evening classes in the Belfast School of Art. Career After World War I McKee helped in the revival of the IDAA with Eveline McCloy, working from the group's studio at 35 Wellington Place. McKee exhibited at the 6th exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in Dublin and Cork in 1921, and became a members of the Guild of Irish Art- Workers in 1925. Throughout the 1920s her work featured in all the major Irish arts and crafts exhibitions. She won a medal at the 1922 Tailteann exhibition in Dublin for her decorative leatherwork and pottery. Both McKee and McCloy worked in a Celtic revival style, producing a large body of work in various media, which would become emblematic of the IDAA in the early 20th century. McKee is seen as having the stronger artistic style, and created most of the studio's designs, particularly in pottery and coloured prints. She used factory made blanks from sources such as Belleek Pottery or Wedgwood, which she decorated with original Celtic designs in bright colours such as deep blue and yellow lustre. Items included jugs, bowls, and candlesticks as well as ceramic tiles and brooches. Prints produced by the IDAA included bookmarks, bookplates, greeting cards and calendars, featuring more Celtic designs with landscapes and fairy themes. These designs drew on traditional illustrated Irish manuscripts, and McKee signed them with her name in Irish: Aoife McAoda. Some of her designs which featured birds drew in elements from Art Nouveau. McKee also drew up a large number of jewellery designs, which were then executed by local Belfast craftswomen. These designs feature interlace and spiral patterns of Celtic design mixed with the leafy tree motifs of the English arts and crafts movement. Among the items she designed were necklaces, earrings, pendants, and rings which had settings for enamel, ceramic or precious stones. McKee was also well known for her decorative leatherwork, also featuring Celtic design. One example is her book cover for a George William Russell volume of poetry, which was exhibited at the Tailteann exhibition in 1924. Both McKee and McCloy also created a variety of domestic items, utilising decorated woodwork, embroidery, enamelling, and repouss√© metalwork. By the 1920s, McKee had a retail space in Belfast, which appeared to continue to trade until the 1960s. Later life From 1933, McKee and McCloy stopped using the IDAA, a name which was exclusively associated with their work by this time. The pair moved their studio to Donegall Place and continued their partnership into the 1950s. McKee died in Belfast in 1955. A large collection of her work is held in the Linen Hall Library, Belfast, and the John J. Burns Library in the Boston College where her work has been exhibited.

This list only includes names that were not properly published (\\"unavailable names\\") and have not since been published under a valid name. The following types of names are present on this list: * Nomen nudum, Latin for \\"naked name\\": A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. * Nomen manuscriptum, Latin for \\"manuscript name\\": A name that appears in manuscript but was not formally published. A nomen manuscriptum is equivalent to a nomen nudum for everything except the method of publication, and description. * Nicknames or descriptive names given to specimens or taxa by researchers or the press. A =Airakoraptor= \\"Airakoraptor\\" is an informal name given to a genus of dromaeosaurian theropod from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. The nomen nudum was accidentally created by Perle et al. in their 1992 in a citation for a paper called \\"Morphology Dromaeosaurian dinosaur-Airakoraptor from the upper cretaceous of Mongolia\\". As the journal and volume of the listed paper contain no such publication, the actual title for the work likely being \\"New dromaeosaur material from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia\\" by the same authors as listed, there is no verifiable publication for this taxon name. The proper publication described three specimens, one of which is not referred to by a specimen number, and most likely corresponds to the material \\"Airakoraptor\\" was to be named for. This specimen, IGM 100/981, was found in Khulsan and is referrable to Dromaeosauridae while likely distinct from Velociraptor. =Amargastegos= \\"Amargastegos\\" is an informally named genus of extinct stegosaurid ornithischian dinosaur known from the La Amarga Formation of Argentina on the basis of MACN N-43 (some dorsal osteoderms, the cervical and caudal vertebrae, and one skull bone). In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter declared it a nomen dubium, establishing it as an indeterminate stegosaur. =Andhrasaurus= \\"Andhrasaurus indicus\\" is an informal genus of extinct armored ornithischian dinosaur from the Kota Formation of India. Ulansky (2014) coined the name for skull elements, about 30 osteoderms, and the extremities of vertebrae and limbs, all preserved in the collections of the GSI and assigned to Ankylosauria by Nath et al. (2002).Nath, T. T., Yadagiri, P., and Moitra, A. K., 2002, First record of armoured dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic Kota Formation, Pranhita-Godavari Valley, Andhra Pradesh: Journal of the Geological Society of India, v. 59, p. 575-577. In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter noted that \\"Andhrasaurus\\" did not meet ICZN requirements and therefore declared it a nomen nudum, listing it as Thyreophora indet., while noting that the jawbones described by Nath et al. (2002) belonging to crocodylomorphs.Galton, Peter M. & Carpenter, Kenneth, 2016, \\"The plated dinosaur Stegosaurus longispinus Gilmore, 1914 (Dinosauria: Ornithischia; Upper Jurassic, western USA), type species of Alcovasaurus n. gen.\\", Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie - Abhandlungen 279(2): 185-208 The dermal armor informally named \\"Andhrasaurus\\" was redescribed by Galton (2019).Peter M. Galton (2019). \\"Earliest record of an ankylosaurian dinosaur (Ornithischia: Thyreophora): Dermal armor from Lower Kota Formation (Lower Jurassic) of India\\".

The taxon is toothless and is known from multiple individuals collectively covering much of the skeleton, some remains were described by Allain et al. (2014). =Angloposeidon= Pneumatic structures of \\"Angloposeidon\\" \\"Angloposeidon\\" is the informal name given to a sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight in southern England. It was a possible brachiosaurid but has not been formally named. Darren Naish, a notable vertebrate palaeontologist, has worked with the specimen and has recommended that this name only be used informally and that it not be published. However, he published it himself in his book Tetrapod Zoology Book One from 2010. The remains consist of a single cervical vertebra (MIWG.7306), which indicate it was a very large animal, 20 metres or greater in length. =Archaeoraptor= The \\"Archaeoraptor\\" fossil \\"Archaeoraptor\\" is the informal generic name for an important fossil from China that was later discovered to be a fake. The name was created in an article published in National Geographic magazine in 1999, where the magazine claimed that the fossil was a \\"missing link\\" between birds and terrestrial theropod dinosaurs. Even prior to this publication there had been severe doubts about the fossil's authenticity. Further scientific study showed it to be a forgery constructed from rearranged pieces of real fossils from different species. Zhou et al. found that the head and upper body actually belong to a specimen of the primitive fossil bird Yanornis, and another 2002 study found that the tail belongs to a small winged dromaeosaur, Microraptor, named in 2000. The legs and feet belong to an as yet unknown animal. =Archbishop= \\"The Archbishop\\" in multiple views \\"The Archbishop\\" is a giant brachiosaurid sauropod dinosaur similar to Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan. It was long considered a specimen of Brachiosaurus (now Giraffatitan) brancai due to being found in the same formation in Tendaguru, Tanzania. However, the \\"Archbishop\\" shows significant differences including a unique vertebral morphology and a proportionally longer neck, that indicates it is a different, previously unknown genus and species.http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2005/abstract.html Specific features of the Archbishop that distinguish it from other brachiosaurs It was discovered by Frederick Migeod in 1930. \\"The Archbishop\\" is a nickname that functions as a placeholder ‚Äì the specimen currently has no scientific name. The specimen is currently housed in the Natural History Museum in London, and will eventually be re-described by Dr. Michael P. Taylor of Bristol University. In May 2018, Taylor started to work on describing the Archbishop. B =Balochisaurus= \\"Balochisaurus\\" (meaning \\"Balochi lizard\\", for the Baloch tribes of Pakistan) is an informal taxon of titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Pakistan. The proposed species is \\"B. malkani\\". The discovery was made (along with other dinosaur specimens) near Vitariki by a team of paleontologists from the Geological Survey of Pakistan. Described in 2006 by M.S. Malkani, the genus is based on seven tail vertebrae found in the Maastrichtian-age Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation, with additional vertebrae and a partial skull assigned to it. Balochisaurus was assigned to the family \\"Balochisauridae\\" along with \\"Marisaurus\\", although the family was used as a synonym of older Saltasauridae. =Bananabendersaurus= \\"Bananabendersaurus\\"http://forum.dinozaury.com/viewtopic.php?t=1129 is the informal name given to an unnamed species of sauropod found in the Winton Formation, Australia. The two known specimens of \\"Bananabendersaurus\\", known as Cooper and George, were discovered in 2005 and 2006 and have been dated to the early Cenomanian (ca. 98-95 Ma). The Cooper specimen is known from both humeri and the left radius, while the George specimen is known from a single rib and a left femur. \\"Bananabendersaurus\\" represents the largest dinosaur discovered in Australia to date - \\"Bananabendersaurus\\" was around long on average. =Barackosaurus= \\"Barackosaurus\\" is the informal name created in 2010 which is used for a sauropod found in Kimmeridgian-aged sediments pertaining to the Morrison Formation, Wyoming. It was found in the Dana Quarry and \\"Barackosaurus\\" was supposedly 20 meters long and weighed 20 tons.https://dinoanimals.com/dinosaurs/complete-dinosaurs-database/ =Barnes High Sauropod= The \\"Barnes High sauropod\\" is the informal name given to MIWG-BP001, an undescribed sauropod dinosaur specimen from the Wessex Formation on the Isle of Wight. It was discovered in the cliffs around Barnes High in 1992 and is currently owned by the privately run unaccredited Dinosaur Farm Museum near Brighstone, the ownership situation was described as \\"complex\\" and the specimen is currently inaccessible to researchers. It is roughly 40% complete and consists of a \\"Partial postcranial skeleton, including presacral vertebrae, anterior caudal vertebrae, girdle and limb elements\\" including a largely complete forelimb. It has been suggested to be a Brachiosaur and is possibly synonymous with the earlier named Eucamerotus due to similarities with the vertebrae. =Bayosaurus= \\"Bayosaurus\\" is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of dinosaur. The name was coined by paleontologists Rodolfo Coria, Philip J. Currie, and Paulina Carabajal in 2006. It apparently was an abelisauroid from the Turonian Cerro Lisandro Formation of Neuqu√©n, Argentina, around long. The specimen is MCF- PVPH-237, including dorsal and sacral vertebrae, a fragmentary pelvis, and other partial bones, which were discovered in 2000. The name was used in a phylogenetic analysis to indicate the position of MCF-PVPH-237. The suggested binomial was \\"Bayosaurus pubica\\". =Beelemodon= \\"Beelemodon\\" is the informal name given to an undescribed theropod genus from the Late Jurassic, possibly belonging to a coelurosaur. The fossils include two teeth found in Wyoming, United States. The name appeared in print in 1997, when paleontologist Robert T. Bakker mentioned it in a symposium for the Academy of Natural Sciences.Bakker, R. Raptor family values: Allosaur parents brought great carcasses into their lair to feed their young. In \\"Dinofest International\\", Proceedings of a Symposium, Academy of Natural Sciences, eds Wolberg, Sump and Rosenberg, 51 ‚Äì 63 (1997). The teeth are most similar to Compsognathus, but have no unique features and also share similarities with Protarchaeopteryx and dromaeosaurids. =Biconcavoposeidon= \\"Biconcavoposeidon\\" is the placeholder name for AMNH FARB 291, five consecutive posterior dorsal vertebrae of a brachiosaurid sauropod, from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, Wyoming. Not much else is currently known about \\"Biconcaveoposeidon\\", except that it was discovered in the Bone Cabin quarry in 1898. =Bihariosaurus= \\"Bihariosaurus\\" (meaning \\"Bihor lizard\\") is an invalid genus of iguanodontian dinosaur from Early Cretaceous Bauxite of Cornet, Romania. The type species, \\"Bihariosaurus bauxiticus\\", was named but not described by Marinescu in 1989. It was similar to Camptosaurus, and was an iguanodont. The original publication of the taxon did not include sufficient description, and the illustrations cannot distinguish it from any other ornithopod.F. Marinescu. 1989. Lentila de bauxita 204 de la Brusturi-Cornet (Jud. Bihor), zacamint fosilifer cu dinozauri [Bauxite lens 204 from Brusturi- Cornet (Bihor Co.), fossil excavation with dinosaurs]. Ocrotirea Naturii si a Mediului Inconjurator 33(2):125-133 \\"Bihariosaurus\\" may have been the same animal as Valdosaurus. =Biscoveosaurus= \\"Biscoveosaurus\\" is the informal name of an ornithopod dinosaur specimen from the Early Maastrichtian age Snow Hill Island Formation of James Ross Island, Antarctica. It comes from the Cape Lamb Member of the formation, the same member as Morrosaurus, another basal ornithopod. As such, it's been suggested it may be a secondary specimen of that species, but as the holotype of Morrosaurus is fragmentary and doesn't overlap with the material of \\"Biscoveosaurus\\", this can't as yet be tested. The specimen consists of dentaries, teeth, a braincase, parts of the maxillae, forelimb elements, assorted vertebrae, and the pectoral girdle; this makes it unique compared to the other James Ross Island ornithopods, which don't presever both cranial and postcranial remains. It has been estimated the animal would've been about in length. =Brachiosaurus nougaredi= Diagram showing preserved parts of the \\"B.\\" nougaredi sacrum in blue \\"Brachiosaurus\\" nougaredi was a sauropod dinosaur of uncertain affinities. It was originally assigned to the genus Brachiosaurus in 1960, though it certainly represents a different genus, and probably a different family. In 1958, the French petroleum geologist F. Nougar√®de reported to have discovered fragmentary brachiosaurid remains in eastern Algeria, in the Sahara Desert. Based on these, Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent described and named the species Brachiosaurus nougaredi in 1960. He indicated the discovery locality as being in the Late Jurassic‚Äìage Taouratine Series. He assigned the rocks to this age in part because of the presumed presence of Brachiosaurus. A more recent review placed it in the \\"Continental intercalaire,\\" which is considered to belong to the Albian age of the late Early Cretaceous, significantly younger. The type material moved to Paris consisted of a sacrum, weathered out at the desert surface, and some of the left metacarpals and phalanges. Found at the discovery site but not collected, were partial bones of the left forearm, wrist bones, a right shin bone, and fragments that may have come from metatarsals. \\"B.\\" nougaredi was in 2004 considered to represent a distinct, unnamed brachiosaurid genus,Upchurch, P.; Barrett, P.M.; Dodson, P. (2004). \\"Sauropoda\\". In Weishampel, D.B.; Dodson, P.; Osmolska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria, Second Edition. Univ of California Press, Berkeley. pp. 259‚Äì322. . but a 2013 analysis by Philip D. Mannion and colleagues found that the remains possibly belong to more than one species, as they were collected far apart. The metacarpals were concluded to belong to some indeterminate titanosauriform. The sacrum was reported lost in 2013. It was not analyzed and provisionally considered to represent an indeterminate sauropod, until such time that it could be relocated in the collections of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. Only four out of the five sacral vertebrae are preserved. The total original length was in 1960 estimated at , compared to with B. altithorax. This would make it larger than any other sauropod sacrum ever found, except those of Argentinosaurus and Apatosaurus. C =Capitalsaurus= \\"Capitalsaurus\\" vertebra \\"Capitalsaurus\\" is the informal genus name given to the species formerly known as Creosaurus potens and Dryptosaurus potens, a dinosaur from the Arundel Formation of North America. The only known specimen was discovered in Washington, D.C. It was a theropod, and it lived during the Cretaceous. It is a nomen nudum, the name having never been formally published. \\"Capitalsaurus\\" was discovered in January 1898 at the intersection of First and F Streets S.E., in the District of Columbia ‚Äì an intersection now designated as Capitalsaurus Court. It was not uncovered by any paleontological activity, but as a by-product of sewer work. The only known specimen of \\"Capitalsaurus\\" consists of part of a single vertebra. Some paleontologists feel that this is insufficient justification for a name that suggests an entire genus, and that \\"Capitalsaurus\\" is merely an undetermined theropod. Others note that this is hardly the only dinosaur with a common name that does not helpfully reflect its taxonomy. The \\"Capitalsaurus\\" is the official dinosaur of the District of Columbia. =Changdusaurus= \\"Changdusaurus\\" (also known as \\"Changtusaurus\\") is the informal name given to a genus of dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period. It lived in what is now China. \\"Changdusaurus\\" is classified as a stegosaurid. The type species was named \\"Changdusaurus laminoplacodus\\" by Zhao in 1986, but it has never been formally described, and remains a nomen nudum. One source indicates the fossils have been lost. =Coelurosaurus= \\"Coelurosaurus\\" is an informal generic name, attributed to Friedrich von Huene, 1929, that is sometimes seen in lists of dinosaurs. It probably arose as a typographical error; von Huene intended to assign indeterminate remains to Coelurosauria incertae sedis, but at some point in the process of publication a revision to the text made it appear that he was creating a new generic name \\"Coelurosaurus\\" (as described by George Olshevsky in a 1999 post to the Dinosaur Mailing List). The name is undescribed and has not been used seriously, although it has appeared in works of fiction. =Comanchesaurus= \\"Comanchesaurus\\" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur. The remains, NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including vertebral centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of Guadalupe County. Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name \\"Comanchesaurus kuesi\\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a \\"possible indeterminate saurischian\\". D =Dachongosaurus= \\"Dachongosaurus\\" is the informal name given to an undescribed genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of China. It is known from fossils including at least a partial articulated skeleton from the Dark Red Beds of the Lower Lufeng Series (Sinemurian stage) in Yunnan.Zhao, 1985. The reptilian fauna of the Jurassic in China. Pages 286‚Äì289, 347 in Wang, Cheng and Wang (eds.). The Jurassic System of China. Geological Publishing House, Beijing. Possibly a cetiosaur, the \\"type species\\" is \\"Dachongosaurus yunnanensis\\", coined by Zhao in 1985. An alternate spelling is \\"Dachungosaurus\\". As with other informal names coined by Zhao in 1985 and 1983, nothing has since been published, and the remains may have been redescribed under another name. =Damalasaurus= \\"Damalasaurus\\" (meaning \\"Damala lizard\\") is the informal name given to a genus of herbivorous dinosaur from the Early Jurassic. It was a sauropod, though its exact classification within the clade is unknown. Fossils of \\"Damalasaurus\\", including a rib, have been found in the Middle Daye Group of Tibet. Species attributed to this genus include \\"Damalasaurus laticostalis\\" and \\"D. magnus\\". =Duranteceratops= \\"Duranteceratops\\" is a purported new taxon of chasmosaurine ceratopsid from the Hell Creek Formation. In 2012, a ceratopsid skull reportedly distinguishable from Triceratops was unearthed in South Dakota by an amateur fossil hunter named John Carter. Though it has yet to be published, according to the Prehistoric Times issue no. 121 from Spring 2017, the specimen is to be named \\"Duranteceratops\\". E =EK troodontid= The \\"EK troodontid\\" (specimen SPS 100/44) is an unnamed genus of troodontid dinosaur discovered in Mongolia. In the scientific literature it is referred to as the \\"EK troodontid\\", after the Early Cretaceous sediments in which it was found. SPS 100/44 was discovered by S.M. Kurzanov during the 1979 Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition. It was found in deposits of the Barunbayaskaya Svita at the Khamareen Us locality, Dornogov (southeastern Gobi Desert), in the Mongolian People's Republic. SPS 100/44 was described by Rinchen Barsbold and colleagues in 1987.Barsbold, Rhinchen, Osmolska, Halszka, Kurzanov, S.M. (1987). \\"On a new troodontid (Dinosauria. Theropoda) from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia\\". Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 32(1-2): 121-132 Its fossil remains include an incomplete skeleton consisting of the braincase, posterior parts of the lower mandibles, a maxillary fragment with teeth, parts of five cervical vertebrae, an articulated right manus with partial semilunate, left manus phalanx I-1, distal end of the left femur, and fragmentary left and right pedes. Barsbold pointed out that the specimen was smaller and from older sediments than other known troodontids, but it had some features of the skull that could have made it a juvenile. Barsbold also indicated the high degree of fusion of the bones of the skull and the unusual foot morphology to indicate that it might be an adult of an unknown taxon. Barsbold took the conservative position and did not name this specimen because it was not complete enough to rule out the possibility that it was a juvenile of a known genus of troodontid. Barsbold also noted that the naturally articulated manus of SPS 100/44 showed no signs of an opposable third digit, as was suggested for Troodon by Russell and Seguin in 1982. Turner and colleagues, in 2007, found the EK troodontid to be a distinct basal genus of troodontid, in a polytomy with Jinfengopteryx and a clade of more derived troodontids.Turner, Alan H.; Pol, Diego; Clarke, Julia A.; Erickson, Gregory M.; and Norell, Mark (2007) \\"A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight\\" http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/317/5843/1378.pdf \\"Science\\" 317:1378‚Äì1381 doi=10.1126/science.1144066 =Eoplophysis= \\"Eoplophysis\\" is a genus of stegosaur known from the Middle Jurassic Cornbrash Formation, Sharp's Hill Formation, and Chipping Norton Formation of England.http://zoobank.org/NomenclaturalActs/866BDB21-5E62-408E-A999-F8281BD615D5 It was originally named Omosaurus vetustus by the renowned German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene.F. v. Huene. 1910. √úber den √§ltesten Rest von Omosaurus (Dacentrurus) im englischen Dogger [On the oldest remains of Omosaurus (Dacentrurus) from the English Dogger]. Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Mineralogie, Geologie und Pal√§ontologie 1910(1):75-78. The holotype, OUM J.14000, is a right femur of a juvenile individual from the Middle Jurassic (upper Bathonian) Cornbrash Formation of Oxfordshire, England, although it was probably reworked from the slightly older Forest Marble Formation in view of its eroded nature. Because of the renaming of Omosaurus, an occupied name, as Dacentrurus, O. vetustus was renamed into a Dacentrurus vetustus in 1964.O. Kuhn. 1964. Pars 105. Ornithischia (Supplementum I). In F. Westphal (ed.), Fossilium Catalogus. I: Animalia. IJssel Pers, Deventer, The Netherlands 1-80 In the 1980s, researcher Peter Malcolm Galton reviewed all known stegosaur material from the Bathonian of England and concluded that Omosaurus vetustus was valid and should be tentatively referred to Lexovisaurus.Galton, P.M. and Powell, H.P., 1983, \\"Stegosaurian dinosaurs from the Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) of England, the earliest record of the family Stegosauridae\\", Geobios, 16: 219‚Äì229Galton P.M. (1985) \\"British plated dinosaurs (Ornithischia, Stegosauridae), Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 5: 211-254 However, the species was later considered a nomen dubium in both reviews of Stegosauria.Galton, Peter M.; Upchurch, Paul (2004). \\"Stegosauria (Table 16.1).\\" In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press.

Osm√≥lska (editors), University of California Press, Berkeley 435-455 In their alpha-taxonomic review of stegosaurs, Susannah Maidment and her colleagues noted that OUM J.14000 shares characters present in both sauropods and stegosaurs, but that it lacks synapomorphies exclusive to Stegosauria and assigned it as a Dinosauria indet.S. C. R. Maidment, D. B. Norman, P. M. Barrett and P. Upchurch. 2008. Systematics and phylogeny of Stegosauria (Dinosauria: Ornithischia). Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 6(4):367-407 Nevertheless, the amateur paleontologist Roman Ulansky coined the new genus \\"Eoplophysis\\" (\\"Dawn Armed Form\\") for O. vetustus, noting differences with the femora of other stegosaurs. =Eugongbusaurus= \\"Eugongbusaurus\\" skull IVPP 14559 \\"Eugongbusaurus\\" is the informal name (nomen nudum) proposed for a neornithischian found in the Oxfordian-age Shishugou Formation of Xinjiang, China. The intended type species, \\"Gongbusaurus\\" wucaiwanensis, was described by Dong Zhiming in 1989 for two partial skeletons as a second species of the poorly known tooth taxon Gongbusaurus. Fragmentary skeleton IVPP 8302, the type specimen for the new species, included a partial lower jaw, three tail vertebrae, and a partial forelimb. Second specimen IVPP 8303 consisted of two hip vertebrae, eight tail vertebrae, and two complete hind limbs. Dong estimated it as around long, and considered it to be a strong runner. He assigned the genus Gongbusaurus to the Hypsilophodontidae, a paraphyletic grade of small herbivorous bipedal dinosaurs. Because dinosaur teeth are generally not distinctive enough to hold a name, it is unsurprising that other paleontologists have suggested removing \\"G.\\" wucaiwanensis from Gongbusaurus and giving it its own genus. The possible replacement name \\"Eugongbusaurus\\" leaked out accidentally and remains informal. F =Fendusaurus= Fendusaurus is a nomen ex dissertatione proposed by Fedak (2006) for FGM998GF13-II, which includes a skull. Other specimens referred to Fendusaurus are FGM998GF13-I, FGM998GF13-III, FGM998GF69, FGM998GF9, and FGM998GF18, all found by a crew from the Princeton University. All the specimens include femora and coracoids, and although they each share slightly different features, the differences are credited to intra-specific variation. Known specimens of Fendusaurus were previously classified as cf. Ammosaurus. The femora and coracoids also help identify different individuals, and Timothy J. Fedak, the described of the specimens, found that each block represented about one individual. Fendusaurus is known from the Early Jurassic (Hettangian) McCoy Brook Formation of Wasson Bluff, Nova Scotia. As five specimens of Fendusaurus are from the McCoy Brook Formation, the formation is the richest prosauropod site in North America. The formation is also similar to other formations of North America and Asia, as it lacks any remains presently assigned to Anchisaurus. Fedak places Fendusaurus as a genus of the family Massospondylidae.Fedak TJ. Description and evolutionary significance of the sauropodomorph dinosaurs from the Early Jurassic (Hettangian) McCoy Brook Formation. Ph.D. Dissertation, Dalhousie University. 2006. The specimens of Fendusaurus include mostly crushed vertebrae, along with appendicular elements. They are distinguishable from Anchisaurus by the morphology of both the ilium and sacral vertebrae. However, in some specimens, the morphology of the femora and coracoids are quite different, which led Fedak to speculate that more than one species may have been present. Fendusaurus, according to Fedak, can be distinguished from all closely related sauropodomorphs by the extreme elongation of the cervical vertebrae; a four vertebrae sacrum that includes a dorsosacral and caudosacral; the elongate postacetabular process of the ilium; and an expanded anterior distal process of the tibia. =Ferganastegos= \\"Ferganastegos\\" is a dubious genus of stegosaur from the Middle Jurassic (Callovian) Balabansai Formation of Fergana Valley, Kyrgyzstan.Ulansky, R. E., 2014. Evolution of the stegosaurs (Dinosauria; Ornithischia). Dinologia, 35 pp. [in Russian]. [DOWNLOAD PDF]http://dinoweb.narod.ru/Ulansky_2014_Stegosaurs_evolution.pdf.http://zoobank.org/References/5FE177A1-0DA1-4997-83AA-57B12685676D?region=ru The holotype of \\"Ferganastegos callovicus\\", IGB 001, consists of four posterior dorsal vertebrae.Averianov, A.O.; Bakirov, A.A. & Martin, T. 2007. First definitive stegosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan. Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift 81(4):440‚Äì446. Although Averianov et al. did not consider the vertebrae diagnostic to genus, the freelance Russian dinosaur enthusiast and amateur paleontologist Roman Ulansky decided that the differences between IGB 001 and other stegosaurs were sufficient to warrant a binomial for IGB 001, \\"Ferganastegos callovicus\\" (Callovian roof from Fergana Valley), despite the fact he did not examine the material himself. Other researchers still contend that the material is not diagnostic and that the genus is a nomen dubium. =Futabasaurus= \\"Futabasaurus\\" is an informal name for a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Japan, known only from a partial shin bone discovered in the Coniacian-age Ashizawa Formation of the Futaba Group. It was coined by David Lambert in 1990 as a conversion from the Japanese nickname \\"Futaba-ryu\\", for an undescribed theropod. Dong Zhiming and coauthors briefly discussed the fossil shin bone it was based on that same year, publishing a photograph. They considered the bone to belong to an indeterminate tyrannosaurid. If the specimen is eventually described and named, it will require a different name, because the name Futabasaurus has since been used for a genus of plesiosaur. G =Gadolosaurus= Skeleton of \\"Gadolosaurus\\" \\"Gadolosaurus\\" is an informal name given to an undescribed hadrosauroid from the Bayan Shireh Formation of Baishan Tsav, Mongolia.Tsogtbaatar, K., D. Weishampel, D. C. Evans, and M. Watabe. (In review). A New Hadrosauroid (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) from the Late Cretaceous Baynshire Formation of the Gobi Desert (Mongolia). PLOS ONE The name \\"Gadolosaurus\\" was first used in a 1979 book by Japanese paleontologist Tsunemasa Saito, in a caption for a photo of a juvenile dinosaur skeleton. This small individual was only about a meter long (39 inches). The skeleton was part of a Soviet exhibition of fossils in Japan. Apparently, the name comes from a Japanese phonetic translation of the Cyrillic word gadrosavr, or hadrosaur, and was never meant by the Russians to establish a new generic name. Despite being merely a mistranslation of gadrosavr, it appeared in many popular dinosaur books, with varying identifications. Donald F. Glut in 1982 reported it as either an iguanodont or hadrosaur, with no crest or boot on the ischium (the lack of which are both characteristics of the crested lambeosaurine duckbills), and suggested it could be the juvenile of a previously named genus like Tanius or Shantungosaurus. David Lambert in 1983 classified it as an iguanodont, but changed his mind by 1990, when it was listed as a synonym of Arstanosaurus without comment. What may be the same animal is mentioned but not named by David B. Norman and Hans-Dieter Sues in a 2000 book on Mesozoic reptiles from Mongolia and the former USSR; this material, from the Soviet-Mongolian expeditions of the 1970s, had been listed as Arstanosaurus in the Russian Academy of Sciences, and was found in the Cenomanian-age Bayan Shireh Formation of Baishin Tsav. =Gallimimus mongoliensis= \\"Gallimimus mongoliensis\\" skeleton \\"Gallimimus mongoliensis\\" is an informal name Rinchen Barsbold used for a nearly complete skeleton (IGM 100/14) known from the Bayan Shireh Formation, but since it differs from Gallimimus in some details, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and Barsbold proposed in 2006 that it probably belongs to a different genus. =Gspsaurus= \\"Gspsaurus\\" (a nomen manuscriptum) is a titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Vitakri Formation of Sulaiman Basin of Pakistan. It has been suggested to be synonymous with the also invalid taxon \\"Maojandino\\", also proposed by Malkani.Malkani, M.S., 2015. Dinosaurs, Mesoeucrocodiles, Pterosaurs, New Fauna and Flora from Pakistan. Geological Survey of Pakistan, Information Release 823: 1-32.Malkani, M.S., 2020. First Skull of Medium Sized Titanosaur in Indo-Pakistan Subcontinent Found from the Latest Maastrichtian Vitakri Formation of Pakistan; Associated Cranial and Postcranial Skeletons of Gspsaurus pakistani (Poripuchia, Stocky Titanosauria, Sauropoda) from Pakistan and India. Open Journal of Geology 10(4): 448-489. =Grusimimus= \\"Grusimimus\\" (or \\"Tsurumimus\\") is an informal name for an undescribed genus of ornithomimid from the Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian‚ÄìBarremian) aged Shinekhudag Formation of Mongolia. Known from a skeleton including all regions except the skull, \\"Grusimimus\\" was given an invalid name in 1997 by Rinchen Barsbold, who also suggested the species name \\"tsuru\\". The specimen (GIN 960910KD) was found in 1996 and examined by Barsbold before he suggested the informal name, a nomen nudum. An abstract and poster were presented on the taxon by Kobayashi & Barsbold in 2002, and the former published a thesis paper on the specimen (referred to as \\"Ornithomimosauria indet.\\") which found the taxon to be close to Harpymimus phylogenetically but possible more derived. H =Hanwulosaurus= \\"Hanwulosaurus\\" is the informal name given to an as- yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was an ankylosaur around long, which is long for an ankylosaur. Its fossils were found in Inner Mongolia, China. Much of a skeleton, including a complete skull, vertebrae, ribs, a scapula, an ulna, femorae, bones from the shin, and armor, was discovered; this may be the most complete ankylosaurian skeleton yet found in Asia, according to early reports. Zhao Xijin, who has studied it, suggests that it may belong to its own subgroup within the Ankylosauria. The name first surfaced in news reports in 2001. =Heilongjiangosaurus= \\"Heilongjiangosaurus\\" (meaning \\"Heilongjiang lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as-yet undescribed genus of duckbilled dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It possibly was a lambeosaurine, and may in fact be the same animal as Charonosaurus. The fossils were found in Maastrichtian-age rocks in Heilongjiang, China. As a nomen nudum, it is unclear what material it was intended to be based on, but might be connected to the nomen nudum \\"Mandschurosaurus\\" jiainensis, informally named in a 1983 publication. The \\"type species\\" is \\"H. jiayinensis\\", and it was coined in 2001 in a faunal list by Li and Jin. =Hironosaurus= \\"Hironosaurus\\" (meaning \\"Hirono lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as-yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. Found in Hirono, Fukushima, Japan, it was probably a type of hadrosaur, although no subfamily identification has been made. The fossils are quite fragmentary, and consist of teeth and a vertebra, possibly from the tail. Since the fossils have never been fully described in a scientific paper, \\"Hironosaurus\\" is considered a nomen nudum. It was first mentioned by Hisa in an obscure 1988 publication and was later (1990) brought to a wider audience by David Lambert. Dong Zhiming, Y. Hasegawa, and Y. Azuma regarded the material as belonging to a hadrosaurid, but lacking any characteristics to allow more precise identification (thus indeterminate). =Hisanohamasaurus= \\"Hisanohamasaurus\\" (meaning \\"Hisano-hama lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It is a nomen nudum known only from teeth that first appeared in a general-audience dinosaur book by David Lambert in 1990. Although initially identified a diplodocid,Zhiming, Dong; Y. Hasegawa; and Y. Azuma (1990). The Age of Dinosaurs in Japan and China. Fukui, Japan: Fukui Prefectural Museum. it later re-identified as a nemegtosaurid similar to Nemegtosaurus.M. Matsukawa and I. Obata. 1994. Dinosaurs and sedimentary environments in the Japanese Cretaceous: a contribution to dinosaur facies in Asia based on molluscan palaeontology and stratigraphy. Cretaceous Research 15(1):101-125 As its name suggests, its fossils were found in Japan. The location is part of Iwaki, Fukushima. I =Ichabodcraniosaurus= \\"Ichabodcraniosaurus\\" is an informal name for theropod fossils were first discovered within the Gobi Desert in China. The remains consist of a partial skeleton without a head (IGM 100/980), from which its name refers to the fictional character Ichabod Crane, a character in the history of Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, where he was pursued by a headless horseman. Fossils include a hyoid bone, cervical vertebrae, a supposed skull and a supposed jaw bone. \\"Ichabodcraniosaurus\\" was named by Novacek in 1996.Novacek, Michael J. (1996). Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs. New York: Anchor Books. . This specimen may belong to Velociraptor mongoliensis, but Norell and Makovicky concluded that it was not complete enough to say for sure, and it awaits a formal description. J =Jiangjunmiaosaurus= \\"Jiangjunmiaosaurus\\" is an informal name created by an anonymous author in 1987 for a possible chimaera of Monolophosaurus and Sinraptor. =Jindipelta= \\"Jindipelta\\" (Lei et al., 2019; in press) is the currently informal name given to an ankylosaur from the Zhumapu Formation in China. It is known from a partial skeleton found in Cenomanian rocks. The name was first announced in the 2019 SVP abstract book, alongside the megalosauroid Yunyangosaurus.http://vertpaleo.org/Annual- Meeting/Annual-Meeting-Home/SVP-Program-book-v5_w-covers.aspx =Julieraptor= Cast of Julieraptor \\"Julieraptor\\" is the nickname of a dromaeosaurid fossil found in the Judith River Formation, Montana in 2002. Parts of the same skeleton were illegally excavated and nickamed Sid Vicious in 2006, and the excavator subsequently served jail time for the theft. Bob Bakker therefore also nicknamed the specimen \\"Kleptoraptor\\". The skeleton was arranged to be sold to Royal Ontario Museum. It is known from a skeleton consisting of an almost complete skeleton missing most of its skull, most tail vertebra, part of the femur, some spinal and neck vertebra, one claw but it has a well preserved braincase. K =Kagasaurus= \\"Kagasaurus\\" (meaning \\"Kaga lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous. It was a theropod which lived in what is now Japan. The type species was named by Hisa in 1988, but is known from only two teeth. Since \\"Kagasaurus\\" has never been formally described, it is considered a nomen nudum. Unlike \\"Kitadanisaurus\\" and Katsuyamasaurus, it is unlikely that \\"Kagasaurus\\" is synonymous with Fukuiraptor, and may instead be a dromaeosaurid. =Katsuyamasaurus= \\"Katsuyamasaurus\\" is an informal name for a genus of intermediate theropod known from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) of the Kitadani Formation, Japan. Known from a single middle caudal vertebra and an ulna, the taxon was informally called \\"Katsuyama-ryu\\", until Lambert (1990) made it into an invalid genus name, \\"Katsuyamasaurus\\". The caudal vertebra was suggested to belong to an ornithopod by Chure (2000), and Olshevsky (2000) suggested the material was a synonym of Fukuiraptor. However, the ulna differs from Fukuiraptor, and the large olecranon suggests the taxon falls outside Maniraptoriformes. =Kelmayisaurus gigantus= \\"Kelmayisaurus gigantus\\" is an informal name for a genus of sauropod known from the Cretaceous. The type species of Kelmayisaurus, K. petrolicus, was first named and described by Chinese paleontologist Dong Zhiming in 1973.Dong, Z. (1973). \\"Dinosaurs from Wuerho\\". Reports of Paleontological Expedition to Sinkiang (II): Pterosaurian Fauna from Wuerho, Sinkiang. Memoirs of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Academia Sinica 11: 45-52. A supposed second species, K. \\"gigantus\\", was mentioned by Grady in a children book in 1993 as a gigantic vertebral column coming from a 22 m long specimen,Grady, 1993. The Dinosaur Project: The Story of the Greatest Dinosaur Expedition Ever Mounted. Edmonton: Ex Terra Foundation; Toronto: Macfarlane Walter & Ross. . 261 pp. but is a nomen nudum and probably does not pertain to Kelmayisaurus. It may be a sauropod instead.http://dml.cmnh.org/2003Jul/msg00355.html =Khetranisaurus= \\"Khetranisaurus\\" (meaning \\"Khetran lizard\\", for the Khetran people of Pakistan) is an informal taxon of titanosaurian sauropod from the Late Cretaceous of Balochistan, western Pakistan (also spelled \\"Khateranisaurus\\" in some early reports). The proposed species is \\"K. barkhani\\", described by M. Sadiq Malkani in 2006, and it is based on a tail vertebra, found in the Maastrichtian-age Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation. It was assigned to \\"Pakisauridae\\" (used as a synonym of Titanosauridae), along with \\"Pakisaurus\\" and \\"Sulaimanisaurus\\". =Koreanosaurus= \\"Koreanosaurus\\" (meaning \\"Korean lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as-yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous. It was a possible dromaeosaur (or similar theropod) which lived in what is now Korea, although at times it has been referred to the Tyrannosauridae and Hypsilophodontidae. Based solely on a femur, the name was coined by Kim in 1979, but by 1993 Kim decided that it was a species of Deinonychus, and created the informal name \\"D.\\" \\"koreanensis\\".Kim, 1993. Journal of Natural History and Environments 1(1). World Society of Natural History and Environments:Pusan University, Pusan, Korea. ISSN 1225-6404. =Kunmingosaurus= \\"Kunmingosaurus\\" is an informally named primitive sauropod which lived during the Early Jurassic. Its fossils were found in Yunnan Province, China in 1954. The type and only species is \\"Kunmingosaurus wudingensis\\", invalidly coined by Zhao in 1985. It is known from fossils found in the Fengjiahe Formation (or the Lower Lufeng Series), including pelvic, hind limb, and vertebral material.Barrett, P M. 1999.

The \\"type species\\", \\"L. cachuensis\\", was coined by Zhou in 1985, but remains a nomen nudum. It is known from the Dapuka Group of Tibet. =Lijiagousaurus= \\"Lijiagousaurus\\" (meaning \\"Lijiagou lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of herbivorous iguanodontian dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of what is now Sichuan, China. It has not been formally described yet, but the formal publication is forthcoming, from Chinese paleontologist Ouyang Hui. \\"Lijiagousaurus\\" was only briefly mentioned in the Chongqing Natural History Museum guidebook (2001) and is thus a nomen nudum.Anonymous (2001). Chongqing Natural History Museum guidebook. =Likhoelesaurus= \\"Likhoelesaurus\\" (meaning \\"Li Khole lizard\\") is the name given to an as yet undescribed genus of archosauriform, either a dinosaur or rauisuchian, from the Late Triassic of what is now South Africa. The name was coined by Ellenberger in 1970, and the \\"type species\\" is \\"Likhoelesaurus ingens\\".Ellenberger, 1970.

M =Magulodon= \\"Magulodon\\" is the name given to an as yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian to Albian stages, approximately 112 million years ago). It was a possible ornithischian, either an ornithopod or basal ceratopsian, which lived in what is now Maryland, in the United States. The type species, \\"Magulodon muirkirkensis\\", was coined by Kranz in 1996.Kranz, P. (1996). Notes on the sedimentary iron ores of Maryland and their dinosaurian faunas. Maryland Geological Survey Special Publications 3:87-115. It is a tooth taxon, based solely on a single tooth. Since it has not been formally described, it is also a nomen nudum. It was considered to be an indeterminate specimen in a paper which cited the intended type specimen but avoided using the name to prevent taxonomic clutter.Chinnery, B.J., Lipka, T.R., Kirkland, J.I., Parrish, J.M., and Brett- Surman, M.K.

The type species is \\"M. jeffi\\", described by M. Sadiq Malkani in 2006, and it is based on tail vertebrae, found in the Maastrichtian-age Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation. Much additional material, including a partial skull, many vertebrae, and a few hindlimb bones, was referred to this genus. \\"Marisaurus\\" was assigned to \\"Balochisauridae\\" with \\"Sulaimanisaurus\\", although the family was used as a synonym of Saltasauridae.M.

It was a titanosaur sauropod which lived in what is now China. The type species, \\"Megacervixosaurus tibetensis\\", was coined by Chinese paleontologist Zhao Xijin in 1985. \\"Megacervixosaurus\\" has never been formally described, and remains a nomen nudum.Zhao X.

It was theropod, possibly a tetanuran which lived in what is now England. The type species, \\"Merosaurus newmani\\", was coined by paleontologists Samuel Welles, H.P. Powell, and A. Pickering in 1995, and is based solely on some leg bones (a knee joint) once thought to belong to Scelidosaurus.Mortimer, M (2004) \\"The Theropod Database\\" . University of Washington.

Its fossils were found in the late Campanian-age Dinosaur Park Formation, in Alberta, Canada. Not much is known about this dinosaur, as it has not yet been fully described; it is therefore a nomen nudum. The fossils of \\"Microcephale\\", including tiny skull caps, were first mentioned by paleontologist Paul Sereno in 1997, in a list of pachycephalosaurids. These skull caps measure less than 5 cm (2 in) each. No potential species name was given. =Microdontosaurus= \\"Microdontosaurus\\" (meaning \\"tiny-toothed lizard\\") is the name given to an as yet undescribed genus of sauropod dinosaur from China. It was named from fossils from the Middle Jurassic-age Dapuka Group of Xinjiang. The intended type species is \\"M. dayensis.\\" As with other informal names created by Zhao in 1985 or 1983, it has not been used since then, and may have been redescribed under another name. =Mifunesaurus= \\"Mifunesaurus\\" (meaning 'Mifune lizard') is a nomen nudum given to an extinct non-avian theropod dinosaur from Cenomanian rocks of Japan. \\"Mifunesaurus\\" is only known from a few bones, among which are a tibia, a phalanx, a metatarsus and a single tooth. The genus was informally coined by Hisa in 1985.Lambert, D., and the Diagram Group. (1990). The Dinosaur Data Book . Facts on File: Oxford, England, 320 p. =Moshisaurus= The \\"Moshisaurus\\" humerus Hisa (1985) used \\"Moshisaurus\\" (or \\"Moshi-ryu\\") for sauropod remains from the Early Cretaceous Miyako Group of Japan. Dong et al. (1990) and Hasegawa et al. (1991) referred them to Mamenchisaurus, but Azuma & Tomida (1998) and Barrett et al. (2002) assigned them to Sauropoda indet.Hasegawa Y, Manabe M, Hanai T, Kase T, Oji T. 1991. A diplodocoid dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Miyako Group of Japan.

N =Newtonsaurus = Illustration of the \\"Newtonsaurus\\" dentary mold in internal and external views \\"Newtonsaurus\\" is an informally named genus erected for the theropod dinosaur species Zanclodon cambrensis, which was discovered in the Lilstock Formation in 1898. It was probably a ceratosaur, which lived in what is now the United Kingdom. The taxon was reassigned to Megalosaurus due to the taxonomic difficulties associated with Zanclodon. It is based on a mold of a dentary from Rhaetian-age beds in Wales (hence the species name), and is one of the relatively few dinosaurs known from the time near the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic boundary.Newton, E.T. (1899). On a megalosaurid jaw from Rhaetic beds near Bridgend (Glamorganshire). Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 55:89-96. Paleontologists have avoided using the name \\"Newtonsaurus\\" since its appearance in 1999 in private publications, although \\"Zanclodon\\" cambrensis or Megalosaurus cambrensis have both been used for this taxon. =Ngexisaurus= \\"Ngexisaurus\\" is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic Dapuka Group of Tibet, China. The type species, \\"Ngexisaurus dapukaensis\\", was coined by Zhao in 1983.Zhao, X. (1983). \\"Phylogeny and evolutionary stages of Dinosauria.\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 28(1-2); 295-306.Zhao, X. (1985). [The Jurassic Reptilia]. [The Jurassic System of China. Stratigraphy of China, No. 11] 286-290.Weishampel, David B; et al. (2004). \\"Dinosaur distribution (Middle Jurassic, Asia).\\" In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd Edition, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 541‚Äì542. . =Nicksaurus= \\"Nicksaurus\\" is an informally named Titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous red muds of the Vitakri Formation of Sulaiman Basin, Pakistan. The dinosaur shared a habitat with other sauropod dinosaurs including Khetranisaurus, Sulaimanisaurus, Pakisaurus, Gspsaurus, Saraikimasoom, and Maojandino. =Nurosaurus= A close-up of the head of \\"Nurosaurus qaganensis\\". \\"Nurosaurus\\" (Nur-o-saw-rus, meaning \\"Nur lizard\\") is the informal name for a genus of sauropod dinosaur. It is known from a partial, large skeleton, that was presented as soon-to-be-described by Zhiming Dong in 1992, where he gave the proposed binomial \\"Nurosaurus qaganensis\\". It was discovered in the Qagannur Formation of Inner Mongolia, southeast of Erenhot. The deposit is younger than the Psittacosaurus-bearing Guyang Group, but is still Early Cretaceous. It was found alongside the plates and scapula of a stegosaur. The foot of \\"Nurosaurus\\" is notable for a stress fracture present on the first of the fourth digit of the left foot, which was the first identified fracture of its kind, and have since been identified on the phalanges and metatarsals of Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus. O =Orcomimus= \\"Orcomimus\\" (Pronounced or-coh-MEEM-us) is the name given to an as yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period 66 million years ago. The dinosaur was an ornithomimid which lived in what is now South Dakota, in the United States. The type was coined by Michael Triebold in 1997, but has never been formally described and is currently a nomen nudum. \\"Orcomimus\\" was a bipedal theropod, but the dinosaur is known from only a pelvis and a hindlimb. \\"Orcomimus\\" is thought to be relatively advanced for other ornithomimids at the time, although this is hard to tell from the limited amount of specimens found of the dinosaur.Triebold, M. (1997). \\"The Sandy site: Small dinosaurs from the Hell Creek Formation of South Dakota.\\" in Wolberg, D., Stump, E. and Rosenberg, G. (eds); Dinofest International: Proceedings of a Symposium. Arizona State University Academy of Natural Science. 245-48 It may be referable to one of the ornithomimosaur species currently known from the Hell Creek Formation. =Oshanosaurus= \\"Oshanosaurus\\" (meaning \\"Oshan lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic period of Yunnan, China. Its fossils were found in the Lower Lufeng Series. The intended \\"type species\\", \\"Oshanosaurus youngi\\", was coined by Zhao in 1985. It has sometimes been associated with heterodontosaurids, which appears to be due to the juxtaposition of a species of Dianchungosaurus (formerly thought to be a heterodontosaurid) in the text of Zhao (1985). P =Pakisaurus= \\"Pakisaurus\\" (meaning \\"Pakistan lizard\\") is an informal taxon of titanosaurian sauropod from the Late Cretaceous of Balochistan, western Pakistan. The proposed species is \\"P. balochistani\\", and it was validly named by M. Sadiq Malkani in 2006, based on four tail vertebrae, found in the Maastrichtian-age Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation. Three additional tail vertebrae have been assigned to it. The author erected the family \\"Pakisauridae\\", using it synonymously with older Titanosauridae. \\"Pakisaurus\\" was decided to be closely related to \\"Sulaimanisaurus\\" and \\"Khetranisaurus\\", both from Pakistan as well. =Podischion= \\"Podischion\\" is an informal genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur known from a skeleton discovered in 1911 on the Red Deer River in Alberta by a crew led by Barnum Brown. The remains were tentatively named \\"Podischion\\", which was not mentioned in published literature until Dingus & Norell (2010). It is possible that the skeleton represents an individual of Hypacrosaurus. R =Ronaldoraptor= Cast of \\"Ronaldoraptor\\" \\"Ronaldoraptor\\", also known as the ‚ÄúMitrata‚Äù Oviraptorid, is an undescribed oviraptorid from MongoliaGee, H. & Rey, L. V. 2003.

It was a sauropod, possibly a cetiosaurid,Delair, J.B., and Sarjeant, W.A.S. (2002). The earliest discoveries of dinosaurs: the records re-examined. Proceedings of the Geologists' Association 113:185‚Äì197. which lived in what is now England. The specimen, called \\"Rutellum impicatum\\", was described in 1699 by Edward Lhuyd,Lhuyd, E. (1699). Lithophylacii Britannici Ichnographia, sive lapidium aliorumque fossilium Britannicorum singulari figura insignium. Gleditsch and Weidmann:London. and is notable as the earliest named entity that is recognizable as a dinosaur. It was based on a tooth collected from Caswell, near Witney, Oxfordshire.Gunther, R.T. (1945). Early Science in Oxford: Life and Letters of Edward Lhuyd, volume 14. Author:Oxford. Because \\"Rutellum impicatum\\" was named before 1758 (the official starting date for zoological nomenclature according to the ICZN), it is not considered a part of modern biological nomenclature. S =Sabinosaurus= \\"Sabinosaurus\\" mount \\"Sabinosaurus\\" or \\"Sabinosaurio\\" is a name used for a partial skeleton from the Sabinas Basin in Mexico. It was initially described as Kritosaurus sp. by Jim Kirkland and colleagues, but considered an indeterminate saurolophine by Prieto-M√°rquez (2014). This skeleton is about 20% larger than other known specimens, around 11 meters [36 ft] long, and with a distinctively curved ischium, and represents the largest known well-documented North American saurolophine. Unfortunately, the nasal bones are also incomplete in the skull remains from this material. =Saldamosaurus= \\"Saldamosaurus\\" is an informal genus of stegosaurid dinosaur known from a complete braincase discovered in the Early Cretaceous Saldam Formation of Siberia, Russia. The type species, \\"Saldamosaurus tuvensis\\", was named in 2014 but according to Galton and Carpenter (2016) it did not meet the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and is hence a nomen nudum,.Ulansky, R. E., 2014. Evolution of the stegosaurs (Dinosauria; Ornithischia). Dinologia, 35 pp. [in Russian]. =Saltillomimus= Skeleton of \\"Saltillomimus\\" \\"Saltillomimus\\" is an informal name for an ornithomimid theropod from the Late Cretaceous (late Campanian) of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation in Mexico. It is known from a partial tail, most of a hindlimb, and forelimb bones that was given the name \\"Saltillomimus rapidus\\" by Martinez in 2010. Named in his thesis, the taxon name is an invalid nomen ex dissertatione. =Sanchusaurus= \\"Sanchusaurus\\" (meaning \\"Lizard from Sanchu\\") is an informal name for an ornithomimosaur dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous period of Asia. It is only known by a partial tail vertebra, found in Nakasato, Japan. Dong (1990) considered it synonymous with Gallimimus but the large discrepancy in both age and location between the two species renders this opinion untenable. The genus has not been formally described and is considered a nomen nudum. It was first mentioned by Hisa in 1985. =Saraikimasoom= \\"Saraikimasoom\\" (meaning 'Innocent one') is an invalid species of titanosaur dinosaur from the Vitakri Formation in Pakistan. The type species, Saraikimasoom vitakri, was described by Sadiq Malkhani in 2015, in a paper describing multiple Pakistani dinosaurs, such as Gspsaurus, \\"Nicksaurus\\" and \\"Maojandino\\". Saraikimasoom is currently recognised as a nomen manuscriptum. =Shake-N-Bake theropod= The \\"Shake-N- Bake theropod\\" is an undescribed species of coelophysoid from the Kayenta Formation.Tykoski, R.

According to Galton and Carpenter (2016) it did not meet the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.Ulansky, R. E., 2014. Evolution of the stegosaurs (Dinosauria; Ornithischia). Dinologia, 35 pp. [in Russian]. PDF. \\"Siamodracon\\" was the first thyreophoran dinosaur discovered in South East Asia. =Sidormimus= \\"Sidormimus\\" is an informal genus of noasaurid discovered in the Elrhaz Formation in Niger. It was discovered in 2000 by Chris Sidor and it was immediately described by Lyon on the Project Exploration website, with a photograph of the holotype.Lyon, 2000. https://web.archive.org/web/20121024124915/http://www.projectexploration.org/niger2000/9_15_2000.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20001208070300/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/dinoquest/profile_01_dispatch2b.html During the same year, on the National Geographic website, the same photograph of the holotype was labelled \\"Dongosaurus\\". In 2005, Sidor himself confirmed that \\"Sidormimus\\" was the Elrhaz noasaurid. \\"Sidormimus\\" has been mentioned by Paul Sereno three times.Sereno, Wilson and Conrad, 2004. New dinosaurs link southern landmasses in the Mid-Cretaceous. Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series B. 271, 1325-1330.Sereno and Brusatte, 2008.

Noasaurid (Theropoda: Abelisauroidea) skeleton from Africa shows derived skeletal proportions and function. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Program and Abstracts 2010, 162A. \\"Sidormimus\\" is known from a partial post cranial skeleton. Its neck and ribs were exposed when the holotype was discovered. =Sinopeltosaurus= \\"Sinopeltosaurus\\" is a dubious genus of extinct scelidosaurid ornithischian dinosaur described by Roman Ulansky. The type and only species is \\"S. minimus\\" of the lower Jurassic Lufeng Formation of Yunnan China, based on an articulated set of ankle bones. In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter identified it as a nomen dubium, and listed it as Ornithischia indet., possible Thyreophora indet.Ulansky, R. E., 2014. Evolution of the stegosaurs (Dinosauria; Ornithischia). Dinologia, 35 pp. [in Russian]. [DOWNLOAD PDF] http://dinoweb.narod.ru/Ulansky_2014_Stegosaurs_evolution.pdf.Ulansky, R. E., 2014. Evolution of the stegosaurs (Dinosauria; Ornithischia). Dinologia, 35 pp. [in Russian]. [DOWNLOAD PDF] http://dinoweb.narod.ru/Ulansky_2014_Dinoclass_Stegosauria.pdf Ulansky variously referred to it as \\"Sinopeltosaurus minimus\\" or \\"Sinopelta minima\\"; Galton and Carpenter, as the first revisers under ICZN, made the former official. =Skaladromeus= Skeletal diagram of \\"Skaladromeus\\" \\"Skaladromeus\\" or the \\"Kaiparowits ornithopod\\" is an ornithopod from the Kaiparowits Formation named in a 2012 thesis by Clint Boyd. The intended type species is \\"Skaladromeus goldenii\\". =Suciasaurus= The upper femur of \\"Suciasaurus\\" A fossil theropod nicknamed \\"Suciasaurus rex\\" was discovered in 2012 at Sucia Island State Park in San Juan County of the U.S. State of Washington. It was the first dinosaur discovered in Washington state. The finding was announced when Burke Museum paleontologists published a discovery paper in PLoS ONE. Prompted by a petition from students at an elementary school at Parkland, near Tacoma, the Washington State Legislature introduced a bill in 2019 to make it the official state dinosaur. =Sugiyamasaurus= \\"Sugiyamasaurus\\" (meaning \\"Sugiyama lizard\\") is the informal name given to a few spatulate teeth belonging to a titanosauriform, possibly Fukuititan, which lived in Japan during the Early Cretaceous. The name was first printed by David Lambert in 1990 in the Dinosaur Data Book, and also appears in Lambert's Ultimate Dinosaur Book and in many on-line lists of dinosaurs. Since it has not been formally described, \\"Sugiyamasaurus\\" is a nomen nudum. Remains were found near Katsuyama City and were initially referred to Camarasauridae, but might belong to Fukutitan because they were unearthed in the same quarry as the Fukuititan material.Dong, Hasegawa and Azuma, 1990. The Age of Dinosaurs in Japan and China. Fukui, Japan: Fukui Prefectural Museum. 65 pp.Azuma, 1991. Early Cretaceous Dinosaur Fauna from the Tetori Group, central Japan. Research on Dinosaurs from the Tetori Group (1). Professor S. Miura Memorial Volume, 55-69. =Sulaimanisaurus= \\"Sulaimanisaurus\\" (meaning \\"Sulaiman lizard\\", for the Sulaiman foldbelt) is an informal taxon of titanosaurian sauropod from the Late Cretaceous of Balochistan, western Pakistan (also spelled \\"Sulaimansaurus\\" in some early reports). The proposed species is \\"S. gingerichi\\", described by M. Sadiq Malkani in 2006, and it is based on seven tail vertebra, found in the Maastrichtian-age Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation. Four additional tail vertebrae have been assigned to it. It was considered to be related to \\"Pakisaurus\\" and \\"Khetranisaurus\\" in the family \\"Pakisauridae\\" (used as a synonym of Titanosauridae). T =Teihivenator= Syntype tyrannosauroid tibia AMNH 2550 given the name \\"Teihivenator\\" \\"Teihivenator\\" (\\"strong hunter\\") is an improperly named taxon of tyrannosauroid coelurosaur from the Navesink Formation of New Jersey. It was suggested to contain the species, \\"T.\\" macropus, originally classified as a species of Dryptosaurus (= \\"Laelaps\\", a name preoccupied by a mite). It was suggested as a separate genus in 2017 by Chan-gyu Yun. The name \\"Teihivenator\\" is invalid because the publication naming it is online-only, which means that a registration with ZooBank is required to be present in the article when published. However, the ZooBank registry was only added in after initial publication, meaning that it fails the requirement to be a validly published taxon. In 2017, a preprint paper by Chase Brownstein concluded that the remains of L. macropus are a mixture of tyrannosauroid and ornithomimid elements with no distinguishing characteristics, rendering the species a chimera and a nomen dubium. In 2018, Brownstein stated that a tibia of L. macropus catalogued as specimen AMNH FARB 2550 represents a tyrannosauroid that probably was distinct from Dryptosaurus, but not sufficiently to base a taxon on. =Tiantaisaurus= \\"Tiantaisaurus\\", alternatively spelled \\"Tiantaiosaurus\\", is the name given to a specimen of therizinosaur from the Aptian age Laijia Formation of Zhejiang Province, China. According to correspondence through the Dinosaur Mailing List, the former name (from a 2012 study) was the one intended to be use for an official description. After being discovered in 2005, it was first mentioned named in an unpublished manuscript written in 2007. The given species was named \\"T. sifengensis\\". The specimen consists of an ischium, an astragalus, a tibia, a femur, an incomplete pubis and ilium, and a large number of vertebrae from across the body. =Tonouchisaurus= \\"Tonouchisaurus\\" (meaning \\"Tonouchi lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Period. It was a theropod which lived in what is now Mongolia. The suggested \\"type species\\", \\"Tonouchisaurus mongoliensis\\", was coined by Barsbold in 1994. It was notably small: less than in length. It may have been a tyrannosaurid, judging by the known skeletal elements, which include only limb bones. These limb bones include \\"a complete didactyl manus and complete pes, as well as other limb bones\\" (Olshevsky 1996). V =Valdosaurus dextrapoda= In 1998 William Blows inadvertently named another species of Valdosaurus, \\"V. dextrapoda\\", by including this name in a fauna list,Blows, W.T., 1998, \\"A review of Lower and Middle Cretaceous dinosaurs of England\\", New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, Albuquerque 14: 29-38 but this was an error, and the species has never been supported.Martill, D.M. and Naish, D., 2001, \\"Ornithopod dinosaurs.\\" Pages 60-132 in Martill, D.M. and Naish, D. (eds.). Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight, The Palaeontological Association, London.Galton, P.M., 2009, \\"Notes on Neocomian (Late Cretaceous) ornithopod dinosaurs from England - Hypsilophodon, Valdosaurus, \\"Camptosaurus\\", \\"Iguanodon\\" - and referred specimens from Romania and elsewhere\\", Revue de Pal√©obiologie 28(1): 211-273 Lacking description, it is a nomen nudum. =Vectensia= In 1982 Justin Delair informally named the genus \\"Vectensia\\" based on specimen GH 981.45, an armour plate. Like the holotype of Polacanthus it was found at Barnes High, but reportedly in an older layer, of the Lower Wessex Formation.Delair, J.B., 1982, \\"Notes on an armoured dinosaur from Barnes High, Isle of Wight\\", Proceedings of the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society for 1980, 7(5): 297-302 Blows in 1987 tentatively referred it to Polacanthus.Blows W.T. (1987). The armoured dinosaur Polacanthus foxi, from the Lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight, Palaeontology. 30, 557‚Äì580 =Vitakridrinda= \\"Vitakridrinda\\" is a genus of abelisaurid theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Balochistan, western Pakistan. The intended type species is \\"V. sulaimani\\". The discovery was made (along with other dinosaur specimens) near Vitariki by a team of palaeontologists from the Geological Survey of Pakistan, in rocks from the Maastrichtian-age Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation. Formally described in 2006 by M.S. Malkani, the genus is based on partial remains including two thigh bones, a braincase, and a tooth. A partial snout was later found that Malkani assigned to the holotype, and additional vertebrae may also belong to this genus. However, the snout was later reclassified as a new genus of mesoeucrocodylian, Induszalim.Malkani M.S. 2015a. Terrestrial mesoeucrocodiles from the Cretaceous of Pakistan. In: Zhang Y., Wu S.Z., Sun G. eds., abstract volume, 12th Symposium on ‚ÄúMesozoic Terrestrial Ecosystems (MTE 12), and 3rd Symposium of International Geoscience Program (IGCP 608) ‚ÄúCretaceous Ecosystem of Asia and Pacific‚Äù August 15‚Äì20, 2015, Paleontological Museum of Liaoning/Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China, 242-246.Malkani, M.S., 2015b.

Thomas Holtz gave a possible length of 6 meters (19.7 feet). It is, however, a possible nomen nudum.https://www.deviantart.com/carnoferox/art/Dinosaur-Names- to-Avoid-Using-784219870 =Vitakrisaurus= \\"Vitakrisaurus\\" is a genus of noasaurid theropod dinosaurs represented by only one known species, \\"Vitakrisaurus saraiki\\", which is the intended type species. It lived in the late Cretaceous period, approximately 70 million years ago, during the Maastrichtian, in what is today the Indian subcontinent. Its fossils were found in Pakistan's Vitraki Formation. The holotype specimen, MSM-303-2 is a right foot with a seemingly tridactyl form and robust phalanges. It may belong to Noasauridae due to similarities with the foot of Velocisaurus, although inconsistencies within its brief description and a lack of comparison with other theropods within the article makes formal classification difficult. The generic name references the Vitakri Member of the Pab Formation and combines this with the Greek suffix \\"saurus\\", meaning \\"reptile\\". The specific name honours the Saraiki people, who primarily live in southern Pakistan. However, like most dinosaur taxa named by M. Sadiq Malkani, it is probably a nomen nudum X =Xinghesaurus= Skeletal mount of \\"Xinghesaurus\\" from a Japanese fossil expo \\"Xinghesaurus\\" was the name given to a species of sauropod dinosaur, possibly a titanosauriform, in 2009, in the guidebook for the dinosaur expo \\"Miracle of Deserts\\". No species name was given for the genus. Y =Yuanmouraptor= \\"Yuanmouraptor\\" or \\"Yuenmeuraptor\\" is an informally named carnosaur from Yuanmou County, China. It lived during the Middle Jurassic, around 174 and 163 million years ago, and it is known from ZLJ0115, which is a complete, articulated skull on display at an unknown Chinese museum (possibly the Lufeng Dinosaur Museum), alongside a reconstructed skeleton of \\"Yuanmouraptor\\". \\"Yuanmouraptor\\" was briefly mentioned in a 2014 guide book. =Yibinosaurus= \\"Yibinosaurus\\" (meaning \\"Yibin lizard\\") is the informal name given to an as yet undescribed genus of herbivorous dinosaur from the Early Jurassic. It was a sauropod which lived in what is now Sichuan, China. The suggested \\"type species\\", \\"Yibinosaurus zhoui\\", has not been formally described yet, but the formal publication is forthcoming, from Chinese paleontologist Ouyang Hui. \\"Yibinosaurus\\" was only briefly mentioned in the Chongqing Natural History Museum guidebook (2001) and is thus a nomen nudum. =Yunxianosaurus= \\"Yunxianosaurus\\" is the provisional name for a genus of titanosaurian dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous of what is now Hubei Province, China. The type species, \\"Yunxianosaurus hubeinensis\\", was proposed by Chinese paleontologist Li Zhengqi in 2001. The fossils of \\"Yunxianosaurus\\" were found near the Nanyang Prefecture. Li stated that the name \\"Yunxianosaurus\\" was a temporary label for ease of description, but that further field work and study of the fossils would be required before the genus could be given an official name.Li, Zhengqi. (2001). Distribution, burying and classification of dinosaur fossils in Upper Cretaceous strata at Meipu Town, Yunxian County of Hubei Province. Hubei Geology & Mineral Resources, 15(4)(Total No 37): 25-31. Z =Zamyn Khondt oviraptorid= Zamyn Khondt oviraptorid Zamyn Khondt oviraptorid is a nickname for oviraptorid specimen IGM or GIN 100/42. Since the type skull of Oviraptor is so poorly preserved and crushed, the skull of IGM 100/42 has become the quintessential depiction of that dinosaur, even appearing in scientific papers with the label Oviraptor philoceratops.Barsbold, R., Maryanska, T., and Osmolska, H. (1990). \\"Oviraptorosauria,\\" in Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmolska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria. Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 249-258. However, this distinctive- looking, tall-crested species has more features of the skull in common with Citipati than it does with Oviraptor and it may represent a second species of Citipati or possibly an entirely new genus, pending further study.Clark, J.M., Norell, M.A., & Barsbold, R. (2001). \\"Two new oviraptorids (Theropoda:Oviraptorosauria), upper Cretaceous Djadokhta Formation, Ukhaa Tolgod, Mongolia.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 21(2):209-213., June 2001. =Zizhongosaurus huangshibanensis= In 1999 Li Kui mentioned \\"Zizhongosaurus huangshibanensis\\"K. Li, Y. Zhang, K. Cai, 1999, The Characteristics of the Composition of the Trace Elements in Jurassic Dinosaur Bones and Red Beds in Sichuan Basin, Geological Publishing House, Beijing but this has remained an undescribed nomen nudum.

Among his siblings was Cornelia Rogers, who married Captain Samuel Emlen Meigs. From December 1856 until October 1858, he was educated in Paris, France. In 1861, he entered the University of Pennsylvania with the class of 1865 where he was a member of the Philomathean Society and the University Glee Club. Career Rogers, a corporal in the University Light Artillery, left Penn at the close his sophomore year to enter the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War. He became a private in the 1st Troop of Cavalry of the City of Philadelphia. He eventually graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1867. Following his graduation from West Point, he served as a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers until he resigned from the Army in 1869. After retiring from the Army, Rogers moved to Detroit, Michigan where he entered the lumber business and helped organize Presque Isle County. Rogers City, Michigan, the county seat of Presque Isle, is named in his honor. In 1875, he moved to Garrison, New York, located just outside of New York City, where he worked as a cotton exporter. In 1883, he was appointed him to the New York State Board of Railroad Commissioners by then Governor, later U.S. President, Grover Cleveland, serving for nine years total of which five were spent as chairman. In 1892, he was admitted to the bar in New York and practiced law. Later, William Rogers worked for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company.

Because of racial segregation, Cosme did not pursue an acting career in the traditional Cuban theater, instead focusing on the art of declamation, or poetry reading. She was the sole Cuban woman and one of the few black women to participate in African-themed declamation. Her performances went beyond reciting the poems, as she used gestures, facial expression and vocal rhythm to convey the emotion of the written word. Focusing on works that served as social commentary on race, gender, and the disparity of the position of blacks in both Latin America and the United States, Cosme was recognized as a master of her craft. Beginning her career in variety shows, she performed in Cuba until the late 1930s, before embarking on international tours. In 1938, Cosme moved to the United States. She became a naturalized US citizen in the 1940s. She performed to sold-out houses at venues including Carnegie Hall, The Town Hall, and historically black universities. She performed with both Marian Anderson and Langston Hughes, and brought the works of African-American poets to Hispanic audiences via The Eusebia Cosme Show, which aired on CBS Radio from 1943 to 1945. She performed recitations in the United States through the late 1950s, worked as an abstract painter in the 1960s, and began acting in film and television in 1964. Cosme lived in Mexico City from 1966 to 1973, when she appeared in such films as The Pawnbroker and White Roses for My Black Sister. Her most noted role was as \\"Mam√° Dolores\\", which she played repeatedly in her career. She first played this character, from Felix B. Caignet's radio drama El Derecho de nacer (The Right of Birth), in a 1955 stage performance in New York City. She repeated it in both the 1966 film and telenovela by the same name. In 1971 she filmed a spin-off, Mam√° Dolores. Her performance in the 1966 film was recognized with the Premio √ìnix as best actress. After suffering a stroke in Mexico City in 1973, Cosme was moved to the United States and lived her final years in Miami. Located in Mexico, her effects were donated to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library in Harlem. The archive has become an important resource for academics studying race, gender and social perception of not only Afro-Cubans in her era but also within the wider community of the African diaspora.  Early life  Street Scene, Santiago de Cuba Eusebia Adriana Cosme Almanza was born on 5 March 1908 in Santiago de Cuba to Leocadia Almanza and Germ√°n Cosme. Her father served in the Liberation Army Corps during the 1898 Cuban War of Independence, when the island nation gained its independence from Spain. Her mother was a domestic worker on the estate of Luis Fern√°ndez Marcan√©, a prominent local lawyer, who took charge of Cosme's education. From an early age she developed an interest in stage performances, but found there were few non-white performers in the dramatic and comedic theaters she attended. This led Cosme to believe that she would have no future as an actress, or would be offered only stereotypical roles as a servant or rumba performer. Cosme enjoyed reciting poetry, though she found little affinity with the white writers who produced the works she read. When she discovered Nicol√°s Guill√©n's poetry, focused on African subjects and black culture, she found her performance medium. Between 1926 and 1927, she studied at the Conservatorio Municipal de M√∫sica de Habana (Municipal Conservatory of Music of Havana), graduating with a diploma. Soon after completing her schooling, Cosme performed as a cupletista in a melodramatic, singing cabaret performance at the Teatro Neptuno. From the late 1920s to early 1930s, she was often listed in playbills as part of the cast of various variety shows. Returning to Santiago, she improved her skill in declamation techniques by performing for the Fern√°ndez Marcan√© household and made her public debut in Santiago in 1930. The household returned to Havana when Fern√°ndez Marcan√© served in the Senate and in 1931, she began lessons in elocution at the Municipal Conservatory's Academy of Declamation studying with Graziella Garbalosa, the academy's director and founder. Garbalosa encouraged Cosme to develop her individuality and embrace her African roots to distance herself from her white peers by vocalizing and expressing her own cultural background. Through the use of popular dialect and by creating elaborate interpretative routines, with vivid backdrops, props, and flamboyant costumes, Cosme recreated scenes using exaggerated gestures to convey the emotion of the poetry. Her costumes reflected the mood of the piece. If, for example, she was speaking about the struggles of black mothers, she wore a traditional Cuban peasant dress adorned with a kerchief. She also used a typical costume of rumba dancers, a dress featuring a tightly fitted bodice with a deeply ruffled skirt, to set the scene for more rhythmic, celebratory poems. She designed her sets and chose the accompanying music, becoming an artistic director of each performance, rather than simply a performer. Cosme was trained in the tradition of pose√≠a negra, a specific type of recitation of poetry which is tied to the African experience, with particular attention to the irony of blacks' peculiar societal position in the wake of slavery. Originating in the Antilles, the genre is often synonymous with Afro-Cuban poetry, though there were numerous artists from other islands, such as Puerto Rico. The performance is closely tied to the ethnic and cultural experiences of mulattos (mixed-race people) navigating in a white-dominated culture. The reciters, known as declamdores cubanos or simply recitadores, were predominantly male, with Cosme being the sole exception. Their recitations followed musical rhythms of the danz√≥n and rumba while simultaneously using traditional Spanish verse forms. The movement flourished from the mid-1920s to mid-1930s in the Spanish Caribbean. In the absence of women writers of the period, Cosme recited poems written by men, but her emotional interpretations and performances elevated her to an artistic level beyond simple recitation. She saw her role as an essential bridge between the poet and listener, whereby she recreated the written text as an expression of feeling and consciousness.  Cuban career  Spanish ruffled dress in the style worn by Cosme When Fern√°ndez Marcan√© and his family moved back to Santiago, Cosme remained in the city and took up residence with an aunt. To pay the rent on her apartment, she took in students from the neighborhood. In 1932, Cosme gave a declamation for a hurricane benefit, appearing on stage with Ignacio Pi√±eiro. In her first major speaking engagement in Havana on 16 March 1933, Cosme recited a tribute to the Spanish actor, at the Payret Theater. By this time, she had developed a standard format, divided into three sections, each featuring five to six declamations, grouped according to their social message and rhythm. In 1934, she performed in Camag√ºey and then at the Lyceum, a women's organization frequented by white middle- and upper-class women. That summer, she took part in an event sponsored by the Hispano-Cuban Institution of Culture, winning rare praise from the organization's president, Fernando Ortiz. He called her an artist with a finely developed mastery of the aesthetic expression of Cuban culture who moved her audience to tears. She went on to perform in August at the Principal de la Comedia earning praise from Chic Magazine, which dubbed her \\"the greatest artistic attraction\\" that month in the capital. In 1935, she returned to the Principal de la Comedia reciting works by Emilio Ballagas, Regino Boti, F√©lix B. Caignet, Nicol√°s Guill√©n, Luis Pal√©s Matos, and Jos√© Antonio Portuondo, among others. Rafael Su√°rez Sol√≠s, the critic for El Pa√≠s declared there were no comparisons for her artistry. A featured article on Cosme in the November 1935 issue of Adelante described her as \\"black emotion, voice and rhythm, harmoniously vibrating in the flesh and grace of woman\\". By 1936, Cosme regularly featured in speaking engagements and on radio programs such as CMCG's Hora Sensemay√°. She began to appear in more elite venues, like the Casino Espa√±ol and the Teatro Mart√≠, and joined the Society for the Study of Afro-Cubans. Making her first foray abroad, she performed in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where she earned mostly positive reviews for her performances. She was also praised for sharing works by Ballagas, Guill√©n and Pal√©s with her audience. As she developed her craft, Cosme expanded her repertoire to include works from other poets of the African diaspora. It took on a more complex continental feel, including works from African-American, Afro-Puerto Rican, and Afro-Venezuelan poets. At the end of the year, when she returned to Cuba, Cosme was honored by the city of her birth in a celebration where she was granted the title Hija Predilecta (Favorite Daughter) of Santiago.  Immigration and speaking career  Eusebia Cosme 1943 In 1938, Cosme left Cuba for a performance tour in Venezuela, as part of a cultural mission for the Cuban Ministry of Education. She performed in Maracaibo at the Teatro Baralt and later was introduced at the Teatro Nacional in Caracas by Andr√©s Eloy Blanco. In July, she headed back to the Caribbean to perform at the University of Puerto Rico, in R√≠o Piedras. She appeared in 18 performances over the month and made trips to study Afro-Puerto Rican culture in Lo√≠za Aldea and Machuchal, areas known for their African traditions. While in Puerto Rico, she decided to visit the United States and sailed from San Juan to New York City, arriving on 22 August 1938. Within a month, Cosme was scheduled to appear at Carnegie Hall. She performed on 4 December to a sell-out crowd of more than 3,200 people who paid $6 per ticket to hear her perform. The tour included performances at Howard and Yale Universities and events in which she opened for Marian Anderson, a noted African-American singer. Cosme focused on themes in her repertoire that spanned the experiences of Afro-Antilleans, from celebrations of culture to suffering and struggling to survive, as well as exploring the stereotypical fears mainstream society had of blacks. She also used her declamations as a way to provoke analysis of racial and gender perceptions of identity. Probably in the early 1940s, she married a white Puerto Rican mechanic, Rafael \\"Felo\\" Laviera, from New York. Cosme appealed to diverse audiences, who each had their own perception of her. Latin American publications categorized her as Afro-Latina; mainstream media in the United States and Europe depicted her as an exotic, tropical personality; while the African-American community saw in her the broad historical connections of the diaspora. Until she arrived in the United States, most of her recitations had been based upon white, Latino authors. After her arrival in New York, she focused on works of black artists and was able to introduce the works of literary figures such as Joseph Seamon Cotter Sr., Paul Laurence Dunbar, and James Weldon Johnson to Hispanic audiences. Her space was unique, as comparison between her and Ethel Barrymore, and other prominent white actresses in both American and Cuban entertainment, failed to recognize that they were not allowed to perform in the same spheres. Additionally, comparison could not be made with African-American actresses, as their cultural experiences were different. As a mulatta and Latina, Cosme could and did perform in cosmopolitan venues featuring her international appeal as a Latin American; similar spaces would not have been open to \\"Negro\\", African-American artists. Though she performed in Spanish, she was embraced by the African- American community, with newspapers and reviewers stressing that language was not a barrier. Comparisons were made between opera and her recitations, showing that her mastery of gestures, facial expressions, and rhythm conveyed the message of the performance making words unnecessary. Eusebia Cosme 1958 In 1940, she appeared at Northwestern University in a program sponsored by the Institute of Spain in the United States and soon after the performance went to Mexico City to be presented at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. She performed at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo in Morelia before returning to Sugar Hill in January 1941. She composed the song Fue en el √Åfrica (It Happened in Africa), which was recorded by RCA Victor featuring Ernesto Roca later that year. She was naturalized as a United States citizen in Laredo, Texas in the early 1940s. In 1942, she again performed at Carnegie Hall and the following year played at The Town Hall. Beginning in 1943, she had her own radio show, The Eusebia Cosme Show, which aired on CBS and was broadcast throughout the Americas on La Cadena de las Am√©ricas (Network of the Americas) for the next two years. She had return engagements at Howard University in 1944 and 1946 and at The Town Hall in 1945, where she recited poems by Jes√∫s Col√≥n and Alberto Socarr√°s in honor of Antonio Maceo's hundredth birthday. In May 1946, Cosme collaborated with Langston Hughes in Cuban Evening: The Poems and Songs of Nicol√°s Guill√©n by Katherine Dunham. They recited poetry by Guill√©n and Eartha Kitt sang at the event. In 1947, she performed at the Club Cubano Inter-Americano in New York City, during the anniversary celebrations of the Grito de Baire. In another collaboration with Hughes, which included Ben Frederic Carruthers and Arna Bontemps, Cosme performed in 1949 in Carruthers and Hughes' translation of Guill√©n, which they called Cuba Libre. In 1952, she returned to Cuba for the first time since 1938, taking her husband with her. She was celebrated in her performance at the Universidad de Oriente in her home town, and received the Orden Nacional de M√©rito \\"Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes\\" (Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes Order of National Merit). However, she was refused inclusion in the official centennial celebrations planned for Jos√© Mart√≠. She was not able to perform in Havana until May 1953, when she was featured at the Pro-Arte Musical Auditorium. She returned to New York, where her husband died by the middle of the decade. In September 1955, she was cast as \\"Mam√° Dolores\\" in a stage production of F√©lix B. Caignet's radio drama El Derecho de nacer (The Right of Birth), which played at the Teatro Santurce, located at 1421 5th Avenue, near 116th Street. In 1956, she performed in the Recital de Poes√≠a Afro-Antillana sponsored by the Puerto Rican Society of Journalists and Writers and held at The Town Hall and in 1958, she recited at Fairfield University, winding down her declamatory career.  Artistic and film career  Cosme began to paint and exhibited abstract paintings in such venues as the annual Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit through the early 1960s. In 1964, she made her film debut playing in The Pawnbroker with Rod Steiger under the direction of Sidney Lumet, which aired in 1965. Cosme moved to Mexico City in 1966, living at the Hotel Insurgentes. Her film roles there were often stereotypical as domestics or a celibate, aging surrogate mother. She appeared in a film version of El derecho de nacer, reprieving her role as \\"Mam√° Dolores\\", under the direction of Tito Davison. She was recognized as the \\"best actress\\" of 1966 for her role in the film and was awarded the Premio √ìnix by the El Instituto y la Escuela de Cultura Cinematogr√°fica at the Universidad Iberoamericana (The Institute and School of Cinematographic Culture of the Ibero-American University), the educational department charged with developing a national film industry in Mexico. The prize was widely acknowledged as a national mark of excellence. Also in 1966, Telesistema Mexicano (TSM) adapted the work for a telenovela of the same name with Cosme again playing \\"Mam√° Dolores\\", in a production directed by Ernesto Alonso. In 1968, Cosme appeared in another TSM telenovela Tres vidas distintas (Three Distinct Lives), under the direction of Carlos Salinas and the following year, she starred in Rosas blancas para mi hermana negra (White Roses for My Black Sister) with Libertad Lamarque. In the film, Cosme is killed in a traffic accident and her heart is donated to Lamarque's daughter. In 1971, she worked in the telenovela Cristo negro directed by Tony Carbajal and featured in the movie Vuelo 701 (Flight 701), a thriller in which a series of events prevents some of the passengers from boarding the doomed flight traveling from Acapulco to San Francisco. Davison directed a spin-off of El derecho de nacer in 1971, called Mam√° Dolores, in which Cosme starred in the title role. Her last film, El derecho de los pobres (The Rights of the Poor), directed by Ren√© Cardona, was released in 1973 and though she was scheduled to make Negro es un bello color (Black is a Beautiful Color) in May 1973, Cosme was debilitated by a stroke and was placed in the American Benevolent Society in Mexico City. A prominent American actor paid for her to have nursing care and eventually arranged for her relocation to the Miami Convalescent Home in South Florida in early 1974.  Death and legacy  Cosme died on 11 July 1976 at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida. She was buried in Flagler Memorial Park's Sunset Mausoleum. Cosme's papers are housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library in Harlem. The archival material was discovered in Mexico by Eileen Charbo, a writer and researcher who had been affiliated with the Kansas Historical Society. When Cosme was debilitated by a stroke in 1973 she left her effects and papers with the American Benevolent Society. Charbo attempted to have her costumes placed with the Smithsonian, but when they did not express interest, she donated the plain clothing to the Daughters of the American Revolution in Mexico, and contacted Jean Blackwell Hutson to see if the Schomburg center was interested in the remaining effects. The archive has become an important resource for scholars in evaluating not only Afro- Caribbean identities, but the changing perceptions of the greater African diaspora. In 2013, Nydia Sarabia, a Cuban author, published a biography of Cosme, Eusebia Cosme, la rosa canela. In 2015, Cosme was one of the figures celebrated during the 500th anniversary of Santiago de Cuba's founding. An exhibit, prepared by the City Historian from the office of preservation, featured the significant citizens who had influenced the cultural development of the city.

The facility is currently producing final assemblies of the Tesla Model 3 and will produce Tesla Model Y, with Y deliveries slated to begin in January 2021. The factory initial production rate target is 3,000 cars a week, eventually reaching 250,000 electric cars per year. The initial assembled Model 3 were first delivered in December 2019, just twelve months after beginning site grading on the gigafactory in December 2018. The Shanghai municipal government approved the agreement to build the production facility in July 2018, and a long-term lease was signed for about of land in October 2018. Construction began in December 2018 with the installation of secure fencing and site offices. The General Assembly Building was nearly complete by August 2019, and manufacturing line equipment was being installed for both batteries and automobiles. The plant began initial production of Tesla Model 3 cars in October 2019, with additional production facilities for motors, seats, and powertrain assemblies under construction in late 2019 with expected completion by March 2020. Tesla is also building engineering and design teams in China.  Description  The factory site is within Pudong District, with the western edge bordering Fengxian District.  History  = Background = The Tesla (Shanghai) company was formally established 8 May 2018, with an authorized capital of 100 million yuan, wholly owned by Tesla Motors Hong Kong. In July 2018 Tesla CEO Elon Musk signed an agreement with the Shanghai regional government to build its third Gigafactory, and the first in China. On 8 August 2018, compulsory purchase order Shanghai [2018] was issued by Pudong New Area Planning and Land Administration, with a closing date for objections of 14 August 2018, and finalization scheduled to occur on 20 August 2018. On 26 September 2018, the bidding process for the newly acquired plots Q01-05 in the area designated as 04PD-0303 were advertised, with the restriction that the land be used for electric car manufacturing, with a minimum investment requirement.

Tesla won the long-term lease for of land in Lingang, Shanghai on 17 October. Tesla (Shanghai) was the only bidder, with its bid of 973 million Chinese yuan for the 50-year lease covering the site, with the capital coming from local Chinese banks. The Shanghai Land Transfer contract with Tesla (Shanghai) required construction work to begin within 6 months, and be completed within 30 months, with production started after 36 months, and full minimum tax revenues being paid after 60 months. The Land Transfer was scheduled to occur on 12 December 2018, and limits the with a maximum height of . Up to of the area can be used for non-production office buildings. Phase 1 of the project will manufacture Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y cars, with a target production rate of 250,000 electric cars per year. Tesla stated that it planned to eventually be able to produce 500,000 electric vehicles per year at the site. The public environmental impact consultation for Phase 1 of the project was opened on 24 October 2018 and scheduled to run for ten working days. Capital expenditures covering the land purchase and initial design costs for were scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2018. The purchase was aided by a loan from Chinese banks, and converted to a $1.4 billion loan in late 2019, also by Chinese banks. =Construction= A construction permit was granted by the Shanghai municipal government authorizing work to begin after 29 December 2018. The project contractor is China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd., part of China State Construction Engineering, a large state-owned construction company. By December 2018, construction activity at the site was underway with site grading. Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong visited the site on 5 December. A subsidiary of China Minmetals was making preparations for piling foundations. Shanghai Construction Group was one of the companies bidding for part of the larger construction contract. On 7 January 2019 the groundbreaking ceremony was held. By March, foundation work in some areas of the large facility was in place and structure is being erected, with crews operating at the site on multiple shifts to accelerate construction. By early August 2019, the building exteriors were nearly complete, and the general assembly building was being fitted with manufacturing equipment, with a target to begin production in November. The plant received its \\"comprehensive acceptance certificate\\" on 19 August.https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-3-acceptance-certificate- inspection-record-time, 20 August 2019.

Preliminary plans indicate Tesla could add a second shift of production by the beginning of 2Q2020 which would increase line capacity to approximately 3500 vehicles per week. The gigafactory Shanghai was temporarily shut down for approximately two weeks by order of the government on 29 January 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\"Tesla says China has ordered its Shanghai factory shut down over coronavirus fears\\", The Verge, Jan 29 2020, https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114377/tesla-coronavirus- delay-production-factory-china Production resumed 10 February, as did for suppliers and other companies around the country. Several precautions were taken to prevent virus spread. Initial production line capacity of Giga Shanghai is aimed at 5,000 cars per week, and if achieved and sustained could result in an annual capacity of more than 250,000 vehicles. Once the factory has been fully built out and production has fully ramped, Tesla plans for the factory to reach an annual production capacity of 500,000 vehicles.

The United Kingdom and France signed in 1947 signed the Treaty of Dunkirk, a defensive pact, which was expanded in 1948 with the Treaty of Brussels to add the three Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) and committed them to collective defence against any armed attack for fifty years. The British worked with Washington to expand the alliance into NATO in 1949, adding the United States and Canada as well as Italy, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \\"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\\" International Affairs 59.3 (1983): 351-363. West Germany and Spain joined later.  Beginnings  The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by US President Harry S. Truman in alt=Eleven men in suits stand around a large desk at which another man is signing a document. The Treaty of Brussels was a mutual defense treaty against the Soviet threat at the start of the Cold War. It was signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom and was the precursor to NATO. The Soviet threat became immediate with the Berlin Blockade in 1948, leading to the creation of a multinational defence organization, the Western Union Defence Organisation, in September 1948. However, the parties were too weak militarily to counter the Soviet Armed Forces. In addition, the communist 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat had overthrown a democratic government, and British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing in the United States, especially with the American anxiety over Italy and the Italian Communist Party. In 1948, European leaders met with US defence, military, and diplomatic officials at the Pentagon, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association.Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \\"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\\" International Affairs 59.3 (1983): 351-363. The talks resulted in the North Atlantic Treaty, and the United States signed on 4 April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states, as well as the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was \\"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down\\". Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro- neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism, which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic co-operation. A 1952 US postage stamp commemorating the third anniversary of NATO. Stamps honoring the organization were issued by many member countries. The members agreed that an armed attack against any of them in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against them all. Consequently, they agreed that if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked and take such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. That differs from Article IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response is military in nature. NATO members are nonetheless assumed to aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their \\"vessels, forces or aircraft\\" above the Tropic of Cancer, including some overseas departments of France. The creation of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which, in many cases, meant European countries adopting US practices. Roughly 1300 Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. The 7.62√ó51mm NATO rifle cartridge was thus introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside NATO. Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.  Cold War  During the Cold War, most of Europe was divided between two alliances. Members of NATO are shown in blue, with members of the alt=A map of Europe showing several countries on the left in blue, and ones on the right are in red. Other unaffiliated countries are in white. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 was crucial for NATO, as it raised the apparent threat of all communist countries working together and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans. Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) was formed to direct forces in Europe, and began work under Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower in January 1951. In September 1950, the NATO Military Committee called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets and reaffirmed that position at the February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon. The conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to 96 divisions. However, that requirement was dropped the following year to roughly 35 divisions, with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons. At th a time, NATO could call on about 15 ready divisions in Central Europe and another 10 in Italy and Scandinavia. Also at Lisbon, the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organization's chief civilian was created, and Lord Ismay was eventually appointed to the post. In September 1952, the first major NATO maritime exercises began. Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway. Other major exercises that followed included Exercise Grand Slam and Exercise Longstep, naval and amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean Sea, Italic Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in northern Italy, Grand Repulse, involving the British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE), Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the Central Army Group, and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving American, British, Greek, Italian, and Turkish naval forces. Greece and Turkey also joined the alliance in 1952, which forced a series of controversial negotiations, mainly between United States and Britain, over how to bring both countries into the military command structure. While that overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately, unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery. The German alt=Two soldiers crouch under a tree while a tank sits on a road in front of them. In 1954, the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe. The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected that proposal. On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council approved MC 48, a key document in the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO had to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union, whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. That gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons that existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command. The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as \\"a decisive turning point in the history of our continent\\" by Halvard Lange, then the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister. A major reason was that German manpower was necessary to have enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion. One of the immediate results of West German entry was the creation of the Warsaw Pact, which was signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War. Three major exercises were held concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957. Operation Counter Punch, Operation Strikeback, and Operation Deep Water were the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance so far, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.  French withdrawal  Map of the NATO air bases in France before alt=A map of France with red and blue markings indicating air force bases in 1966. NATO's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France.Garret Martin, \\"The 1967 withdrawal from NATO ‚Äì a cornerstone of de Gaulle's grand strategy?\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies (2011) 9#3 pp. 232‚Äì243. De Gaulle protested the strong role of the United States in NATO and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to US President Dwight Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate, which would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK. Considering the response to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc, instead of being drawn into a larger war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and it later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. That caused the United States to transfer 300 military aircraft out of France and to return control of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967. Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command. In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included \\"the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries\\". The withdrawal forced the relocation of from Rocquencourt, near Paris, to Casteau, north of Mons, Belgium, by 16 October 1967. France remained a member of the alliance and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack with its own forces stationed in West Germany throughout the Cold War. A series of secret accords between US and French officials, the Lemnitzer‚ÄìAilleret Agreements, detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO's command structure if East-West hostilities broke out. When de Gaulle announced his decision to withdraw from the integrated NATO command, US President Lyndon Johnson suggested that when de Gaulle \\"comes rushing down like a locomotive on the track, why the Germans and ourselves, we just stand aside and let him go on by, then we are back together again.\\"Cited in William I. Hitchcock, \\"The Ghosts of Crises Past: The Troubled Alliance in Historical Perspective,\\" The End of the West? Crisis and Change in the Atlantic Order, (eds. Jeffrey Anderson, & John G. Ikenberry, & Thomas Risse, Ithaka & London: Cornell University Press, 2008), p. 67. That vision came true when France announced its return to full participation at the 2009 Strasbourg‚ÄìKehl summit.  D√©tente and escalation  alt=US President Richard Nixon talked with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in 1973. During most of the Cold War, NATO's watch against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not actually lead to direct military action. On 1 July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature. NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty since US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war, when the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states then knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements, which were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance: to maintain security and pursue d√©tente. That was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race. On 12 December 1979, in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and Pershing II theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the West's negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. That policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983 and 1984, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium- range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations in the event of war. That action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for their deployment wavered, as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained. Wim van Eekelen, Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, greeting US soldiers deploying to NATO bases in 1987 The membership of the organization was then largely static. In 1974, as a consequence of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish co-operation, was readmitted in 1980.\\"Greek- Turkish Relations: The Deadlocked Allies\\", CIA, 1982 The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is applicable only to attacks on member state territories north of the Tropic of Cancer. On 30 May 1982, NATO gained a new member when the newly-democratic Spain joined the alliance, as was confirmed by referendum in 1986. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed US forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.  After the Cold War  The Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent of Europe. The shift started, with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. European countries then accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, that had fallen to 21 percent. NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly-autonomous countries od Central and Eastern Europe and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not been thought of as NATO concerns. Reforms made under Soviet leader alt=Two men in suits sit signing documents at a large table in front of their countries' flags while two others stand outside watching them. An expansion of NATO came with German reunification on 3 October 1990, when the former East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the alliance. That had been agreed in the Two Plus Four Treaty earlier that year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east. There was no formal commitment in the agreement not to expand NATO to the east, but there are diverging views on whether negotiators gave informal commitments regarding further NATO expansion. Jack Matlock, the American ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a \\"clear commitment\\" not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then the West German foreign minister, said in a conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, \\"For us, however, one thing is certain: NATO will not expand to the east.\\" In 1996, Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs that \\"during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east,\\" and hr repeated that view in an interview in 2008. However, in 2014 Gorbachev stated the opposite: \\"The topic of 'NATO expansion' was not discussed at all [in 1990], and it wasn't brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Western leaders didn't bring it up, either.\\" According to Robert Zoellick, a US State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, that appears to be a misperception, and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer also rejects that an informal agreement existed. As part of restructuring, NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure but maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.  Enlargement and reform  The alt=A pale yellow building with square columns with three flags hanging in front and soldiers and dignitaries saluting them. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, like the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro- Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1998, the NATO‚ÄìRussia Permanent Joint Council was established. On 8 July 1997, three former communist countries (Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland) were invited to join NATO, which was accepted by all three, with Hungarian acceptance being endorsed in a referendum in which 85.3% of voters supported joining NATO. Czech President Vaclav Havel welcomed the expansion: \\"Never have we been part of such a broad, solid and binding security alliance, which at the same time respects in its essence the sovereignty and will of our nation.\\" Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek also welcomed the expansion: \\"Poland forever returns where she has always belonged: the free world.\\" Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi stated that the expansion showed that Hungary was returning \\"to her natural habitat.\\" The expansion was also welcomed by US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who stated that the expansion would do \\"for Europe's east what NATO has already helped to do for Europe's west: steadily and systematically, we will continue erasing ‚Äì without replacing ‚Äì the line drawn in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot.\\" Expansion was criticised in the US by some policy experts as a \\"a policy error of historic proportions.\\"[NATO Expansion Would Be an Epic 'Fateful Error' http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/07/local/me-10464], Los Angeles Times, 7 July 1997 According to George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and an advocate of the containment policy, the decision \\"may be expected to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.\\"\\"NATO Expansion Would Be a Fateful Blunder\\", New York Times, 5 February 1997 Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit and joined NATO on 29 March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. Slovenian membership was endorsed in a referendum in which 66.02% of voters supported joining. New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished. In 1997, NATO reached agreement on a significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to 20. The NATO Response Force (NRF) was launched at the 2002 Prague summit on 21 November, the first summit in a former Comecon country. On 19 June 2003, a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, Allied Command Transformation (ACT), was established in Norfolk, Virginia, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of Allied Command Operations (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO while ACO is responsible for current operations. In March 2004, NATO's Baltic Air Policing began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia by providing jet fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions. Eight multinational jet fighters are based in Lithuania, the number of which was increased from four in 2014. Also at the 2004 Istanbul summit, NATO launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with four Persian Gulf nations. Meetings between the government of Ukrainian President alt=Two older men in black suits and red ties sit facing each other in a room with green, white, and gold trimmed walls. The 2006 Riga summit was held in Riga, Latvia, and highlighted the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit to be held in a country that had been part of the Soviet Union. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania, both of which joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence system. Studies for the system had begun in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, Russian Presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized the system as a threat. In 2009, US President Barack Obama proposed using the ship-based Aegis Combat System, but the plan still includes stations being built in Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Romania, and Poland. NATO will also maintain the \\"status quo\\" in its nuclear deterrent in Europe by upgrading the targeting capabilities of the \\"tactical\\" B61 nuclear bombs stationed there and deploying them on the stealthier Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.Norton- Taylor, Richard. \\"Nato plans to upgrade nuclear weapons 'expensive and unnecessary'.\\" The Guardian, 10 May 2012.Becker, Markus. \\"US Nuclear Weapons Upgrades.\\" Der Spiegel, 16 May 2012. After the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO committed to forming a new \\"spearhead\\" force of 5000 troops at bases in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. NATO foreign ministers and Montenegro's Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá signed a protocol at the NATO Council in 2016 The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by NATO nations, and Poland invoked Article 4 in meetings. Then, at the 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO's member states formally committed for the first time spend the equivalent of at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defence by 2024, which was previously only an informal guideline. In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. At the beginning of 2018, eight members either were meeting the target or were close to it; six others had laid out plans to reach the target by 2024 as promised; and Norway and Denmark had unveiled plans to substantially boost defense spending, including Norway's planned purchase 52 new F-35 fighter jets. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea, and aerial warfare. That means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Montenegro became the 29th member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia. On 1 August 2018, the US Department of Treasury sanctioned two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said that the US behavior would force Turkey to look for new friends and allies. The US‚ÄìTurkey dispute appears to be one of the most serious diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies in years. On 4 December 2019, NATO officially recognized space warfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea, aerial, and cyber warfare. That means that an attack on any of the domain can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. On 27 March 2020, North Macedonia became the 30th and newest member after a dispute about its name had been resolved with Greece.

After Eisenhower arrived in Paris in January 1951, he and the other members of the multinational Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) Planning Group immediately began to devise a structure for the new Allied Command Europe. NATO official documents state, \\"The corner stone of the NATO Military Command Structure was laid... when the North Atlantic Council approved D.C. 24/3 on 18 December 1951.\\" They quickly decided to divide Allied Command Europe into three regions: Allied Forces Northern Europe, containing Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic; Allied Forces Central Europe, and Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH), covering Italy and the Mediterranean. SHAPE was established at Rocquencourt, west of Paris. The British post of Commander in Chief Mediterranean Fleet was given a dual-hatted role as NATO Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Mediterranean in charge of all forces assigned to NATO in the Mediterranean Area. The British made strong representations in discussions regarding the Mediterranean NATO command structure since they wished to retain their direction of NATO naval command in the Mediterranean to protect their sea lines of communication running through the Mediterranean to the Middle East and Far East.Sean Maloney, 'To Secure Command of the Sea,' University of New Brunswick thesis, 1991, p.258-261 In 1952, after Greece and Turkey joined NATO Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST) was created in Izmir, Turkey, under a US Army General because of the geographic distance of both countries from the LANDSOUTH headquarters as well as political disagreements over which nation should be the overall commander for its ground forces. With the establishment of Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT) on 30 January 1952, the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic joined the previously created Supreme Allied Commander Europe as one of the alliance's two Major NATO Commanders. A third was added when Allied Command Channel was established on 21 February 1952 to control the English Channel and North Sea area and deny them to the enemy and to protect the sea lanes of communication. The establishment of this post and the agreement that it was to be filled by the British Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, was part of the compromise that allowed an American officer to take up the SACLANT post. Previously Commander-in-Chief Portsmouth had controlled multinational naval operations in the area under WUDO auspices. In due course, the CINCHAN role was assumed by the British Commander-in-Chief Fleet. In 1966, when French President Charles de Gaulle withdrew French forces from the military command structure, NATO's headquarters was forced to move to Belgium. SHAPE was moved to Casteau, north of the Belgian city of Mons. Headquarters Allied Forces Central Europe was moved from the Chateau de Fontainebleau, near Paris to Brunssum, in the Netherlands.

Six multinational corps were to replace the previous eight.Barbara Starr, 'Cold War Battle Orders Make Way for a New NATO Era,' Jane's Defence Weekly, 8 June 1991. Announcements in June 1991 presaged main defensive forces consisting of six multinational corps. Two were to be under German command, one with a US division, one under Belgian command with a pending offer of a U.S. brigade, one under U.S. command with a German division, one under joint German-Danish command (LANDJUT), and one under Dutch command. The new German IV Corps was to be stationed in eastern German and was not to be associated with the NATO structure. On July 1, 1994, the Alliance disestablished Allied Command Channel but retained many of its subordinate structures after the reshuffling. Most of the headquarters were absorbed within ACE, particularly within the new Allied Forces Northwestern Europe.Thomas-Durrell Young, Command in NATO After the Cold War: Alliance, National, and Multinational Considerations, US Army Strategic Studies Institute, June 1, 1997, 11, citing JDW July 17, 1993. E-3A flying with United States Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons in a NATO exercise. From 1994 to 1999, ACE had three Major Subordinate Commands, AFNORTHWEST, AFCENT, and AFSOUTH. In 1995 NATO began a Long Term Study to examine post-Cold War strategy and structure. Recommendations from the study for a new, streamlined structure emerged in 1996.Pedlow, 12. The European and Atlantic commands were to be retained, but the number of major commands in Europe was to be cut from three to two, Regional Command North Europe and Regional Command South Europe. Activation of the new RC SOUTH occurred in September 1999, and in March 2000 Headquarters AFNORTHWEST closed and the new RC NORTH was activated.T.D. Young, 'NATO After 2000,' 16-18. The headquarters of the two Regional Commands were known as Regional Headquarters South (RHQ South) and RHQ NORTH respectively. Each was to supervise air, naval, and land commands for their region as well as a number of Joint Subregional Commands (JSRCs). Among the new JSRCs was Joint Headquarters Southwest, which was activated in Madrid in September 1999. =Organizations and agencies= Prior to the reorganization, the NATO website listed 43 different agencies and organizations and five project committees/offices as of 15 May 2008.NATO, Organizations and Agencies, accessed May 2008 including: * Logistics committees, organisations and agencies, including: **NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency **Central Europe Pipeline System **NATO Pipeline System * Production Logistics organisations, agencies and offices including the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency * Standardisation organisation, committee, office and agency including the NATO Standardization Agency which also plays an important role in the global arena of standards determination. * Civil Emergency Planning committees and centre * Air Traffic Management and Air Defence committees, working groups organisation and centre including the: **NATO ACCS Management Agency (NACMA), based in Brussels, manages around a hundred persons in charge of the Air Control and Command System (ACCS) due for 2009. **NATO Programming Centre * The NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Programme Management Organisation (NAPMO) * NATO Consultation, Command and Control Organisation (NC3O) **NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A), reporting to the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Organization (NC3O).

Schmidt The mathematical work of Eduard Wirsing, Functiones et Approximatio Commentarii Mathematici, vol. 35, 2006, pp. 7‚Äì18 Biography Wirsing studied at the University of G√∂ttingen and the Free University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1957 under the supervision of Hans-Heinrich Ostmann with thesis √úber wesentliche Komponenten in der additiven Zahlentheorie (On Essential Components in Additive Number Theory). In 1967/68 he was a professor at Cornell University and from 1969 a full professor at the University of Marburg, where he was since 1965. In 1970/71 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study. Since 1974 he was a professor at the University of Ulm, where he led the 1976 Mathematical Colloquium. He retired as professor emeritus in 1999, but continued to be mathematically active. Wirsing organized conferences on analytical number theory at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach. In his spare time he plays go and chess, plays alto recorder, and makes electronic devices. Research In 1960 he proved for algebraic number fields a generalization of Roth's 1955 Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem: Let \\\\alpha be algebraic of degree \\\\geq 3, then there are only finitely many algebraic numbers \\\\beta of degree n and height H, so that \\\\left\\\\alpha - \\\\beta \\\\right < H^{-(2 n + \\\\varepsilon)} for arbitrarily small positive \\\\varepsilon. The exponent on the right was improved to n+1 (replacing 2n) by Wolfgang M. Schmidt in 1970. In 1961 Wirsing proved a theorem about the asymptotic means of non-negative multiplicative functions, and he was able to show, under certain conditions, that these are essentially determined by their values at the prime numbers (and not also by values at the higher prime exponents). In 1967 he sharpened his theorem and proved a conjecture of Paul Erd≈ës (each multiplicative function, which takes only the values 1 and -1, has an average value). In 1957 he, with Bernhard Hornfeck, gave an asymptotic estimate for the density of perfect numbers.Wirsing, Hornfeck √úber die H√§ufigkeit vollkommener Zahlen, Mathematische Annalen, vol. 133, 1957, pp. 431‚Äì438 In 1959 Wirsing gave an asymptotic estimate for the density of multiply perfect numbers.Wirsing Bemerkung zu der Arbeit √ºber vollkommene Zahlen, Mathematische Annalen, vol. 137, 1959, pp. 316‚Äì318 In 1956, with Alfred St√∂hr, Wirsing gave simpler examples (than the example given by Yuri Linnik in 1942) demonstrating that there are essential components that are not additive bases.St√∂hr, Wirsing Beispiele von wesentlichen Komponenten, die keine Basis sind, Journal f√ºr die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik, vol. 196, 1956, pp. 96‚Äì98 He gave in 1962 an elementary proof of a sharpened form of the prime-number theorem (with remainder). (In this context, \\"elementary\\" means \\"not using methods from complex function theory\\".) About the same time, similar results were published by Robert Breusch (1960) and Enrico Bombieri (1962). Elementary proofs of the prime number theorem were first published by Paul Erd≈ës and Atle Selberg in 1949. Wirsing is also known for his work on the Gauss-Kuzmin-Levy distribution (named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, Rodion Kuzmin, Paul L√©vy).Wirsing On the theorem of Gauss-Kuzmin-L√©vy and a Frobenius type theorem for function spaces, Acta Arithmetica, Vol. 24, 1973/74, pp. 507‚Äì562. His results are presented, for example, in Donald Knuth The art of computer programming , Volume 2 (Seminumerical Algorithms), Addison-Wesley, 3rd Edition, p. 363.Gauss-Kuzmin Distribution, Mathworld Wirsing gave asymptotic estimates for the distribution of the coefficients of the regular continued fraction evolution of a random variable evenly distributed in the unit interval. In this context, he also introduced a universal mathematical constant (Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing constant).

Biography Lykke was born at Gisselfeld in Zealand, Denmark. He was the son of nobleman Frands Lykke (1591‚Äì1655) and the nephew of Anne Lykke (1595‚Äì1641), royal mistress of Christian, Prince Elect of Denmark. His grandfather Henrik Lykke (1555-1611) was a member of the Danish Council (Riksr√•d) who had accumulated substantial estates in Denmark. He was a courtier in 1646-1648 and an early supporter of Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606‚Äì1664). At the death of his father in 1656, Lykke inherited seven estates and became one of the richest landowners in Denmark. He became known for his debauched and expensive lifestyle. During the Dano- Swedish War (1657‚Äì58) was the commander of his own army in 1657 but was dismissed by royal decree in 1658. In 1660, he married √òllgaard Gyldenstierne. Lykke is foremost known for the 1661 scandal in which he accused Queen Sophie Amalie of adultery by writing to his mistress Sophie Abelsdatter that the queen used to have sexual relations with her lackeys. This letter was exposed to the queen and Lykke was sentenced to a great fine. When he fled to Sk√•ne instead of paying, he was sentenced to death for L√®se-majest√©, was executed in his absence and had his property in Denmark confiscated. He was allowed to return to Denmark after 24 years of exile following the death of Queen Sophie Amalie in 1685.

Viking activity in the Iberian peninsula seems to have begun around the mid-ninth centuryFletcher 1984, ch. 1, note 51. as an extension of Viking raids on and establishment of bases in Frankia in the earlier ninth century. While connections between the Norse and Eastern Islamic lands were well-established, particularly involving the Rus' along the Volga and around the Caspian Sea, relations with the Western edge of Islam were more sporadic and haphazard.Anne Kormann and Else Roesdahl, \\"The Vikings in Islamic Lands\\", in The Arabian Journey: Danish Connections with the Islamic World over a Thousand Years, ed. K. von Folsach, T. Lundbaek, and P. Mortensen (Aarhus: Prehistoric Museum Moesgard, 1996), p. 12. Although Vikings may have over-wintered in Iberia, no evidence has been found for trading or settlement. Indeed, the Iberian peninsula may not have offered particularly wealthy targets, in the ninth to tenth centuries.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 5-12. Sporadic raiding continued until the end of the Viking Age. Our knowledge of Vikings in Iberia is mainly based on written accounts. There are archaeological findings of what may have been anchors of Viking ships,Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 7. and some shapes of mounds by riversides look similar to the Norse longphorts in Ireland. These may have been ports or docks for Viking longships.  Terminology  A street plate in P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal, with Siglas poveiras (describing names of local families), supposedly related to Scandinavian Bom√§rken.\\"O Barco Poveiro\\" ‚Äì Oct√°vio Lixa Filgueiras, 1¬™ edi√ß√£o 1966 In medieval Latin sources about Iberia, the Vikings are usually referred to as normanni ('northmen') and gens normannorum or gens nordomannorum ('race of the northmen'), along with forms in l- like lordomanni apparently reflecting nasal dissimilation in local Romance languages,Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 15-17. or others which have an obscure etymology, as leodemanorum or lotimanorum, frequent in Galician charters.Morales Romero 2004, p. 87. In Arabic sources, they are referred to as maj≈´s (ŸÖŸéÿ¨Ÿàÿ≥), but as this term denoted a wide range of non-Islamic foreigners (though not usually Iberian Christians), references to maj≈´s in Arabic are not necessarily references specifically to Scandinavian raiders.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 17-27. The prominent early Arabic source Al-Mas‚Äò≈´dƒ´ also identified the 844 raiders on Seville partly as R≈´s and (probably borrowing from Iberian Latin lordomanni) al-lawdh‚ÄôƒÅna, which may more specifically indicate Scandinavian raiders.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 23-24. Non-violent contact Aside from Viking raids in the Islamic Mediterranean, it has been imaged that there were also sustained diplomatic relations between the Vikings and the Islamic world.Ibn-Dihya, translated in Stefansson, Jon, \\"The Vikings in Spain. From Arabic (Moorish) and Spanish Sources\\". In Saga-Book of the Viking Club: Vol. VI Proceedings. University of London King's College, 1909, pp. 37‚Äì40.W. E.

Gonz√°lez Campo (ed.), Al-Ghazal y la embajada hispano- musulmana a los vikingos en el siglo IX (Madrid: Miraguano, 2002). However, the key evidence, a thirteenth-century account by Ibn Di·∏•ya, in which an Arab diplomat Al-GhazƒÅl (\\"the gazelle\\") is dispatched to a pagan court during the reign of Abd-ar-Ra·∏•man II, has been shown neither clearly to refer to Vikings nor probably even to have happened.Pons Sanz, S. M., ‚ÄòWhom did al-Ghazal meet? An exchange of embassies between the Arabs from al-Andalus and the Vikings‚Äô, Saga-Book, 28 (2004): 5‚Äì28. It is accepted, however, that in the tenth century the Jewish Hispano-Arabic merchant Ibrahim ibn Yakub Al-Tartushi travelled to the Scandinavian trading town of Hedeby in Schleswig.Gabriel, Judith, \\"Among the Norse Tribes\\" , Saudi Aramco World, November/December 1999. Accessed 19 April 2012. As Scandinavians converted to Christianity and formed stable kingdoms, particularly around the eleventh century, opportunities for contact with Iberia changed, still involving raiding but also opportunities for visits associated with crusading or pilgrimage. One elegant example, portrayed in the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga, is R√∏gnvaldr kali Kolsson (d. 1158),Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 102. who recites this verse, amongst others, to Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne: First raid, 844 Ancient cathedral of St. Martin of Mondo√±edo, near the mouth of the Masma river The first incursion of the Vikings in Iberia has been characterised as 'probably the most significant episode of the whole period of Viking activity in the South'.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 29. It is mentioned in Annales Bertiniani, and dated August 844, when a group from a plundering expedition entered the Garonne and reached Galicia. Despite storm damage, some proceeded to South-West Spain.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 30-31. This account is consistent with several later, but independent sources in Latin and Arabic.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 31-45. In particular, the late ninth- or early tenth-century Chronicle of Alfonso III adds that after plundering a number of coastal villages they were ultimately repulsed in the vicinity of Farum Brecantium (i.e. the Tower of Hercules). Ramiro I of Asturias gathered troops in Galicia and Asturia for the counter-attack. After the Asturian victory, the Vikings continued their voyage in direction of Lisbon.Rolf Scheen: Viking raids on the Spanish Peninsula Revistas / Militaria.Stefansson, Jon, \\"The Vikings in Spain. From Arabic (Moorish) and Spanish Sources.\\" In Saga-Book of the Viking Club: Vol. VI Proceedings. University of London King's College, 1909, p. 32. While some authors consider that the reliability of this chronicle is open to doubt,Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 32-33. others consider that other local chronicles confirm the arrival of the Norsemen.Morales Romero 2004, pp. 130-131. Evidence for the subsequent development of the raid mainly comes from later, Arabic-language sources. The earliest and most important of these, despite a number of implausible details, is Ibn al-Q≈´·π≠iyya. Overall, it seems clear that after their raid on Galicia and Asturias, the Vikings proceeded south, raiding Lisbon and Seville. In the assessment of Ann Christys, 'that is perhaps as much as we can say for certain'.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 33-45 (quoting p. 45). However, the Viking raid on Seville has attracted extensive scholarship in which researchers have attempted to extract a fuller history from late sources. A local Galician legend also claims that when the Vikings arrived at the mouth of the river Masma, in northern Galicia, Gonzalo, the holy Bishop of the local diocese of Britonia, from atop of a hill prayed for protection from the heavens against the forthcoming attack: a major storm was unleashed, sinking most of the flotilla but a ship that could flee to warn the rest of the fleet.H√©lio Pires 2012, pp. 239-241. A series of early medieval rock castles placed atop hills and mountains with large visual field over the ocean, extending along the coasts of Galicia, have been tentatively idenfified as temporary shelters and watchtowers built by local communities or lords against Norse raids.. Second raid, 859-61 Viking longship replicas at Catoira, Galicia Vikings returned to Galicia in 859, beginning what seems to have been a three-year campaign, during the reign of Ordo√±o I of Asturias. The main source for these events are Arabic histories compiled by Ibn ·∏§ayyƒÅn in the eleventh century, though some near-contemporary Latin sources also mention the events, and later Latin sources offer more elaborate, but less reliable, accounts.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 47-48. In the assessment of Ann Christys, what can be known about the Viking raids on Iberia in 859-61 is that > The expedition of 859‚Äì861, like that of 844, seems to have involved a single > band of adventurers. Returning to the scene of Viking incursions in northern > Iberia and al-Andalus, but meeting with little success, they sailed on to > raid targets on the shores of the Mediterranean. Here they may have taken > captives for ransom or to trade as slaves. Vikings seem to have over- > wintered in Francia, perhaps waiting on the northern shore of the > Mediterranean for favourable tides and currents to exit the sea through the > Straits of Gibraltar. They may even have sailed to Italy, Alexandria and > Constantinople.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, > 2015), p. 64. Some historians have given credence, however, to a range of accounts in late sources about raids in this period as evidence for this Viking incursion. Yet different sources mention different figures; not all potentially relevant raids recounted were necessarily by Vikings; and the sources are likely more to reflect the political context in which they were composed than actual events in 859-61. For example, on the basis of an account by Al-Bakrƒ´ it has been supposed that in 859 or 860, Vikings sailed through Gibraltar and raided the little Moroccan state of Nekor, and defeated a Moorish army.Ibn-Adhari, translated in Stefansson, Jon, \\"The Vikings in Spain.

The raiders have been identified as the legendary Hastein and Bj√∂rn Ironside, but this is based on modern extrapolation from already altogether unreliable medieval sources.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 60-61. There was a well-attested raid on Constantinople in 860, which may have been by Vikings and which has been associated with the raids on Iberia, but there is no evidence that the raid on Constantinople was by the same people who were active in the western Mediterranean at the time. Moreover, it is plausible that the Constantinople raiders came from the north by the river-routes running from the Baltic into the Black Sea (known in Old Norse as the Austrvegr).Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 61-63. A story about an attack in the period 859-61 on Banbal≈´na (which could mean modern Pamplona but also the whole kingdom of Navarre), again, may or may not reflect activities of Vikings.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 63-64. Raids in the 960s and 970s Evidence for Viking activity in Iberia after 861 is sparse for nearly a century: while often late, and perhaps reflecting later efforts to construct histories of Viking depredation for contemporary political gain, a range of sources including Dudo of Saint-Quentin, Ibn ·∏§ayyƒÅn, and Ibn IdhƒÅrƒ´, along with a number of charters from Christian Iberia, together afford convincing evidence for Viking raids on Iberia in the 960s and 970s.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 79-93.Morales Romero 2004, pp. 175-193. Among the stories recounted in later sources about these events, the Chronicle of Sampiro and a number of later sources portray a raid in 968 led by one Gundered: a fleet of a hundred ships of Norsemen and Flemings arrives at the port of Iuncaria, intending to pillage Iria, but the Vikings are met at Fornelos by the armies of Bishop Sisnando Men√©ndez, who is killed in the battle. After three years devastating and pillaging the land, they are defeated at the Cebreiro mountains by one Gonzalo S√°nchez,Morales Romero 2004, p. 185. who might be identifiable as either a Galician count, Gonzalo S√°nchez, or, according to some authors, as William S√°nchez of Gascony.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 81-86. Bishop Sisnando was responsible for the fortification of Santiago de Compostela, allegedly against the raids of Norse, Flemings, and other enemies who uses to raid the lands and shores of Galicia.Morales Romero 2004, pp. 178. Several Galician charters of later decades relate the destruction of monasteries and the suffering of the people as \\"dies Lordemanorum\\" (\\"day of the Northmen\\");Morales Romero 2004, pp. 190-193. in particular one charter dated in 996 uses the location of an ancient fortress of the Norse, in the south bank of the Ulla river, as a landmark.Morales Romero 2004, p. 87 According to Ibn IdhƒÅrƒ´, in 966 Lisbon was again raided by the Norse, this time with a fleet of 28 ships, but they were successfully repulsed.Ibn-Adhari, translated in Stefansson, Jon, \\"The Vikings in Spain. From Arabic (Moorish) and Spanish Sources\\". In Saga- Book of the Viking Club: Vol. VI Proceedings. University of London King's College, 1909, pp. 42‚Äì43.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 86-87. He recounts further raids in Al-Andalus, in a series of annalistic asides to narratives of events in C√≥rdoba, for 971-72; these records chime with a note in the textually related, and not necessarily reliable, Anales Complutenses and the first group of the Anales Toledanos saying that Vikings attacked Campos (believed to refer to either Santiago or to the Campos Goticos in the province of Leon) in 970.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 87-92. These activities are vaguely consonant with two thirteenth-century Scandinavian sources for the life of Eir√≠kr Bl√≥√∞√∏x (the Historia Norwegiae and √Ågrip) situating his death (implicitly in the 950s) in Spain while raiding. These two texts are not, however, representative of other accounts of Eir√≠kr's death (which is usually put in England) and they are unlikely to reflect tenth-century reality.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 97-98. Likewise, the probably thirteenth-century Kn√Ωtlinga saga imagines one √ölfr raiding Galicia in the later tenth century.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 98.  Raids in the eleventh century  The Torres de Oeste were built circa 1020 to protect the seaways into Santiago de Compostela, Galicia Quite extensive evidence for minor Viking raids in Iberia continues for the early eleventh century. The twelfth-century Chronicon Lusitanum claims Viking raids for 1008 and 1016,Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 97. while the thirteenth-century Heimskringla portrays √ìl√°fr Haraldsson, who later became king Olaf II of Norway, raiding Iberia en route to Jerusalem in 1015, striking settlements that might correspond to Castropol, Betanzos, Rivas de Sil and Tui.Vikings and Pilgrims in Galicia Pilegrim.noAnn Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 99-100. Although the reliability of these narratives is questionable, a 1015 charter records Amarelo Mest√°liz selling land in northern Portugual to clear a debt incurred by ransoming his daughters: > a great number of Vikings (Lotnimis) arrived in July and occupied the > territory between the rivers Douro and Ave for nine months. These Vikings > (Leodemanes) captured my three daughters, called Serili, Ermesenda and > Faquilo, and reduced me to poverty, for, when they were about to sell their > captives, I had no choice but to pay to Vikings (Lotmanes) a ransom of > silver for them.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, > 2015), p. 96. Likewise a few years later the crew of a 'barca de Laudomanes' ('ship of Vikings') took the following ransom for a woman called Meitilli and her daughter: a cloak, a sword, a shirt, three pieces of linen, a cow and some salt. Ruins of the fortress of A Lanzada Dated in 1024, a royal charter of king Alfonso V of Le√≥n annexed the bishopric of Tui to that of Santiago, because the city had been ravaged by the gens Leodemanorum, and the local Bishop and many other were captured and took afar, while other people have been sold or assassinated.Vitorino Pires 2012, pp. 177-187. Another royal charter, from Oviedo and dated to 1028 (possibly forged, but presumably intended to be plausible), recounts how one Felix fled royal disfavour aboard Viking ships (before later returning and receiving an estate from the Queen).Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 96-97. A royal charter of king Veremud III of Le√≥n, dated in 1032, narrates a recent battle of the forces of count Rodrigo Romaniz, including Norsemen allies, against a troop of Basque marauders who had occupied a stronghold in Mt. Lapio, near Lugo.Vitorino Pires 2012, pp. 191-193.Morales Romero 2004, pp. 208-209. And in 1068 Bishop Cresconius of Iria fortified Santiago, after in 1055 specifying that people could be exempt from resting on a Sunday in the event of an attack by Saracens or Vikings, indicating that he at least considered Vikings to be a threat.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 77-78, 86. He also rebuilt a number of strongholds and castles protecting the seaways into Compostela, including the Torres de Oeste and the fortress of A Lanzada. As the Viking Age drew to a close, Scandinavians and Normans continued to have opportunities to visit and raid Iberia while on their way to the Holy Land for pilgrimage of crusade, or in connection with Norman conquests in the Mediterranean. Key examples in the saga literature are Sigur√∞r J√≥rsalafari (king of Norway 1103-1130) and R√∏gnvaldr kali Kolsson (d. 1158).Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 95-104. Vikings in Madeira Tenth- or eleventh- century fragments of mouse bone found in Madeira, along with mitocondrial DNA of Madeiran mice, suggests that Vikings also came to Madeira (bringing mice with them), prior to colonisation by Portugal.  Did Vikings prompt navy- and fortification-building in Iberia?  Dornas from Galicia: clinker-built boats to which is popularly attributed a Viking origin Various historians have suggested that the well evidenced development of naval forces and fortifications across the Iberian peninsula during the tenth and eleventh centuries can be partly attributed to Viking activity. For example, it has also been suggested that the first navy of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba was built in response to the raid of 844,Haywood, John. \\"The Vikings in the Mediterranean\\" in The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings. Penguin Group: New York, NY. 1995, pp. 59‚Äì61, . and according to Fletcher \\"Alfonso III was sufficiently worried by the threat of Viking attack to establish fortified strong points near his coastline, as other rulers were doing elsewhere\\".Richard A. Fletcher, Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm√≠rez of Santiago de Compostela (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 23. It is clear, however, that a wide range of factors were encouraging these developments, and that key stages do not correlate with known Viking activity.Ann Christys, Vikings in the South (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 65-78.

She was sailing from Bengal to Cadiz when an American-built and outfitted privateer with a letter of marque from the patriotic forces in Buenos Aires captured her in January 1817 in a sanguinary single-ship action during the Argentine War of Independence. Voyage and capture After the Royal Philippine Company purchased Triton, Captain David Proudfoot took on a cargo and sailed from Bengal on 16 August 1816 with a cargo of piece goods, cassia bark, rice, and sugars. Triton was bound for Cadiz.'Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register (1818), pp.311-2. On 18 December Proudfoot detected a shoal at , which received the name \\"Triton's Bank\\". It extended about three miles East-West, and about one mile North-South.Fitzroy (1839), p.280. (Some other, later sources put Triton's Bank at .) On 25 January 1817, Triton encountered the privateer Tupac Amaru off the Cape Verde islands. Tupac Amaru was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 105 men under the command of Captain Menceno Monson. After an engagement of two-and-a-half (or four hours), Proudfoot struck. By one account, Triton had had 20 men killed.American State Papers (1834), pp.201-2. Captain Proudfoot requested that Captain Monson put his prisoners, especially the wounded, at Madeira or the Canary Islands, but Monson refused, concerned that he might lose his prize. He sailed with his prisoners to Buenos Aires, where they finally arrived at Encenada on 1 April, and Proudfoot was permitted to go ashore on 12 April. Triton arrived at Buenos Aires the next day. During the long voyage, four of the wounded died, as did three other seamen, of scurvy. Proudfoot presented petitions to the local authorities and the British consul pointing out that Tupac Amaru was the American brig Regent. She had been purchased at New York and had been sailed to Baltimore where she was fitted out and armed, and recruited a crew entirely made up of Americans. Monson's commission (letter of marque) had been forwarded from Buenos Aires. She had left Baltimore only 12 days before her encounter with Triton and had cleared Baltimore, ostensibly sailing for Havana. Proudfoot pointed out that he believed that it was \\"contrary to the law of nations\\" to outfit a privateer in a neutral port, man her with subjects of the neutral nation, and sail from that port to \\"cruize for captures.\\" The prize court at Buenos Aires on 17 April declared Triton a good prize to Tupac Amaru, Captain Marcena Monron. It ordered that Tritons cargo be delivered to Don David Cortes de Forest.American State Papers (1834), p.537. Don David Cortes de Forest was an American, the former US Consul at Buenos Aires, and the owner of Tupac Amaru. The Spanish Ambassador to the United States Luis de On√≠s y Gonzalez-Vara submitted on 2 November to the United States Secretary of State a protest and request for indemnification for the seizure of Triton by the American vessel Regent (aka Trepacamara). de On√≠s made the essentially the same point that Proudfoot had made, and also pointed out that the US and Spain had signed a treaty in which the signatories had bound themselves not to permit third-party privateers to arm, equip, and operate from each other's ports. Spain claimed an indemnity of 701,980 dollars for the cargoes on Triton and another Royal Philippine Company, Esmerelda, that too had been captured by an American privateer operating under the Buenos Aires flag. Post script Tupac Amara (or Tupac Amaru) again sailed from Buenos Aires on 3 July 1817 on a privateering cruise. She was armed with 16 guns and carried a crew of 160 men.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5216. On 30 November a Spanish brig prize to Tupac Amaru arrived at Buenos Aires.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5257. The brig was the Santo Christo, which had been sailing from Lima to Cadiz.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5261. The national cruiser brig Tupac Amaru, Captain Juan Magfudole, had captured Santo Christo on 1 September off Santa Maria, Terceira Island. She had been carrying a cargo of cotton, copper, Jesuit's bark, and cacao. The cargo was transferred to Don David Cortes de Forest & Co.American State Papers (1834), p.538.

It is affiliated with Sun Yat-sen University. The hospital was founded in March 1964. It is a Level III Class A hospital (the highest rank in China) and the largest integrated cancer center in southern China for care, research, education and prevention. SYSUCC is ranked among the top three cancer center's in China, and is one of the best in Asia. The current President of the center is Prof. Xu Rui-Hua. SYSUCC is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC).  History  The predecessor of SYSUCC was the Tumor Hospital in South China. The founders were Professor Hsieh Chih Kuang (), a pioneer of clinical radiology and the founding father of radiation oncology in China, and Professor Liang Boqiang (), the originator of modern pathology in China. In 1948, Hsieh Chih Kuang (Medical Doctor from University of Connecticut 1922) was recruited from PUMC (Peking Union Medical College), where he was a professor and head of the radiology department since 1928, to chair the radiology department at Lingang University. Since the early 1950s and with the help of Ke Lin, the Dean of the Zhongshan Medical School, they later established the Tumor Hospital in South China. The hospital opened its doors in March 1964 under the leadership of Hsieh Chih Kuang. A few days later a Cancer Institute was opened under the leadership of Liang Boqiang. In 1966, the name of the hospital was changed to the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Sun Yat-sen Medical College. The name was later changed again in 1985, to the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Sun Yat-sen Medical University. Twenty-three years after both their respective establishments, in 1987, the Cancer Hospital and the Cancer Institute merged under the name Sun Yat-sen Medical University Cancer Center. The name was simplified in 2001 to: Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.  Research  According to the 2018 Nature Index report for global healthcare, the achievements of SYSUCC's active research environment were number 81 among the top 100 medical institutes in the world. \\"The Nature Index is a freely accessible database of author affiliation information collated from research articles published in an independently selected group of high-quality science journals.\\" = State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China = SYSUCC hosts the State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China (SKL), which is national recognition for the highest degree of expertise.

It was largely mobilised from the Dravska divisional district, and, like all Yugoslav infantry divisions of the time, was a very large and unwieldy formation which was almost entirely reliant on animal transport for mobility. Commanded by Divizijski ƒëeneral ƒåedomir Stanojloviƒá and largely manned by Slovene and ethnic German troops, the division also lacked modern arms and sufficient ammunition to meet the German onslaught. Part of the Yugoslav 7th Army, it was to be deployed in the Pohorje mountains around Maribor, responsible for the German frontier from the Savinja Alps in the west to Radgona in the east, including the roads running south through Dravograd and Maribor, with its main positions on the southern bank of the Dravinja river. When the invasion commenced on 6 April, much of the division was deployed forward at Dravograd and Maribor, where, along with the border guard units along the frontier, it briefly held a defensive line. German penetration on its right flank soon resulted in withdrawal to the Dravinja and subsequent attempts to form a defensive line failed. Undermined by fifth column activities and faced with German thrusts by two German corps through Dravograd and Maribor, the division fell back in disarray and surrendered with the rest of the 7th Army on 12 April. Background alt=Map highlighting the location of Yugoslavia The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created with the merger of Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav- inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the immediate aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro- Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political hegemony. The army's development was hampered by the kingdom's poor economy, and this continued during the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army was renamed the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ). The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. Infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26,000‚Äì27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in their invasions of Poland and France. The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Usta≈°e but also from the country's Slovene and ethnic German minorities. Structure =Peacetime organisation= According to regulations issued by the VKJ in 1935, the 38th Infantry Division Dravska (38th ID) was to be raised from the Dravska divisional district, which was headquartered in Ljubljana. The Dravska divisional district was under the control of the 4th Army district, headquartered in Zagreb. The division was named for the Drava river, which runs through the Styria region, and was largely manned by Slovene and ethnic German troops. In peacetime, the Dravska divisional district included: * 37th Infantry Regiment, based in Ribnica * 39th Infantry Regiment, based in Celje * 40th Infantry Regiment, based in Ljubljana * 45th Infantry Regiment, based in Maribor * 16th Artillery Regiment, based in Ljubljana * 32nd Artillery Regiment, based in Maribor =Wartime organisation= The wartime organisation of the VKJ was laid down by regulations issued in 1936‚Äì37, which set the strength of an infantry division at 26,000‚Äì27,000 men. A total of 11,200 horses and other pack and draught animals were required to provide mobility for each infantry division. The theoretical wartime organisation of a fully mobilised Yugoslav infantry division was: * headquarters * divisional infantry headquarters, with three or four infantry regiments * divisional artillery headquarters, with one or two artillery regiments * a cavalry battalion with two squadrons, a bicycle squadron and a machine gun platoon * a pioneer battalion of three companies * an anti-tank company, equipped with twelve or anti-tank guns * a machine gun company * an anti-aircraft machine gun company * a signals company * logistics units Each infantry regiment was to consist of three to four infantry battalions and a machine gun company. The divisional artillery regiments were animal-drawn and largely equipped with World War I-vintage pieces. An artillery regiment consisted of four battalions, one of light howitzers, one of or mountain guns, and two of or field guns. The 37th, 39th and 40th Infantry Regiments and the 16th and 32nd Artillery Regiments, which were administered by the Dravska divisional district in peacetime, were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised, and the division was to be brought up to its wartime strength by the 38th and 112th Infantry Regiments and 38th Artillery Regiment from the VJK reserve. Planned deployment The 38th ID was a component of the 7th Army, a part of the 1st Army Group, which was responsible for the defence of north and north-western Yugoslavia. According to the final war plan developed by the Yugoslav General Staff, \\"Defence Plan R-41\\", the 7th Army was to deploy in a cordon along the Italian and German borders. The 38th ID was to deploy in the Pohorje mountains around Maribor, responsible for the German frontier from the Savinja Alps in the west to Gornja Radgona in the east, including the roads running south from the German border through Dravograd to Celje and Maribor to Ptuj. Both Dravograd and Maribor are on the Drava river, a major obstacle. The 38th ID was to establish its main positions on the southern bank of the Dravinja river, some south of the Drava. On the left flank of the division was Mountain Detachment Triglavski (MD Triglavski), and on its right flank was Detachment Ormozki of the 4th Army. Both of these flanking formations were ad hoc groupings of brigade-strength. Border guard units in the divisional sector consisted of the 6th, 7th and 8th Border Regiments supported by three border artillery battalions fielding a total of eight batteries. Prior to the invasion, significant fortifications known as the Rupnik Line were constructed along the German border. In what became the 38th ID sector, the Yugoslavs concentrated on preparing to block the passes through the Karawank and Savinja Alps, and built bunkers behind obstacles along the routes leading south from the border towards Dravograd and Maribor. Preparations were also made to block routes north of the Drava and along the southern banks of the Drava. These fortifications were to be manned by border guard units, and were not the responsibility of the 7th Army. Operations =Mobilisation= Following unrelenting political pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, a military coup d'√©tat overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force commander, Armijski ƒëeneral Du≈°an Simoviƒá. A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. This hesitation was in vain, for on the same day as the coup Hitler had issued F√ºhrer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, F√ºhrer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the invasion, which was to commence on 6 April. According to a post-war U.S. Army study, by the time the invasion began, the 38th ID had only commenced mobilising, and was largely in its mobilisation centres or moving to concentration areas. On 6 April, the elements of the division were located as follows: * the divisional commander Divizijski ƒëeneral ƒåedomir Stanojloviƒá, his chief of staff Major Ivan Babiƒá, and their headquarters staff were mobilising in Slovenska Bistrica * the divisional infantry headquarters and 45th Infantry Regiment were mobilising around Maribor * the 38th Infantry Regiment was mobilising in Maribor, Slovenska Bistrica and Ptuj * the 112th Infantry Regiment (less its 1st Battalion) was marching west towards Slovenj Gradec from Slovenska Bistrica. The 1st Battalion of the 112th Infantry Regiment had already deployed near Dravograd, supporting the 6th Border Regiment * the 128th Infantry Regiment, which had been allocated to the 38th ID from the VKJ reserve at mobilisation, was concentrating near Ptuj * the 38th Artillery Regiment (less its 2nd Battalion) was near Ptuj, while its 2nd Battalion was marching west from Maribor to its planned position at Slovenj Gradec * the divisional machine-gun battalion, which had only 50 percent of its establishment of men and animals, was marching south from Maribor to Ptuj * the remainder of the divisional units were mobilising in Slovenska Bistrica, Maribor, Ptuj and Ljubljana =5‚Äì6 April= alt=A black and white photograph of a group of a dozen German soldiers marching past a house with weapons slung over their shoulders The border between Germany and Yugoslavia was largely unsuitable for motorised operations due to the mountainous terrain. Due to the short notice of the invasion, the elements of Generaloberst Maximilian von Weichs's invading German 2nd Army that would make up LI Infantry Corps and XXXXIX Mountain Corps had to be transported from Germany, German-occupied France and the Nazi puppet Slovak Republic, and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas on schedule. In the interim, the Germans formed a special force under the code name Feuerzauber (Magic Fire). This force was initially intended to merely reinforce the 538th Frontier Guard Division, which was guarding the German border. On the evening of 5 April, a particularly aggressive Feuerzauber detachment commander, Hauptmann Palten, led his Kampfgruppe Palten across the Mura river from Spielfeld and, having secured the bridge, began attacking bunkers and other Yugoslav positions on the high ground, and sent patrols deep into the Yugoslav border fortification system. Due to a lack of Yugoslav counter-attacks, many of these positions remained in German hands into 6 April. On the morning of 6 April, German aircraft conducted surprise attacks on Yugoslav airfields in the 7th Army area, including Ljubljana. For example, at 07:00, Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters of Jagdgeschwader 27 strafed Ljubljana airfield, attacking hangars and some Potez 25 biplanes. The LI Infantry Corps, commanded by General der Infanterie Hans- Wolfgang Reinhard, was tasked with attacking towards Maribor then driving towards Zagreb. The XXXXIX Mountain Corps, under General der Infanterie Ludwig K√ºbler, was to capture Dravograd then force a crossing on the Sava river at Zidani Most. At 05:00 on 6 April, LI Infantry Corps captured the Mura bridges at Mureck and Radkersburg (opposite Gornja Radgona) undamaged. One column of LI Infantry Corps pushed towards Maribor from Mureck, and the other pushed on from Gornja Radgona through Lenart towards Ptuj. Some time later, other elements of LI Infantry Corps attacked the area between Sveti Duh and Dravograd. The 7th and 8th Border Regiments met these attacks with fierce resistance, but were forced to withdraw due to German pressure. Generalmajor Benignus Dippold's 183rd Infantry Division of LI Infantry Corps captured 300 prisoners, and a bicycle-mounted detachment of the division reached Murska Sobota in the sector of the right flanking Detachment Ormozki without meeting any resistance. Generalmajor Rudolf Sintzenich's 132nd Infantry Division, also from LI Infantry Corps, pushed south along the Sejanski valley towards Savci. By the end of the first day, LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and Radenci, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XXXXIX Mountain Corps captured border crossings on the approaches to Dravograd, but was held up by the 6th Border Regiment in mountain passes located further west at Ljubelj, Jezerski Vrh and Korensko sedlo. Late that day, German mountain pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in the area penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten. German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters, attacked airfields in the rear area of the 7th Army later that day. This was followed by attacks by the Italian Air Force on Yugoslav troop concentrations in the 7th Army area. The Yugoslav Air Force was unable to interdict the Axis air attacks because the Hawker Hurricanes and Ikarus IK-2 aircraft of its 4th Fighter Regiment were based away at Bosanski Aleksandrovac. After having been grounded for most of the day by poor weather, in the afternoon Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers of the Yugoslav 68th Bomber Group flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the German frontier at Graz, F√ºrstenfeld, Steyr and Wiener Neustadt in an attempt to interdict the assembling Germans. By the close of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and this, combined with delays caused by fifth column actions meant that nearly all the fighting was conducted by border troops. Fifth columnists delayed but did not engage in combat with Yugoslav troops. The 38th ID was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion in depth around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion on the right around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion on the left were at Slovenj Gradec and marching north towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services. On that day, Marko Natlaƒçen‚Äîthe governor of the Drava Banovina (province)‚Äîmet with representatives of the major Slovene political parties, and created the National Council of Slovenia (, NszS), whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia. When he heard the news of fifth-column-led revolts within the flanking 4th Army, the commander of the 7th Army, Divizijski ƒëeneral Du≈°an Trifunoviƒá was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by the commander of the 1st Army Group, Armijski ƒëeneral Milorad Petroviƒá. =7 April= In the early hours of 7 April, three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment took off from Rovine to bomb the railway junction at Feldbach, but became disoriented in bad weather. Only one aircraft found a target, bombing a bridge and road near Steyr before continuing on to Wiener Neustadt where it was hit by anti-aircraft fire and made an emergency landing. Over the period 7‚Äì9 April, LI Infantry Corps held the lead elements of the 183rd and 132nd Infantry Divisions back to some extent while the rest of each division de- trained in Graz and made their way to the border. German forces along the front of the 7th Army continued to push towards Maribor and Dravograd on 7 April, against significant resistance from the 6th, 7th and 8th Border Regiments. The German thrusts towards Maribor broke through the Yugoslav defensive line Pesnica‚ÄìLenart‚ÄìSveta Trojica v Slovenskih Goricah‚ÄìKapelski Vrh, but those advancing towards Dravograd were held up by the 6th Border Regiment and a battalion of the 38th ID. On the afternoon of 7 April, Trifunoviƒá again pressed Petroviƒá to order a withdrawal from the border. Petroviƒá accepted that this might become necessary if the situation on the immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the chief of staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski ƒëeneral Leon Rupnik, who wryly suggested that Trifunoviƒá should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petroviƒá that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy. =8 April= alt=A black and white photograph of a group of German soldiers paddling a rubber boat across a river On the night of 7/8 April, Petroviƒá ordered Trifunoviƒá to begin to withdraw, first to a line through the Dravinja river, Zidani Most bridge and the right bank of the Krka river. Later in the day this was moved back to the line of the Kupa river. This ended the successful defence of the 38th ID and border guard units along the line of the Drava, and meant their withdrawal from Maribor. Disregarding orders from above, Palten exploited their withdrawal by leading his kampfgruppe south towards the town, and crossing the Pesnica river in inflatable boats, leaving his unit vehicles behind. In the evening, Palten and his force entered Maribor unopposed, taking 100 prisoners. For disregarding orders, Palten and his kampfgruppe were ordered to return to Spielfeld, and spent the rest of the invasion guarding the border. In the meantime, the forward elements of the two divisions consolidated their bridgeheads, with the 132nd Infantry Division securing Maribor, and the 183rd Infantry Division pushing past Murska Sobota, reaching Kapelski Vrh. Some bridges over the Drava were blown before all elements of the 7th and 8th Border Regiments had withdrawn, but some soldiers were able to swim across, the rest being captured by the advancing Germans. German patrols reached the Drava at Ptuj, and further east at Ormo≈æ they found the bridge had been blown. Elements of the XXXXIX Mountain Corps had pushed forward to Poljana and Dravograd. The German troops received close air support from dive bombers and fighters during their advance, while medium bombers hit targets throughout the 7th Army area. The 4th Fighter Regiment clashed several times with German aircraft on 8 April without result. Three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment again flew a mission to attack a target in southern Austria, escorted by 4th Fighter Regiment Hurricanes, but the rest of the 8th Bomber Regiment was awaiting orders to bomb a rebelling Yugoslav regiment of the neighbouring 4th Army in Bjelovar ‚Äì these orders were subsequently cancelled. The German orders for the following day were for LI Infantry Corps to force a crossing of the Drava near Varazdin on the right flank of the 38th ID and advance on Zagreb, while XXXXIX Mountain Corps were to drive towards Celje. =9 April= On 9 April, the Germans continued their advance, and all elements of both divisions of LI Infantry Corps had finally unloaded in Graz. In the meantime, the 7th Army continued rapidly withdrawing its right wing, while withdrawing its centre more slowly. The 38th ID continued to withdraw south from Ptuj through Krapina towards Zagreb, while the Mountain Detachment Triglavski on its left flank fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river. Units of LI Infantry Corps crossed the Drava along the line Maribor‚ÄìPtuj and further east, and continued to expand their bridgehead south of Maribor. Elements of XXXXIX Mountain Corps expanded their bridgehead at Dravograd. German aircraft again attacked airfields in the rear area of the 7th Army. As the activities of Natlaƒçen and his NszS were continuing, the Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered their arrest. Rupnik and the head of the operations staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Pukovnik Franjo Nikoliƒá, who were both Slovenes, hid the orders from Petroviƒá and did not carry them out. =10 April= alt=A colour map On the evening of 9 April, Weichs ordered the XXXXVI Motorised Corps of General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff to break out of its bridgeheads in the 4th Army's sector the following day. The thrust from the Z√°k√°ny bridgehead was to drive straight west to Zagreb then continue west to cut off the withdrawing 7th Army. This attack was led by Generalmajor Friedrich K√ºhn's 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, and was a resounding success. By 19:30 on 10 April, lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb, having covered nearly in a single day. Before it arrived, the Usta≈°e, supported by German agents, had proclaimed the creation of the puppet Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). When it entered Zagreb, the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds, and had captured 15,000 Yugoslav troops, including 22 generals. In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began crossing the Drava, but construction of a bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki, the formation on the immediate right flank of the 38th ID. This crossing, combined with the withdrawal of the 38th ID from the line from Slovenska Bistrica‚ÄìPtuj, exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. It attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night of 10/11 April. That same night, the 1st Mountain Division, the most capable formation of XXXXIX Mountain Corps, had de-trained, crossed the border near Bleiburg, and advanced southeast towards Celje, reaching a point about from the town by evening. The rest of the XXXXIX Mountain Corps encountered little resistance, and by nightfall had reached the line ≈†o≈°tanj‚ÄìMislinja. Luftwaffe reconnaissance sorties revealed that the main body of the 7th Army was withdrawing towards Zagreb, leaving behind light forces to maintain contact with the German bridgeheads. When it received this information, 2nd Army headquarters ordered LI Infantry Corps to form motorised columns to pursue the 7th Army south, but extreme weather conditions and flooding of the Drava at Maribor on 10 April slowed the German pursuit. On 10 April, as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simoviƒá, who was both the Prime Minister and Chief of the General Staff, broadcast the following message: > All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means > at their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act on your > own and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience. During the night of 10/11 April, XXXXIX Mountain Corps was ordered to bridge the Savinja river at Celje, then advance towards Bre≈æice on the Sava, and LI Infantry Corps was directed to link up with the 14th Panzer Division which would then drive west to Karlovac. =11 April= On 11 April, Usta≈°e elements captured the staff of the 7th Army at Topusko and handed them over to the Germans shortly thereafter, and the 7th Army effectively ceased to exist as a formation. Chaos ensued throughout the 7th Army, whose Croat and Slovene soldiers could hear fifth column radio broadcasts telling them of their pending encirclement by the Germans and encouraging them to return to their homes and not fight against the invaders. This was reinforced by Natlaƒçen and his NszS, who had distributed leaflets on the night of 10/11 April urging soldiers not to resist the Axis troops. To maintain public order, the NszS also formed a \\"Slovenian Legion\\" on 11 April, and encouraged Slovene nationalists among the 7th Army to join it. This force, split into a dozen units and totalling 2,000‚Äì3,000 men, then began to assist the Germans in disarming units of the 7th Army, but did not engage in combat with Yugoslav troops. The NszS authorised Natlaƒçen to negotiate with the Germans for the creation of a Slovene client state along the lines of the NDH and the Slovak Republic, and Natlaƒçen appointed the Ljubljana police chief Lovro Hacin to make contact with the Germans. alt=A black and white photograph of soldiers in helmets watching other soldiers laying down rifles in a pile Proxies for the NszS approached Generalmajor Hubert Lanz, the commander of the 1st Mountain Division, when his formation closed on Celje, but Lanz was not empowered to negotiate with civilians, and sought direction from higher headquarters. All German commanders were authorised to negotiate with the commanders of Yugoslav military formations so long as they agreed to surrender all weapons. Later that day, Lanz was authorised to meet with Natlaƒçen the following day, and XXXXIX Mountain Corps took Celje. Held up by freezing weather and snow storms, LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and broke through a hastily established defensive line south of Ptuj between Pregrada and Krapina. Bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure Usta≈°e-controlled Vara≈ædin in the 4th Army sector. In the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division but lead elements of that division had already thrust west from Zagreb into the rear of the withdrawing 7th Army and captured Karlovac. Around 12:00, the Italians went over to the offensive against the formations of the 7th Army on the left flank of the 38th ID, with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line Selca‚ÄìRadovljica, XI Corps to push via Logatec to Ljubljana, VI Corps to drive on Prezid, and V Corps to advance south from Fiume towards Kraljevica then Lokve. There was little significant resistance to the Italians, and by the end of the day they had captured Su≈°ak, Bakar, Delnice, Jesenice, Vrhnika, Logatec and Ljubljana. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region. The Italians captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian 14th Infantry Division Isonzo entered Ljubljana, a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, Generale di Divisione Federico Romero, and symbolically handed him the keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by Natlaƒçen and most of the members of the NszS, but because Natlaƒçen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy Ljubljana, he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz. Fate On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the ring around the remnants of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and ƒårnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice by the end of the day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlaƒçen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of the Drava Banovina into Italian and German- controlled territories, and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective. Remnants of the 4th Army conducted a fighting withdrawal through Bosnia towards Sarajevo over the following days, pursued by the 14th Panzer Division and elements of LI Infantry Corps but a ceasefire was declared at noon on 15 April. After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document, the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers, with Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania all annexing parts of its territory. Most of the Slovene members of the division and all ethnic Germans taken as prisoners of war were soon released by the Axis powers, as 90 per cent of those held for the duration of the war were Serbs.

History  Skaros Rock is a large rock promontory on the Aegean island of Santorini. The formation was created through the volcanic activity (likely in an eruption dated to 68,000 B.C)http://volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0102-04= of the nearby Santorini caldera, and has since been further shaped by erosion and earthquakes. In a nautical context, the formation is referred to as Cape Skaros. A prominent landmark, the elevated position of the rock made it a preferable location for defensive fortifications. The site was initially fortified in the early 13th century by the Byzantine Empire, which employed Venetian architect Giacomo Barozzi to construct a fortress around the promontory. The initial structure, known as \\"La Roka\\" (\\"Upper Castle\\" in Greek), was completed in 1207. Upon the fortress' completion, Barozzi was given control of Santorini by fellow Venetian Marco I Sanudo, who had recently coerced the Byzantines into surrendering their claim to the Aegean islands and had named himself Duke of Naxos. The settlement subsequently grew, with many homes, businesses, and further fortifications being built around the promontory. A church complex, the Chapel of Panagia Theoskepasti, was built at the base of the formation, as was a small harbor. By the time of the Venetian Republic's takeover of Santorini in 1336, the settlement consisted of over 200 homes and had several hundred inhabitants. As Skaros was the largest settlement on the island, the fortress became the de facto capitol of Venetian Santorini. Thomas Hope dating to the 1790salt= A series of escalating wars between the Ottoman Empire and Venice in the mid 16th century resulted in Santorini being the target of numerous raids by the Ottomans. While other settlements suffered, Skaros' fortifications and position high on the cliffs of Western Santorini protected the town from raiders. However, the island's trade-based economy suffered, resulting in the ruling families of Santorini severing ties with Venice and signing a non-aggression treaty with the Ottomans. This policy change angered Venice, which attempted to recover the island without success. In addition to Venetian incursions, some Ottoman captains continued to raid the island for slaves and supplies in violation of the Turko-Santorinian treaty, while the rise of the Tunisia-based Barbary pirates also proved to be a major threat to the island. Despite these risks, Santorini maintained its independence until 1566, when Ottoman admiral Piali Pasha arrived off of the island with a large fleet, demanding the full annexation of the island into the Ottoman Empire.Bono, Salvatore: Corsari nel Mediterraneo (Corsairs in the Mediterranean), Oscar Storia Mondadori. Perugia, 1993. All of the island's settlements, including Skaros, accepted these terms, and the island became an Ottoman possession. The Ottomans left a garrison force in Skaros, and after the Ottoman takeover the threat posed by Muslim piracy abated. Without the threat of raids to keep rival settlements in check, Skaros was eclipsed in importance by the towns of Fira (which became the new capital of the island) and Oia.Savvides, A. (1997). \\"Santurin AdasiÃä\\". In Bosworth, C. E.; van Donzel, E.; Heinrichs, W. P.; Lecomte, G. The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, Volume IX: San‚ÄìSze. Leiden: E. J. Brill. p. 20. . Though already in decline, Skaros remained a prominent settlement until the Santorini volcano became active and began to erupt in 1650. This eruption caused several strong earthquakes which collapsed part of the town into the sea. The volcano continued to go through periods of activity, erupting from 1701 to 1711 and again from 1866 to 1870. The 18th century eruptions were notably impactful, as they caused most of Skaros' residents to move to Fira or the nearby village of Imerovigli. The old Venetian fortress subsequently fell into disuse, and by the early 19th century consisted of only a few weathered ruins. = Present day = The ruins of Skaros are currently a popular destination for hiking and photography; the promontory is accessible via the nearby village of Imerovigli. A monastery, known as the Chapel of Panagia Theoskepasti, remains in use on the cliffs below the rock feature.

Although not currently starbursting, it has undergone a period of intense star formation in the recent past, ceasing only ‚âà500 Myr ago. The galaxy is host to an obscured AGN. A massive molecular outflow, with 2.4 √ó 107 M_{\\\\odot} of hydrogen, is present from the nucleus of the galaxy, at a rate of 110 M_{\\\\odot} yr‚àí1. Less than 2% of the gas (2 M_{\\\\odot} yr‚àí1) is escaping the galaxy. Momentum coupling to the jet of the AGN is likely driving the outflow. The current observed star-formation rate (SFR) of ~0.87 M_{\\\\odot} yr‚àí1 is significantly lower than expected for a galaxy of its properties, suppressed by a factor of 50 to 150. Authors have put forth several hypotheses to explain these observations. The most likely scenario is that the AGN-driven molecular outflow is injecting turbulence into the nuclear regions, preventing gravitational collapse of molecular clouds. NGC 1266 is the first known intermediate-mass galaxy to show AGN-driven suppression of star formation. Two hypotheses exist to explain NGC 1266's nuclear activity and excessive far-IR emission. Either a heavily obscured ultracompact starburst is present in the nuclear regions, or a powerful buried AGN is present, beyond what has been inferred from other observations. Neither scenario is without problems. The black hole at the center of the galaxy is likely growing according to the M‚Äìsigma relation, and eventually the outflow will result in the removal of the majority of the gas from the nucleus.

Dumas was the son of Benjamin F. Dumas and Martha Ussery, and through his father was the descendant of Huguenot refugees who had first settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1700. He was born in a part of Richmond County, North Carolina that is today located in Montgomery County, but at the age of four moved with his family to Georgia, where they settled in Putnam County. In 1821 they moved again, this time to Monroe County, Georgia. Dumas married Isabel Martha Gibson in 1830; the couple were the parents of thirteen children. A circuit rider, Dumas spent over forty years as a Primitive Baptist minister, founding the Union Primitive Baptist Church in Goggins, Georgia in 1837. He was prominent in the community, being active as a local judge in Montgomery County and serving in the Georgia House of Representatives. A Mason, he also ran a singing school in addition to his other musical activities. Dumas died in Monroe County and is buried in the cemetery of the church which he helped found.

Career After his step-father's death in 1885, his now twice-widowed mother divided the JA Ranch holdings with Charles Goodnight. In 1887, Ritchie traveled to the ranch to learn the cattle business from his stepfather's old partner who continued to manage the late Adair's properties, and hired Ritchie as a cowhand, eventually promoting him to foreman.J. Evetts Haley, Charles Goodnight (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1949).Dorothy Abbott McCoy, Texas Ranchmen (Austin: Eakin Press, 1987). Reportedly, Ritchie adapted quickly to the Panhandle and lived in a dugout at the original Tule campsite. In January 1888, Ritchie was demoted for gambling. Soon afterward, his mother persuaded him to travel to New York where Ritchie he managed the New York City Police Department's purchase of horses from the ranch.

Though born fully furred, Baldwin guinea pigs begin to lose their fur at two to five days of age, starting at the nose and leaving them almost entirely hairless by about two months of age. They retain whiskers and sometimes a few hairs on their feet. Baldwins are known for having skin of a rubbery texture, many wrinkles and large, droopy ears. They come in all colors and patterns that haired guinea pigs come in, such as Dutch, tortoiseshell, broken colors, Himalayan and selfs. Unique traits Hairless guinea pigs are not significantly physiologically different than regular haired guinea pigs, although they need to eat more to maintain body heat. The optimal temperature range for a hairless guinea pig is , which is slightly higher than the optimal temperature range for the haired guinea pig. Their skin has a similar appearance to human skin, but has a more rubbery texture. Their skin is quite vulnerable to sunburn, other injuries and fungal infections unless precautions are taken. Baldwin guinea pigs should be housed indoors and they are usually kept with nesting materials such as a blanket, fleece bag or small plastic or wooden house for heat conservation. Heating pads or other external heat sources may be needed when the weather is cold. The gene causing hairlessness in Baldwin guinea pigs is a recessive gene, and breeding two Baldwins together will always result in all offspring being Baldwins. Breeding a Baldwin guinea pig to a standard haired guinea pig will result in offspring that all carry one copy of the gene, but none will express hairlessness. These offspring are generally called Baldwin carriers. Breeding two Baldwin carriers together will (on average) result in 25% offspring being Baldwins, 50% offspring being Baldwin carriers and 25% offspring being regular haired guinea pigs that do not carry the gene. Since the chance of getting a Baldwin is low, and because it is not possible to visually tell the difference between a haired guinea pig that does carry the gene and one that does not, this method of breeding is not recommended. Haired Baldwin carriers remain haired (looking like normal guinea pigs) their entire life. There is a second type of hairless guinea pig called the Skinny pig, but its hairlessness is the result of a completely different recessive gene. Breeding a Skinny pig with a Baldwin will result entirely in offspring that are haired yet carry one copy of the gene for Skinny pig hairlessness and one copy of the gene for Baldwin hairlessness. Even though the Baldwin is a relatively new breed among pet owners and cavy fanciers, it is gaining popularity for its unique and handsome appearance.
