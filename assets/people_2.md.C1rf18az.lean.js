Baṣrī (; 1911-2006) was an Iraqi Jewish writer, economist, journalist, and poet. Among many public positions he held, Basri served as the head and central leader of Baghdad's Jewish community.  Life  Basri was born on September 19, 1911 in Baghdad, Iraq to Shaool Basri and Farha Dangoor (the daughter of the famous Chief Rabbi of Baghdad Ezra Reuben Dangoor). Basri was educated Baghdad at al-Ta'awun and the Alliance school where he studied Hebrew, English, and French. Following his secondary education, he trained as an economist and studied Arabic literature. In 1928, Basri joined the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, going on to hold a number of government positions including many relating to Iraq's Jewish community. In early January 1969, Basri, then-Chairman of the Jewish Council of Iraq, was detained for almost two months for interviewing an American who the Iraqi government alleged to be a spy. His detention has been characterized as motivated by antisemitic efforts to censor the Iraqi Jewish community. In the early 70's Basri, who had originally been unwilling to immigrate from his home country, left Iraq for Amsterdam. From Amsterdam, he immigrated to the UK where he lived until his death in 2006.  Writing  During his career, Basri wrote in a variety of genres, including poetry, biography, periodical, and essay and memoir. Much of his writing is centered on his identity as a Jew living in the Arab world during the establishment of Israel; themes of patriotism, homeland, Zionism, and religion are common. Basri described himself as being enthralled with Arabic, particularly Arabic poetry, and published much of his work in the language.

Anthropologist Norman Tindale distinguished the Mutjati from the Otati, whereas AIATSIS treats the two ethnonyms as variants related to the one ethnic group, the Wuthathi. Language Wuthathi is considered to have been a dialect of the Uradhi branch of the Paman languages. A list of some 400 words of the Otati language was taken down by Charles Gabriel Seligman, and a further 60 by George Pimm, members of Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits in the late 19th century. Country The Wuthathi, according to Tindale, held sway over some of territory extending north from Shelburne Bay north to the vicinity of Orford Ness. The area around Shelburne Bay has been described as the some of 'the most beautiful coastal and island country in Australia, if not the world,' and was home to over 30 rare and threatened species of fauna as the double-wattled cassowary and the palm cockatoo. One report issued after the battle for the conservation of Shelburne Bay from silica mining had been won, stated of Shelburne, together with the Cape Flattery duneland: > The extraordinary landscapes of these two largest dunefields make a lasting > impression on all who view them. Active, large elongated parabolic dunes > rise like snow-clad hills above vegetation and/or lake filled swales. Low > ridges (<2m high) in repeated v-shapes form so called Gegenwalle ground > patterns within the dunefields, that are the best developed and largest in > the world. Donald Thomson places the Otati on the coast south of Oxford Bay down to Margaret Bay. Norman Tindale stated that the Otati dwelt in their traditional lands, measuring roughly , which extended from the southern part of Shelburne Bay, east and south to the Macmillan River, inland as far as the headwaters of the Dulhunty River. Tindale's distinction of the Otati with the Mutjati is not accepted by AIATSIS, which regards the two as variants of the one name. Mythology Wuthathi origin stories focus on their totem, the Diamond stingray, in Wuthathi called yama, which had been washed up on shore and flipped on its back during a tempest, exposing its pure white belly, a tale which apparently had an aetiological purpose for explaining the dazzling white silica dunes characteristic of the site. Lifestyle and economy The Otati were one of the Kawadji, or sandbeach people, like the Pakadji, Olkola and others, who lived along the coast facing the Coral Sea and fished for food in the rivers and ocean. History of contact The Wuthathi were uprooted from the Shelburne Bay area and forcefully herded by the Queensland Government down to the Lockhart Mission where they were forbidden to practice their customs or speak their language. The land they were dispossessed of was then leased out to white pastoralists. When word leaked out in 1985 that a joint Japanese Australian consortium, Shelburne Silica, proposed mining the white silica sand dunes at Shelburne Bay and was seeking a mining lease to work over of dunefields, in order to extract and export 400,000 tonnes a year for the Japanese glass manufacturing industry, the displaced Wuthathi and Australian conservation activists, the latter headed by Don Henry of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, mobilized to challenge the plan through the courts. The consortium produced documentation claiming that the Wuthathi people were extinct, though one descendant, Alik Pablo, artfully demonstrated his knowledge of the bay when miners lawyers tested him with an upturned map to confuse him. Despite a ruling by the Mining Warden in favour of the indigenous people, the government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen persisted in ignoring the decision. Eventually the then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, included the Shelburne Bay in one of the four conservation areas he marked out as crucial to the national interest, the others being The Daintree Wet Tropics, Kakadu and the Tasmanian Wilderness. In 2016, after a century of dispossession, the Wuthathi right to 118,000 hectares of this spectacular coastal landscape was recognized.

Their major concentration is in Maharashtra, but there are also populations in northern Karnataka and Telangana. There is no certain knowledge of their origins. Colonial scholars, including Edgar Thurston, believed the name Vodra derives from Odra-desha, the old name for Odisha, and thus they must have come from there. However the theory is only based on a speculation of the etymology of their name. In support of this, Thurston mentioned they had another language besides Telugu that could be related to Odia, but no other scholars have reported it. Based on linguistic evidence, the Waddars may actually come from the region now known as Andhra Pradesh or Telangana. The Waddars have traditionally been migratory. They were placed under the Criminal Tribes Act by the British. Their first caste association was formed in Chitradurga, Karnataka in 1940. They were later classified as a Denotified Tribe in Maharashtra. They traditionally do most construction, especially stone-crushing, earth-diigging and other similar jobs. Nowadays they are classified as a Backward Class in Telangana and as a Scheduled Caste in Karnataka. They speak the Waddar language, related to Telugu.

Yeilding is currently the Vice President of British Petroleum, America, and has had various other positions at BP in oil and gas, exploration of the Gulf of Mexico, geoscience and Vice President of exploration technology. Yeilding graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in Geology from Southern Methodist University and later completed her Master's of Science degree in Geology from the University of North Carolina. Yeilding has given short courses and lectures on exploration with her vast experience in exploration, production and geoscience.  Personal life  Cindy Yeilding was born on May 23, 1960. She is currently a wife and mother of two children. As a child, Cindy's mother often took her to hunt for fossils and rocks, helping develop her love for geology and the physical world. Her interest strengthened with further support from her educators, family, and friends. Yeilding enjoyed how geology presented opportunities to interact with nature and explore the world, as well as work with teams of geoscientists who were equally as passionate about the field. Gathering bits of information from the Earth and connecting the dots to create models that explain structures and history of rocks is her favorite part of the career.  Education  Yeilding initially pursued a math degree, from being praised as being talented in mathematics during her high school years. Eventually she decided to pursue her true passion, art history and architecture, and switched to a geology major. Yeilding studied Geology at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. She then graduated from there with a bachelor's degree in Science. Soon after, she continued to pursue Geology at a graduate level and attained her Master's in Science degree University of North Carolina.  Achievements  Throughout her illustrious career Cindy Yeilding has been recognized for numerous awards and honorary positions. Among the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, she is recognized as a Distinguished Lecturer, as well as a founding member of the AAPG's Women's Committee. In 2003, the AAPG awarded Yeilding the title of \\"Legend of Exploration.\\" Within the city of Houston, Yeilding has maintained a decorated reputation. While being included within the rankings of Houston's 50 Most Influential Women of 2016, she was awarded the Houston Business Journal's \\"2016 Women in Energy Leadership\\" award, as well as being included among the Top 15 Business Women in Houston. Yeilding was named a 2017 honoree of the Manufacturing Institutes STEP Award for women in science, technology, engineering, and production.  Scientific contributions  Cindy A. Yielding has contributed to and published numerous research works, some of which include the following: * Structural Controls on Tertiary Deep Water Deposition in the Northern Gulf of Mexico: A study that analyzes how the seabed topographies of the northern Gulf of Mexico are created, the factors involved in its creation and the role of the regional and local structural setting as well as the area's previous tectonic and deposition history. * Spatial and Temporal Variations in the Facies Associations of Depositional Sequences on the Slope: Examples from the Miocene-Pleistocene of the Gulf of Mexico: The study of the deep water deposition systems of northern Gulf of Mexico which demonstrates that the building blocks that make up the deep water depositional sequences combine in a variable assemblage of facies. These depositional sequences are also predictive since they assemble in an upward succession of high energy to low energy deposits. * Shelf Margin Processes And Their Impact On Sediment Architecture Of The Plio-Pleistocene, U.S. Gulf of Mexico: An article which aims to describe how the shelf margins in the Plio-Pleistocene of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico varies, with the study of the depositional sequences of these shelf margins as well as how vertical and lateral facies are associated with them. This articles also lays out the ways in which slope deposition can be predicted through the analyzation of the structure of the shelf margins, as well as the relationship between these shelf margin architectures and sea level changes. * Facies in a shelf-edge delta - An example from the subsurface of the Gulf of Mexico, middle Pliocene, Mississippi Canyon, Block 109: A study of shelf-edge delta systems in the middle Pliocene, Mississippi Canyon, Block 109, which includes analyzation into the characteristics such as vertically stacked shelf-edge delta systems, extensive upper delta-slope deformation, turbidities in the upper slope, gravity and tractional deposits, mouth-bar deposits, and the lack of delta- plain facies. * Sedimentary response to Mississippian tectonic activity at the east end of the 38th Parallel fracture zone: A study of the Mississippian est end of the 38th Parallel fracture zone that describes how the east-west uplift is established, as well as records the timing of Paleozoic tectonic movement. * Is the workstation \\"killing\\" geology?: An article in the Bulletin of the Houston Geological Society journal, in which Yielding describes how advanced technology has aided the geological interpretations and analyzations, while also raising points on how heavy reliance of the geo-scientists on the tools and aids of technology also leads to diminished critical analyzing and thinking. * Effects of Mississippian Tectonic Movement on Sedimentation and Diagenesis of Greenbrier Group in Eastern Appalachian Plateau: Analyzations of the effects of tectonic movements in Mississippi on the sedimentation in the Eastern Appalachian Plateau. This study describes the characteristics of the sediment layers and lays out how the layers were formed. *Reservoir Prediction Using the Forest and the Trees: Reducing Reservoir Risk and Uncertainty in Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Exploration by Using a Wide Range and Scale of Predictive Tools: This article from the Bulletin of the Houston Geological Society Journal, talks about the analyzation of the depositional and petroleum systems framework on which the exploration of the Gulf of Mexico is focused.

Therefore, it is known as \\"Tadkeshwar\\". The length of the Shivlinga is approximately 6 to 8 ft.About - Tadkeshwar Mahadev Temple, ValsadHistory of Tadkeshwar Mahadev Temple, Valsad On the occasions of the Maha Shivaratri festival and Shravan Month, a fair take place nearby. History of Tadkeshwar Mahadev Temple, Valsad History A semi-circuler Shivlinga type stone was seen in the bushes of the north bank of Wanki river in May 1215.Samarpan magazine: \\"Tadkeshwar\\" During that time, this stone was taken by the local people who partially broke it down. Poisonous wasps swarmed from the stone and stung around 60 people within a 1500 ft radius of the temple. All 60 died and were buried on the temple site. The Dargah was created on the site. One day Shiva appeared in the dreams of a devotee of Abrama and commanded: \\"Take the linga from the bank of Wanki river. Two of Lord Shiva's devotees can pick it up easily. When the linga becomes too heavy, set it down and create the linga on that place.\\" The temple ceiling was built twice. After the first time the ceiling was destroyed in a fire. The second time, the ceiling collapsed. Lord Shiva appeared in the dreams of one devotee and said: \\" I am Tadkeshwar Mahadev. I need the Rays of Sun. Therefore, do not reconstruct the ceiling of the temple.\\". From that day on, Shivlinga of Tadkeshwar Mahadev was kept safe in the temple. The peak of the temple remains open to the sky, featuring a hole about in diameter. At noon, the rays of the Sun shine directly on the Shivlinga.History of Tadkeshwar Mahadev Temple: Image References Category:Tourist attractions in Valsad district ","title":"Tadkeshwar Mahadev Temple"},{"id":"59670472","text":"Luiz Gustavo Novaes Palhares (born 20 February 1998), simply known as Luizão is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Porto B as a midfielder.

Bubares built the Xerxes Canal for the passage of the Second Persian invasion of Greece.

Bubares (, died after 480 BC) was a Persian nobleman and engineer in the service of the Achaemenid Empire of the 5th century BC. He was one of the sons of Megabazus, and a second-degree cousin of Xerxes I. Marriage to the sister of Alexander I of Macedon Bubares was sent to Macedonia in order to settle a diplomatic conflict with King Alexander I, as Alexander was responsible as crown prince for the murder of several members of a Persian delegation, a few years earlier. The Persians had taken liberties with the Macedonian women of the Palace, and therefore had all been killed with their retinues by Alexander and his men. General Bubares was sent with some troops to investigate the matter. King Alexander diffused the situation by giving a great sum of money and marrying his sister Gygaia to Bubares: The couple had a son named after their maternal grandfather, Amyntas. Amyntas later officiated in Caria as a tyrant of the city of Alabanda. After staying a few years in Macedonia, possibly guarding the Axios valley, Bubares left circa 499-498 BC, possibly to attend to the matters of the Ionian revolt. Amyntas I of Macedon is said to have died soon after his departure. Xerxes canal From around before 483 BC and for three years, Xerxes I commissioned Bubares together with Artachaies for the construction of the so-called Xerxes Canal through the isthmus of the eastern foothills of the Chalkidike peninsula (near Ierissos). There, almost ten years before, the great Persian fleet of Mardonius had been shattered amidst the uneven waves of Mount Athos. The canal avoided the possibility of a repetition of this disaster. The construction of the canal was one of the most elaborate projects of antiquity and lasted three years, as workers were forcibly recruited from various peoples including the inhabitants of Athos.Herodotus VII, 24 Strymon bridge The ancient Persian fort at Eion (left) and the mouth of the Strymon River (right), seen from Ennea Hodoi (Amphipolis).

Its headquarters are located in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parfümerie Douglas was part of the Douglas Holding, but since 1 June 2015, 85 percent belong to the financial investor CVC Capital Partners and 15 percent to the Kreke family. The first perfumery to carry the name \\"Parfümerie Douglas\\" opened in Hamburg in 1910. With more than 2,400 perfumeries in 26 countries and turnover of roughly 3.5 billion Euros (fiscal year 2018/19) Douglas is the market leader in Europe.  History  The name of the company can be traced back to the Scottish soap manufacturer John Sharp Douglas. He came from a small village near Glasgow and on 5 January 1821, he founded a soap factory in Hamburg's warehouse district. The factory was soon included to the \\"Hamburger Address Book\\" as \\"J.S. Douglas, Engl. Soap factory, Kehrweider, Herbst Hof\\". On 5 November 1828, Hamburg granted John Sharp Douglas citizenship as number 663 of the Civil Protocol. Two years later, on 23 July 1830, Douglas married the mother of his six children, Johanna Catharina Francisca Becker. Douglas's soap products, such as the Coconut Oil Soda Soap developed in 1830 and the Chinese Heavenly Soap introduced around 1840 quickly turned into success. Thanks to modern manufacturing processes, Douglas benefited from greater production efficiency. Soap became a much more affordable product to a wider range of the public and bathing became a normal thing to do. Douglas died in 1847 and his sons Thomas and Alexander took over the business under the name \\"J.S. Douglas Sons\\". In 1851, they presented their soap products at the first World Fair in London, where the \\"Chinese Heavenly Soap\\" was honored with a medal. In the same year, the brothers developed their \\"Egyptian Toilette Soap\\". In September 1878, Thomas and Alexander Douglas separated as business partners and sold the company to merchants Gustav Adolph Heinrich Runge and Johan Adolph Kolbe. The new owners kept the company's name \\"J.S. Douglas Sons\\" and expanded the assortment to leather goods, travel utensils and fashion items, which they called \\"Fantasy Products\\". In 1888, Gustav Adolph Kolbe took over the position of his deceased father, Johann Adolph, and two years later became the sole owner of the company. By proxy in 1909, he handed responsibility of the soap factory to his wife Berta. = The first Douglas Perfumeries = Berta Kolbe was the first woman to take over the management of J.S Douglas Sons. She received a business offer from Anna and Maria Carstens: the sisters wanted to open their own perfumery under the established name of \\"Douglas\\" to \\"establish and operate a business in soaps, perfumery products, and toiletries in Hamburg.\\" And so, on 24 May 1910, the first \\"Parfümerie Douglas\\" opened on Hamburg's shopping street Neuer Wall, and even exists today. In 1929, the Carsten sisters passed the business on to their goddaughters Hertha and Lucie and their father, German artist Johannes Harders. As of 1931, the company was called \\"Parfümerie Douglas Harders & Co.\\" and thus, reflected the new ownership structure. In 1936, the family hired Erhard Hunger to run the business. He reduced the soap business and expanded the assortment to premium brand products like Elizabeth Arden. By 1969, Erhard Hunger had expanded Douglas to six stores in Hamburg. = From perfumery to corporation = In 1969, the six Douglas perfumeries were taken over by the then listed Hussel AG. Under the management of Hussel's chief executive at the time, John Kreke, Hussel AG fueled the expansion of the perfumery through more takeovers and store openings. These were initially consolidated under the name Hanhausen- Douglas GmbH. In the course of this development, Hussel AG was restructured into a holding group with two operating companies: one for confectionery and one for perfumeries. In 1973, Hanhausen-Douglas took over the Austrian chain Ruttner. As of 1976, all perfumery stores eventually operated under the name \\"Parfümerie Douglas\\" and the associated company under the name \\"Parfümerie Douglas GmbH\\". = Growth in Europe = During the 1980s, the Parfümerie Douglas GmbH expanded to the Netherlands, France, Italy and the United States. And, Douglas continued to expand in Germany, for example through the acquisition of \\"Er & Sie\\" perfumeries. Based on this development in the perfumery business, an organizational restructuring took place that ended in 1989 with the founding of the Douglas Holding AG to replace the Hussel Holding AG. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Douglas opened stores in eastern Germany in the 90's and expanded into Switzerland, Spain and Portugal. Since the start of the new millennium, Douglas has expanded to Poland, Hungary, Monaco, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Denmark and Croatia. Next to stationary retail, Douglas has also been selling its products via its own online shop since 2000. At the annual general meeting in June 2001, Dr. Jörn Kreke handed over the chairmanship of the Douglas Holding to his son Dr. Henning Kreke after 32 years in the top position. Due in part to the economic crisis and a low market share, the company withdrew from Slovakia, Estonia and Denmark in 2009/10 as well as from the American market. = Takeover by financial investor = In 2012, the Kreke family, together with the private equity investor Advent International, made a public takeover offer to the remaining shareholders of the listed parent company of the Douglas Group, Douglas Holding AG, which at that time also included the companies Thalia, Christ, AppelrathCüpper and Hussel. After the successful takeover in 2013, Douglas de-listed from the Frankfurt stock exchange. This marked the beginning of the conglomerate's reorientation, which went back to being purely a perfumery chain in 2014. After that, Douglas continued to grow internationally and acquired the French perfumery chain Nocibé. = Change of ownership and strategic realignment = At first, a renewed stock market launch for the Parfümerie Douglas Deutschland was planned for 2015. However, on 1 June 2015, 85 percent of the company was sold to financial investor CVC Capital Partners with the Kreke family still holding a minority share of 15 percent. Then, manager Isabelle Parize took over as CEO of Douglas in February 2016 and the headquarters was moved in October from Hagen to Düsseldorf. According to Douglas, the company wanted all customer-oriented departments and the online activities from Cologne to be concentrated in one place. In the same year, the company withdrew from Turkey due to a small market share. In July 2017, Douglas completed a transaction to acquire the Spanish perfumery chain Bodybell. In November, the company also completed transactions to acquire the Spanish chain Perfumerías If and the Italian perfumery chains Limoni and La Gardenia. In November 2017, Tina Müller took over as the Group CEO of Douglas.

Plot When haughtily wealthy Eleanor Ramsey (Helene Heigh) is strangled and the murder is pinned on detective Michael Shayne’s ex-con pal Joe Darnell (Parker Garvie), Shayne tries to clear his buddy’s name by investigating the five people with the strongest motives to kill the society matron: her penniless husband Arnold (Pierre Watkin) kept on a tight budget by his penny-pinching wife, her grasping, ungrateful stepchildren Ernest (David Reed) and Dorothy (Julia McMillan), Eleanor’s ex-con brother Buell Renslow (Lyle Talbot) who’s due half of her million as part of his inheritance which she has refused to give him, and her gigolo lover Carl Meldrum (George Meeker) who is romancing both mother and step-daughter. Naturally plodding police detective Pete Rafferty (Ralph Dunn) does everything in his power to thwart Shayne’s investigation and get enough goods on him to strip him of his P.I. license.

Founding Clova was founded in the late sixth century by the pre- Columban missionary known to history as Saint Moluag, who was sent from the Bangor monastery in Ulster to the Picts in Scotland in 562, a year before Iona was established by Columba. Site Archaeological work at the site has revealed a prehistoric settlement with earth houses on the left bank of the Little Mill Burn, a tributary of the burn of Mossat, just east of Little Mill Smiddy, about a half mile south of Clova House (an eighteenth-century building), and a mile southwest of Lumsden. Near the site, the foundations of a small church, called St. Luke’s by the local population, can still be traced, near which is a well called Sammiluak's. Some maintain its name is homophonous with St. Molaug’s, others with St. Luke’s. Four stone crosses excavated in 1875, in the old churchyard are on display at Clova House and “may well be relics of the early Celtic monastery.” They were discovered in an upright position beneath the surface of the earth, where they had sunk over time. Traces of interment were noticeable. William Douglas Simpson tried to convey the atmosphere of the place in 1922, writing: > Standing on this very ancient and sacred site, is it not strange to think of > it as the scene of a busy little Culdee community, where manuscripts were > read and copied, and where schools were established to spread religion and > civilization among the rude inhabitants of Kildrummy and Auchindoir, at a > period when the adjoining earth houses may still have been inhabited, and > when beacons blazed often on the vitrified fort at Tap o' Noth to give > warning of approaching war. Life at Clova Most of the inhabitants of Clova were lay persons doing manual labor. In addition, there were three groups of monks: (a) the seniors, older men past their years of physical labor, (b) the working brethren doing the missionary and educational work of the monastery, and (c) the juniors, novices under instruction. Relays of the brethren would have been sent to conduct Laus perennis (perpetual praise) in the church night and day. The attire of the community would have been a floor-length shirt having an upper garment with hood and sleeves, shoes of hide, and a white surplice suitable for festivals. As with other medieval monasteries, the lifestyle at Clova was austere. The monks, regardless of from which social class they sprang, would have slept on either beds of stone or boards covered with straw, though each monk would probably have had his own cell or hut. Celibacy was strictly enforced. In the surrounding hills were the “diserts,” hermitages where members could go for solitary meditation. On the south side of Tap o’ North is located the stone of Moluag, sometimes called St. Moluag’s Chair. It looks toward Clova and is thought to have been the site of Moluag’s personal retreat. To accomplish the evangelistic mission of the monastery, members went out in couples for several months at a time to preach among the natives. The educational mission included not only literacy, but practical instruction in agriculture. Eventual disposition Though the monastery survived for 600 years, little of its history was recorded, though it is known that Moluag placed it under the authority of his larger establishment at Mortlach in Banffshire. A supposed eleventh-century document purports that the church and lands of Clova were confirmed by Malcolm Canmore to the monastery at Mortlach in 1062; however, this title is now considered a forgery. Clova was merged ultimately into the Anglo-Norman system when Pope Adrian IV assigned Mortlach—along with the churches and monastery at Clova—to the See of Aberdeen in 1157. One hint that the religious work of Clova survived into the thirteenth century is the notation that Gilbert de Stirling, bishop of Aberdeen, recovered Clova from “wicked Highlanders” in 1228. Clova eventually became a parish at which time the chapel replaced the monastery. It is argued that the name St. Luke’s was chosen for the chapel because of its similarity to the name of Clova’s founder, Moluag. That is to say, after removing the first syllable of the saint’s name, mo-, which is an honorific, and the endearing suffix -ag, one is left with the founder’s actual personal name Lua, which is analogous to Luke. Eventually, Clova was united with Kildrummy and denoted as “the parish of Kildrummy and Clova.” The date of this union is uncertain, though in 1363 the bishop ordained one vicar to serve both parishes with the church lands because the meagre revenues of both “are said to have been wasted by frequent wars.”  References  Category:Buildings and structures in Aberdeenshire Category:500s establishments Category:Former Christian monasteries in Scotland ","title":"Clova Monastery"},{"id":"59672548","text":"Ogbah may be, *Ogbah people **Ogbah language *Emmanuel Ogbah ","title":"Ogbah"},{"id":"59672577","text":"Oroko may refer to: *Oroko language *Armel Oroko *Hyacinth Oroko Egbebo ","title":"Oroko"},{"id":"59672580","text":"Ot Danum may be, *Ot Danum people *Ot Danum language Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Ot Danum"},{"id":"59672582","text":"Otoro may be, *Otoro River, Hoduras *Otoro Nuba people **Otoro language ","title":"Otoro"},{"id":"59672601","text":"Pak-Tong may be, *Pak-Tong language *paktong (nickel silver) ","title":"Pak-Tong"},{"id":"59672604","text":"Paku may be, *Paku language (Karen) *Paku language (Indonesia) *Shannon Paku See also *rulers of Paku Alaman *PAKU ","title":"Paku"},{"id":"59672623","text":"Gaddang or Ga'dang may be, *Gaddang people **Gaddang language **Ga'dang language ","title":"Gaddang"},{"id":"59672629","text":"Galeya may be, *Galeya language *Abhin Galeya ","title":"Galeya"},{"id":"59672656","text":"Geruma may be, *Geruma Island, Japan *Geruma language, Nigeria ","title":"Geruma"},{"id":"59672665","text":"Girawa may be, *Girawa (woreda), Ethiopia *Girawa language, New Guinea ","title":"Girawa"},{"id":"59672667","text":"Gitonga may be, *Gitonga language *Charles Gitonga *Charles Gitonga Maina ","title":"Gitonga"},{"id":"59672675","text":"Gobu may be, *Gobu language *Gobu Seyo, Ethiopia *Göbü, Zonguldak ","title":"Gobu"},{"id":"59672693","text":"Guaru may refer to: *Guarú (Rodrigo Neves de Freitas, born 1981), Brazilian footballer *Guarú language, an extinct Arawakan language of Colombia *Rosa Guarú (fl. c. 1780), nurse of Argentine general José de San Martín ","title":"Guaru"},{"id":"59672708","text":"Gulay Fərzəliyeva *Gulay language *Zeki Gülay See also *Gulay-gorod ","title":"Gulay"},{"id":"59672728","text":"Guwa may be, *Guwa language *Sechen Guwa ","title":"Guwa"},{"id":"59672734","text":"Yelantsy () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Olkhonsky District of Irkutsk Oblast, Russia.

As its common name suggests, it is most commonly observed feeding on Pittosporum plants.  Description  Monteithiella humeralis adults are 9mm long with predominantly brown bodies and pale green legs. First instar nymphs are small and black, with circular bodies and white spots on the upper surface of the abdomen. Later nymph stages are similar to the first but with orange spots instead of white.  Life history  Adult females lay blue eggs on the underside of leaves which turn white after 2–3 days, and hatch after 5 days. Nymphs progress through 5 instars or juvenile stages before reaching adulthood. It takes around 41 days after eggs are laid for bugs to mature to adulthood. In New Zealand, adults are most abundant in November and March. while eggs and nymphs can be found from November to April.  Ecology  In both New Zealand and Australia, pittosporum shield bugs are most commonly found feeding on species of Pittosporum, and to a lesser extent Coprosma. In New Zealand, pittosporum shield bugs are widespread but are not considered a pest. They are known to be attacked by Trissolcus basalis, a parasitoid of pentatomid egg masses introduced into New Zealand in 1949 to control Nezara viridula.

First established as Ming'an County in 111 BC by Emperor Wu of Han, the city was relocated and rebuilt at the current site in 295 AD by Emperor Hui of the Western Jin dynasty. As the capital of Jinchang Commandery (later Guazhou Prefecture), the city prospered during the Tang and Western Xia dynasties. It was an important administrative, economic, and cultural center of the Hexi Corridor for over a millennium, with an estimated peak population of 50,000. It was destroyed and abandoned in the 16th century, after the Ming dynasty came under attack by Mansur Khan of Moghulistan. The city ruins comprise the inner city, the outer city, and several yangmacheng (fortified animal enclosures used as fortresses in wartime). Outside the city walls, the broader archaeological park includes the original site of Ming'an County, more than 2,000 tombs, and the remains of an extensive irrigation system with over of canals. The archaeological park also encompasses a number of Buddhist sites, including the Ta'er Temple, the Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves, Jianquanzi Caves (), and Hanxia Caves (). Suoyang City is listed as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China (No. 4-50). In 2014, it was inscribed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites as part of Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor.  Location  Suoyang City is located in the Gobi Desert, southeast of modern Suoyangcheng Town, Guazhou County, in Gansu Province of Northwestern China. It occupies the site of an ancient oasis in the Hexi Corridor, at an altitude of above sea level. During its existence of about 1,700 years, the city was a major political, military, economic and cultural center on the Silk Road, between Dunhuang (Shazhou) to the west and Jiuquan (Suzhou) to the east.  City ruins  The walled city comprises an inner city, an outer city, and several yangmacheng fortresses in between. = Inner city = Inner city wall The inner city is in the shape of an irregular rectangle measuring in area. Its four walls measure (east), (west), (south), and (north). The bases of the rammed earth walls are wide, and the remaining walls are 9 to 12.5 m tall. Two main streets run through the western and northern gates, respectively, with many smaller streets and alleys branching from them. A partition wall divides the inner city into two sections: the larger western city and the smaller eastern city. Many house remains and thick layers of charcoal have been found in the western city, while the eastern city has few remains. It is likely that the eastern city housed the government buildings and residences of high- ranking officials, while the general populace lived in the western city. In the northwest corner of the inner city, an tall adobe watchtower remains standing. = Outer city = Southern section of the outer city wall The outer city is also an irregular rectangle. Its walls measure in the east, in the west, and in the north. The south wall is broken into two parts: a eastern section, and a western one. The bases of the outer city walls are between wide, and the remaining walls are between tall. The northern part of the outer city is divided from the rest by an internal wall north of the inner city. The outer city is believed to be the largest extent of Suoyang at its peak during the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed by floods coming from the mountains in the south, which breached the southern wall and cut it into two sections. Most buildings in the city were destroyed or damaged, the remains of which have been found in the outer city, covered by a thick layer of flood sediments. The outer city and the outer walls were not rebuilt or repaired after the destruction. = Yangmacheng = Between the outer and inner cities are several fortresses known as yangmacheng (literally \\"sheep-and-horse city\\"). A common feature of Tang dynasty cities, they were used as animal enclosures in peace time to keep humans and livestock apart as a disease-prevention measure, and as military fortresses in wartime. There are no signs that the ones at Suoyang were repaired or used after the Tang dynasty.  Outside the walled city  = Ta'er Temple = Main pagoda of the Ta'er Temple east of the city are the remains of the Buddhist Ta'er Temple (literally \\"Pagoda Temple\\"), which is believed to be the King Ashoka Temple recorded in historical documents. It was destroyed in Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou's suppression of Buddhism and rebuilt in the Tang and Western Xia dynasties. It is said to be where the great Tang monk Xuanzang preached for a month before he left for his pilgrimage to India. Most of the extant ruins date from the Western Xia, including the main pagoda and eleven smaller ones. = Tombs and cemeteries = Many tombs and cemeteries lie outside of the city, mainly to the south and southeast. More than 2,100 tombs have been discovered, dating from as early as the Han and mostly from the Tang dynasty. They have not been excavated by archaeologists, with the notable exception of a large Tang tomb, which was excavated in 1992 after it was disturbed by tomb robbers. Many Tang dynasty artifacts were found in the tomb, including sancai figurines and tomb guardians, silk, porcelain, and coins. One of the richest tombs found along the Silk Road, it probably belonged to a governor of Guazhou Prefecture or a wealthy merchant. = Irrigation system = Ruins of an extensive system of irrigation canals remain outside of the city, which diverted water from the Shule River (called Ming River in the Han dynasty and Ku River in the Tang dynasty) for farming. Approximately of channels irrigated an area of of land surrounding Suoyang. It is estimated that there was 300,000 mu of farmland in the Han and Tang dynasties. It is one of the most extensive undisturbed ancient irrigation systems in China and the world. History In 111 BC, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty established Ming'an County () under the Dunhuang Commandery. Its seat was located northeast of Suoyang. During the Western Jin dynasty, Emperor Hui established Jinchang Commandery (), which governed eight counties. Ming'an was elevated to become the capital of the new commandery, and a new city was built at the current site in 295 AD to serve as the commandery and county seat. After the fall of the Western Jin, Jinchang was controlled by a succession of short-lived kingdoms including Former Liang, Former Qin, Later Liang, Southern Liang, Western Liang, and Northern Wei. During the Sui dynasty which reunited China, Ming'an was renamed Changle County (). In 621, in the subsequent Tang dynasty, Jinchang Commandery was renamed Guazhou (Gua Prefecture), whereas Changle (Ming'an) was renamed Jinchang County, still serving as the prefectural seat. The city's population during the Tang dynasty is estimated to be 50,000. As the Tang empire was severely weakened by the An Lushan rebellion, the city fell under the control of the Tibetan empire in 776, until it was recovered by the Tang loyalist general Zhang Yichao in 849. After the collapse of the Tang, the Western Xia occupied Guazhou in 1036. It became a major city of the Xia empire and the headquarters of its western military region. Emperor Li Renxiao, who was once based there, promoted Buddhism and built many cave temples nearby. After the Mongol Empire destroyed Western Xia in 1227, Guazhou Prefecture was not restored until fifty years later during the Yuan dynasty, when it was governed under Shazhou Circuit. Dried suoyang (Cynomorium songaricum) from the local area During the Ming dynasty, the city was called Kuyu (), a name that was first recorded in 1405 in the Ming Shilu. When the king of Hami was threatened by the Mongols, the Chenghua Emperor of Ming moved him and his followers to Kuyu in 1472. In 1494, the Hongzhi Emperor repaired the city's walls that remained from the Tang and Western Xia eras. Two decades later, under attack by Mansur Khan, the Ming retreated east to the Jiayu Pass and Kuyu was occupied by Mansur. However, constant fighting among the Mongols, Moghulistan, and other nomadic tribes severely damaged the city and it was eventually abandoned. The name \\"Suoyang City\\" comes from the Qing dynasty novel Xue Rengui's Campaign to the West, based on the campaigns of the Tang dynasty general Xue Rengui. In the novel and the popular legend it spawned, Xue's troops were besieged in the city by the Göktürks, and survived by eating the suoyang plant (Cynomorium songaricum) that grew wild in the city until reenforcement arrived. The ruined city subsequently became known as Suoyang City.  Conservation  In 1996, the State Council of China designated Suoyang City as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level (No. 4-50). The site was listed in 2010 by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage as a candidate for the national archaeological park status. In 2014, Suoyang City was among the 33 sites inscribed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites as part of Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang'an- Tianshan Corridor.

He co-founded Two Sigma, where he currently serves as co- chairman. Siegel has written for Business Insider, The New York Times, Financial Times and similar publications on topics including machine learning, the future of work, and the impact of algorithms used by search and social media companies.  Early Life and education  Siegel was born in 1961 and spent his early childhood in the Bronx, New York and focused on computer science at a young age. By 12 years old, he had built memory and logic boards and learned to program a supercomputer at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. As a freshman in high school, he taught a programming course to high school students at an NYU summer program. After attending Mamaroneck High School, Siegel graduated from Princeton University with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science and he went on to receive a PhD in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, he conducted research at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and developed thermal and tactile sensors for the Utah-MIT dexterous four-fingered hand, as well as a computational architecture for controlling the system.  Career  After leaving MIT, Siegel worked alongside Jeff Bezos at D.E. Shaw & Co and became the company's first Chief Information Officer. During this time he founded FarSight Financial Services, the first integrated personal financial services website. FarSight performed the first retail stock trade on the Internet and was acquired by Merrill Lynch. He later served as Chief Technology Officer and Managing Director at Tudor Investment Corporation. In 1999, Siegel founded Blink.com, a web-based browser bookmark storage, organization, and sharing service that automatically searched for new sites related to users' existing bookmarks. = Two Sigma = In 2001, Siegel co-founded Two Sigma, a New York City-based company that applies data science and technology to financial services. Siegel has stated that he believes investment managers that take a scientific approach to investing – by using machines, data, and artificial intelligence – have a distinct advantage. Two Sigma now manages $60B assets globally, and has offices in New York, Houston, London, Hong Kong and Shanghai. It employs approximately 1,600 people — two thirds in research and development roles, with science and math backgrounds, including about 250 people with Ph.D.s. Siegel has spoken about encouraging employees to branch out from their daily work at Two Sigma, taking on outside engineering challenges and coding competitions. In May of 2019, a Two Sigma team competed in the inaugural New York City FIRST robotics corporate challenge after setting up a temporary robotics lab in its New York office. Siegel supports employees contributing to the company’s Data Clinic, which uses the pro bono model to connect Two Sigma data scientists on a project basis with the social sector. In a partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund, the Data Clinic data scientists used public data on inspections of oil and gas wells to develop predictive models that could be used to send inspectors to higher risk sites.  Published Views  Siegel writes and speaks frequently about the relationship between technology and society. He has called machine learning the “story of our times,” and despite its limitations, such as a lack of common sense, has described it as “the best way anyone has come up with to algorithmically find knowledge in unstructured data”. Siegel has focused on the importance of separating misconceptions from reality when it comes to artificial intelligence and algorithms. He has cautioned that A.I. and automation could lead to significant losses of certain middle-skill jobs, but could create new types of jobs for appropriately skilled workers. He has argued that algorithms such as those used by search and social media companies could harm society by “contributing to increasingly slanted and divided views about the issues of the day.” He has advocated for these companies to form a self-regulatory organization modeled after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Siegel has suggested that if society is going to trust machines with life or death situations, it must \\"insist on new, tougher standards for their software.\\"  Philanthropy  = Siegel Family Endowment = In 2011, he founded the Siegel Family Endowment, which supports organizations that help prepare society for the impact of technology. The endowment funds organizations including the Center on Rural Innovation - which brings digital job training, computer science education and entrepreneurship centers to rural areas — and Data and Society – a research institute that examines the social issues that can arise from pervasive technology.

Description The annual or short-lived perennial grass has a tufted habit and typically grows to a height of . The culms are erect or geniculately ascending and have two to four nodes. The internodes mid-culm are glabrous and have branched lateral branches. It can have smooth or scaberulous leaf-sheaths with a glabrous or hairy surface. The ligule has a fringe of hairs. The flexuous, filiform leaf-blades can have a smooth or scaberulous surface with a length of and a width of . It blooms between February and June producing brown coloured flowers. Each compound inflorescence has en elliptic shaped panicle with a length of and a width of . Spikelets are pedicelled containing one flower. The spikelets are lanceolate with a length of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1855 as part of the work Description of fifty new Australian plants, chiefly from the colony of Victoria as published in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. Synonyms include Aristida arenaria var. brevistipitata, Aristida arenaria var. hirsuta, Arthratherum arenarium, Aristida arenaria and Aristida contorta var. hirsuta. It is closely related to Aristida holathera with which A. contorta is able to hybrise. Distribution It is present throughout most of mainland Australia where it can grow in red, white or yellow sand, red or brown clay or loamy soils. The grass is adapted to survive in the most arid areas of Australia and is prevalent in most arid and semi-arid localities. It is often associated with Eucalyptus and Acacia aneura woodland communities. Uses The grass, when dominant, is an indicator of poor pasture. It is a normal part of grassland pastures and can be grazed by cattle and sheep along with other more-palatable species, but is mostly considered to be undesirable. The proportion of the plant in grazing areas tends to increase over time as it has low palatability. Although it has low forage value it has some moisture retaining capacity and is able to grow quickly.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is the only remaining example in Michigan of a bridge with both a pony truss span and a main through truss span. History This bridge was originally located where Dixie Highway crosses the Cass River, about two miles west of the present location. This section of Dixie Highway was originally established as a turnpike in the 1830s, and the first bridge over the Cass River was constructed at that time. The first bridge was replaced by a second in 1847. It is likely that other replacement bridges were constructed in subsequent decades, but there is no record of either construction materials or construction dates. In 1904, however, the Bridgeport Township Board proposed to replace the bridge existing at that time with an iron bridge designed by the Joliet Bridge and Iron Company to do so. Township voters approved, and the township contracted Joliet to construct the bridge. Construction began almost immediately, and the bridge was likely in place in late 1904 or early 1905. Dixie Highway was a state trunkline, and with the explosion of automobile traffic at the beginning of the 20th century, the Cass River bridge soon became outmoded. In 1919/20 the State of Michigan replaced it with a larger truss bridge (which was in turn replaced in 1931). The 1904 bridge was moved to its current location at the Beyer Road crossing of the Cass River. It seems likely that there was no previous bridge at this location, and it appears that the section of Beyer Road near the bridge location was constructed at the same time. The bridge acquired the name of Christian Gugel, who was Frankenmuth Township Supervisor and a member of the Saginaw County Board of Supervisors at the time. The new section of Beyer Road ran at least partially through his property. The bridge remained open to traffic until 1976, when it was closed. The deck subsequently deteriorated. However, local resident William \\"Tiny\\" Zehnder Jr. led an effort to rehabilitate the bridge, and in 2004 it was completely renovated and reopened to foot traffic. Description The Gugel Bridge is a two span Pratt truss bridge, with a Pratt through truss span of 144 feet and a Pratt pony truss span of 60 feet, for a total bridge length of 204 feet. The through truss span sits on a concrete abutment on the south side of the river and a concrete pier near the north side of the river. The pony truss extends from the concrete pier to a concrete abutment on the north shore of the river. The bridge is located about fifteen feet above the river surface. The truss structure is 17 feet wide, with a vertical clearance of about 20 feet. The main truss structure contains eight panels separated by the vertical posts made from two parallel channels with crossed-bracing connecting them. The upper chords of the span are made from two channels covered with plating. The understructure supporting the deck is made of large I-beams between the vertical posts with smaller length-wise steel stringers under the deck. Lattice guard rails are on each side of the main through truss, but are not present on the pony truss. A plaque on eah end gives the date of construction: 1904.

It stars Kate Beckinsale as a woman who believes that her husband was killed in a plane crash three years earlier, but then discovers that he is still alive in the Congo. The show was released on Amazon Prime Video on 1 March 2019 before being broadcast on ITV from 8 April 2019.  Premise  The series follows Georgia Wells (Kate Beckinsale) whose husband Will died in a plane crash on a trip to the Congo in Africa. Three years later, she sees a man resembling him on a news story reporting civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and she travels to Kinshasa to uncover the truth. She starts to look for answers, particularly why her husband evidently faked his own death. The eight-episode series features multiple story lines and explores themes such as violence and corruption.  Production  The Widow is a co-production of British ITV and Amazon Video. It was filmed in South Africa, Wales, and Rotterdam. The heat in some of the locations became difficult for Beckinsale, who was hospitalised after passing out while shooting a scene.

Borrero studied in both Rome and Paris before returning to his homeland to serve as a bishop not long after he was ordained as a priest; he served in the national episcopal conference and was in 1923 made the coadjutor for the Bogotá archdiocese. But the national government frowned upon his succession to the archbishopric in 1928 and more so after his involvement in the 1930 presidential election seeing his favored candidate lose. Borrero was known for his energetic approach to fostering social and charitable initiatives and towards the end of his tenure sought to establish new parishes and reorganize their structure. The late prelate became lauded for his holiness in addition to his virtue allowing his successor to initiate the beatification process. This cause culminated decades later in mid-2017 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and titling him as Venerable. Life Ismael Perdomo Borrero was born on 22 February 1872 in the Huila Department to Gabriel Perdomo Cuenca and María Francisca Borrero Silva. He completed his high school education in Neiva before he commenced his ecclesial studies in Bogotá in 1889 though later transferred his studies to Rome in 1895 in the Pontifical Latin American College. Borrero received his ordination to the priesthood on 19 December 1896 from Lucido Maria Parocchi in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran before remaining in Rome to continue with further studies. He obtained his doctorate in sacred theological studies from the Pontifical Gregorian University on 20 July 1897 and did additional studies at Saint Sulpice college in Paris. Borrero returned to Neiva in his homeland in 1899 before becoming the vice-rector for Garzón in the Huila Department thus seeing him monitor the education of seminarians; he was later made chancellor for the Tolima diocese. His rise in the ranks culminated on 8 June 1903 after Pope Leo XIII appointed Borrero to be the first Bishop of Ibagué; he received his episcopal consecration in Rome on 19 June from Girolamo Maria Gotti in the chapel of the Pontifical Latin American College. The principal co-consecrators were Archbishop Giuseppe Maria Costantini and Bishop Esteban Rojas Tobar. He served from 1908 until 1919 as the secretary for the Colombian Episcopal Conference while Pope Pius XI named him on 5 February 1923 to be both the coadjutor for the Bogotá archdiocese in addition to Titular Archbishop of Traianopolis in Rhodope. This former appointment meant that Borrero would become the see's archbishop upon the death or resignation of the current prelate and he was enthroned as coadjutor on 7 October 1923. He succeeded as archbishop on 2 January 1928 while in May 1928 he was made an Assistant to the Pontifical Throne thus being granted the title of \\"monsignor\\". On 12 February 1929 he was enthroned in his see and received the pallium from the apostolic nuncio Paolo Giobbe. He made several pastoral visits throughout his tenure but would delegate others to do those visits on his behalf when his health in the late 1940s began failing. From 1928 until his death he served as the president for the national episcopal conference. The national government was not too pleased with Borrero becoming the archbishop and more so after his involvement in the 1930 presidential election that saw his favored conservative candidate Alfredo Vásquez Cobo lose. In 1934 he asked to have a bishop appointed to his see in order to aid him in his duties thus resulting in the appointment of the coadjutor Juan Manuel González Arbeláez. But Arbeláez was moved in 1942 to another archdiocese thus leaving Borrero on his own to manage the administration of his archdiocese. In his archdiocese he became tireless in promoting both social and charitable initiatives and was known for his humble but energetic approach to archdiocesan affairs and the promotion of the faith. He created more than 50 new parishes and helped reorganize their structure. Pope Pius XII named him on 13 October 1949 to serve as the first Military Vicar of Colombia which was a position he held until his death. The destruction of the episcopal residence on 9 April 1948 forced Borrero to live with seminarians at their residence where he would live until his death. In March 1950 his health - which was precarious for sometime - had taken a decline. He had celebrated his last Mass at Easter and on 27 April received the last rites from the chargé d'affaires Sebastiano Baggio. Borrero died in El Chicó on 3 June 1950 on 9:15am and as per his last will was interred in the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the archdiocesan cathedral. Beatification process The informative process for the beatification cause launched in the late prelate's archdiocese on 31 January 1962 and concluded just a few months later on 12 September; the cause remained inactive until it was reopened on 1 June 1979 thus allowing for a second local investigation to be opened on 10 May 1982. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process later on 27 February 1986 in Rome. Borrero became titled as Venerable on 7 July 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late archbishop had practiced heroic virtue during his life.

Columbia Photographic Society Henry S. Marsteller started the club in his Columbia Avenue apartment in 1889 and it quickly grew from 12 to more than 130 members, so that in less than a decade the Society relocated to four-story building at 1811 North Broad Street. The main interest was in photography which was catered with six darkrooms and a sky-lit studio, but there was a strong social element to activities. Members of the club’s ‘Wheelman’ committee organised regular weekend cycling and photographing excursions to Perkiomen, the Brandywine and Atlantic City and the resulting images were shown in lantern- slide shows accompanied by music. The magazine Camera, originally the Society's gossip sheet, soon became a magazine and achieved national circulation. Its articles catered to the amateur, being largely concerned with technical considerations and avoided the controversies over Pictorialism that occupied more serious publications of the period, though it reproduced work by accomplished Pictorialists, such as Leonard Misonne and Robert S. Redfield. Early editors included, from July 1897–June 1899, John Curtis, Jr. and others; from July 1899 the editor was Frank Virginius Chambers (1861–1940), who published numbers of technical books on photography, joined by John Bartlett from January 1901–January 1904, and others. From Vol. 12, no. 3 (Mar. 1908) the imprint was published by The Camera Publishing Co. In 1923 the magazine merged with The Photographic Journal of America (the latter formerly Wilson's photographic magazine) but retained The Camera in its title. Chambers also edited the Bulletin of photography: the weekly magazine for the professional photographer (Aug. 14, 1907–June 24, 1931, formerly titled the St. Louis and Canadian photographer), which from 1931 also merged with The Camera.Frank V.

An OFC provides flexibility for investors (namely shareholders of the OFC) to trade their interests in the fund through the creation, redemption and cancellation of shares. OFCs could be set up as public or private funds in Hong Kong.  History  The OFC structure was introduced in Hong Kong in July 2018 under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571). Historically, open-ended investment funds in Hong Kong were commonly established in the form of unit trusts but not in corporate forms. This is due to various capital reduction restrictions applicable in Hong Kong which restrict a company from reducing or making distributions out of its share capital unless certain procedures specified in the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) are followed. As corporate fund structures are becoming more popular internationally, in 2014, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) published a consultation paper to consult the public on the proposed introduction of the OFC structure in Hong Kong to expand the city’s legal structure for investment fund vehicles. This proposal was made with a view to further developing Hong Kong as a full-service international asset management centre and a preferred fund domicile. Eventually, the OFC structure was introduced by the Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 and the new OFC regime came into effect on 30 July 2018.  Key Features  Unlike a unit trust which is essentially a trust arrangement, an OFC is a separate legal entity in corporate form. It has a board of directors who, though not required to be licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), owe statutory and fiduciary duties to the OFC. The assets of an OFC will be segregated and entrusted to the custodian for safekeeping. An OFC is also subject to a mandatory requirement to delegate its investment management functions to an investment manager, who must be licensed or registered with the SFC for conducting asset management activities. An OFC may be created as an umbrella fund consisting of a number of separately pooled sub-funds. Operationally, each sub-fund will be distinct, and the assets of each sub-fund will be managed according to the investment management policies and objectives specific to that sub-fund. Sub-funds will be subject to a “protected cell” regime which segregates the assets and liabilities of each sub-fund in order to minimize the risk of insolvency of a sub-fund affecting other sub-funds.  Advantages  OFCs offer three main advantages. First, they allow for the redemption of shares from paid-up capital, thus providing for the first time a Hong Kong domiciled corporate vehicle suitable for open- ended investment funds. Secondly, as corporate vehicles, OFCs offer not only limited liability but statutory segregation of assets and liabilities between sub-funds so that the liabilities of one sub-fund cannot be satisfied from the assets of another sub-fund. Finally, as corporate vehicles, OFCs benefit from a wider range of exemptions from authorization by the SFC and thus, can raise capital more flexibly than unit trusts or limited partnerships.  Key Regulators  Under the OFC regime in Hong Kong, the registration and regulation of OFCs will be overseen by the SFC. Separately, the incorporation and statutory corporate filings of OFCs will fall within the ambit of the Hong Kong Companies Registry.

It is presented by historians and family descendants, with readings from former players, coaches, commentators and journalists. Storyline The tale considers the origin of the game in Australia in 1908, predominately in New South Wales and Queensland. In 1914 the English toured Australia for the second time, culminating in the famous \\"Rourke’s Drift\\" 3rd Test in Sydney in which the visitors won with a reduced number of players. It was the last Test before the war. Many Rugby League representative and club players enlisted, but the league decided to continue. This was a contentious issue as other sports stopped for the duration of the war. It was argued by the Rugby League that it provided normality for the Australians required to run the home front. Anecdotes tell of players who did not return and the gallantry that earned two players the Victoria Cross. It shows the hardships of life on the homefront as the war continued. Two conscription plebiscites failed as the casualties mounted. A huge industrial strike in 1917. The presenter is former player Nathan Hindmarsh whose great grandfather enlisted. The story is told by historians Terry Williams, Greg Shannon, David Middleton, Tom Mather and Max Solling by and family descendants: Paul Watkins (Jack ‘Bluey’ Watkins), Josie Shelley (Herbert ‘Nutsy’ Bolt), Leslie Perry (George Cummins) and Karen Verguizas (Frank Cheadle). Production The documentary was conceived by Rugby League historian Terry Williams, while he worked for the NRL Museum as official historian. He engaged Richard Bradley Productions who had produced other Rugby League documentaries as the production company. NRL funding allowed production to start in late 2014. A 3-minute promotional clip was screened at halftime during the 25 April Anzac round of games celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Anzac landings at Gallipoli in 1915. After a funding hiatus of 18 months the documentary was completed in 2018. Release The documentary had its official screening at 11 am on 11 November 2018 on the National Rugby League website celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the armistice that ended the Great War. The documentary is viewable from the NRL website. Reception The documentary was well received, earning positive reviews in The Sydney Morning Herald Masters, Roy -Sydney Morning Heald-10 November 2018- Page 51- \\"Roy Masters: Documentary debunks the myth that League went AWOL compared to Rugby during war\\" and The Telegraph.Walshaw, Nick-The Telegraph-10 November 2018- Page 102- \\"Why NRL fans should know the story of ‘Nutsy’ Bolt\\" Roy Masters writing in the Herald that the documentary debunked the myth that game was absent during the war.

In fact, a contemporary journalist described the war \\"as the greatest game of all\\". His article also mentioned the many social and political divisions outlined in the documentary. And Nick Walshaw wrote in The Telegraph as to why fans should know the story of Herbert ‘Nutsy’ Bolt who was one of players whose story was told.

It was created and predominantly performed as the fight song at the University of Mississippi. In 2009, the Chancellor Dan Jones requested the university's The Pride of the South marching band stop playing \\"From Dixie with Love\\" at university sports events. According to some alumni and current students, it is now banned from being played in public. This has not been independently confirmed.  History  \\"From Dixie with Love\\" was created as a mashup of \\"Dixie\\" and the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" and started being played in the 1980s. Starting in approximately 2004, students began chanting \\"The South Will Rise Again!\\" at the end of the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" part of the song instead of the line \\"His truth is marching on.\\" The Chancellor of the University of Mississippi Dan Jones then requested in 2009 that The Pride of the South no longer play \\"From Dixie with Love\\" at Ole Miss Rebels football games after fans failed to heed his warnings that he would do so if fans continued to chant \\"The South Will Rise Again\\". This continued a trend of the University of Mississippi ceasing to use symbols of the Confederate States of America, and followed their removal of Colonel Reb as a mascot and a ban on sticks being carried into Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, which effectively prevented the waving of Confederate battle flags at games. The ban was not received well by some students. Prior to an Ole Miss football game, the Ku Klux Klan protested the removal of the song outside the university's chapel; they were outnumbered by counter-protesters and stopped after ten minutes. Jones himself received calls for him to be removed as Chancellor as a result. His contract was not renewed in 2014, leading to speculation that the banning of \\"From Dixie with Love\\" played a part of it. The band was still permitted to play \\"Dixie\\" itself until 2016, when the university banned that from being played as well.

Biography Leopold Buczkowski was born on November 15, 1905 in Nakwasza, located in the former Austrian Empire. He was the son of Tomasz Buczkowski and Anna Zając. From early childhood, he demonstrated some form of artistic talent. This was hindered by the difficult conditions of life in his hometown. From 1914 he lived in Podkamień, where he worked as a stone-cutter and sculptor in the 1930s. Buczkowski studied Polish Literature at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He was also a free listener at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, where he studied painting under the tutorship of Julian Fałat. At the outbreak of World War II, Buczkowski enlisted to defend Poland from Nazi forces in the so-called September Campaign. He became a POW, after which he lived in Lviv. In 1944, he survived the Pidkamin massacre, while his two brothers died. These events forced his family to relocate to Warsaw. He took part in the Warsaw Uprising. After the war, Buczkowski settled in Kraków, where he worked as a book illustrator. From 1950 up until his death he lived in Konstancin, near Warsaw. In 1982 he became a member of the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth. His grave is located at the cemetery in Skolimów. He was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta by the government in 1956. Writing One of his poems was published in 'Gazeta Polska' in 1929 under a pseudonym. He officially debuted in 1936. Buczkowski ran an amateur theatre, for which he wrote Zabójstwo, a play. His first novel, Wertepy, was seized by the police because of its harsh portrayal of life in poverty-stricken Volhynia (now part of Ukraine). Buczkowski wrote his second novel, Black Torrent in 1946. In 1953, he began to paint more frequently and display his works in Warsaw. Works such as Black Torrent (Czarny potok), Dorycki krużganek, Młody poeta w zamku and Pierwsza świetność all reference the terror of the Nazi occupation of Poland and World War II. Buczkowski's prose is characterised as experimental and original for its disregard of the traditional rules of storytelling and dialogue. The author considered Kąpiele w Lucca, a novel published in 1974, as his greatest work and regarded some of his later works as its supplements.

It was released by I Oh You Records in Australia and by Dine Alone Records in Canada on 2 May 2014. It was produced by former-Gerling frontman Burke Reid and recorded at the Grove Studios in Somersby from December 2013 to January 2014. It won at the ARIA Music Awards of 2014 for Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album. Writing and recording Most songs were written by both Shane Parsons and Simon Ridley. Writing began in early 2013 when the duo were together in the remote town of Yass, New South Wales. Once the two were happy with what they had, sometime after leaving Yass, they entered the Grove Studio with producer Burke Reid and over the course of six weeks they produced the album. Critical reception The album met with generally favourable reviews. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album has an average score of 77 based on 6 reviews. In early May 2014, writing for the Australian newspaper, music journalist Andrew McMillen awarded Black Rat 3.5 stars out of a possible 5. McMillen compared their debut album Bloodstreams as juvenile alongside Black Rat, and writes that the more mature sound better suits the duo, as they move beyond their \\"trash party\\" origins. McMillen further praises the album's 11 songs as a \\"significant step forward\\" and concludes: \\"... it's [Black Rat] the sound of a confident band torn between its populist, party-friendly beginnings and a new-found ability to embrace glimpses of beauty amid the sonic destruction.\\" On 18 May, the album peaked at No. 23 on the ARIA Charts for one week.

Demetrius is the only son of Gurgen of Klarjeti, who revolted around 1010 against King Bagrat III of Georgia and crowned himself as the King of Klarjeti, however in 1012, he was executed, while Demetrius survived by escaping to Constantinople where he received a Greek education. Returning to Georgia on the death of Bagrat III, in 1014, he managed to find a place in the high society of the kingdom and became the leader of the pro-Byzantine party of Georgia. Shortly after Bagrat IV's ascension to the throne, Constantine VIII sent in an army to take over the key city-fortress of Artanuji on behalf of the Georgian Bagratid prince Demetrius. Several Georgians nobles defected to the Byzantines, but Bagrat's loyal subjects put up a stubborn fight. The Byzantines overran the Georgian borderlands and besieged Kldekari, a key fortress in Trialeti province, but failed to take it and marched back on the region Shavsheti. The local bishop Saba of Tbeti organized a successful defense of the area forcing the Byzantines to retreat. Finally Bagrat IV manages to defeat Demetrius and imprisons him. The Georgian Chronicle states that he died during his captivity.

Early life  Fanny Potter was born on 17 September 1837, at Kibworth. She recorded as a \\"scholar at home\\" aged 13 at 10 Leicester Road, Kibworth Beauchamp, Leicestershire in the 1851 census. Her parents William (born in Marylebone in c.1804) and Elizabeth (born in Kibworth in c.1805) had two other children, sons James (born c.1836) and Cyrus (born c.1846), and were able to afford a live-in servant.  Education and career  Fanny registered as a Chemist & Druggist on 5 February 1869, having taken the Pharmaceutical Society's Modified exam, established by the Pharmacy Act to allow assistants who had been \\"actually engaged and employed in the dispensing and compounding of Prescriptions\\" for at least three years to be placed on its Register. Her father also joined the register for the first time as a result of the Pharmacy Act, qualifying as a Chemist & Druggist under the clause that allowed those in business before 1 August 1868 to register without taking an exam. She joined 215 female pharmacists who were included in the first compulsory Register in 1869 (1.9% of the total number of 11,638). Many had taken over businesses from their fathers or husbands, some were running a pharmacy independently. Unlike other professions including medicine, women were not excluded from taking the Pharmaceutical Society's exams alongside their male counterparts, even though the male hierarchy of the PSGB and the profession had not considered them in their drawing up of the PSGB educational scheme. However, women were not permitted to become PSGB members. They could work as pharmacists, but were not allowed to play a role in the profession's organisation or regulation. Fanny worked as her father's assistant after registration, as she had done so before it. In the 1871 census, she is listed as \\"chemist\\" still living with her parents on Leicester Road.  Personal life  Fanny married Abraham Deacon (1828-1911), a widower, in the Independent Chapel in neighbouring Kibworth Harcourt on 23 September 1875 when he was aged 46 and she was 37. He already had three daughters, Sarah, Mary and Harriet from his first marriage. The couple had a son, Augustine Henry, in around 1877. The family lived in Fleckney where Deacon is first recorded as a draper, but later as a post master. By 1881, he had founded a Strict & Particular Baptist Church at Carmel Chapel on Wolsey Lane in the village, and worked as its Minister. Local records suggest that he taught himself to read and write, and was an author and poet as well as a pastor. He opened his post office also on Wolsey Lane in Fleckney, probably in the 1880s, and Fanny worked in the same building as a Chemist & Druggist. Fanny's parents had moved to Fleckney in 1876, and some time after William's death in 1882, their step-granddaughter Harriet moved in as a companion to Fanny's widowed mother Elizabeth aged 87. Abraham died on 16 February 1911, but Fanny is still listed as a Chemist & Druggist in the census of that year, in spite of her age of 73, with Harriet her step-daughter living with her. In fact, she stayed on the Pharmaceutical Society's Register until her death on 15 January 1930, in Fleckney, aged 92. The cause of death was reported as \\"Shock caused by the deceased accidentally falling downstairs on 23rd December 1929.\\"  References  =Sources= * Census: 1851, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1911 * Pharmaceutical Society Registers 1869-1930 * Marriage certificate 23 September 1875 * Death certificate 15 January 1930 =Footnotes=  Further reading  * Rayner-Canham, Marlene; Rayner-Canham, Geoffrey (2008).

Gladys Sandes became the first female surgeon at the hospital in 1925. Gladys Maud Sandes Alston (5 November 1897 – 17 January 1968) was an Irish surgeon and venereologist and the first woman surgeon at the London Lock Hospital in 1925. Inspired by Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, she became an active member of the medical community and published widely on venereal diseases like syphilis and the treatment of children after sexual assault.  Life  Sandes was born in Dublin on 5 November 1897. Her family later relocated to London, where attended Wimbledon High School. She later married James Maxwell Alston FRCP (b.1900) and had a daughter.  Studies  She completed her medical studies at the London School of Medicine for Women (LSMW) in 1922, in that same year becoming a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons. The LSMW had been since its foundation in 1874 the main institution for the education of women doctors and surgeons in England. She later returned to the LSMW to lecture in anatomy. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1930.  Work  After qualifying at the LSMW in 1922, she held residencies at the London Lock Hospital and the Mildmay Mission Hospital. She later became surgical registrar at the South London Hospital for Women. In 1925, she became the first woman surgical registrar at the London Lock Hospital. As her career progressed, she was elected to consultant posts at Queen Mary's Hospital in Carshalton, the Mother's Hospital in London, and the London Lock Hospital. According to her obituary, she 'greatly prized' her position at the Lock Hospital - although the institution was closed after changes brought in by the foundation of the National Health Service. She also kept up a private practice at 41 Devonshire Square, London, W1. Sandes was very active in medical organisations and societies, including the Royal Society of Medicine and the British Medical Association. From 1955 to 1957 she was chairman of the Marylebone Branch of the BMA. She also served as chairman of the editorial board of the publication Mother and child.  Research and specialty  Sandes worked in venereology, urology and gynecology. In 1929, she published a textbook on the nervous system based on her work as Demonstrator of Anatomy at the London School of Medicine for Women. She was profoundly affected by her early professional experiences at the London Lock Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital. She dedicated her life to the treatment of venereal diseases, particularly in women and children. She had hoped to found a postgraduate institute for venereology at the London Lock Hospital, although this plan was disrupted by its closure. Prevailing belief at the time was the all venereal disease would be eradicated by antibiotics, and the hospital was provisioned by the new NHS for other purposes. With the closure, Sandes relocated her work to the Salvation Army Mother's Hospital, where she continued until her retirement in 1962. She also made great contributions to the medical treatment of children who had suffered sexual assault. Many women doctors of the early twentieth century focused on venereal diseases - an area of work which was less competitive than some other male dominated specialties. It was also believed that women doctors and surgeons were particularly well placed to treat female patients with often stigmatised sexually-transmitted diseases.  Personal interests  Sandes is remembered as an enthusiastic traveller - visiting the United States, Russia, South African and many European countries.  Legacy  In 2018, Sandes and her work at the London Lock Hospital was featured in the exhibition 'This vexed question': 500 years of women in medicine at the Royal College of Physicians.

Dawson carried out her research at both the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (undertaking much of her research at Surgeons' Hall) and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.  Early life and education Edith Dawson was born in India to a military family. Prior to studying medicine she held a teaching appointment in a missionary school in Rangoon (now Yangon). She travelled to Edinburgh via the Trans-Siberian Railway to study medicine; she graduated in 1921.  Career and research Dawson dedicated her career to studying pathology, initially as a cancer research fellow from 1931 at Edinburgh University. Her thesis on “Sarcoma of the Breast” 1970 was noted to be of ‘outstanding significance.’ Dawson later lectured at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh while also carrying out research at the laboratory. Throughout her career, she focused on the study of breast pathology, with special interest in fibrosis and adenosis. In 1941, she was appointed as temporary part-time Assistant Histologist to the Laboratory at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. From 1960, she moved to work at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In addition to performing the diagnostic histology she undertook a research work on the material in the Museum and donated to the College a large quantity of histological material and specimens, including whole sections of breast and other organs, some specially mounted for demonstration purposes. Several of these are still on display in the museum and a reference library which is publicly available.  Personal life  She was married to pathologist James Walker Dawson, who was renowned for his work on multiple sclerosis, and who was pathologist to the RCP Laboratory. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Archive holds the Dawson Archive, which represents all aspects of her career. Collection items include substantial papers concerning the full research process, including correspondence; clinical notebooks and research notes, including notebooks with remarks on scientific papers regarding many forms of cancer, and clinical notes on cancer therapy; thesis notes; pathological drawings and photographs (including clinical and pathological images); glass slides of breast carcinoma samples; and patient case notes. In addition, Surgeons’ Hall Museums holds Dawson's histology collection of thousands of slides of a variety of systems.

Bangladeshi culture is predominantly conservative and patriarchal. Several issues in Bangladesh, including Sex education, romance, homosexuality, and sexual behavior are taboo topics. Marriage system Bangladesh follows the traditional culture of arranged marriage where a marriage can only be done when a man is not unemployed and reproduction is the main base of the Bangladeshi family-system. As Bangladesh is based on social conservatism, there is a strong social and cultural prohibition on Love marriage; it is viewed negatively by a large portion of the people, though love marriages can be seen in a very little extent, employment is resembling pertinence and a rugged proviso here also for the male person for engaging in romantic relationship with a female as always a male has to income and a female has to do the cultural role of housewife in a family, although in the 21st century women are having jobs in various sectors but there is no exemption for men to get married with them if they (men) are jobless and earning women also get themselves involved in household activities for patriarchal society-system. Any discussion around sex and sexuality is taboo. Bangladesh is a family- oriented, moderate Muslim country with strong economic class structure. Romance has been mostly negative, with people calling romance a sin, a social crime, or just perverted behavior. However, there is a pocket of tolerance and acceptance depending on the social class. Religion Most of the Bangladeshi people are adherents of Islam. For this reason Islamic sexual jurisprudence is practiced largely in the country which supports sexual acts between spouses only and focuses mainly on procreation. Sex education Bangladesh has a sex education system in schools that it teaches it in a conservative way. Inter- gender friendship is disallowed in society. Pornography Watching, possession or production of any kind of pornography is illegal in Bangladesh, a law against it was passed by the parliament in 2012; 244 pornographic sites and sites linked to adult contents were blocked as per the rule. Homosexuality Homosexual sexual behavior is outlawed in Bangladesh, as Section 377 of the Penal Code forbids anal or oral sex, regardless of the gender and sexual orientation of the participants. Thus, even consensual heterosexual acts such as fellatio and anal penetration may be punishable under this law. In 2009 and 2013, the Bangladeshi Parliament refused to overturn Section 377.Pawar, Yogesh.

Celentano performs Jailhouse rock and is called \\"the Italian Elvis\\". * 21 May – The inauguration, by 1962, of a second RAI TV channel, is decided; the year sees also the opening of several new RAI regional offices. * 9 June – The broadcast of a pseudo-Greek tragedy (The Medea’s sons, by Vladimiro Cajoli), with Alida Valli, is suddenly interrupted because the actress’ son has been abducted by Enrico Maria Salerno; the kidnapper is captured in the bar of the RAI, after a raving monologue live. The whole thing is clearly a joke but, as for Orson Welles’ The war of the worlds twenty years before, many viewers take it seriously and the fake phone number given by the actor playing a police officer is tempested by the calls. The episode causes an harsh debate about the new media's dangers. * 28 June - At the show Un, due, tre the comedian Ugo Tognazzi simulates a fall from the chair. At the remarks of his partner Raimondo Vianello, he answers: \\"Everybody can fall\\", alluding to a similar accident, shot by the cameras, recently occurred to Italian President Giovanni Gronchi. The harmless gag, improvised live, arouses the ire of the RAI executives: Renzo Puntoni, producer of \\"Un, due, tre\\", is fired, while Tognazzi and Vianello are forced to prerecord their performances. At the end of the season, the show is deleted, notwithstanding its popularity, and, for some years, the two actors are turned away from public television. * 26 August - The literary critic Leone Piccioni, son of the Minister Attilio, becomes director of the television news. He takes the place of Massimo Rendina, judged too leftist by the government. *7 September - During the show Serata di gala (Gala soirée) Renato Carosone, the most popular Italian band-leader announces, unexpectedly, his retirement from the scenes; he will explain later to have wanted to go out on a high, foreboding a change in the public’s tastes for the arrival of rock and roll. * 3 December - Institution of Rai Corporation, Italian Radio TV System, a society, based in New York, for the production and sale of Italian programs in the United States.

The movies are naive and homemade for the today's standards, but, at the time, get a massive success. The Sheridan character, with his characteristic white trench, will be later reprised in several TV- movie, miniseries and spots. * Alfred Hitchcock presents = Variety = * Campanile sera (Bell tower at the evening) – 3 seasons, hosted by Mike Bongiorno and Enzo Tortora.

The director is able to serve the charm and the adventurous spirit of the novel, in spite of the poor means (the show is integrally shot in studio); memorable the acting of Garrani as Long John Silver. * Il romanzo di un maestro (from De Amicis’ The novel of a schoolmaster) – by Mario Landi, with Armando Francioli. * Ottocento (Nineteenth century, from the Salvator Gotta’s novel and the Costantino Nigra’s memories) – by Anton Giulio Majano, with Sergio Fantoni (Costantino Nigra), Lea Padovani (Eugenie de Montijo) and Virna Lisi (Countess of Castiglione).

Nino Manfredi gets a huge success playing the barman of Ceccano, a caricature of the rough Ciociaria people, and his catchphrase \\"Fusse che fusse la volta bona\\" (Maybe it's the right time) becomes proverbial; but the true star is Delia Scala, who proves to be a complete show-girl. The contest is won by Joe Sentieri with Piove (the song had already triumphed at the Sanremo festival), while Mina is known by the general public singing Nessuno. * Il mattatore (The spotlight chaser) – \\"mixed show\\" directed by Daniele D’Anza, script by Federico Zardi. It's virtually a Vittorio Gassman’s one-man show (also if, technically, sometimes he shares the scene with other actors). The star of the Italian stage and cinema exhibits the whole extensions of his talent, passing from the classic theatre to the cabaret, often parodying himself and trying also the political satire (a taboo argument, till then, for the Italian television). The show, following its public and critical success, the next year is adapted into a movie. *Le divine (The divine women) – by Mario Ferrero, with Franca Valeri, Vittorio Caprioli and Monica Vitti, in six episodes; a parody of the history of the show business, from the belle èpoque to the television age, through the history of six imaginaries female stars, played by Franca Valeri. = News and documentaries = * L’India vista da Rossellini (India seen by Rossellini).

The reporter travels all over Italy to interview women working in every field of the economy (agriculture, industry, tertiary). The enquiry has a great impact on public opinion and is now again a precious source of information about the female condition of the time; in 1993 another edition, with new interviews to the same women, had been realized by Raffaella Spaccarelli. * Incontri di Indro Montanelli (Indro Montanelli’s encounters). The famous journalist meets important figures of the Italian culture, as Moravia, Guttuso, Carlo Levi, Guareschi and De Laurentis; the interviews often become, willingly, almost humorous sketches.

At 06:00 UTC on 26 November, TCWC Jakarta recorded that the system was located southwest of the city of Cilacap as a tropical depression with a maximum wind speed of 45 km/h (30 mph). Wave heights of across the central and east southern coast of Java were predicted and a warning was issued. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center the next morning on 27 November, stating that satellite imagery depicted flaring convection near the center of the system. Several hours later, TCWC Jakarta upgraded the system to a tropical cyclone, giving the name Cempaka which was then located south-southeast of Cilacap. BMKG warned of heavy rainfall across the island of Java with possible flooding and landslides. On 29 November, Cempaka weakened into a tropical low and turned to the southwest away from Java. It continued moving to the southwest on the following day. TCWC Perth and Jakarta last mentioned Cempaka on 1 December. Impact Hourly precipitation of parts of Java during Cyclone Cempaka. Cyclone Cempaka never made landfall but the rainfall it brought caused severe flooding and landslides across 28 regencies and cities in Java, mainly along the southern part of the island. Tornadoes were also reported in the area. Pacitan received of rain on 27 November while Yogyakarta received on 28 November, both considered to be \\"extreme\\" amounts of daily rainfall by BMKG. On 29 November, the government of Yogyakarta declared an emergency. By 30 November, 26 deaths were reported and more than 14,000 people were evacuated in Central Java, East Java, and Yogyakarta according to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB). Tens of thousands of houses and agricultural lands were flooded. Roads were covered by landslides and bridges were destroyed in border regencies of Central Java and East Java, isolating some remote villages. Indonesians and several politicians took into social media to express their condolences using the hashtag #PrayForPacitan. President Joko Widodo called the people to \\"remain vigilant\\" while relief efforts were being undertaken by the national and local government agencies. The cyclone also changed the direction of ash from Agung Volcano in Bali from eastward toward Lombok to westward across Banyuwangi and Jember. By early December, BNPB counted that at least 41 people were reported dead in Pacitan, Yogyakarta, Wonogiri, Purworejo, and Wonosobo. More than 28,000 were staying in shelters while the cost of the damages was estimated at Rp1.13 trillion (US$83.6 million). Rarity The region of Indonesia is not generally traversed by tropical cyclones although a lot of systems have historically formed there. Cyclone Cempaka was among the few tropical cyclones in the southern hemisphere which ever struck the region. An analysis of tropical cyclone data from the Bureau of Meteorology since 1907 to 2017 found that only around 0.62% of all cyclones in the Australian region during those years occurred north of the 10th parallel south.

Retrieved January 15th, 2019. In his research, Leuven has been a frequent collaborator of Hessel Oosterbeek, with whom he worked at the University of Amsterdam. A key topic in Leuven's research is workplace training. Comparing the demand and supply of training in Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the US, Leuven and Ooosterbeek find that the employer is typically the provider of training and often willing to pay for general training, that international differences in training largely reflect differences in the weights of certain worker and job characteristics, and that the demand for training tends to increase in workers' education and training.Leuven, E.; Oosterbeek, H. (2000). The demand and supply of work- related training: Evidence from four countries. Research in Labor Economics. Emerald Group Publishing Limited. 18: 303–330. Analysing the impact of legislation enabling Dutch firms to claim a larger share of their expenditures on employees' training if they are aged 40 or older, they find that the training rate of workers just above the age of 40 is 15–20% higher than that of workers just below 40, with the effect mainly reflecting the postponement of earlier training needs and having no significant effect on workers' wages.Leuven, E.; Oosterbeek, H. (2004). Evaluating the effect of tax deductions on training. Journal of Labor Economics. University of Chicago. 22 (2): 461–488. However, using an estimation method in which they narrow down the comparison group to workers who wanted private-sector training but were unable to participate because of random events, Oosterbeek and Leuven observe only much smaller, statistically insignificant returns to training.Leuven, E.; Oosterbeek, H. (2008). An alternative approach to estimate the wage returns to private-sector training. Journal of Applied Econometrics. 23 (4): 423–434. Important surveys by Leuven in this field review the literatures on workplace training in EuropeBassanini, A. et al. (2005). Workplace training in Europe. IZA Discussion Papers, No. 1640. and the economics of private sector training, the latter with a focus on strategic interaction between employers and employees and market imperfections.Leuven, E. (2005). The economics of private sector training: a survey of the literature. Journal of Economic Surveys, 19(1), pp. 91-111. Another field of research for Leuven have been the determinants of student achievement. Together with Mikael Lindahl, Hessel Oosterbeek and Dinand Webbink, he finds that extra funding for personnel or computers and software targeted at primary schools with large populations of disadvantaged students significantly decrease student achievement, with extra funding for IT being particularly detrimental for girls.Leuven, E.; Lindahl, Mikael; Oosterbeek, Hessel; Webbink, Dinand (2007). The effect of extra funding for disadvantaged pupils on achievement. Review of Economics and Statistics. MIT Press. 89 (4): 721–736. In another study, Leuven, Oosterbeek and Bas van der Klaauw investigate the effect of financial rewards on student achievement, finding that the offer of financial rewards for Dutch university freshmen who pass all required first-year subjects increases only the achievement of high-ability students while decreasing that of low-ability students, with the effects worsening over time, possibly due to the erosion of intrinsic motivation by the extrinsic reward.Leuven, E.; Oosterbeek, H.; Van der Klaauw, B. (2010). The effect of financial rewards on students' achievement: Evidence from a randomized experiment. Journal of the European Economic Association. European Economic Association. 8 (6): 1243–1265. Finally, Leuven has also conducted on wage differentials and overeducation. With regard to wage differentials, in addition to Leuven & Oosterbeek (2008), he observes in work with Oosterbeek and Hans van Ophem, that about one third of the variation in wage differentials between skill groups in developed economies are explained by differences in the net supply of skill groups, with relative demand and supply being a particularly strong determinant of relative wages of low-skilled workersLeuven, E.; Oosterbeek, H.; Van Ophem, H. (2004). \\"Explaining international differences in male skill wage differentials by differences in demand and supply of skill\\". Economic Journal. 114 (495): 466–486. In another study (with Lars Kirkeboen and Magne Mogstad), Leuven examines the wage differentials of different types of postsecondary education, including the field and institution of study, in Norway, and finds that different fields of study have substantially different labour market payoffs, even when institutions and peer quality are controlled for, that attending a more selective institution within a given field doesn't improve earnings by much, and that individuals' selection of fields suggest that they choose fields in which they have comparative advantages.Kirkeboen, L.J., Leuven, E., Mogstad, M. (2016). Field of study, earnings, and self-selection. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131(3), pp. 1057-1111. With regard to overeducation, Leuven's research is reviewed in his and Oosterbeek's synthesis of those economic literatures in the Handbook of the Economics of Education.Leuven, E.; Oosterbeek, H. (2011). Overeducation and mismatch in the labor market. In: Hanushek, E.A.; Machin, S.; Wößmann, L. (eds.). Handbook of the Economics of Education. Amsterdam: Elsevier.

It became a registered charity (No. 500434) for public education in the history of the two counties in 1970.  History  The society was founded in 1878, when one of the region's foremost historians, John Parsons Earwaker, suggested to his colleagues in the Chetham Society that they should form another organisation to foster their common interest in local history. Earwaker served as the society's founding Secretary (until his death in 1895) although, towards the end of his life, his other commitments led to delays in the society's planned publications. The bibliophile James Crossley, President of the Chetham Society, was the founding President, and another prominent early member (and later Vice-President) was William Ecroyd Farrer.  Publications  Publication started with Lancashire and Cheshire Church Surveys 1649–1655, edited by Henry Fishwick (1879). Earwaker soon gained permission to publish lists of wills that had been proved in Chester, which was \\"hailed as a coup\\"; G. E. Cokayne, Lancaster Herald, wrote to congratulate Earwaker, stating that \\"I do not think there is any work that has been at any time, or that could be now, more useful.\\" The index ran to seven volumes (covering 1545–1760); according to Earwaker's obituary, \\"their value to students of local history is incalculable\\". Other important documents that have been published by the society include part of De laude Cestrie, edited by Margerie Venables Taylor, one of the earliest examples of prose writing concerning an English urban centre. Many of the early volumes have been digitised by the Internet Archive. The society has published more than 150 volumes (2019), an up-to-date list of which is maintained by the Royal Historical Society. The most recent volumes are The Diaries of William Lloyd Holden, 1829 and 1830, edited by Jonathan Pepler (2019) and The Cheshire Motor Vehicle Registrations, edited by Craig Horner (2019). When the society published a volume of early Cheshire charters (1958) in honour of its long- serving President, William Fergusson Irvine, a local newspaper described the book as \\"beautifully printed and illustrated...well worthy of the distinguished scholar in whose honour it had been produced\\". Recent reviews of the society's volumes have described them as \\"invaluable for anyone interested in the history of this area\\", and pointed out that they are \\"well edited\\" and the documents \\"thoroughly explained\\". One review (2013) observed that by bringing to public attention documents that are an \\"under used resource\\", the society's publications could allow \\"insights into parish and community life rarely available in other sources\\".

Food safety in the United States relates to the processing, packaging, and storage of food in a way that prevents food-borne illness within the United States. The beginning of regulation on food safety in the United States started in the early 1900s, when several outbreaks sparked the need for litigation managing food in the food industry. Over the next few decades, the United States created several government agencies in an effort to better understand contaminants in food and to regulate these impurities. Many laws regarding food safety in the United States have been created and amended since the beginning of the 1900s. The United States has recently taken food safety into consideration again after several deadly outbreaks occurred in the early 2000s. Incidents such as the E.coli contaminated spinach in 2006 bring attention to the regulation surrounding the food industry and food quality control. Many outbreaks have occurred because of loose enforcement of regulation and lack of quality testing of every batch of food that is being produced. Most legislation regarding food safety is in the wake of a deadly outbreak of a food-borne illness. The bacteria and viruses that cause most of the food-borne illnesses are Salmonella, E.coli, Listeria, Norovirus, Campylobacter, and Clostridium perfringens. These can lead to some deadly diseases that have killed many people in the United States.  Overview  Food safety in the United States is necessary in order to prevent and properly report food-borne illnesses. In 2011, a total of 9.4 million incidents of food-borne illness occurred in the United States. Widespread food-borne outbreaks typically spark legislation rather than legislation working as a preventative measure against food-borne illnesses. Informing consumers of the proper ingredients in food helps avoid widespread food-borne illness. Prior to 1906, there were no laws related to food and intentional additives and unintentional contaminants added to food. The Jungle, a novel published by Upton Sinclair in 1905, described the horrible working conditions in the meat- packing industry. His detailed account of the low quality of meat caused outrage among the public. In 1906, two acts were signed into law following the aftermath of the accounts of lack of food quality: the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The Pure Food and Drug Act forced food manufacturers to only sell unadulterated foods and to correctly label foods. The Meat Inspection Act lead to the creation of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which manages the production of meat, poultry, and eggs, enforcing regulated limits of certain contaminants and enforcing quality of product. These laws have become a foundation for food safety in the United States and have set a precedent in regulating food. Since these two acts were signed, amendments and changes have taken place, but upon the framework set by the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. These acts allowed U.S. court case called U.S. vs. 95 Barrels Alleged Apple Cider Vinegar to rule that the apple cider vinegar in question was misbranded as it was made from dried apples instead of fresh apples. Recent legislation regarding food safety includes the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed in 2011 by Barack Obama. This recent legislation forces the FDA to write more regulations regarding produce safety with respect to the growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of produce as well as regulations with increased preventative control measures in facilities that process food.  Government agencies  The United States has three federal and two state governmental organizations that are in control of food safety within the United States: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the State Department of Public Health, and the State Department of Agriculture. These organizations focus on the production and distribution of food, making sure all food distributed to retail stores, restaurants, and consumers is safe, without contamination from food-borne illness. While there are many other smaller organizations that participate in the distribution of safe food, these organizations are the most active in regulating food and preventing food-borne illness in the United States. = Food and Drug Administration = The FDA helps regulate contaminants in all types of food. In 1862, the government division called the Bureau of Chemistry was created. The Bureau of Chemistry separated into two divisions in 1927, one of which was called the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a new organization, the FDA had little legal control when enforcing the few regulatory food safety laws. However, an incident in the late 1930s improved the FDA's control over food and drugs. In the 1930s, a new antibacterial drug called sulfanilamide was synthesized and was widely accepted. One chemist at S.E. Massengill Co. in Bistol, Tennessee wanted to come up with a way to liquify the insoluble drug so children and adults could take the drug in liquid form. Diethylene glycol (DEG) was used to dissolve the drug, even though DEG is deadly to humans. Without any toxicologic testing, 1300 bottles of this \\"Elixir Sulfanilamide\\" were distributed to consumers and physicians. As soon as people starting dying after taking the elixir, the drug was recalled. The FDA investigated the company and found no clinical trials and no evidence of further testing involve the elixir. At this time the FDA had no authority to penalize the company in question. Charges against the owner were filled, and six months later, a law called the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was signed. This law forced all new food, drugs, and cosmetics to be certified by the FDA before being put on the market. This act granted the FDA with enforcing and legal power that has helped regulate food and drugs ever since. As of 2018, the FDA regulates more than $2.5 trillion in consumer food, medical products, and tobacco in the United States. The head of the FDA has the position of Commissioner of the FDA. The FDA is currently in the government branch of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. = Food Safety and Inspection Service = The 25 percent of food that the FDA does not regulate is monitored instead by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and includes all egg, meat, and poultry products processed and distributed in the United States. FSIS was founded upon the creation of the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906, the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957, and the Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970, along with several amendments to these acts that have been passed. FSIS enforces safe, wholesome, correctly-labeled egg, poultry, and meat products in every state in the United States including Puerto Rico. Currently, FSIS is an agency in the United States Department of Agriculture. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) helps target public health issues including food-borne illnesses caused by contaminated food. = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention = In 1948, the Malaria Control in War Areas, a program run by the U.S. Public Health Service, was turned into the Communicable Disease Center (CDC). On July 1, the CDC was established in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the CDC's initial goals was to eradicate malaria from the United States entirely, which it successfully accomplished in 1951. When polio starting spreading in the 1950s, the CDC started to develop surveillance methods to keep track and record incidents of polio to help fight the spread of the paralytic and deadly virus. By the 1970s, less than 10 people had contracted polio in the United States. In the 1970s, when the CDC's name changed to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the organization continued to advocate for other diseases and urgent public health issues. In 2016, when the Zika virus spread to the United States, the CDC immediately mobilized their Emergency Operations Center and took appropriate action. The main goal of the CDC is to keep track of health, safety, and security threats to the American people.  Legislation  Before 1906, there were no laws concerning food safety and regulating how food is produced, manufactured, and distributed. Laws are typically written in the wake of severe outbreaks, rather than as a preventative measure. The current food safety laws are enforced by the FDA and FSIS. The FDA regulates all food manufactured in the United States, with the exception of the meat, poultry, and egg products that are regulated by FSIS. The following is a list of all food safety acts, amendments, and laws put into place in the United States. = 1900-1950 = 1906: Pure Food and Drugs Act 1906: Federal Meat Inspection Act 1913: Gould Amendment 1930: McNary-Mapes Amendment 1938: Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 1948: Miller Amendment = 1951-2000 = 1953: Factory Inspection Amendment 1954: Miller Pesticide Amendment 1957: Poultry Products Inspection Act 1958: Food Additives Amendment 1960: Color Additive Amendment 1962: Talmidge/Aujeb Act 1966: Fair Packaging and Labeling Act 1967: Wholesome Meat Act 1968: Wholesome Poultry Products Act 1968: Animal Drug Amendments 1970: Egg Products Inspection Act 1976: Vitamins and Minerals Amendment 1980: Instant Formula Act 1990: Nutrition Labeling and Education Act 1990: Organic Foods Production Act 1994: Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act 1996: Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act 1996: Food Quality Protection Act 1997: FDA Modernization Act 1997: National Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act = 2001-present = 2002: Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act 2002: Farm Security and Rural Investment Act 2003: Animal Drug User Fee Act 2004: Passage of the Food Allergy Labeling and Consumer Protection Act 2005: Sanitary Food Transportation Act 2011: Food Safety Modernization Act 2016: Agriculture Marketing Act  Recent food-borne illness outbreaks  Listed are the deadliest incidents of food-borne illness in the past few decades: 1992-1993 - Jack in the Box E.coli outbreak: Beef patties distributed by Jack in the Box restaurants were contaminated with E. coli O15:H7.

The Center focuses on research related to the long-term effects of brain trauma and degenerative brain diseases, specializing in the diagnosis and analysis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). According to researchers at Boston University, CTE is a brain disease involving progressive neurological deterioration common in athletes, military personnel, and others who have a history of brain trauma. The disease is primarily caused by repeated blows to the head, some of which result in concussions or sub- concussive symptoms. Symptoms from CTE do not typically appear in a subject until many years after the initial injuries, and a conclusive diagnosis of the disease can only be achieved through autopsy. In the years since its inception, the BU CTE Center and Brain Bank has devoted the majority of its time and effort into researching methods for diagnosing CTE in living subjects and developing potential treatments for the disease. Although CTE remains mysterious and controversial, researchers have observed a link between the disease and the protein called tau, which slowly forms clumps in the brain that kill brain cells. This often results in subjects experiencing depression, anxiety, memory loss, headaches, and sleep disturbances.  Formation  Boston University's CTE Center was formed as a part of the school's Alzheimer's Disease Center (BU ADC) which was established in 1996. As the prominence of long-term brain injuries continued to grow in the early 2000s, the CTE Center collaborated with the United States Department of Veteran Affairs and the Concussion Legacy Foundation to form the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. This Brain Bank was officially formed in 2008, and acts as a subset of the Boston University School of Medicine. A brain bank is designed to act as a central resource for the collection and distribution of brain and brain tissue samples. Brain donors may donate their brains after death to aid in the understanding of neural diseases. Brain banks differ from other organ banks in that donated brains will only be used for research purposes, and will not be given to other individuals. Dr. Ann McKee acts as the primary director for the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank and Boston University CTE Center, leading her team of researchers during group and individual case studies. McKee is aided in directing the Brain Bank by Dr. Chris Nowinski, CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, and Lisa McHale, who acts as the Bank's director for family relations. When the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank formally opened in 2008, it became the first tissue repository in the world fully dedicated to the study of CTE. The Brain Bank continues to lead the field of CTE study, as it remains the largest brain tissue repository in the world that focuses on traumatic brain injuries and CTE. In partnership with the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank, the Boston University CTE Center continues to be the most accomplished CTE research facility in the world, as the Center houses 70% of global CTE cases.  Mission and Practices  The goal of the Boston University CTE Center is to collect and study post-mortem brains to better understand the long-term diseases associated with head trauma. Specifically, the CTE Center focuses its research on the formation of neurodegenerative diseases, including Post- Concussion Syndrome and CTE. During case studies, researchers at the CTE Center perform high-impact tests and in-depth autopsies on post-mortem brains to further understand the neuropathology and clinical presentation of CTE. These tests examine the effects of concussions and sub-concussive blows on the brain, specifically as they relate to the development of CTE. The Center's ultimate goal is to develop a test that would definitively diagnose CTE in a living subject. In order to accomplish this, researchers at Boston University made it a priority to study as many post-mortem brains as possible, which led to the formation of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. Currently, the Brain Bank contains over 600 brains, including 325 brains that have been diagnosed with CTE since the formation of the bank. The directors of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank work with families of former athletes and veterans to create a well-rounded database that researchers can utilize during large CTE case studies. Employees of the Brain Bank collect tissue samples from the central nervous system (brain, eyes, and spinal cord) of deceased athletes, most notably American football professionals, and military veterans. The Bank then stores these samples optimally to ensure proper care and treatment before, during, and after research testing. The Brain Bank directors will also share findings with family members and caregivers of the deceased. Although the Brain Bank contains a variety of brains belonging to many different types of athletes and military personnel, Boston University has made it a priority to study the brains of former American football players. These brains come from players involved in every different level of football and have been at the forefront of some of the most important CTE case studies over the past decade.  Notable People  = Dr. Ann McKee = Dr. Ann McKee is the primary director of the Boston University CTE Center and a professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine. Her research focuses on CTE and the late effects of neurodegeneration. Along with her colleagues, McKee has conducted several research studies involving traumatic brain injuries in sports and military situations, and the long-term effects of these injuries. While her largest project has been the formation and expansion of the VA-BU- CLF Brain Bank, McKee is also the director of several other brain banks, all of which are located in Massachusetts. = Chris Nowinski, PH.D. = Chris Nowinski is the co-founder and current CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, an organization dedicated to the awareness and prevention of concussions in every level of sport. Concussions in American football is particularly important to Nowinski as he himself experienced a significant brain injury while playing football at Harvard University. After graduating with a degree in behavioral neuroscience, Nowinski partnered with researchers from Boston University to create the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. = Lisa McHale = Lisa McHale currently acts as the director of family relations for the VA-BU- CLF Brain Bank, working with families of former athletes to help them understand CTE and the mission of the Boston University CTE Center. McHale joined the Concussion Legacy Foundation in 2010, first acting as the Volunteer and Family Coordinator. McHale has personal experience with families dealing with the effects of CTE, as her husband Tom McHale, a former American football player, passed away in 2008 due to complications from the disease.  Notable Case Studies  = 2009 Case Study = Example of tau pathology in human brain In 2009, Dr. McKee and her team of researchers from Boston University published their first CTE study. This publication discussed 47 instances of neuropathological deterioration determined to be CTE. The study involved former athletes from a wide range of sports. The majority of the reported CTE cases were former boxers (85%), but the study also included cases from former American football players, soccer players, and wrestlers. The study was primarily conducted to develop a more accurate clinical presentation of CTE in the brain. By studying the brains of former athletes whose sports commonly involved blows to the head, the researchers were able to identify how CTE looked in the brain of a former athlete. Through in-depth autopsies, the researchers observed the formation of proteins in the brain that caused initial brain cell decay, ultimately leading to CTE in the brain. = 2015 NFL Case Study = Healthy brain (left) and brain with stage IV CTE (right)The first major American football study conducted by the BU CTE Center involved the donated brains of 79 former NFL players. This study was released in 2015 and detailed the autopsies performed by researchers on the donated brains and brain tissue. These examinations were performed at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels, in order to identify important neuropathological characteristics of CTE, including how the brain deteriorates over time, and the distribution of proteins in brains with CTE. Through microscopic examination, the researchers were able to confirm the role of the tau protein in CTE diagnosis, as well as other proteins that are signs of this degenerative disease. This tau protein was present in each brain that was diagnosed with CTE, demonstrating its role in the development of the disease. From these post-mortem tests, researchers were able to detail the characteristics of the various stages of CTE. In the study, the Boston University researchers grouped the subjects into four distinct stages of CTE, with each stage increasing in severity. In stage I CTE, p-tau pathology can be observed in the cerebral cortex, most likely in the area between sulci. In the second stage of CTE, the tau protein is observed in multiple areas of the cerebral cortex, as the p-tau pathology begins to spread across sulci. In stage III CTE, the tau protein becomes widespread, with the greatest severity located in the frontal and temporal lobes. The p-tau groups in these regions are often concentrated in the depths of the sulci. In stage IV CTE, severe p-tau pathology is spread across all areas of the cerebral cortex and temporal lobe. In extreme cases, the tau protein calcarine cortex, which contains the primary visual cortex in the brain. In the study, researchers noted that microscopic signs of p-tau pathology were primarily observed in subjects with Stage III and IV CTE. = 2017 American Football Case Study = Two years after the Center's 2015 study, researchers from Boston University partnered with Stanford University to conduct autopsies on the brains of 202 deceased former American football players from multiple levels (high school, college, semi-pro, CFL, NFL). Recruitment for this study began in 2008, after the establishment of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. After the success of the 2015 American football case study, donations to the Brain Bank grew, as the link between CTE and American football became clear. These increased donations allowed for a larger case study, which would give researchers an opportunity to paint a clearer picture of the disease in a brain. Each of the 202 deceased players had a history of brain trauma and experienced behavioral, mood, and cognitive symptoms during their lives. In addition, the most common cause of death among participants was neurodegeneration or suicide. Each brain was evaluated and CTE p-tau pathology for the brains were classified into a stage of CTE. The study showed that of the 202 evaluated brains, CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 (87%), including 110 of 111 former NFL players (99%). In all cases of CTE, clusters of the tau protein were found in the cerebral cortex, consistent with earlier studies from the CTE Center. These results suggested CTE might be related to participation in football, and higher levels of play may increase the likelihood of the disease. = Aaron Hernandez Autopsy = Former New England Patriots Tight End Aaron Hernandez, Subject of the BU CTE Center In April 2017, former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez committed suicide in a jail cell at the age of 27. Hernandez's suicide occurred just months after he was convicted of first- degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. After his death, Hernandez's brain was donated to the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank, where Boston University researchers, led by Dr. Ann McKee, immediately performed an autopsy on the post-mortem brain. The posthumous examination of the brain showed that Hernandez suffered from stage III CTE, which had previously only been diagnosed in former American football players who were well into their 60s before their deaths. According to Dr. McKee, Hernandez's brain presented a classic case of CTE, as multiple groupings of the tau protein could be seen in frontal lobes. These p-tau deposits developed in close proximity to small blood vessels in the brain and spread to areas that control perception, memory, and emotion. The discovery from Hernandez's autopsy began to shed new light on the impact of CTE in American football players, as well as other athletes. The degree of the CTE present in Hernandez's brain was unprecedented for someone so young. In the autopsy report from Boston University, Dr. McKee explains that Hernandez's brain was one of the most intact specimens her team had ever examined. McKee also notes that the damage to Hernandez's brain took years to develop, and was not the symptom of one incident. While the fear of CTE in American football players had grown after initial discoveries from Boston University, most of the cases featured older players who had been retired for several decades before passing away. With the study of Hernandez's brain, a new push was established to attempt to find a method for diagnosing the disease in living subjects, and ultimately develop ways to treat the disease.  Potential Applications of CTE Research  Current CTE research has primarily focused on how the disease could potentially impact the world of sports. Most notably, CTE has been linked with American football at all levels, though the most concerning findings have dealt with retired players from the National Football League. As CTE continues to gain notoriety, research focus has shifted to developing a test for diagnosing the disease in a living person. By studying and diagnosing post mortem brains with CTE, researchers at the Boston University CTE Center have been able to map out the disease in the brain, specifically, the various proteins that develop in an affected brain. The most important of these proteins is the tau protein, that leads directly to the formation of the disease in the brain. This protein forms as a result of blows taken within the skull, resulting in rapid movement of the brain. By analyzing how and where this protein forms within the brain, researchers can potentially map the protein in living individuals, and predict the development of the disease. As research into the disease continues, leaders of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank hope to utilize their findings to develop methods for treating and preventing the disease.

Currently, there are over a quarter of a million prosthetic heart valves implanted annually, and the number of patients requiring replacement surgeries is only suspected to rise and even triple over the next fifty years. While current treatments offered such as mechanical valves or biological valves are not deleterious to one's health, they both have their own limitations in that mechanical valves necessitate the lifelong use of anticoagulants while biological valves are susceptible to structural degradation and reoperation. Thus, in situ (in its original position or place) tissue engineering of heart valves serves as a novel approach that explores the use creating a living heart valve composed of the host's own cells that is capable of growing, adapting, and interacting within the human body's biological system. Research has not yet reached the stage of clinical trials.  Procedure  Seeding cells into scaffold ready for tissue engineering use and implantation = Scaffolds = Various biomaterials, whether they are biological, synthetic, or a combination of both, can be used to create scaffolds, which when implanted in a human body can promote host tissue regeneration. First, cells from the patient in which the scaffold will be implanted in are harvested. These cells are expanded and seeded into the created scaffold, which is then inserted inside the human body. The human body serves as a bioreactor, which allows the formation of an extracellular matrix (ECM) along with fibrous proteins around the scaffold to provide the necessary environment for the heart and circulatory system. The initial implantation of the foreign scaffold triggers various signaling pathways guided by the foreign body response for cell recruitment from neighboring tissues. The new nanofiber network surrounding the scaffold mimics the native ECM of the host body. Once cells begin to populate the cell, the scaffold is designed to gradually degrade, leaving behind a constructed heart valve made of the host body's own cells that is fully capable of cell repopulation and withstanding environmental changes within the body. The scaffold designed for tissue engineering is one of the most crucial components because it guides tissue construction, viability, and functionality long after implantation and degradation.  Biological  Decellularized tricuspid biological heart valve Biological scaffolds can be created from human donor tissue or from animals; however, animal tissue is often more popular since it is more widely accessible and more plentiful. Xenograft, from a donor of a different species from the recipient, heart valves can be from either pigs, cows, or sheep. If either human or animal tissue is used, the first step in creating useful scaffolds is decellularization, which means to remove the cellular contents all the while preserving the ECM matrix, which is advantageous compared to manufacturing synthetic scaffolds from scratch. Many decellularization methods have been used such as the use of nonionic and ionic detergents that disrupt cellular material interactions or the use of enzymes to cleave peptide bonds, RNA, and DNA.  Fabricated  There are also current approaches that are manufacturing scaffolds and coupling them with biological cues. Fabricated scaffolds can also be manufactured using either biological, synthetic, or a combination of both materials from scratch to mimic the native heart valve observed using imaging techniques. Since the scaffold is created from raw materials, there is much more flexibility in controlling the scaffold's properties and can be more tailored. Some types of fabricated scaffolds include solid 3-D porous scaffolds that have a large pore network that permits the flow through of cellular debris, allowing further tissue and vascular growth. 3-D porous scaffolds can be manufactured through 3-D printing or various polymers, ranging from polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) to more natural polymers such as collagen. Fibrous scaffolds have the potential to closely match the structure of ECM through its use of fibers, which have a high growth factor. Techniques to produce fibrous scaffolds include electrospinning, in which a liquid solution of polymers is stretched from an applied high electric voltage to produce thin fibers. Conversely to the 3-D porous scaffolds, fibrous scaffolds have a very small pore size that prevents the pervasion of cells within the scaffold. Hydrogel scaffolds are created by cross-linking hydrophilic polymers through various reaction such as free radical polymerization or conjugate addition reaction. Hydrogels are beneficial because they have a high water content, which allows the ease of nutrients and small materials to pass through. = Biocompatibility = The biocompatibility of surgically implanted foreign biomaterial refers to the interactions between the biomaterial and the host body tissue. Cell line as well as cell type such as fibroblasts can largely impact tissue responses towards implanted foreign devices by changing cell morphology. Thus the cell source as well as protein adsorption, which is dependent on biomaterial surface property, play a crucial role in tissue response and cell infiltration at the scaffold site.  Methodology  = Inflammatory response =  Acute inflammation  Implantation of any foreign device or material through the means of surgery results in at least some degree of tissue trauma. Therefore, especially when removing a native heart valve either partially or completely, the tissue trauma will trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses and elicit acute inflammation. During the initial phase of acute inflammation, vasodilation occurs to increase blood flow to the wound site along with the release of growth factors, cytokines, and other immune cells. Furthermore, cells release reactive oxygen species and cytokines, which cause secondary damage to surrounding tissue. These chemical factors then proceed to promote the recruitment of other immune responsive cells such as monocytes or white blood cells, which help foster the formation of a blood clot and protein-rich matrix. = Chronic inflammation = If the acute inflammatory response persists, the body then proceeds to undergo chronic inflammation. During this continual and systemic inflammation phase, one of the primary driving forces is the infiltration of macrophages. The macrophages and lymphocytes induce the formation of new tissues and blood vessels to help supply nutrients to the biomaterial site. New fibrous tissue then encapsulates the foreign biomaterial in order to minimize interactions between the biomaterial and surrounding tissue. While the prolonging of chronic inflammation may be a likely indicator for an infection, inflammation may on occasion be present upwards to five years post-surgery. Chronic inflammation marked by the presence of fibrosis and inflammatory cells was observed in rat cells 30 days post implantation of a device. Following chronic inflammation, mineralization occurs approximately 60 days after implantation due to the buildup of cellular debris and calcification, which has the potential to compromise the functionality of biocompatible implanted devices in vivo. Foreign body giant cell (FBGC) from the fusion of macrophages = Foreign body response = Under normal physiological conditions, inflammatory cells protect the body from foreign objects, and the body undergoes a foreign body reaction based on the adsorption of blood and proteins on the biomaterial surface. In the first two to four weeks post implant, there is an association between biomaterial adherent macrophages and cytokine expression near the foreign implant site, which can be explored using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Macrophages fuse together to form foreign body giant cells (FBGCs), which similarly express cytokine receptors on their cell membranes and actively participate in the inflammatory response. Device failure in organic polyether polyurethane (PEU) pacemakers compared to silicone rubber showcases that the foreign body response may indeed lead to degradation of biomaterials, causing subsequent device failures. The utilization of to prevent functionality and durability compromise is proposed to minimize and slow the rate of biomaterial degradation.  Benefits  Tissue engineered heart valves offer certain advantages over traditional biological and mechanical valves: * Living valve – The option of a living heart valve replacement is highly optimal for children as the live valve has the ability to grow and respond to its biological environment, which is especially beneficial for children whose bodies are continually changing. This option would help reduce the number of reoperation needed in a child's life. * Customized process – Since the scaffolds used in tissue engineering can be manufactured from scratch, there is a higher degree of flexibility and control. This allows the potential of tailoring tissue engineered heart valves and its properties such as the scaffold's shape and biomaterial makeup to be tailored specifically to the patient.  Risks and challenges  Diagram of the opened heart viewed from the front, displaying the complex anatomical geometry of valvesMany risks and challenges must still be addressed and explored before tissue engineered heart valves can fully be clinically implemented: * Contamination – Particular source materials can foster a microbiological environment that is conducive to the susceptibility of viruses and infectious diseases. Anytime an external scaffold is implanted within the human body, contamination, while inevitable, can be diminished through the enforcement of sterile technique. * Scaffold Interactions - There are many risks associated with the interactions between cells and the implanted scaffold as specific biocompatibility requirements are still largely unknown with current research. The response to these interactions are also highly individualistic, dependent on the specific patient's biological environment; therefore, animal models researched prior may not accurately portray outcomes in the human body. Due to the highly interactive nature between the scaffold and surrounding tissue, properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, and immunogenicity must all be carefully considered as they are key factors in the performance of the final product. * Structural complexity – Heart valves with their heterogeneous structure are very complex and dynamic, thus posing a challenge for tissue engineered valves to mimic. The new valves must have high durability while also meeting the anatomical shape and mechanical functions of the native valve. History = Synthetic scaffolds = Studies performed seeded scaffolds made of polymers with various cell lines in vitro, in which the scaffolds degraded over time while leaving behind a cellular matrix and proteins. The first study on tissue engineering of heart valves was published in 1995. During 1995 and 1996, Shinoka used a scaffold made of polyglycolic acid (PGA), approved by the FDA for human implantation, and seeded it with sheep endothelial cells and fibroblasts with the goal of replacing a sheep's pulmonary valve leaflet. What resulted from Shinoka's study was an engineered heart valve that was much thicker and more rigid, which prompted Hoerstrup to conduct a study to replace all three pulmonary valve leaflets in a sheep using a poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) coated PGA scaffold and sheep endothelial cells and myofibroblast. = Biological scaffolds = Another option studied was using decellularized biological scaffolds and seeding them with their corresponding cells in vitro. In 2000, Steinhoff implanted a decellularized sheep pulmonary valve scaffold seeded with sheep endothelial cells and myofibroblasts. Dohmen then created a decellularized cryopreserved pulmonary allograft scaffold and seeded it with human vascular endothelial cells to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in a human patient in 2002. Perry in 2003 seeded a P4HB coated PGA scaffold with sheep mesenchymal stem cells in vitro; however, an in vivo study was not performed. In 2004, Iwai conducted a study using a poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) PLGA compounded with collagen microsponge sphere scaffold, which was seeded with endothelial and smooth muscle cells at the site of a dog's pulmonary artery. Sutherland in 2005 utilized a sheep mesenchymal stem cell seeded PGA and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold to replace all three pulmonary valve leaflets in a sheep. = In vivo implant studies = A handful of studies utilized tissue engineering of heart valves in vivo in animal models and humans. In 2000, Matheny conducted a study in which he used a pig's small intestinal submucosa to replace one pulmonary valve leaflet. Limited studies have also been conducted in a clinical setting. For instance in 2001, Elkins implanted SynerGraft treated decellularized human pulmonary valves in patients. Simon similarly used SynerGraft decellularized pig valves for implantation in children; however, these valves widely failed as there were no host cells but rather high amounts of inflammatory cells found at the scaffold site instead. Studies led by Dohmen, Konertz, and colleagues in Berlin, Germany involved the implantation of a biological pig valve in 50 patients who underwent the Ross operation from 2002 to 2004. Using a decellularized porcine xenograft valve, also called Matrix P, in adults with a median age of 46 years, the aim of the study was to offer a proposal for pulmonary valve replacement. While some patients died postoperatively and had to undergo reoperation, the short-term results appear to be going well as the valve is behaving similarly to a native, healthy valve. One animal trial combined the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure with tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs). A TAVR stent integrated with human cell-derived extracellular matrix was implanted and examined in sheep, in which the valve upheld structural integrity and cell infiltration, allowing the potential clinical application to extend TAVR to younger patients.  Research  While many in vitro and in vivo studies have been tested in animal models, the translation from animal models to humans has not begun. Factors such as the size of surgical cut sites, duration of the procedure, and available resources and cost must all be considered. Synthetic nanomaterials have the potential to advance scaffoldings used in tissue engineering of heart valves. The use of nanotechnology could help expand beneficial properties of fabricated scaffolds such as higher tensile strength.

The thermophilic bacteria found in thermal lakes that Taq Polymerase was isolated from. Extremophiles in biotechnology is the application of organisms that thrive in extreme environments to biotechnology. Extremophiles are organisms that thrive in the most volatile environments on the planet and it is due to their talents that they haven begun playing a large role in biotechnology. These organisms live everywhere from environments of high acidity or salinity to areas with limited or no oxygen are places they call home. Scientists show keen interest in organisms with rare or strange talents and in the past 20-30 years extremophiles have been at the forefront with thousands of researchers delving into their abilities. The area in which there has been the most talk, research, and development in relation to these organisms is biotechnology. Scientists around the globe are either extracting DNA to modify genomes or directly using extremophiles to complete tasks. Thanks to the discovery and interest in these organisms the enzymes used in PCR were found, making the rapid replication of DNA in the lab possible. Since they gained the spotlight researchers have been amassing databases of genome data for the hopes that new traits and abilities can be used to further biotechnical advancements Everything from the biodegradation of waste to the production of new fuels is on the horizon with the developments made in the field of biotechnology. There are many different kinds of extremophiles with each kind favoring a different environment. These organisms have become more and more important to biotechnology as their genomes have been uncovered, revealing a plethora of genetic potential. Currently the main uses of extremophiles lies in processes such as PCR, biofuel generation and biomining, but there are many other smaller scale operations at play. There are also labs that have identified what they wish to do with extremophiles, but haven't been able to fully achieve their goals. While these large scale goals have not yet been met the scientific community is working towards their completion in hope of creating new technologies and processes.  Overview of extremophiles  Thermal lake in which thermophilic extremophiles thrive. Extremophile is the term that covers a large group of organisms, most prominently Archaeans, which have evolved to fill the niches of extremely inhospitable environments. Such environments include high or low temperatures, high levels of salinity, high or low pH levels, and areas where volatile chemicals are prominent. These organisms have made some of the most undesirable locations on the planet their home. A few examples of these locations include thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, soda lakes, runoffs from chemical factories and the trash heaps of landfills. There are 4 major types of extremophiles: = Thermophiles = Thermophilic extremophiles live in areas of extreme heat with the best example being geothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The benefit of these organisms lies in the polymers and enzymes produced within them as they are highly thermostable. = Halophilies = Halophilic extremophiles live in areas of high salinity such as solar salterns and soda lakes. Their ability to consume and thrive in areas of such salinity open up possible benefits such as inoculating crops in salt rich soils to help them grow. Another use found for them lies in their production of polymers used to make biodegradable plastics. = Methanogens = Methanogenic extremophiles live just about anywhere and are the most widespread. These organisms take various simple organic compounds and use them to synthesize methane as their source of energy. There are no other known organisms that use the synthesis of methane as a form of energy production. = Psychrophiles = Psychrophilic Extremophiles have the ability to maintain high growth rates and enzyme activity at temperatures even as low as 0℃. This presents the possibility of utilizing enzymes found in these organisms in parallel to how thermophilic organism enzymes are used, but at low temperatures as opposed to high temperatures. Having the ability to live in such harsh environment comes from the organisms traits and abilities that are coded into their genomes. Changes inherited over time via DNA have allowed these organisms to build up various resistances and immunities to the volatile nature of their homes. It is these traits that have scientists so fixated on extremophiles because the genes that allow for said abilities can be taken from extremophiles and used in various biotechnical processes. A good example of this would be how Taq Polymerase was isolated from the bacteria Thermus aquaticus and was then used to make the process of PCR possible. In some cases even the entire organism can be utilized due to how it functions in nature. A good example of this would be the use of methanogenic extremophiles to assist in the decomposition of waste. While only four major types of extremophiles are listed above, there are many more types that are not mentioned in this article.  Importance  Scientists at a biotechnical laboratory synthesizing DNA. A great deal of biological and chemical processes undertaken in laboratories take great stretches of time, are extremely delicate and tend to be costly. This is due to the fact that general biological enzymes, proteins and other various organic compounds have very specific requirements for them to function properly. These are generally moderate conditions and therefore are known as mesophilic. Catalysts that involve changes in temperature, salinity, or acidity can impact the mesophilic organic compounds and products within a given process which in turn negatively affects the outcome. To deal with this scientists in the past have had to take longer experimental pathways in order to meet the moderate conditions. This as stated previously extends the time it takes to perform experiments and processes as well as increases costs. To overcome this issue scientists have turned to extremophiles due to their natural abilities to handle extreme conditions. These abilities are linked to genes which can be isolated, extracted and replicated in the lab. With this the genetic information can then be implanted in the given enzymes, polymers, proteases and other various organic compounds to give them desired resistance. This allows for biological and chemical processes to be completed rapidly as the careful, long winded strategies can be bypassed. Extremophiles, both themselves and their DNA, are helping scientists to optimize lengthy research techniques and processes.  Applications  = PCR = Polymerase Chain Reaction was developed in 1980's by the scientist Kary Mullis. Mullis would later receive the Nobel Prize for his creation of this process in 1993. This technique utilizes the heat resistant enzymes found in the thermophile T. aquaticus to rapidly and efficiently make copies of specific strands of DNA. The small sample of the target DNA is added to a test tube along with DNA primers, DNA nucleotides, Taq Polymerase, and a buffer solution. Once these five key parts are combined they can be put into a PCR thermocycler. In this device the mixture is exposed to a series of temperatures over and over again cycling between 94-95°C, 50-56°C, and 72°C. These three stages are known as the denaturing, annealing and extending stages. During the denaturing stage at 94-95°C the DNA chains separate allowing for new bonds to be made. Then during the annealing stage from 50-56°C primers attach to the single strands of DNA to prepare them for replication. Finally, the extending stage at 72°C the strands of DNA replicate as they would naturally as the DNA nucleotides are added reforming the double stranded helix. These stages are cycled through multiple times until the desired amount of DNA is obtained. Without the enzyme produced by T. aquaticus, Taq Polymerase, this process would not be possible as the components would normally denature at such high temperatures. = Biofuel production = Fuels play a large part in everyday life in everything from driving a car and heating homes to large scale industrial processes and heavy machinery. As natural gases and fuels are being used up scientists have focused their gaze on possible replacements for said fuels. One way in which this is being done is through the utilization of various methanogenic and thermophilic strains of bacteria. These extremophiles in large quantities are able to take in various substances such as sugars, cellulose, and various waste products to produce methane, butanol and biodiesel. While butanol in high percentages would normally inhibit the growth and function of biological organisms, some bacterial strains, primarily thermophiles, have been engineered to handle butanol even in high concentrations. One of the more recent developments in this area is the discovery of extremophile strains of algae which can be used to produce biodiesel. Cyanidium caldarium is noted as one of the most promising strains due to the high lipid content of the biodiesel products it creates. While this application has not yet widely developed to large scale utilization, scientists working in this field hope to find an efficient and sustainable solution involving extremophiles soon. = Biomining = Through work with various extremophiles the technique of biomining was developed. Also known as bioleaching, the process involves the use of acidophiles in the removal of insoluble sulfides and oxides from various metals as they are mined from the earth. The normal process of heap leaching involves mixing mined metals with highly volatile chemicals such as cyanide. The process of bioleaching is noted as a safer approach to the mining process. Along with this it is also much better for the environment. With heap leaching comes the possibility of runoff and spills that would poison the environment as it seeps into the ground. With biomining this worry is reduced as the conditions can be easily maintained using thermophilic and acidophilic strains of bacteria. Not only has this process been noted as safer and more environmentally friendly, but is also able to extract more metal. Heap leaching has about a 60% extraction rate while bioleaching has seen rates up to 90%. So far gold, silver, copper, zinc, nickel, and uranium have been mined successfully using this process. These three examples listed above are a few of the primary applications of extremophiles in biotechnology, but they are not the only ones. Other various applications that will not be fully described here include: carotenoid production, protease/lipase production, Glycosyl hydrolase production and sugar production. These secondary applications focus on the production of biological compounds that can be used within primary applications such as those listed above.  Future developments  Thanks to the increased interest in extremophiles the revolutionary technique of PCR was pioneered and brought the field of DNA study to the next level. Following this trend scientists in both biotech and industry want to push farther and find new ways to impact the scientific community. One way that is currently being studied is the production of plastics by halophilic extremophiles so that modern day oil-based plastics can become a thing of the past. This would bring biodegradable plastics to the world market, which in the long run is proposed as a way to help fight the world's garbage problem. Another advancement that scientists hope to make using these organisms is to increase the degradation of landfills around the world using methanogenic species that thrive on the organic compounds found there. Not only would this reduce waste, but the methane produced is hoped to be collected and used as an energy source. One other interesting future development lies in the field of medicine. Some biotechnical labs are looking into using extremophiles engineered to produce portions of viruses on their surface to elicit immune system responses. This would help train immune memory and antibody response to defend the body in case said virus ever attacks. While this is just a handful of examples there are many more advancements and developments being worked on using extremophiles in hopes of creating a better future.

This bacterium is about 0.7 μm wide by 1.0–10.0 μm long in colony and the cells are pleomorphic with irregular cell walls. This bacterial species is mostly urease positive; around 75% of the strains are urease positive. Less than 0.01% of the human gut microbiota is this bacterium. B. wadsworthia is linked to various diseases and is not well known due to frequent misidentification of the bacteria. The two unique characteristics of B. wadsworthia are the production of hydrogen sulfide and the rapid catalase reaction. This bacterium is vulnerable to the antibiotics: imipenem, ceoxitin, and ticarcillin, which are all β-lactam antibiotics.  Biology  = Type and morphology = Gram stain showing a gram-negative bacteria B. wadsworthia is a gram-negative, catalase-positive, and usually urease-positive bacterium. Although most strains are urease positive, there are some strains that are urease negative. This bacterium, due to its slow nature to grow in standard media for anaerobes, is often misidentified as other anaerobes or not identified at all. The best identifier for this bacterium is a transparent colony with a black center in BBE agar; the black center is ferrous sulfide, which is created by the hydrogen sulfide the bacteria produces. Another unique characteristic of B. wadsworthia is its positive catalase reaction with a 15% hydrogen peroxide reagent; its catalase reaction is unlike other catalase-positive species because the reaction is explosive with bubble formation and is very quick. The most accurate method to identify this bacterium from other similar species is through gas liquid chromatography (GLC); GLC results show that there are a lot of acetic acid peaks and minimal succinic acid present. B. wadsworthia is non-motile and is non-spore forming. In addition, this bacterium has irregular cell walls and no flagella attached to it. The two factors that stimulate its growth are bile and pyruvate; specifically, 20% bile and 1% pyruvate. = Metabolism = One of the main processes that occur in B. wadsworthia is hydrogen sulfide production, which is the product responsible for the bacterium's signature black dot. B. wadsworthia is able to produce hydrogen sulfide through its taurine desulfonation pathway using isethionate sulfite-lyase (IslA). The bacterium converts taurine to hydrogen sulfide when it respires taurine. The production of hydrogen sulfide is connected to the human intestinal microbiota; although there are some benefits to hydrogen sulfide production in the gut like cardioprotection, hydrogen sulfide production also contributes to disease pathology. Production of hydrogen sulfide has been linked to irritable bowel disease (IBD) by damaging the gut epithelium's mucus layer and to colorectal cancer. In addition, during treatments with antibiotics, hydrogen sulfide can aide opportunistic bacteria grow leading to antibiotic resistance. Future research on controlling hydrogen sulfide production may help address B. wadsworthia's contribution to diseases. = Culture growth on bacteriodes Bile esculin (BBE) agar = The bacteria must be grown on this agar for at least 3 days in order to see colony formation. Starting from day 3, two possible types of colonies appear. First, a 1-2 mm diameter convex and irregular colony with a black center is visible. Second, a translucent umbonate and circular colony with a dark center is present. In addition, β-lactamase is not produced in this agar and the colonies formed in BBE agar pass the positive urease test. BBE agar is the optimal agar for B. wadsworthia colony growth. = Culture growth on Brucella agar = The bacteria similar to the BBE agar must be incubated on the agar for at least 4 days. In this agar, a 0.6-0.8 mm diameter raised, circular erose colony is visible. Also, the colony is gray and translucent. = Location = Although the preferred location for this bacterium is still unknown, it is mostly found in the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract. This bacterium is considered virulent in nature because it is commonly found in patients with appendicitis, gangrenous appendicitis, and the blood cultures of patients with liver abscesses; it is the third-most abundant anaerobic bacterium found in patients with appendicitis. Also, they are found in the feces samples of healthy patients. In non-human cases, this bacterium is found in dogs with periodontal disease. In rare cases, this bacterium may be found in saliva and vaginal samples. Other specimen locations where B. wadsworthia have been found include: * Scrotal abscess * Mandibular osteomyelitis * Axillary Hidradenitis suppurativa * Sepsis * Cholecystitis * Bartholinitis  Discovery  B. wadsworthia was first identified in 1988 by E. J. Baron, a retired pathology professor from Stanford University, in specimens collected from patients with perforated appendicitis and gangrenous appendicitis; the bacterium was also found in healthy fecal specimens. This bacterium was categorized into the genus Bilophila because of its bile-loving and growing nature. Baron named the species wadsworthia after the Wadsworth Anaerobe Laboratory, which was where the bacteria was first identified.

Biography Dorothea Kloos (as she was originally known) was born in Bad Gams, a small market town approximately 18 miles / 30 km from Graz in Austria. Slightly unusually, the family into which she was born was half Catholic and half Protestant. She grew up in Idar-Oberstein, a town in the hills north of Saarbrücken. Her earlier career ambitions had been a little esoteric. She planned to become a criminologist and sat the necessary exam to embark on the training, Then she determined to become a teacher. She was still only 17 when, in 1957, she entered the Waldbreitbacher Franciscan community, taking the monastic name Basina. Her management skills seem to have been spotted early on: she was still only 23 when she took charge of the commercial and administrative functions at one of the order's hospitals. Between 1976 and 1988 she served as vicar general of the order. Then, in 1988, she was appointed Superior general, serving till 1994. She served as general secreatary to the German Association of Religious Order Heads (\\"Vereinigung der Ordensoberinnen Deutschlands\\" /VOD)) between 1995 and 1998.

He served as Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast from October 2000 to March 2003 under President Laurent Gbagbo, a close political ally. Sangare was president of a dissident, pro-Gbagbo faction of Ivorian Popular Front members at the time of his death in 2018. Biography Sangaré first met future President Laurent Gbagbo in 1970 while both were students at the University of Abidjan. In 1971, both were imprisoned by the government of then-President Felix Houphouet-Boigny for their opposition to his government. During the 1980s, Sangare and Gbagbo began to set up their clandestine opposition party. Gbagbo, Sangare, and other allies co-founded the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) in 1988. The party was legalized in 1990. The government of then-President Henri Konan Bédié imprisoned Sangare from 1994 to 1995. Laurent Gbagbo became President of Ivory Coast in 2000. He appointed Sangare Foreign Minister from October 2000 to March 2003. The duo remained close after Sangare left office and became head of the FPI. Sangare remained a close loyalist of former President Gbagbo, former First Lady Simone Gbagbo, and their family even after the ex-president's arrest and trial by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes. Sangare denounced the arrest and extradition of Gbagbo to the ICC in The Hague, describing the former president as a \\"hostage\\". Sangare also led boycotts of subsequent Ivorian national elections to call for the release of Gbagbo. He and his faction of the FPI condemned the government of President Alassane Ouattara as \\"undemocratic\\" at rallies calling for Gbagbo's release. Gbagbo remains on trial for crimes against humanity, as of 2019. Sangare, who suffered from cancer, was hospitalized at the Hôtel Dieu hospital in Abidjan in October 2018. He died in the same hospital just fifteen days later on November 3, 2018, at the age of 72. According to Radio France Internationale, Sangare's death dealt a significant blow to the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party. The RFI described Sangara as \\"one of the most respected members\\" within the FPI and an important ally of the Gbagbos. Sangare was president of a dissident, pro-Gbagbo faction of the FPI at the time of his death. Sangare's death came just ten days after the unexplained disappearance of another major FPI leader, former director general of the port of Abidjan, Marcel Gossio.

The girl questions the subjugation of women in her community, and rebels against community norms by dancing with her friends, stealing food denied to her, and demanding the opportunity to call the vaang. The play is written by scriptwriter-director Rafeeq Mangalassery. It was released in November 2018 in the Indian state of Kerala, at a time when the Women's rights movement was taking shape, asking for the right to worship in Sabarimala temple; for Muslim women's right to participate in religious rituals; and for Gender equality in religious spaces, including the appointment of women as Imams, and participating in and leading prayers at mosques. Inspiration Rafeeq Mangalassery says his drama Kithaab was not directly based on the story of Vaangu, but was an independent adaptation inspired from Unni R.'s story Vaangu. However, Unni R. distanced himself from Mangalassery's drama, saying it was not in tune with his ideas and was lacking in spiritual value. Malayalam director V. K. Prakash also had an independent plan to adapt Unni R.'s story Vaangu for film. Plot A Muslim girl wishes to become a muezzin like her father and to call out the azaan. She steals the fried fish her mother cooks for the men in the house and says that doing so is not morally wrong because Padachon (creator-god) would understand that girls are not given enough food. Her father then censures her, telling her that women should get only half of everything that men have. To this, the girl impishly asks why then women shouldn't wear only half of what men do. Amidst these struggles, she expresses her wish to call out the azaan. Her father answers all her queries by referring to a big book (Kithab), and he locks her away so she would not perform in a play (a play within the play) again. He tells her she will not reach heaven if she continues to do such things. \\"If I'd lose entry to heaven because I sing and dance, then I don't want that heaven,\\" she says. The father is even ready to kill the girl when she performs at the school play despite his wishes. When her mother reminds him that he is not just the muezzin, but also a father, he allows her to call out the azaan, and the drama ends with the girl calling out the azaan and the rest praying. Controversy Memunda Higher secondary school in rural Kozhikode staged a drama for interschool competition at district level in Vadakara, which won prizes for best drama and best actress at district level, and was supposed to continue to the Kerala state level interschool competition. Kithaab portrays social discrimination against women on various issues in the traditional Muslim family. Many topics such as discrimination against girls in the provision of food, poor education, and the practice of polygamy are discussed. Since the drama deals with gender justice in the context of Islam, it was opposed, and Memunda Higher secondary school's participation in the completion was successfully stalled by religio-political orthodoxy and conservatives invoking faith issues. The play triggered discussion on gender equality and religious intolerance. The drama was staged separately and performed at a later date. Subsequently, a whataboutery counter-play named Kithabile Koora was also performed on the Malayalam stage, with a female character who seeks freedom of religion. One of the Malayalam theatre activists, Abbas Kalathode, while not enthusiastic about the counter-play either, criticized Mangalassery's Kithaab for not considering a number of recent far-reaching changes in the Muslim community. \\"Portraying a mukri as the villain in the community is an understatement because other villains have emerged among Muslims,\\" he added. Mangalassery disagreed, replying that, \\"It is not correct to say that the Muslim community has registered a steady progress in social life. There could be changes among Muslims as in other communities. But regressive forces have also started dominating. Purdah, which was the dress of a negligible minority in Kerala, has now become the identity of Muslim women. I know mukri is only an employee in the mosque but he represents the clergy, whose vice-like grip has strengthened among Muslims. The play ends with opening of new vistas for the community.\\" \\"Here the background is that of a Muslim family, and hence it tells Muslim life. There is no attempt to insult any particular religion,\\" said Mangalassery. Activists and writers including K Satchidanandan and S Hareesh voiced their opposition against exclusion of Kithaab at the state festival. In a joint statement they condemned the interference of religious organizations on reformative renaissance values and freedom of expression. Cinematographer Prathap Joseph conducted a social media campaign claiming that the withdrawal of the play was a \\"threat to renaissance values and freedom of expression\\". A. Santha Kumar, playwright, wrote via Facebook that \\"the school has washed its hands by withdrawing the play and surrendering to the dictates of religious leaders. He complains that they have also isolated the author of the play, Rafeeq Mangalassery.\\" Kumar asked why those who speak volumes about \\"renaissance values\\" were silent about the isolation of Mangalassery at the hands of \\"minority fundamentalism\\". Rafeeq Mangalassery Rafeeq Mangalassery is a Malayalam-language script writer and director from Chettippadi (Malappuram Kerala) in India. His drama Annaperuna depicts wastage of food while many others go hungry. He also directed Kottem Kareem.

Formerly called Via Triumphalis, it was an ancient consular road that connected Rome to Veii. The northern terminus of the road connects with the Via Cassia. History The name given to the road most likely dates back to the victory of Marcus Furius Camillus over the city of Veii around 396 BC, for which was granted the right to a triumph on the road that led from Veii to the Capitoline Hill (Campidoglio Hill). Roman generals awarded a triumph traditionally proceeded from the Campus Martius to the Capitoline along this road. The route was identified during the Renaissance and described by Flavio Biondo in Roma Triumphans book X. Important ancient landmarks were the Triumphal Bridge (Pons Neronianus) over the Tiber, now demolished, the Triumphal Gate (Porta Triumphalis), the Arch of Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius, and the termination of the route at the Temple of Janus Quadrifrons. The 1828 book A Tour in Italy and Sicily noted that Via Trionfale was \\"only eight feet wide and completely arched over with trees\\" around that time period. The book also noted that the road was \\"paved with stones two or three feet in diameter, irregular, yet closely fitted together, and so deep set in the ground as to now be in perfect order after the lapse of so many centuries.\\" At that time, it was also noted that some of the stones had the initials \\"V.N.\\" carved into them, which stands for \\"via numinis\\". Today The current route is about . It is typically very busy during the day, particularly on areas of the road that only have one lane on each side. In September 2010, the doubling of the carriageway, two lanes in each direction, was completed between the northern entrance of the Agostino Gemelli polyclinic and the Forte Trionfale. On January 23, 2007, the ramps of the Via Trionfale junction were inaugurated with the Grande Raccordo Anulare (in the Ottavia area). The junction was completely opened to traffic around January 2009. Historical landmarks The Fontana di Piazza Pia exists on the route. The fountain was constructed in 1862 by Pope Pius IX, replacing an earlier fountain by Pope Paul V from 1614. The fountain was designed by Filippo Martinucci. It has now been obscured from view due to the raising and widening of the Via Trionfale. References Further reading * Paolo Liverani, Paolo and Spinola, Giandomenico (2006).

Lim assumed the stage name MILCK, based on her first two initials and her last name backwards. Career MILCK's career largely got its start at the 2017 Women's March in Washington D.C. She had written the song \\"Quiet\\" in 2015 along with Adrienne Gonzalez, as a way of coping with sexual assault and abuse as a teenager. Prior to the march she put out requests for female a cappella groups to help perform the song at the event, a call that was answered by groups Capital Blend and GW Sirens from George Washington University. MILCK separately recorded each vocal part, and sent them individually to the participants, due to the logistical difficulties involved in rehearsing in-person. Along with 26 other singers, she performed seven times throughout the march among the crowd, where it was recorded by film maker Alma Ha'rel, who uploaded the video to social media where it had 8 million views in two days, and shared by a number of well-known celebrities. The group was then invited to perform on the television show Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. The song was named the number one protest song of 2017 by Billboard, and was widely embraced as an anthem for the movement. The same year she performed the song with Choir! Choir! Choir! at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto, with proceed from the event donated to the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2018, MILCK returned to the Women's March to perform \\"Quiet\\". She also released her debut EP This Is Not The End EP, which she promoted with a performance on The Today Show. The same year she was invited to perform at the Save the Children's Illumination Gala, at the American Museum of Natural History. She recorded a cover of the Five Stairsteps song \\"O-o-h Child\\", which was used in an ad campaign by Procter & Gamble related to the 2018 Winter Olympics.

At the beginning of his career, he was a staunch supporter of Andrew III of Hungary, serving his Master of the treasury for a decade. He retained his office after the extinction of the Árpád dynasty too, during the short reign of Wenceslaus. Dominic, with the assistance of his brothers and cousins, established a province, which mostly laid in Nógrád and Heves counties, thus he was among the so-called oligarchs, who ruled de facto independently their dominions during the era of feudal anarchy. In this capacity, he had various conflicts with the most powerful oligarch Matthew Csák. After Wenceslaus' departure from Hungary, Dominic supported the claim of Charles I, becoming his ardent partisan until his death in 1320. Dominic was the ancestor of the Pásztói family, which flourished until the early 16th century. Family Dominic II was presumably born in the early 1260s into the prestigious and influential gens (clan) Rátót, as the son of Stephen I (\\"the Porc\\"), who was a strong confidant of Queen Elizabeth the Cuman and held several offices in her court since 1265. It is plausible that Stephen's only known wife Aglent Smaragd was not the mother of Dominic; she was still alive in 1327, and was a Beguine nun at the Sibylla cloister in Buda. Her brothers, Ladislaus and Aynard were active courtiers even in 1350. Dominic's uncle was the powerful baron Roland I. Dominic had four known brothers: Lawrence was killed in the Battle of Lake Hód (near present-day Hódmezővásárhely) in 1282. Ladislaus was Ban of Slavonia in 1300 and ancestor of the Tari family. Kakas was Master of the horse and was killed in the Battle of Rozgony in 1312. He was forefather of the Kakas de Kaza noble family. The youngest brother was Leustach III (also \\"the Great\\"). He was first mentioned by contemporary records only in 1338, thus he was presumably much younger than his late brothers, and his mother was perhaps Aglent Smaragd.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Rátót 1. main branch) Dominic had two sons from his unidentified wife. The elder one Dominic III (also \\"the Great\\") took the surname Pásztói (sometimes also Hasznosi) after his land centre Pásztó. The noble family flourished until the early 16th century. The younger son, Stephen IV was mentioned only once by a document in 1323.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Rátót 3. Pásztói branch) Andrew's partisan Dominic first appeared in contemporary records in 1270, when he was still a minor. He was next mentioned by three non-authentic charters from 1283. The first document narrates a lawsuit and a subsequent agreement within the kindred following the division of their estates. Accordingly, Dominic was granted Pata and Szentgyörgy in Somogy County, Selpe in Pozsony County, Putnok and Feled (present-day Jesenské, Slovakia) in Gömör County, Kaza in Borsod County, Rátót in Pest County and other lands in Bihar County and Transylvania. The other two documents contain donations of privilege to Pata and Szentgyörgy, as a reward to the members of the kindred, who bravely fought in the previous years against the Cumans. Dominic disappeared from the sources thereafter; he did not hold any royal dignity during the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Since the 1280s, the wide Rátót kinship started to build their province to northeast of the capital, which laid mostly in Nógrád and Heves counties. Dominic's possessions reached out Borsod and Gömör counties, where the Ákos clan passed a similar way. In many cases, this has involved conflict with the local nobility. According to a treaty, which was signed in Zagyvafő (present-day near Salgótarján) by the Rátóts and the Zagyvafői branch of the Kacsics clan in late 1290, there were serious clashes and confrontations between the two families prior to that. According to the document, the Rátóts attacked and destroyed the three forts – including Szőlős – of Leustach Kacsics, who was also killed along with three family members and countless servants. The treaty was mediated by Palatine Amadeus Aba and Andrew, Bishop of Eger. The members of the Rátót clan, including Dominic pledged that they will rebuild the three forts and pay 200 marks as a compensation. Dominic's degree of participation is unknown, but his involvement in the conflict was proved by his signature in the document. Andrew III's denarius. Dominic Rátót was responsible for the royal economic policy throughout his reign Dominic was considered a loyal supporter and strong confidant of King Andrew III by December 1291, when he was appointed Master of the treasury, replacing Mojs Ákos. Around the same time, his brother Ladislaus (or Lack) was made Master of the stewards. Dominic served as Master of the treasury throughout the reign of Andrew III, even retaining the dignity after the extinction of the Árpád dynasty. According to historian Bálint Hóman, favorable changes occurred in the state economic policy and the Hungarian central financial administration for the last decade of the 13th century, when Dominic held the office. For instance, high-quality coins with high precious metal content were minted, which have reached the highest level of coins from the reign of Béla IV decades earlier. Andrew's coinage was a popular currency in abroad too. Dominic also standardized the interest rate of the Viennese denarius with banovac (or banski denar). Unfourtantely, these reform steps were proved to be temporary, as central economic policy ceased under anarchic conditions in the first two decades of the 14th century. The ruins of Hasznos Castle (present-day near Pásztó), built and owned by Dominic Rátót Andrew III visited Dominic's estates in Heves County in early 1295, and issued his royal charter in Pásztó on 16 February, which reflects his influence and prestige. Beside his position of Master of the treasury, Dominic was made ispán of Somogy County around December 1297, serving in that capacity at least until October 1299, when he became ispán of Nógrád County. Historian Tamás Kádár argues, he retained both offices after Andrew's death. Andrew III held an assembly of the prelates, noblemen, Saxons, Székelys, and Cumans in Pest in the summer of 1298. Its decrees authorized Andrew to destroy forts built without permission and ordered the punishment of those who had seized landed property with force, but also threatened Andrew with excommunication if he did not apply the decrees. After the close of the diet, Andrew entered into a formal alliance with five influential noblemen – Amadeus Aba, Stephen Ákos, Dominic Rátót, Demetrius Balassa and Paul Szécs – who stated that they were willing to support him against the \\"rebellious lords\\", which term definitely covered Matthew Csák and the Kőszegi family. Based on Stephen Ákos' surviving feudal contract, Dominic possibly accepted Andrew as his \\"natural lord\\" and swore an oath that will defend his king against his all opponents, even against the Pope, while Andrew committed himself that he will support Dominic and his kinship in their efforts and will make peace with the rebellious lords only with the consent of Dominic. Historian Jenő Szűcs emphasized, the Rátót and Ákos provinces cut off the expanding Csák domain from the royal lands, while Stephen Ákos and Dominic Rátót also received royal support to defend their landholdings and to isolate the Csáks and the Kőszegis from each other. By the end of the reign of Andrew III, Dominic was considered a provincial lord, who established a huge domain with his brothers and cousins. His lands and villages laid in the borderland of Heves, Nógrád, Gömör and Borsod counties, at the valleys of the rivers Sajó and Rima (Rimava). His territory also spread to the northeast portions of Veszprém and Pest counties. Through his cousin Desiderius Rátót, Dominic also had kinship relationships with his neighbor and ally Stephen Ákos. Dominic exchanged his estates in Szabolcs County for Poroszló and its monastery in February 1299, with Julius Sártványvecse. Initially, he resided in Ágasvár (lit. \\"Ágas Castle\\"), a small fort located in the mountain range of Mátra. Following a division contract of estates within the kindred, only his younger brother Ladislaus and his descendants owned the castle. Thereafter Dominic moved to Pásztó permanently, which became the centre of his domain and built there a fortified manor. Under his ownership, the town was granted the right from the Crown to hold fairs and markets in 1298. Near the village of Hasznos (today part of Pásztó), he built his castle by the bank of the Kövecses stream, at the foot of the Western Mátra. His descendants, the Pásztói family possessed the fort until its demolition by the end of the 15th century. During the Interregnum The oligarchic provinces in the early 14th century Andrew III, the last male member of the Árpád dynasty, died on 14 January 1301. Alongside other lords and prelates, Dominic Rátót was present at the king's deathbed in Buda. In the next days, he remained in the capital in the evolving political vacuum, and supported the dowager queen, Agnes of Austria. A civil war between various claimants to the throne – Charles of Anjou, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria – followed Andrew's death and lasted for seven years. In early 1301, Charles of Anjou hurried to Esztergom where he was crowned king irregularly. Being Pope Boniface VIII's candidate for the Hungarian throne, Charles had always been unpopular, because the Hungarian lords feared that they would \\"lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church\\", as the Illuminated Chronicle narrates. Dominic was among those lords, who supported Wenceslaus, the son of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who was not only Béla IV's great-great-grandson, but also the bride of the late Andrew III's daughter, Elizabeth. Dominic was a leading member of that Hungarian delegation, which traveled to Bohemia and offered the crown to the young Wenceslaus. The Bohemian king met the Hungarian envoys in Hodonín in August and accepted their offer in his eleven-year-old son's name. Wenceslaus II accompanied his son to Székesfehérvár where John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, crowned the young Wenceslaus king with the Holy Crown on 27 August 1301. The domain of Dominic Rátót (yellow), which was threatened by Matthew Csák's troops constantly since the 1300s Dominic Rátót became one of the most illustrious supporters of Wenceslaus, and was also a member of the royal council in Buda. The young king referred to him as Master of the doorkeepers in September 1301. Beside that, Dominic retained his position of Master of the treasury until the second half of 1302, when he was replaced by Henry Kőszegi. While retained his office of ispán of Nógrád County at least until 1303, he was also made ispán of Szepes County in 1302. According to a royal document from 1303, he held the ispánate of Fejér County in that year. Wenceslaus, who spent most of his short reign only in the safe Buda, issued a royal charter in Pásztó on 5 May 1303, enjoying the hospitality and protection of his loyal baron, Dominic Rátót. The king again visited him in Pásztó a year later, in early June 1304. These two visits are the only known occasions, when Wenceslaus left his seat for another place. As Wenceslaus' position in Hungary had dramatically weakened in the previous years, his father decided to take him back to Bohemia in the summer of 1304. He even took the Holy Crown of Hungary with himself to Prague. Based on a donation letter, it is possible that Dominic supported the claim of Otto, after Wenceslaus renounced his claim to Hungary in favor of him on 9 October 1305, and the Bavarian duke arrived to Hungary with the Holy Crown. Otto referred to Dominic as his Master of the treasury in the second half of 1306 in the above-mentioned document, however it is plausible that Otto, who was never able to strengthen his position in Hungary, tried to obtain the support of Dominic with this appointment and land donation. Historian Tamás Kádár considers, Dominic retired from politics after Wenceslaus' departure from Hungary, and did not interfere in the conflict between Charles of Anjou and Otto of Bavaria. Based on fragmented data from near-contemporary documents, Matthew Csák seriously threatened Dominic's province in the 1300s. When the powerful oligarch attended in a meeting in Kékes in November 1308, three of his five-member escort were noblemen from Nógrád County, which indicates Matthew Csák extended his influence to much of the county at the expense of Dominic. It is plausible that Matthew launched raids and invasions against Dominic's territory after 1304, when Wenceslaus left Hungary. Dominic's temporary retirement from the national politics during that time also supports this assumption. When John III, Bishop of Nyitra excommunicated Matthew Csák in March 1318 for his previous lawlessness against the Church, he referred an incident that the oligarch had formerly imposed extraordinary tax to his subjects in order to ransom the hostages, who were sent to the court of Dominic during their short-lived reconciliation. In 1323, Dominic's sons, Dominic III and Stephen IV remembered that they were imprisoned and sentenced to death by Matthew sometimes earlier. At the cost of serious injuries, they managed to escape from the prison with the assistance of a lady named Cunigunde. Charles' partisan Along with his brothers and cousins, for instance Roland II, who styled himself Palatine of Hungary in the 1300s, Dominic took an oath of allegiance to Charles I by 1307. He was present at the Diet of Rákos on 10 October 1307, which confirmed Charles's claim to the throne. The subsequently issued royal charter listed Dominic to the second place among the supportive barons, only Ugrin Csák, Charles' earliest and most ardent partisan preceded him. With the leadership of Dominic II and Roland II (who died in 1307, however), the Rátót clan was the most populous family in the royal court, who joined Charles. He was again made ispán of Nógrád County, according to a document issued in September 1308, but it is possible he held the office without interrupt since 1299 (or 1303). When the papal legate Cardinal Gentile Portino da Montefiore managed to persuade Matthew Csák to accept King Charles' rule at their meeting in the Pauline Monastery of Kékes on 10 November 1308, the oligarch also promised that \\"he will conclude a just and equitable peace with magister Dominic and other those barons, with whom he had conflict\\". Thereafter they mutually offered hostages to Thomas II, Archbishop of Esztergom, in order to maintain peace. Charles I, as depicted in the 15th-century Chronica Hungarorum Dominic and his brothers – Ladislaus and Kakas – were present at the following assembly (27 November) in Pest where Charles was unanimously proclaimed king. Dominic also attended the second coronation of Charles I on 15 June 1309, representing his brothers and the whole kindred too. As the Transylvanian oligarch, Ladislaus Kán refused to recover the Holy Crown, which he possessed after Otto's capture and imprisonment, most Hungarian lords regarded Charles' second coronation with a temporary crown invalid. Thereafter Amadeus Aba and Dominic Rátót escorted Archbishop Thomas, who negotiated with the voivode in Szeged on 8 April 1310, on the conditions of return of the crown. Ladislaus Kán finally agreed to give the Holy Crown to Charles. On 27 August 1310, Archbishop Thomas put the Holy Crown on Charles' head in Székesfehérvár; thus, Charles' third coronation was performed in full accordance with customary law. For his loyalty and service, Dominic Rátót was made treasurer of the queenly court of Charles' wife Mary of Bytom. Two documents from August and November 1313 (the latter was preserved from only 18th-century transcriptions) mentioned him in this capacity, but it is possible that he already held the dignity since 1310. When James Borsa rebelled against the king in late 1314 or early 1315, he was dismissed as Palatine by Charles. Dominic Rátót was first referred to as his successor in August 1315, but it is presumable that he already obtained the position at least in February. The importance of the position was overshadowed by the dignity Master of the treasury during the first period of the Angevin (Anjou) rule. For instance, treasurer Demetrius Nekcsei almost always preceded Dominic in the lists of barons, which were part of the royal charters. Tamás Kádár considers Charles chose Dominic to the position, because he remained the only prestigious and experienced baron in the royal court, who has maintained his loyalty; in 1314–15, Charles' rule came to a turning point. The oligarchic powers rebelled against him one after another. Simultaneously, Charles transferred his residence from Buda to Temesvár (present-day Timișoara, Romania) in early 1315, and launched his unification war against the provinces. Dominic realized the situation that he can defend his interests and landholdings against the neighboring Csák and Aba domains, if he does not only cooperate with the central power, but also actively helps the monarch against the violent and disloyal provincial lords. After his appointment, he was granted the confiscated lands of three noblemen in Nógrád County in September 1315, who were considered strong supporters of Matthew Csák. One of these sanctioned nobles was Felician Záh, who became infamous for his assassination attempt against Charles and his family in 1330. Despite Dominic held the dignity for five years, he is one of the least knowable palatines of the era due to the lack of sources. He issued only one private nature document, while his possible vice-palatine or permanent court were not mentioned, in addition to the counties, which he was granted as source of income (honor). Historian Tibor Szőcs argues Dominic resided constantly in the royal court at Temesvár, and because of the war conditions, he never visited the rest of the country and made no judgments. Dominic was a member of the royal council and often gave advice to Charles. His predecessors and successors represented a different institutional style. Because of the unification war, Dominic was only palatine in title, but not in practice. Historian Attila Zsoldos considers the counties of Pest, Fejér and Esztergom, in addition to the privileged Pechenegs of Sárvíz (), belonged to his honor, while he functioned as Palatine of Hungary. Zsoldos argues Stephen Sáfár, the castellan of Visegrád and John Hencfi, judge of Buda were commissioned as acting judges of the aforementioned territories in January 1321, shortly after Dominic's death. In accordance with Zsoldos' theory, Archbishop Thomas nominally remained the perpetual count of Esztergom, but the county and its castle was managed by Dominic Rátót because of its strategic importance in the war against Matthew Csák and the Kőszegis (Esztergom was besieged and captured several times in the previous decade). Dominic was last mentioned as a living person by sources in August 1320. He died soon. He was succeeded as Palatine by Dózsa Debreceni after one and half years period of vacancy in the end of 1321 or early 1322.

Suppose that x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n are positive real numbers. Then : 0<\\\\frac{n}{1/x_1+1/x_2+\\\\cdots+1/x_n}\\\\leq\\\\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2\\\\cdots x_n}\\\\leq\\\\frac{x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots+x_n}{n} \\\\leq\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{x_1^2+x_2^2+\\\\cdots+x_n^2}{n}}. These inequalities often appear in mathematical competitions and have applications in many fields of science.  Proof  There are various methods to prove the inequalities, including mathematical induction, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, Lagrange multipliers, and Jensen's inequality. The links to some methods of proof are included below.  The n = 2 case  The semi-circle used to visualize the inequalities When n = 2, the inequalities become \\\\frac 2 {\\\\frac{1}{x_1}+\\\\frac{1}{x_2}} \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{x_1x_2} \\\\leq \\\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}\\\\leq\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{x_1^2+x_2^2}{2}} for all x_1, x_2 > 0, which can be visualized in a semi-circle whose diameter is [AB] and center D. Suppose AC = x1 and BC = x2. Construct perpendiculars to [AB] at D and C respectively. Join [CE] and [DF] and further construct a perpendicular [CG] to [DF] at G. Then the length of GF can be calculated to be the harmonic mean, CF to be the geometric mean, DE to be the arithmetic mean, and CE to be the quadratic mean. The inequalities then follow easily by the Pythagorean theorem.

All of CANTV's 1.5 million users were affected by the decision. The block was lifted on 18 January 2019, following widespread criticism against the state-owned company, claiming it was in response to the Venezuelan presidential crisis. The block coincided with Juan Guaidó's claims to become acting president during the beginning of the Venezuelan presidential crisis. During the crisis, several Internet outages were reported as well as the blocking of multiple websites, including Wikipedia. Wikimedia Venezuela reported another block of Wikipedia on 23 January 2019. Context The Wikipedia block occurred in the midst of several edit wars on the Spanish Wikipedia articles of Nicolás Maduro, Juan Guaidó, President of Venezuela and List of Presidents of Venezuela. The edit wars were in conflict over edits by both registered users and anonymous IP users, with different opinions on the re-election of Maduro as president of Venezuela from 2019, the assumption of the presidency by Guaidó, as well as about the chronology of the presidency. Initial edits claimed that Guaidó declared himself president, with following wars removing this information. Block On the afternoon of 12 January 2019, the NetBlocks Internet observatory collected technical evidence of the blocking of all versions of Wikipedia in Venezuela. The restrictions were implemented by CANTV, the largest telecommunications provider in the country. NetBlocks identified a major disruption to the network affecting the telecommunications infrastructure, which coincided with other restrictions affecting the ability of Venezuelans to access information in the previous 24 hours. It is believed that the reason is an attempt to hide or suppress the Wikipedia article of the newly appointed president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, who included him as \\"51st President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\\" The information collected also shows several websites that had recently been restricted, meaning that political instability in the country may be the main motive for the control of the Internet. The Observatory VE without filters (Spanish: VE sin Filtro) also collected information about the block, showing that it is an irregularly effective block, an HTTP filtering block according to the SNI (Server Name Indication), preventing a connection to the server from being established with high frequency. The group reported that they thought that the block had ended on 13 January at 4:50pm, but the blocking methods showed up later, and they deleted the tweet with the incorrect information. Similarly, several media outlets suggested that Wikipedia directly or indirectly was taking sides with either group. Reactions =Wikimedia Foundation= On 13 January, the Wikimedia Foundation said that they were opening an investigation into the ongoing event, and that they were still receiving web traffic and edits from Venezuela at the same time. Wikimedia Venezuela In a statement, announced: =Government= On 15 January, Nicolás Maduro spoke about Wikipedia and said that the opposition was \\"aiming to garner political power and become president of the Wikipedia Republic, of the Twitter Republic\\", in reference to the edit wars that took place surrounding the appointment of Juan Guaidó as president in the midst of the presidential crisis. Maduro added \\"There they are with their Wikipedia and their Twitter\\". William Castillo, former president of the National Commission of Telecommunications (Conatel) and current deputy minister of International Communication denied the block of Wikipedia, and alleged that it was a DoS attack against the site, to discredit the Venezuelan government.

These days she is writing a script for a feature film called Milk. The script was selected for the Berlinale talent Market 2018 and won the VFF Talent Highlight Award. Films =Off-White Lies= After years of living apart from her dad, Libby, an introverted yet sharp-witted teenager is sent to live with him in Israel. Her arrival coincides with the outbreak of the second Lebanon war. Libby quickly discovers that her Dad, Shaul, is an infantile eccentric, and that he is “in-between apartments” (in other words: homeless). Shaul comes up with a creative plan to put a roof over their heads- they pose as refugees from the bombarded northern region of Israel and are taken in by a well-off family in Jerusalem. Finally in a “normal” household, Shaul and Libby begin to build their father- daughter relationship, but their false identities cannot last forever, especially as Libby unleashes teenage fury at the lies permeating her life; those she must tell now, and those she's been fed since childhood.A review on Off-White Lies at Yedioth Ahronoth =Milk= Tala (33), an offbeat musician who just gave birth to her first daughter, takes up a job at Milky Way, a dairy for mother's milk, where women sit in working-stations for their breasts to be pumped. The milk is distributed mainly to mothers who can't or don't want to breastfeed their babies but can afford fresh organic mother's milk – For nature knows best what's best for you. The need to earn a living and support her baby with no father in the picture has pushed Tala into this awkward job. Tala soon learns the house rules: 100% discretion, 1-year minimum commitment, 40-minute pumping sessions with 3-hour intervals, strict diet, no drinking, no drugs. The only consolation is the sisterhood woven between the women at the dairy – and of course the handsome paycheck. Everything would have worked out just fine if only Tala wasn't Tala- Even though she tries her best to accept her new role, her rebellious nature keeps pushing her to confrontations. A sneaky cigarette is detected in her blood tests and Tala is suspended from the factory. Upon hitching a ride home with the 'breast'-milkman, she accidentally meets the upper-class woman who receives her own milk, an encounter which leads her to a bumpy and surprising journey, in which she learns what it really means to be a mother. =On the spectrum= A bittersweet comedy about three roommates, living together under one roof. All in their late-twenties, each diagnosed with a disorder on the autistic spectrum. Through their unique, surprising, and extremely un-PC perspective about relationships, family, work, friendship, sex and social conventions, we'll get to look at ourselves in a new, strange and funny way.

He began his criminal career as a small-time marijuana smuggler in his teens, and later joined the Gulf Cartel under kingpin Juan García Ábrego. García Mena was arrested by U.S. authorities in Texas while possessing marijuana in 1984, but was released without a conviction. He returned to Mexico, and established a center of operations in Nuevo León. García Mena was arrested on drug-trafficking charges in 1989, but authorities were again unable to convict him. Released in 1990, he rejoined the Gulf Cartel. Throughout his criminal career, García Mena cultivated a social image of a feared kingpin and a benefactor. He donated money to his community, and corrupt officials in the local police and the military facilitated his drug operations. García Mena consolidated his criminal empire by building a profitable marijuana-trafficking business with his brother and nephews, and successfully defended his turf from rival criminal groups. He befriended Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, who became the undisputed Gulf Cartel kingpin, during the late 1990s. García Mena had disagreements with other Tamaulipas-based traffickers, however, who eventually plotted his downfall. On 6 April 2001, he was arrested by the Mexican Army after a week-long manhunt. García Mena's arrest triggered infighting within the Gulf Cartel, and prompted more offensives from the Mexican government. He was convicted of several charges, including drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms. García Mena was released in 2014, after a court determined that his arrest violated due process. A fugitive from U.S. justice, he has a pending extradition request. Background and career García Mena was born in 1954 in Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to Gilberto García Acevedo and Emma Mena. When García Mena was young, he excelled in school and athletics; he was fluent in English, and popular among his peers. At age eighteen García Mena became involved with Los Bravos Locos, a small drug-running gang which smuggled and sold marijuana in the U.S. Some gang members were devotees of Santa Muerte, a folk Catholic saint, and García Mena also became a devotee. He quickly ascended in the criminal underworld as an assassin and innovative smuggler and was recruited by the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. García Mena rose to prominence during the 1970s by controlling the drug trade in La Frontera Chica region, which includes the U.S.-border municipalities of Miguel Alemán, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Camargo, Mier, and Guerrero. He worked with his brother, Juan Anacleto, and several of his nephews (who were known as Los Aerolitos). The police initially suspected that García Mena was a drug mule and car thief before he joined the Gulf Cartel. García Mena also smuggled drugs through tunnels connecting Miguel Alemán to Star County, Texas. The tunnels required advanced technology because they were dug below the Rio Grande River. García Mena bought properties on both sides of the border to ensure drugs were smuggled smoothly. = Early arrests = In 1984, he was arrested for the first time after U.S. authorities found him in possession of of marijuana in Texas. However, García Mena was not sentenced and was released from prison thirty days after his arrest. He returned to Mexico, and resumed his criminal activities. Instead of returning to his native Tamaulipas, García Mena made Nuevo León his center of operations. Disguised as a cattle rancher, he rented a house in the Monterrey neighborhood of Colinas de San Jerónimo. Residents of the neighborhood said that García Mena was a quiet, normal neighbor; although he greeted neighbors when he arrived home, however, they thought it unusual that he was usually accompanied by a man in military uniform. According to authorities, he used Monterrey as a corridor to move drugs from other parts of Mexico (primarily Oaxaca) before they were sent to Miguel Alemán to be resold. His narcotics were stored in warehouses in Colonia Central de Carga and Parque Industrial Ciudad Mitras, two neighborhoods in Guadalupe and García. When the drugs reached Tamaulipas, they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution. On 12 June 1989, the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) arrested two of García Mena's associates (Jesús López Meléndez and Germán Rodríguez Mijares) in Apodaca with 2.5 tons of marijuana. In their confessions, the men said that they were hired in Oaxaca by Octavio Leal Moncada (one of García Mena's business partners) to move the drugs to one of his ranches in Hidalgo. They identified Leal Moncada, García Mena, and the brothers Omar and Sergio Hinojosa García, as owners of the marijuana, and the PJF arrested García Mena and several of his henchmen on 14 June 1989. Once arrested, García Mena confessed that his cousin Eusebio Guadalupe Hinojosa García and Virgilio Esquivel Cabrera were also involved in his drug operations. The other detainees identified García Mena as the lead operator, and stated that the drugs were intended to be smuggled from Miguel Alemán to the U.S. in speedboats. During his first hearing, García Mena retracted from his statements and said he was tortured by the PJF to confess he was the owner of the marijuana loads. When he was first visited by his defense lawyer Horacio Moyar Quintanilla, García said he was fine, but he later stated that he was forced to say that by the PJF. He said he was in Monterrey for an appointment with doctor Óscar Támez, and that he was arrested at his mother- in-law's house, where he was tortured and forced to sign blank papers. The judge ordered the prosecution to present evidence proving that the vehicle and the properties that were linked to the drug operation were tied to García Mena. He also ordered the doctor to appear in court and show him García Mena's medical records and appointments. The doctor appeared in court in less than 72 hours and showed the judge that García Mena did visit him for a scheduled appointment. The judge thus ordered for García Mena's release, citing torture and the doctor's appointment book as evidence of García Mena's innocence. As García Mena stepped out of prison, he was re-arrested for other drug charges. He was transferred to Reclusorio Sur (a Mexico City penitentiary), and then re-transferred to Topo Chico in Monterrey. The lead prosecutor of the case against García Mena was Alejandro Garza Delgado. His defense argued that he was not guilty because the drugs linked to him by the prosecution were not in his possession at the time of his arrest. Although judge Rodolfo Pasarin de Luna sentenced Leal Moncada to 26 years and gave minor sentences to three detainees on 26 July 1990, he said that the evidence against García Mena was insufficient and ordered his release. The Attorney General's Office (PGR) appealed the verdict, and issued an arrest warrant for him later that year. Leal Moncada and the other detainees were also later acquitted and released from prison. García Mena returned to his native Tamaulipas and settled in Guardados de Abajo, a rural community in Camargo where he lived in a mansion for twelve years. In 1992, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) suspected that García Mena managed to smuggle 30 tons of marijuana from Mexico to Texas with the assistance of ten other gang members, including his brother Antonio. U.S. authorities issued an arrest warrant for his capture and released a US$10,000 bounty. Mexican authorities, including the PGR, requested citizens' help in locating García Mena, who was referred to in the press release by his alias \\"The Czar of Miguel Alemán\\". According to the Mexican police, García Mena was believed to be hiding in his hometown of Guardados de Abajo, and highlighted that his parents owned a property adjacent to the Rio Grande River. The PGR regarded him as one of the five most-wanted fugitives in Mexico, and believed he owned a pipe trailer company, though it was unclear if he used strawpeople to manage it. In September 1993, judge Isidro Gutiérrez González issued an arrest warrant for García Mena's capture. The judge considered that the circumstances surrounding his release were suspicious.  Leadership  When García Mena became involved in drug trafficking in the 1970s, the Gulf Cartel was headed by Juan García Ábrego. García Mena defended La Frontera Chica from incursions by rival criminal groups for several years, and consolidated himself as a kingpin with manpower and a profitable marijuana-trafficking business. Groups like the Juárez Cartel (under the leadership of Amado Carrillo Fuentes), the Tijuana Cartel (under the Arellano Félix siblings), and the Sinaloa Cartel (under Héctor Luis Palma Salazar) unsuccessfully tried to take over drug-trafficking routes in the region, and decided to turn away from the drug corridors at the Tamaulipas border and focus on other drug routes in Mexico. García Mena's success gave him social acceptance and a good reputation in the criminal underworld. After García Ábrego was arrested in 1996, the cartel experienced internal strife as several factions (and leaders) vied for control. García Mena was part of a faction opposed to groups headed by cartel leaders Ángel Salvador Gómez Herrera (\\"El Chava\\"), Adán Medrano Rodríguez (\\"El Licenciado\\"), and Hugo Baldomero Medina Garza (\\"El Señor de los Tráilers\\") for control of the drug corridors in La Frontera Chica. Control of the Gulf Cartel consolidated under Osiel Cárdenas Guillén in 1998, and García Mena began working with him with other cartel leaders involved in the unrest. He was left in charge of drug-trafficking activities in La Frontera Chica, and became one of Cárdenas Guillén's top collaborators. Cárdenas Guillén initially did not know what to call García Mena when he was appointed to the executive role; learning that García Mena was born in June and enjoyed hot weather, he began calling him \\"El June\\". García Mena met Cárdenas Guillén when the latter worked in Miguel Alemán as a PJF officer during the late 1990s, prior to becoming the leader of the Gulf Cartel. As a policeman, Cárdenas Guillén oversaw drug seizures and ran a profitable drug ring with the help of corrupt fellow officers. García Mena heard of Cárdenas Guillén's activities, and approached him for a meeting; they got along well, and became trusted business partners. Cárdenas Guillén helped keep García Mena's turf free from rival drug gangs, and gave him drugs to resell which had been seized by the police. García Mena gave some of the profits to Cárdenas Guillén, who gave them to his collaborators in the police. Their partnership strengthened with time; Cárdenas Guillén was romantically involved with Adriana García García, García Mena's niece. Adriana worked at the PJF offices in Miguel Alemán, and helped Cárdenas Guillén with leaked law- enforcement information. García Mena supported their relationship, and gave Cárdenas Guillén free rein in Miguel Alemán's drug-trafficking activities. Cárdenas Guillén eventually became the head of the Gulf Cartel, and García Mena worked under him.  Influence and downfall  According to federal sources, García Mena was protected by local police, politicians, and the military. Investigators believe that García Mena was allowed to conduct drug- trafficking activities with relative impunity by these corrupt officers. In 1997, he recruited several military members who were stationed in Miguel Alemán to combat drug-trafficking groups in the region; among them were Arturo Guzmán Decena and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, two military officers who were his bodyguards. García Mena's legal team advised him to hire mercenaries because illegal possession of firearms was considered a more serious crime than drug trafficking at that time. On 14 January 2000, García Mena was accused of collaborating with three military members based in Tamaulipas: General Ricardo Martínez Perea, Infantryman Javier Antonio Quevedo Guerrero, and Captain Pedro Maya Díaz. The report, which was issued anonymously to the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA), provided details of García Mena's use of the military for his drug-trafficking activities. The military men were accused of allowing the Gulf Cartel to move drugs from Tamaulipas to the U.S. and notifying them of law-enforcement presence by sharing their communications equipment. In return, García Mena provided them with information on drug shipments by rival gangs for the military to seize. The prosecution thought it suspicious that multiple drug seizures on García Mena's turf under Martínez Perea's tenure occurred without arrests. The former mayors of Miguel Alemán and Camargo, Raúl Rodríguez Barrera (\\"El Chupón\\") and Lorenzo Ramírez Díaz, respectively, were also accused of protecting the Gulf Cartel. Rodríguez Barrera reportedly met García Mena in 1997, when the mayor worked for the PJF in Reynosa and Ciudad Victoria. García Mena reportedly met him several times at horse-racing events at Las Bugambilias, a ranch owned by his lead smuggler Edelio López Falcón (\\"El Yeyo\\"). Rodríguez Barrera and García Mena appeared together in several videos and photographs with other senior Gulf Cartel members; Ramírez Díaz was the cousin of Mario Ramírez (\\"La Gata\\") and Eduardo Ramírez (\\"El Pollo\\"), two of García Mena's chief collaborators in La Frontera Chica. García Mena was seen as a folk hero and a quasi-mythical figure by many residents of Guardados de Abajo. Part of his social image stemmed from his roles as benefactor and kingpin. According to local residents, he provided jobs, services and investment, and was feared and respected by local law enforcement. Residents said that García Mena bought medicine for the sick, brought people to the hospital as needed, provided jobs at his ranch, helped build a school and a church, distributed Christmas presents, paid for funerals and Holy Week vacations, and funded road-paving and access to potable water. They described him as a practicing Catholic who attended mass every Sunday and received communion. This perspective was at odds with the Mexican government's view of García Mena. Authorities suspected him of masterminding 15 homicides, including that of Reynosa PJF commander Jaime Rajid Gutiérrez Arreola. According to an anonymous police officer with knowledge of García Mena's homicide cases, García Mena was not an aggressive crime boss and was generally level-headed. The officer said that García Mena preferred to keep the peace and avoid a commotion. García Mena had a large group of henchmen in Tamaulipas, and one of his closest associates was López Falcón. Although they worked together smuggling drugs into the U.S. from Tamaulipas, they began having differences in the late 1990s. The differences began after López Falcón began diversifying the Gulf Cartel's portfolio and began smuggling cocaine into the U.S. from Tamaulipas. García Mena sided with Cárdenas Guillén to oust López Falcón, which forced López Falcón to seek support from other organized- crime members tied to rival drug cartels. López Falcón and his enforcer, Rolando López Salinas (\\"El Rolis\\"), met with members of the Sinaloa Cartel and brokered a drug deal without the Gulf Cartel's approval during the summer of 2000. They eventually left the Gulf Cartel and joined the Sinaloa Cartel, which promised him larger profits in exchange for allowing them to smuggle drugs in Tamaulipas. This prompted García Mena and the Gulf Cartel to fully cut ties with them. At that time, the Sinaloa Cartel operated as a triangle organization and held an alliance with the Milenio Cartel and Juárez Cartel, two other criminal groups in Mexico that rivaled the Gulf Cartel. García Mena relied on Cárdenas Guillén's forces to kill López Falcón and López Salinas. In turn, López Falcón reportedly opted for a new strategy: reaching out to authorities and providing them with information on García Mena's whereabouts. Manhunt The Gulf Cartel was under close scrutiny after several of its members threatened two U.S. agents at gunpoint in Matamoros in 1999; the incident drew attention to its leadership, which included García Mena. The first major breakthrough about the Gulf Cartel's leadership under Cárdenas Guillén occurred after the arrest of Medina Garza on 1 November 2000, which led to information on García Mena. In early 2001, García Mena and six accomplices were arrested on a highway in Tamaulipas, but he was released hours later by order of Martínez Pérez. From 31 March to 10 April 2001 about 300 soldiers from the Mexican Army and personnel from the Special Prosecutor's Office For Crimes Against Health (FEADS) were stationed in Camargo to crack down on the Gulf Cartel's operations in the area. The crackdown, headed by PGR chief José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, yielded major developments against García Mena's operations. On 2 April, authorities arrested 21 members of the cartel in Guardados de Abajo. The PGR confirmed that García Mena had nearly been captured, escaping seven minutes before the police reached his location. Mexican authorities reached out to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the DEA for assistance, since they suspected García Mena of fleeing to the U.S. They seized 12 tons of marijuana at the home of Juan de Dios Hinojosa Moreno, one of García Mena's top lieutenants in Guardados de Abajo, on 4 April. The military also raided the homes of Zeferino Peña Cuéllar (head of the Miguel Alemán Municipal Police and alleged Gulf Cartel operator), and García Mena's brother Juan Anacleto; a number of firearms were seized from both houses. On 6 April, the military intercepted a phone call in which García Mena asked his associates for clothing so he could leave Guardados de Abajo (where he was suspected of hiding). The army reinforced surveillance in surrounding towns to prevent him from fleeing, and raided three more houses in Guardados de Abajo the following day in search of him. They and the Mexican Air Force conducted air and land surveillance in the adjacent rural communities of Guardados de Arriba, Carrizales, Rancherías, Los Ángeles, and Comales, discovering a clandestine airstrip in Camargo presumably used by the Gulf Cartel for their drug operations. The PGR confirmed on 6 April that they were investigating at least ten military officers in Tamaulipas protecting and supporting the cartel. = Re-arrest = Although soldiers raided García Mena's home in Guardados de Abajo with a search warrant, they were unable to locate him for several days and his family continued to access it. Authorities believed that it was a safe house for his operations, and discovered several government-issued IDs from the State of Mexico and Guerrero in his name with different photographs and addresses. After several fruitless days, the PGR decided to return García Mena's home to his mother. However, the army discovered a hidden compartment behind a bedroom wardrobe a few hours before they were going to leave the house. They noted the wardrobe had an electrical switch, and because they thought the location was unusual they decided to investigate, finding a cupboard wall which covered the entrance to the small room. García Mena was hiding in the room, and was arrested by the army's Special Forces Airmobile Group (GAFE) at 12:20 p.m. on 9 April 2001. Although authorities were prepared to use force, García Mena (who was alone) was arrested without incident. He was in possession of a portable oxygen tank, a mobile phone, a radio-communication device, five firearms, food and cleaning supplies, and an altar and paraphernalia of the Santa Muerte. The weapons, which included three .38 pistols, one .22 pistol and a German-made Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, allowed the soldiers to arrest García Mena in flagrante delicto. The soldiers were particularly alarmed by his MP5 and .38 weapons; the MP5 is a military-exclusive weapon in Mexico, and civilian possession is a violation of federal law. García Mena was wearing one of the .38s on his waist when he was arrested, and admitted in custody that it was his. His four handguns had \\"El Coronel\\" insignia, which reportedly indicated the factory in which they were made. The weapons were not from a Mexican arms provider, and the PGR suspected that they originated in Colombia. The PGR did not confirm to the press if they would investigate links between García Mena's faction and Colombian drug-trafficking groups. PGR chief José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos said at a press conference that although García Mena's arrest was a significant blow to the Gulf Cartel, it continued to operate across Mexico. The PGR confirmed that Cárdenas Guillén was the main target of their law-enforcement operations, they were close to arresting him, and were going after other high-ranking Gulf Cartel leaders. They emphasized that García Mena's arrest was significant, but the Gulf Cartel was not close to being dismantled; the other cartel leaders were similar in rank. According to the PGR, the operation leading to García Mena's Guardados de Abajo arrest also yielded 127 firearms; four hand grenades; 2,134 marijuana packages, weighing more than 20 tons; of marijuana seeds; 52 vehicles and 18 houses, of which 10 remained under federal jurisdiction. The government called it one of Tamaulipas' largest weapons seizures. García Mena's arrest marked a shift in how the Mexican government confronted drug cartels. President Vicente Fox of the National Action Party (PAN), who ousted the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 2000, abandoned a passive approach to the cartels and led aggressive crackdowns on them. Fox relied heavily on the Mexican Armed Forces in counter-narcotics efforts, increasing the military's role in enforcing civilian law and conducting intelligence. His efforts in apprehending García Mena were recognized by the U.S. government, who highlighted it as evidence of increasing multilateral collaboration between law-enforcement agencies in both countries. On 20 April 2001, PGR head Rafael Macedo de la Concha met with DEA administrator Donnie R. Marshall. Marshall praised the Mexican government for García Mena's arrest, saying that it indicated that Mexico was committed to fighting corruption. García Mena was wanted by the U.S. government for drug trafficking, and was the subject of a pending extradition request.  Government response  On 12 April 2001, the Tamaulipas State Police and federal agents reinforced Camargo and Miguel Alemán to prevent criminals from fleeing Tamaulipas for Nuevo León. The plan consisted of surveillance on highways connecting Tamaulipas with Nuevo León to prevent the flow of drugs. The Nuevo León State Police, the army and the PGR sent additional troops to the municipalities of Los Aldamas, Los Ramones, China and General Bravo to improve security. On 26 April, the PGR said that they would increase the law-enforcement presence in Tamaulipas and Veracruz with additional army troops and would not rely on the Federal Preventive Police (PFP). The decision was made after the PGR obtained new evidence from García Mena's arrest and prioritized the arrests of Cárdenas Guillén and Humberto García Ábrego. The increased surveillance in Miguel Alemán and Camargo forced several traffickers to flee and leave some rural communities in near abandonment. Local residents worried that with García Mena's capture, their communities would suffer economic hardship (specifically García Mena's laborers who worked at his properties). Municipal authorities countered these statements by saying that their communities had other means of economic production besides drug trafficking. In response to police-corruption allegations during García Mena's tenure, the government of Tamaulipas laid off 76 state police officers and 35 rural officers based in La Frontera Chica. The layoffs included a number of police chiefs suspected of protecting García Mena. The decision was requested by the PGR to investigate police involvement in organized crime. Between 2 and 6 June 2001, the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO, a former branch of the PGR) cracked down on the Gulf Cartel in Miguel Alemán, Ciudad Mier, Camargo and Reynosa with support from the PJF and the army. The UEDO had intelligence confirming the whereabouts of García Mena's associates José Manuel Garza Rendón (\\"La Brocha\\"), Medrano, and Cárdenas Guillén. However, the men escaped capture when security forces were delayed in obtaining search warrants and finalizing details of the raids. The raids were headed by PGR chief Santiago Vasconcelos, and the PGR said that security forces were closing in on cartel leaders and their arrests were imminent. Troops stationed in La Frontera Chica on 5 June 2001 conducted a number of raids in search of Alesio García Peña (\\"El Huarachón\\"), one of García Mena's henchmen and a suspected successor. Although two of his properties in Ciudad Mier were raided, they were unable to locate him. The Army also set up a checkpoint in front of López Falcón's ranch, without raiding it; however, they raided one of García Mena's ranches and seized of marijuana at a property in Guardados de Abajo. The PGR confirmed that the drugs were not tied to the trafficker for whom they were searching, and one person was arrested in the operation. The military also raided San Manuel, a ranch owned by García Mena's parents in Miguel Alemán, and confiscated two weapons. The operation lasted less than a day, and the federal troops returned to their barracks before midnight. On 26 June 2001, the Mexican government sent 200 troops to Tamaulipas in continued efforts against the Gulf Cartel. They mounted a checkpoint at Guardados de Abajo's only entrance, searching vehicles entering and leaving the town, and patrolled by car and on foot. García Mena's house was not raided. The military left Guardados de Abajo on 28 July.  Civilian and organized-crime reactions  The power vacuum left by García Mena's arrest triggered violence in northeastern Mexico and led to leadership changes in the Gulf Cartel. The PGR confirmed that García Mena's arrest did not reduce Gulf Cartel operations. Under him, the cartel had developed an organizational structure made up of criminal cells; the cells had regional leaders, and carried out criminal activities for the cartel. They often shared resources with other cells, including vehicles, routes, corrupt public officials, weapons and gunmen. The cell controlled by García Mena was one of the cartel's largest. In addition, the law-enforcement operations in Guardados de Abajo discomfited local residents (who called the crackdown excessive), a number of whom filed complaints with the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH). Some of the complaints cited forced disappearances. Amnesty International stated that CNDH officials reported that the military broke into people's houses and arbitrarily detained several residents; some of them were reportedly subject to torture and death threats. On 13 May 2001, several gunmen (presumably on García Mena's orders) stormed an arena in Guadalupe to kill López Falcón. According to investigators, García Mena believed that López Falcón betrayed him by giving authorities information on his whereabouts. On 30 October 2001, García Mena's henchmen attempted to kill López Falcón associate Peña Cuellar in Monterrey for allegedly providing authorities information leading to his arrest. Félix Alonso Fernández García, a journalist from Miguel Alemán, was murdered by unknown assailants on 19 January 2002. According to investigators, Fernández had accused mayor Rodríguez Barrera of supporting García Mena and traffickers based in La Frontera Chica. The journalist's bodyguards confirmed to police that Fernández had hired them after receiving death threats from the mayor. The perpetrators were never arrested, but investigators discovered cocaine in Fernández's vehicle (suggesting that he may have been involved in drug trafficking). On 31 October 2012, Rodríguez Barrera was murdered by gunmen as he entered his home in Miguel Alemán. He was under investigation in the U.S. for his alleged role in homicide and drug trafficking.  Imprisonment  After his arrest, García Mena was flown to Mexico City by Air Force personnel and taken into custody at the PGR facility in Mexico City. He was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (\\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico, on 10 April 2001. García Mena was escorted by about 100 soldiers and state police. Initially charged with drug trafficking, organized-crime involvement and illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms, he was assigned to judge Antonio González García from Toluca, State of Mexico. The other men arrested in Guardados de Abajo the week that García Mena entered custody were charged with the same crimes. On 9 May 2001, medical staff from La Palma gave him a personality test in which he admitted being involved in drug trafficking. García Mena walked investigators through his criminal background and gave them details of his past activities, including his introduction to the drug trade by his brother and his partnership with Cárdenas Guillén. He said that he had been involved in marijuana trafficking, but retired from that activity two years before his arrest. García Mena insisted that the narcotics seized in Guardados de Abajo during the operation leading to his arrest were not his, and he was a victim of defamation because of his previous activities. He told investigators that the narcotics belonged to his nephew, José Fernando Guerra García, a successor to the family business. In 2003, several prison guards confirmed that García Mena was housed with sixty-nine other inmates in Module 8, Section 2-B of Altiplano. The module also housed other high-ranking organized-crime figures, including Luis Amezcua Contreras, Jesús Labra Avilés, Óscar Malherbe de León, Hugo Baldomero Medina Garza, Miguel Caro Quintero, Alcides Ramón Magaña, Jesús Amezcua Contreras, Jesús Albino Quintero Meraz and Ismael Higuera Guerrero. In the module, García Mena was allowed four hours of recreation daily. The guards reported that despite his high profile, García Mena did not receive special treatment and ate the same food as the other inmates.  Trial  = First year = García Mena was defended during his trial by a number of different attorneys, including Juan Jesús Guerrero Chapa, Francisco Flores Iruegas, Jesús Solano Sánchez, and Américo Delgado de la Peña. He denied his firearms charges on 12 April 2001, but did not comment on the drug-trafficking and organized-crime-involvement charges since they were pending confirmation by a judge. On 17 April, judge José Ángel Mattar Oliva in Toluca charged García Mena with illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms. The judge dropped a charge of carrying a firearm when he was arrested, since it was not proven by the prosecution. In accordance with Mexican law, since García Mena was arrested at his home the weapons charges were split into two indictments. That day, he was also charged by Toluca-based judge Leopoldo Cerón Tinajero with organized-crime involvement and drug trafficking. The judge said that he was considering moving the case to a federal court in Tamaulipas for jurisdictional reasons. Cerón had transferred several suspects in García Mena's case to Tamaulipas because it had a maximum-security prison (like Altiplano), and the crimes had been committed in that state. The request was denied three months later, after a court ordered García Mena to be tried in Toluca. On 25 April 2001, the Congress of Tamaulipas unanimously agreed to order state attorney general Eduardo Garza Rivas to appear before legislators and speak about corruption allegations in the Tamaulipas State Police. After García Mena's arrest, the PGR began an investigation of police officers allegedly involved in Gulf Cartel operations. The investigation originated from videos and photographs found at García Mena's home linking him to mayor Rodríguez Barrera. Garza Rivas said that there were no clear indications of state-official collusion with the Gulf Cartel, but agreed to collaborate with the investigation. The congress stated that they would request access to the PGR's videos and photographs; because the files were in the possession of a federal agency, the congress required PGR approval. That day, the PGR confirmed that they were also investigating Nuevo León attorney general José Santos González Suárez and deputy attorney general César Cantú García for possible ties to García Mena. According to PGR head Rafael Macedo de la Concha, every public official related to García Mena's case would be asked to appear at the attorney general's offices for questioning; this included federal officials and members of the military. On 1 May 2001, the Public Registry of Property and Commerce (RPPC) said that the PGR had not issued them a judicial order to seize García Mena's properties. In order to take ownership of his properties, the PGR had to get approval from a judge. On 21 May, Mattar Oliva charged García Mena with drug possession and marijuana transportation (pending charges against him in the state of Guerrero). The judge dismissed an additional drug-transportation charge. According to the PGR witness Arnulfo Garza Silva, García Mena offered him US$2 million to move drugs from Zihuatanejo to Miguel Alemán. However, the judge rejected his testimony because of his description of García Mena as a light-skinned man in his twenties (which did not match his age and complexion). On 26 July 2001, his defense team registered a complaint against Cerón that the judge was unfair to their client. According to the team, Cerón did not carefully weigh the evidence against García Mena and swiftly convicted him of organized-crime involvement and illegal possession of firearms. García Mena complained that an unnamed member of the court prevented him from speaking with his attorneys during a hearing, violating his constitutional rights. On 3 October 2001, a State of Mexico court charged García Mena with organized-crime involvement, illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms, drug trafficking, providing financial support to drug-trafficking activities, and for having a supervisory and promotional role in drug-trafficking activities. The court acquitted him of marijuana trafficking and transportation, but said that he would remain in prison on the other charges. = Following years = García Mena's defense appealed the use of protected witnesses at the trial on 4 November 2002, saying that protected witnesses were used unfavorably by the prosecution. His defense asked judge José Manuel Quintero Montes on 28 November to move his case to a court in Nuevo León, because their client had a pending 1989 charge in Monterrey which was linked to one of his charges in the State of Mexico. PGR prosecutor Otilia Moreno Ramirez appealed the defense's transfer request, saying that a transfer to a Nuevo León prison would pose a security threat and a flight risk. According to the PGR, the pending Monterrey charge was unrelated to his State of Mexico charges. Ninfa Delia Domínguez Leal, the former head of Nuevo León's state penitentiaries, said that García Mena's transfer was unlikely to be approved because Nuevo León did not have a maximum-security prison. The defense request was denied by a federal court, and García Mena remained in Altiplano. On 3 March 2003, a State of Mexico court dropped six of the seven drug charges after deciding that the prosecution had not proven its case. According to the court, the prosecution only proved marijuana possession; the PGR claims that García Mena was guilty of knowingly reinvesting drug proceeds and of drug trafficking with intent to sell, distribute, import, and export were unproven. Although the prosecution tried to have it reviewed, the court confirmed that the decision was final. García Mena remained imprisoned in Altiplano because he had a pending drug- trafficking charge in Nuevo León and a firearms charge in the State of Mexico. Federal authorities raided an alcohol business owned by García Mena's sister, Evangelina, in Miguel Alemán on 22 May as a suspected money-laundering front. Federal authorities announced on 13 January 2005 that they were going to question García Mena for the murder of Sinaloa Cartel member Arturo Guzmán Loera (\\"El Pollo\\"), who was executed by an Altiplano inmate. According to investigators, they would also question Cárdenas Guillén and Tijuana Cartel leader Benjamín Arellano Félix. Although it was initially suspected that the murder was ordered by the Gulf Cartel leadership, investigators later concluded that it was planned by the Juárez Cartel as revenge for the murder of clan member Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes the year before. On 15 January, García Mena's defense issued a recurso de amparo in a Toluca court to prevent their client from being transferred to another Mexican prison (the government was transferring groups of high-profile criminals due to strikes and murders in Altiplano). García Mena's defense alleged that the transfer would ensure poor treatment and keep him in solitary confinement. On 18 January, a court confirmed that he would remain in Altiplano.  Convictions  On 30 May 2003, García Mena was found guilty of illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms and was sentenced to eight years in prison. His organized-crime involvement and drug trafficking were pending when he was convicted, and he also had charges pending in Matamoros and Toluca. At trial, García Mena was deemed a criminal of mid-tier menace but he was denied several legal benefits because of the seriousness of his conviction. He was also fined MXN$4,500. Prosecutor Carlos Javier Vega Memije said that the PGR were unhappy because the court did not include his drug-trafficking and organized-crime-involvement charges in the conviction, and would appeal the decision. On 30 June 2003, State of Mexico judge Andrés Pérez Lozano charged García Mena with money laundering – specifically, with conspiracy to invest and acquire properties with illegal funds. The charge originated from an investigation which began in Tamaulipas on 22 April; García Mena bought a ranch to grow sorghum and other agricultural plants, a country estate with an event center and two houses, and deposited funds in multiple bank accounts. Investigators said that García Mena used his wife, Laura Nallely Hinojosa Martínez, as a strawperson. According to the indictment, García Mena laundered MXN$19.7 million and nearly US$50,000. Peña Cuellar was also indicted along with García Mena and his wife. On 2 November 2003, Hinojosa Martínez accused the GAFE of illegally raiding her home and destroying personal property. On 30 July 2004, an association of ranchers in Tamaulipas notified the court that García Mena was not a registered member; his defense had claimed that García Mena was a businessman and rancher to demonstrate that he was not involved in drug trafficking. On 19 April 2007, a Nuevo León court sentenced him to 16 years and one month in prison for possession and transportation of six tons of marijuana. This charge was part of the pending 1989 investigation in Nuevo León. On 1 September 2007, State of Mexico judge Octavio Bolaños Valadez sentenced García Mena to 54 years and nine months in prison for organized-crime involvement, illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms, and drug trafficking. The drug- trafficking charge was marijuana possession with intent to distribute. He was also ordered to pay MXN$549,244 (approximately US$48,600 in 2007) in fines. Four of García Mena's associates were also found guilty of the same charges, and received 19 to 33 years in prison. On 1 March 2008, State of Mexico judge Rafael Zamudio Arias reduced García Mena's sentence to 43 years and nine months for drug trafficking and illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms after his defense appealed the sentence. The Federal Judicature Council (CJF) said that the court had confirmed that he was a drug-trafficking leader in Guardados de Abajo and responsible for safeguarding marijuana loads through his associates. The court also found four of García Mena's associates guilty of drug trafficking and/or illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms, and sentenced them to 15 to 24 years in prison. García Mena was ordered to pay MXN$281,925 in fines. He requested a recurso de amparo in 2010, saying that he was subject to torture and negligence while receiving medical attention. = Release and aftermath = State of Mexico judge Carlos Sáinz Martínez overturned García Mena's March 2008 conviction on 21 January 2014, ruling that the property raids which led to his 2001 arrest did not meet all the requirements of Article 16 of the Constitution of Mexico and Article 61 of the Federal Criminal Procedure Code. The court also determined that one person who testified against García Mena was questioned by an unqualified person, making his evidence inadmissible. This decision was made after García Mena's defense appealed his conviction, saying that his right to due process was violated when he was arrested. He was released from prison because his arrest was determined to have violated Mexican federal law. The other detainees who were arrested and convicted for collaborating with García Mena in 2001 were also expected to appeal their convictions. On 29 May 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (S.D. Tex.) indicted 16 suspected members of the Gulf Cartel who operated a marijuana ring in south Texas and the greater Houston area. Among those indicted was a man listed as Gilberto Mena García (\\"El Yune\\"), who was described as a Mexican national in his sixties, but the prosecution did not confirm if he was García Mena. According to the DEA and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), who headed the investigation, the suspects were involved in a conspiracy with intent to distribute of marijuana. If convicted, Mena García faces 10 years to life imprisonment and US$4 million in fines. He was also charged with drug possession with intent to distribute , which carries penalties of 5 to 40 years in prison and US$2 million in fines. The proceeds of the marijuana operation were used to buy properties in the Texas counties of Hidalgo, Starr, and Montgomery.

The principal work was intended to cover the history of the world from the beginning until the time of the Ceasars, focused on Greece and her rulers, nations and peoples, and it was from this base that Justin created his Epitome, slimming it down by focusing on \\"whatever [parts] was most worthy of being known\\" and removing parts which \\"were neither attractive for the pleasure of reading, nor necessary by way of example\\", resulting in a work approximately one-sixth the length of the original and described as a \\"capricious anthology\\" rather than a regular epitome. Despite its altered nature, the work stands as an important piece of history, both as a connection to the sole pre-Christian work of world history written in Latin and as one of the few written sources into several notable Hellenistic figures. Origin With virtually nothing known about the author the origin of the work is much disputed. It is believed to have been written in Rome due to a section in the preface where Justin writes that he had composed the work \\"during the leisure that I enjoyed in the city\\". Dating the work, however, is much harder. The commonly attributed date is that of the late 2nd Century or early 3rd Century AD, with the work having been written no later than 226/227, as after this date the rise of the Sassanian Empire would have made the last chapter on the Parthians obsolete. Some scholars disagree, posing arguments based on a linguistic analysis of the text that the work was written much later, in the 4th Century, noting that as an epitome written by a non-historian the fact that work would be partially obsolete by that point does not rule out such a possibility. Composition The composition of the work is complicated due to its epitomized nature, with some elements coming from Trogus and the rest from Justin, and determining whom a particular element belongs to is difficult due to the loss of the principal. This complexity leads to issues when determining who influenced the work of Justin, as it can often be difficult to tell whether connections between the Epitome and earlier works are due to Justin being influenced by those works, or by those works being influence by Trogus. =Language= The work is written in a blend of Latin and Late Latin, with the Latin being generally attributed to elements that Justin transcribed more directly from Trogus, and with the Late Latin occurring in sections that were more original. =Influence of Tacitus= Analysis of the Epitome has led scholars to see a connection, through the similarity of metre and content within selected sections, between the work of Justin and that of the earlier Tacitus. This connection has been used as proof that Tacitus was a major influence on the work of Justin, but recent scholarship has disputed this assumption, and instead arguments have been presented attempting to show that Tacitus was influenced by Trogus, in style and through the use of Trogus' work as a historical reference, and this influence was what caused the connection between the works. However, this scholarship does not rule out the possibility that there is also a Tacitian influence on the Epitome. =Vulgate Tradition= The books focusing on Alexander are written in the Vulgate Tradition, and sourced through Trogus from the lost History of Alexander by Cleitarchus and as such are considered inaccurate due to Cleitarchus' focus on entertainment over accuracy, compounded by Justin's own focus on the same. Structure and theme The Epitome is structured in the same manner as the principal, split into forty- four different books, with the addition of a preface. Each of these books focus on an aspect of world and Grecian history, with specific focus on Alexander the Great, his rise to power and the events transpiring after his death. The principal's theme was that of imperium, the right of the monarch to rule, with Trogus' tracing the passage from one king to another, from one empire to another, and presenting kings as being essential for the well-being of the state, while Justin focused his work on the theme of moral learning. This was a common theme at the time, and a statement expounding that the work was to focus on such is often found in historical prefaces, as it is in this work. In order to meet this theme Justin takes the expansive accounts of Trogus and modifies them, but in doing so has made himself an unreliable tertiary source on the depicted events, and the \\"poorest representative\\" of the now-lost secondary sources of the events. Despite this alteration and the inclusion of Justin's own theme, much of Trogus' focus did filter through Justin, and so in the Epitome there remains a strong theme of imperium and moderation. Account of Alexander Much of the work focuses on the events surrounding the rise of Alexander and Greece, and the successor states arising from it. As one of only five surviving major accounts of Alexander the Epitome, despite its flaws, provides an important insight into these events. In particular, it provides important insights into his father, and the namesake of the work, Phillip II, with Justin being one of just two surviving narrative sources, alongside the earlier Diodorus. Unfortunately, the extent of these insights is minimized by Justin's limited interest in a comprehensive history, and so while Trogus is believed to have gone into significant detail about the conquests of Philip, Justin simply states \\"And so he established one kingdom and one people out of many clans and nations\\". The Epitome also provides an account of Alexander's death, attributing it to his companion Antipater, who upon seeing the immoderation of Alexander, took it upon himself to poison him, with a poison so strong that it \\"could be conveyed [only] in the hoof of a horse\\". This interpretation is disputed by most historians, and instead this is likely to be a transference of the themes of Trogus, where immoderation was seen as an unfit attribute, and a direct cause of the loss of imperium. Reception The work was very popular at the time of its release, quickly overtaking the principal to the extent that most of what we know about the principal is from the Epitome. It continued to be popular in the middle ages, from which period over two hundred copies survive. This popularity was maintained through the Renaissance, with editions being among the earlier generations of printed books, but started to lose popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries, when its reliability was called into question, culminating in a 115-year gap between English translations.

GUG is known for representing the needs and problems of Gozitan youths and students on campus, mainly in the University of Malta, where there are over 900 Gozitan students (10% of all the university students).  Activism  In September 2016, GUG met with Alfred Sant, former Prime Minister of Malta and current MEP and the Gozo Youth Council who expressed their concerns on the depopulation of Gozo, point out at the lack of employment opportunities in Gozo. In early November 2016, GUG called for a revival of the Gozo University Campus in Xewkija, stating that the development of the campus is always put aside. On 23 September 2017, GUG said that Gozitan students were being priced out of the rental market and forced to cross over to Malta every day.

The first observation facilities were provided in 1815 to the newly appointed professor Christopher Hansteen of the recently established Royal Frederick University (which was renamed the University of Oslo in 1939) in an octagonal shack at Akershus Festning, Christiania. Construction began in 1831 on a larger observatory which also could house Hansteen and his family. At its completion in 1833 it became the first building to have been erected by the university. = An Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics = Svein Rosseland, about 1935 The Observatory's final director, professor Svein Rosseland (appointed in 1928) did not consider its future to be promising. In a letter to a colleague, he wrote, He visited the Harvard College Observatory in 1929, and accepted a professorship there. However, rector Sem Sæland of the University of Oslo saw this as a great loss, as Rosseland already had become an internationally renowned scientist at the time. Sæland coordinated a political effort in which Rosseland was offered to manage an astronomical fund provided by the state, prospects of new university facilities, and was promised a general renovation of the observatory. Rosseland accepted, and returned to Oslo in 1930. He then contacted Niels Bohr in Copenhagen who recently had founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics for inspiration and his level plans. Rosseland concluded that the director should reside at the institute. In his opinion, work did not comply with working hours, and the director should always be available. An architectural competition was announced, and the winning design was sent to the Rockefeller Foundation. His proposal of an institute of theoretical astrophysics did not exist elsewhere in the world at the time. The foundation replied 15 April 1931, granting him 105,000 dollars to erect the institute and 15,000 dollars to obtain scientific equipment. The architectural firm of Finn Bryn and Johan Fredrik Ellefsen designed the building for Rosseland at Blindern campus in Oslo. It opened 1 July 1934 and was named Svein Rosselands hus (lit. the house of Svein Rosseland). The building is a striking example of functionalism, unlike the nearby building for physics and chemistry which originally was designed in neoclassical style. Both scientists and the library was moved from the observatory to the new premises. The two first floors and the basement were purposed for research and teaching, and Rosseland himself resided in the upper three floors. A plaque honoring the Rockefeller Foundation can be found near the entrance. In the early days, the institute housed Rosseland himself, his assistant Gunnar Randers, two of the founders of modern meteorology: retired Norwegian dean of science Vilhelm Bjerknes and professor Halvor Solberg, as well as Carl Størmer, a mathematics professor who also studied the northern lights. Rosseland's international recognition led to visits from prominent scientists such as Martin Schwarzschild. = Instruments, Observatories and Telescopes = The institute housed the Oslo Analyzer in its basement between 1934 and 1954. It was the most powerful differential analyzer in the world for four years after its creation. Key pieces were buried in the garden behind the institute during WW2 to prevent the machine from being used by the nazis. The institute had its own solar observatory outside Oslo between 1954 and 1987, the Harestua Solar Observatory. It has been used for science educational purposes after ceasing to exist as a research facility. A subsequent telescope was proposed, the Large European Solar Telescope. After a completion of an initial scientific requirement analysis in 1982, a legal body was formed in 1983. The telescope was however never realized. Solar physicists at ITA have routinely been using the Swedish Solar Telescope since it saw first light in 2002. The institute contributed to, and made use of, the solar imager High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph of the Naval Research Laboratory which was launched on rockets and flew once with the space shuttle between 1975 and 1985. The space-borne Solar and Heliospheric Observatory was launched in 1995. The institute provided the ground test system and computers. In 1988, the Nordic Optical Telescope at La Palma was opened. It was co-funded by Norway and is used by astronomers at ITA. The works of the former celestial mechanics research group at the institute were instrumental in determining the path ESA's Rosetta spacecraft would take when approaching its target, the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in 2014. The institute lead the Norwegian contributions to the Planck mission of ESA until its final release of results in 2018. Scientists at the institute were instrumental in analyzing the resulting maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). = A Center of Excellence = The solar physics group at the institute was granted status as a Norwegian Centre of Excellence in 2017 for the period 2017–2027 under the direction of Mats Carlsson. = Directors = Christopher Hansteen in the 1870s *Christopher Hansteen (1834–61) *Carl Frederik Fearnley (1861–90) *Hans Geelmuyden (1890–1919) *Jens Fredrik Schroeter (1919–27) *Svein Rosseland (1928–35 at the observatory, 1935–1965 at ITA) *Mats Carlsson (1997–2003 (?)) *Per Barth Lilje (2003–12) *Viggo Hansteen (2013–17) *Per Barth Lilje (2017–)  Research  The institute is engaged in various fields of theoretical, observational and numerical astrophysics. The cosmology group is engaged in analysis of data from cosmic microwave background-related experiments such as CORE, GreenPol, LiteBIRD, PASIPHAE, QUIET and SPIDER. The group is also researching the nature of the cosmological accelerating expansion and the nature of dark matter, both through theoretical and numerical investigations into modifying general relativity as well as the future Euclid mission of ESA. The extragalactic astronomy group is organized under the cosmology group. Its scientists use both simulations of galaxy formations, radiative transfer simulations, and observations of gravitationally lensed galaxies to understand and investigate the Universe beyond our own galaxy. Observations are carried out with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope among others. The group is also a key player in the COMAP carbon monoxide intensity mapping experiment. The Rosseland Centre for Solar Physics combines theory, numerics and observations to provide insights into the solar atmosphere. It is regarded as one of the world's foremost solar physics research institutions. With an allocated amount of 115 million CPU hours in 2018, it also is the most data intensive research group in Norway. The institute hosts the European data center for data from the Hinode satellite. It has an in-house developed 3D numerical model of the solar atmosphere called Bifrost. Besides using the Swedish Solar Telescope and Hinode for solar observations, the group also makes use of the space-borne Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), the Solar Dynamics Observatory as well as the ground-based Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).  The Almanac of Norway  The official almanac of Norway has been published since 1644. After the dissolution of the Denmark-Norway union in 1814, the almanac has been edited in Norway. In 1814, it was edited by the Danish astronomer Thomas Bugge. Christopher Hansteen became editor in 1815 and remained so until 1862. Directors and astronomers at the Observatory and ITA have been editing it ever since.

In 1940 the church was severely damaged by a German bombs and after 1968 it was demolished. Maltby Street Market is a weekly street-food and provisions market in Bermondsey, southeast London, England. The market is located on a street of the same name near Tower Bridge in the old Horselydown parish of Bermondsey. As a riparian borough adjacent to Shad Thames and the London Docks Bermondsey has had a long heritage of involvement in the merchant marine and allied trades. The now enclosed River Neckinger passes a few yards from the southern end of the market walk where a diverted conduit of the river is remembered in the name of Millstream road. Maltby Street itself was the approximate site of a ropewalk belonging to Robert Rich and the name has carried over, in the name of the market yard, to the present day. The viaduct at London Bridge railway station in 1836 Local area LASSCO Ropewalk Timber Yard on Maltby Street. The area around Maltby street has historically been constituted of a mixture of workers housing, light industrial units, warehouses and small manufactories and was the traditional location of leather tanneries and rope walks for the making of rigging and cable for shipping in the age of sail. Within half a mile of Maltby Street Market there are a number of built relics of London's industrial heritage. These include Bevington & Sons Neckinger Mills, the Sarsons vinegar factory of 1814, The Leathersellers College of 1909, Hepburn and Gale's tannery complex, the Alaska buildings and the Anchor Brewery at Tower Bridge among many others. The railway arches which run the length of the market were built between 1836 and 1839 for the London and Greenwich Railway, the capital's first steam railway and the earliest elevated railway in the world. The line still carries Southeastern trains at regular intervals From London Bridge to Greenwich and the wider South East. After the removal of the Islington's Caledonian Market to Bermondsey Square in 1950 many of the small warehouses and railway arches around Maltby Street were taken up by antiques and furniture dealers. Subsequently the rezoning of the area to permit the construction new dwellings has led to the dispersal and replacement of these small warehouses with housing stock and an alteration of the character of the area giving it a mixed-residential neighbourhood feel. The market itself occupies a narrow private yard belonging to LASSCO, a long established salvage and reclamation company specialising in reclaimed floorboards. The space was first offered as a site for the fledgling food market in 2009 as a way of utilising the salvage yard on quiet weekends. The Market now runs the length of the LASSCO yard every weekend with the firm packing away its reclaimed timber and machinery on Friday to make way for the market stalls. Creation of Maltby Street Market Maltby Street Market was born in 2009 from a dispute between the Borough Market trustees and traders unhappy with rising rents and a perceived decline in quality at the ancient London Bridge institution. Initially, nine traders moved the mile from Borough High Street to Maltby Street. The market has changed and developed since then and now includes up to 30 traders at any one time with a steady cycle of new traders coming and going as decided by the constituted Market authorities. Many of the original 'rogue traders' who first parted ways with Borough Market have subsequently moved yet further down the railway line to Spa Terminus and created a food production and distribution centre on that site. Rope Walk yard on Maltby Street in 1997, the current site of the market. The Market is made up of various gourmet street food vendors with an emphasis on diversity and quality. Foods from all over the world are cooked and created fresh on-site and offered up to passing customers. The market has achieved both popular and critical acclaim with large crowds of locals and visitors attending weekly and diverse publications advertising the quality of the food on offer.
