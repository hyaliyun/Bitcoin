These microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, viruses and bacteriophages. The bacterial part of the microbiota has been more closely studied. It consists of a core of nine genera: Prevotella, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera, Veillonella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. They are aerobes as well as anaerobes and aerotolerant bacteria. The microbial communities are highly variable in particular individuals and compose of about 140 distinct families. The bronchial tree for instance contains a mean of 2000 bacterial genomes per cm2 surface. The harmful or potentially harmful bacteria are also detected routinely in respiratory specimens. The most significant are Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. They are known to cause respiratory disorders under particular conditions namely if the human immune system is impaired. The mechanism by which they persist in the lower airways in healthy individuals is unknown. The fungal genera that are commonly found make up the lung mycobiome, in the microbiota of the lung, and include Candida, Malassezia, Neosartorya, Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus, among others. Role of the epithelial barrier The airway epithelium together with alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells play a major role in the initial recognition of bacterial products getting into the lower airways with the air. Since some of these products are potent proinflammatory stimuli it is extremely important for the immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-pathogenic commensals. This prevents the development of constant inflammation and forms tolerance against harmless microbiota. Mechanisms underlying inflammation. The airway epithelium has a complex structure consisting of at least seven diverse cell types interacting with each other by means of tight junctions. Epithelial cells can transmit immunostimulatory signals to underlying tissues taking part in the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immune response. The key transmitters of these signals are dendritic cells. Once pathogenic bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa) have activated particular pattern recognition receptors on/in epithelial cells, the proinflammatory signaling pathways are activated. This results mainly in IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 production. These cytokines induce chemotaxis to the site of infection in its target cells (e.g., neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages). On the other hand, representatives of standard microbiota induce only weak signals preventing inflammation. The mechanism of distinguishing between harmless and harmful bacteria on the molecular as well as on physiological levels is not completely understood. This process becomes much more intriguing when taking into account that commensals often share their surface molecules with pathogens. Epithelial cells are equipped with very sensitive recognition tools - toll like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) which recognize a broad variety of microbial structural components. After recognition of pathogenic bacteria proinflammatory pathways are activated and cellular components of the adaptive and innate immunity are recruited to the infection site. One key regulator in this process is NF-κB which translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and activates pro-inflammatory genes in epithelial cells and macrophages. The DNA-binding protein complex recognizes a discrete nucleotide sequence (5’-GGG ACT TTC T-3’) in the upstream region of a variety of response genes. The activation of NF-κB by a number of stimuli: bacterial cell walls or inflammatory cytokines results in its translocation to the nucleus. In contrast, harmless bacteria do not cause the translocation of NF- κB into the nucleus thus preventing the inflammation although they can express the same microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). One possible mechanism explaining this effect was suggested by Neish showing that non-pathogenic S. typhimurium PhoPc and S. pullorum are able to prohibit the ubiquitination of NF-κB inhibitor molecule nuclear factor of NF-κB light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IκB-κ). Another explanation of commensal tolerance of the epithelium refers to the post-translational modification of a protein by the covalent attachment of one or more ubiquitin (Ub) monomers. The inhibition of ubiquitination leads to reduction of inflammation, because only polyubiquitinated (IκB-κ is targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, allowing NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and activation the transcription of effector genes (for example IL-8). Probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacilli are able to modulate the activity of the Ub-proteasome system via inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in epithelial cells. In mammalian cells, ROS have been shown to serve as critical second messengers in multiple signal transduction pathways in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Bacterially induced ROS causes oxidative inactivation of the catalytic cysteine residue of Ub 12 resulting in incomplete but transient loss of cullin-1 neddylation and consequent effects on NF-κB and β-catenin signaling. Another commensal species, B. thetaiotaomicron, attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by promoting nuclear export of NF-κB subunit RelA, through a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ)-dependent pathway. PPAR-γ target transcriptionally active Rel A and induce early nuclear clearance limiting the duration of NF-κB action. The balance between pathogens and commensals is extremely important in the maintenance of homeostasis in the respiratory tract. Physiology The airways are continually exposed to a multitude of microorganisms, some of which are able to persist and even colonize respiratory tract. This is possible due to the presence of nutrients, oxygen, and optimal growth temperature. There are several host-derived nutrient sources for microbial residents: secretions from airway epithelial cells (especially goblet cells), secretions from submucosal glands and transudate from plasma. Moreover, the pool of available nutrients is increased by the activities of some members of the microbiota. Macromolecular components of respiratory secretions (proteins, glycoproteins, lipids, nucleic acids) are converted to nutrients (e.g. carbohydrates, amino acids). Thus, the metabolic activity of present bacteria allow for the colonization of new species. The commensal bacteria are nonpathogenic and defend our airways against the pathogens. There are several possible mechanisms. Commensals are the native competitors of pathogenic bacteria, because they tend to occupy the same ecological niche inside the human body. Secondly, they are able to produce antibacterial substances called bacteriocins which inhibit the growth of pathogens. Genera Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Streptomyces are the main producers of bacteriocins in respiratory tract. Moreover, commensals are known to induce Th1 response and anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10, antimicrobial peptides, FOXP3, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) production. Clinical significance Changes in microbial community composition seem to play a role in progression of such pulmonary disorders as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis. In humans, S. aureus is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract, and on skin and in the gut mucosa. S. aureus, along with similar species that can colonize and act symbiotically but can cause disease if they begin to take over the tissues they have colonized or invade other tissues, have been called \\"pathobionts\\". MRSA can similarly colonize people without making them sick. The presence of such genera as Mycoplasma, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus is correlated with stable COPD state. On the other hand, Prevotella, Mesorhizobium, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Veillonela, Rhizobium, Stenotrophomonas, and Lactococcus present mostly in healthy individual cohort. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria is increased in asthmatic children. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia are found most often in cystic fibrosis patients. High-throughput sequencing and the whole genome sequencing approaches will provide the further information about the complexity and physiological implication of commensal bacteria in the lower respiratory tract.

Developed by Bluepoint Games, who assisted in the remastering alongside SCE Japan Studio and its division Team Ico, the bundle provides support for high-definition monitors, higher frame rates, stereoscopic 3D, and additional features for the PlayStation Network. The two games, while fundamentally different in gameplay and story, are thematically connected, with Shadow of the Colossus considered a spiritual sequel to Ico. Both games were critically acclaimed on their original release, while the remastered collection itself was praised by reviewers. Games Within Ico, the player controls a boy named Ico, cursed by being born with horns on his head, and locked away in a remote empty castle by his village. Ico manages to free himself and comes across a young frail girl, Yorda, who is chased by shadowy creatures that try to drag her to a different realm. Ico helps Yorda escape, ultimately discovering that her mother is the Queen that resides in the castle and is trying to use Yorda to extend her own life. Shadow of the Colossus is considered a spiritual sequel to Ico, and later stated by its creator, Fumito Ueda, to be a prequel set in the same world as Ico. The player controls a young man named Wander seeking to bring life back to the body of Mono, a woman that he cared for, by completing the task of killing sixteen monolithic beasts that wander the landscape. With his horse Agro, Wander locates each lair and destroys the beasts, slowly being overcome with dark energy, but fueled by the opportunity to reunite with Mono. Remastered features The core game and story for both Ico (2001) and Shadow of the Colossus (2005) remain unchanged with the remastered versions. For the remastering, both games have had a graphical overhaul to allow them to support modern high-definition displays up to 1080p. With the more powerful PlayStation 3, both games feature a fixed frame rate of 30 frames per second; the original PlayStation 2 version of Shadow of the Colossus was noted for pushing the limits of the older console and often suffered from framerate losses. Both games support stereoscopic 3D, taking advantage of the original design of the games with considerations towards depth-of-field viewing, as evidenced by the large landscapes. Both games in the collection support 7.1 surround sound. Icos remastering is based on the European version, which features additional content that did not make it into the North America release of the original game, as well as some altered puzzles from these original releases. Specifically, upon completing the game, the player can restart to see the English translations of the mysterious language that Yorda, the player character's companion, uses, and a two-player mode with the second player in control of Yorda. Though there was consideration for inclusion of PlayStation Move motion control support, it was not released with it. The collection includes bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and Ueda's next game, The Last Guardian. Development Prior to the announcement of the Collection, two other remastered collections of PlayStation 2 games had been made for the PlayStation 3: the God of War collection, and the Sly Cooper collection. There had been strong interest by Fumito Ueda, the project lead for both Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, to prepare such a collection for the Team Ico games. Initially, Ueda was not \\"too excited\\" about porting the games, given that they were designed specifically for the PlayStation 2 hardware. Ueda also noted that such a conversion may be difficult due to the complexities Team Ico had to create to push the technical limits of the PlayStation 2, but felt that it was still possible. As the PlayStation 3 became more popular, and PlayStation 2 consoles became rare, Ueda reconsidered his position on giving players of other consoles the opportunity to play these games. Ueda noted that such a release would depend on Sony's executives. Work on the conversion for the collection was done by Bluepoint Games, who had previously performed the remastering for the God of War collection. The staff of Team Ico assisted in the process. Ueda considered Bluepoint Games \\"real craftsmen\\" in this porting effort, due to their understanding of the fundamentals of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus and passion for the games. Though it was Team Ico's idea originally to provide stereoscopic 3D, Ueda praised Bluepoint for their work in fine tuning the 3D effect, taking advantage of the scale and camera provided by the existing games; Ueda stated that the developers \\"made it into something beyond what I imagined\\". Team Ico considered adding new game content to both games. One example Ueda noted was adding in several colossi that were cut from the PlayStation 2 version of Shadow of the Colossus. Ultimately, Ueda and the team decided not to make any such content-oriented changes or additions, concerned that they might be considered \\"half-baked\\" by players, and instead opted to stay \\"faithful to the base work\\". The collection was formally announced at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show. In the months prior, the collection's existence was hinted at by industry rumors and appearances of the collection in online vendor catalogs. In North America and Europe/PAL regions, the two games were released as a single collection. This version features a reversible cover insert, with the original PlayStation 2 cover art for both games on the inner side of the case. Because of the criticism of Icos original North American cover art, the North American version of the collection used the European/Japanese cover by Ueda. However, bilingual copies from Canada do not include the reversible artwork, they have a blank white interior. In Japan, they were released as separate titles, though retailers sold a boxed collector's set containing both games and additional material. Reception The collection received strong positive praise from critics on release, based on the original titles as well as on the improvements made in the high definition port. During the week of its release, the game was the top selling game across all platforms in both North American and Japan, based on sales data from Amazon.com.

The aircraft lost control and crashed shortly after lift- off. The plane was on its way to Nashville International Airport, taking the team to play the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the crash on the pilot's failure to remove gust locks on the right aileron and the rudder before takeoff, as well as an overloaded baggage compartment. The NTSB report said that the plane might have been able to stay airborne had only one of the problems existed. As it was, the extra baggage shifted the plane's center of gravity to the back end, and the locked rudder and aileron made it impossible to control the overweight aircraft. The only member of the Purple Aces who did not die in the crash was David Furr; he was out for the season with an ankle injury and thus was not on the plane that day. But just two weeks after the crash, Furr and his younger brother Byron were killed in a car accident near Newton, Illinois, leaving the entire 1977 Evansville team dead.

Dutch Indies literature or Dutch East Indies literature (Dutch: Indische letteren or Nederlands Indische literatuur, Indonesia: Sastra Hindia Belanda) is the Dutch language literature of colonial and post-colonial Indonesia from the Dutch Golden Age to the present day. It includes Dutch, Indo-European and Indonesian authors. Its subject matter thematically revolves around the VOC and Dutch East Indies eras, but also includes the postcolonial discourse. Even though the socio-economic environment of the Dutch East Indies' colonial society was not particularly conducive to literary pursuits an influential Dutch literary subgenre developed described as follows: > [...] a descriptive quality about them in the way they treated ordinary > aspects of life in the Indies. This set them for ever apart from those > writings in Europe, even if the language was still Dutch. It was this > backdrop, or decor, that was different. The idea that whilst the language > was Dutch, the scene, the scenery, everything was somehow different. This > sense of the different permeated all that was written, even if their own > (authors) reference point was still a belief that they were part of the > metropolitan literary tradition. :—Ian Campbell, Sydney University, 2000. > ASAA Conference 2000 panel paper. Most masterpieces in this genre have international appeal and have been translated to English. In December 1958 for instance American Time magazine praised the translation of Maria Dermoût's The Ten Thousand Things, and named it one of the best books of the year.Note: Among several (other) iconic literary works of 1958: 'Breakfast at Tiffany´s' by Truman Capote, 'Doctor Zhivago' by Pasternak and 'Lolita' by Nabokov. See: Maria Dermout Website. Since 1985 academic working groups on Dutch Indies literature have existed in the Netherlands and the USA.

The most important American literary professor specialised in Dutch Indies literature was E.M.Beekman (1939-2008), who spent his early childhood in the Dutch East Indies, and was associated with the University of Massachusetts. Biography E.M.Beekman by Chase Publishing. With the support of the 'Translations Program' of the 'National Endowment for the Humanities', the 'Foundation for the Promotion of the Translation of Dutch Literary Work', and the 'Prince Bernhard Fund', Beekman has edited many translations of Dutch Indies literature and published widely on the topic.University of Massachusetts Amherst - Library of the Indies In recent years the University of California, Berkeley has shown particular interest in the Dutch Indies subject matter. Berkeley professor J. Dewulf is now a driving force behind further study and deepening of existing knowledge with initiatives such as the 'Amerindo Research Project'Amerindo Website, UC Berkeley. and the 2011 'International Conference on Colonial and Post-Colonial Connections in Dutch Literature'.Quote: \\"...the Dutch language forms a common bond in a literature that was and is deeply marked by intercultural connections. In recent decades, considerable attention has been given to Dutch colonial and post-colonial literature, but the importance of intercultural connections within the Dutch colonial network has been neglected.\\" See: 'International Conference on Colonial and Post-Colonial Connections in Dutch Literature.'

Indo European authors E. du Perron Seventy-five percent of the Dutch speaking community in the Dutch East Indies were so called Indo-Europeans, i.e. Eurasians belonging to the European legal class. Although most published work was written by full blooded Dutchmen, so called 'Totoks', many Indo authors have also written Dutch Indies literature covering a vast array of topics. While Louis Couperus wrote about the upper class elite, Victor Ido wrote about the lower class paupers. After the Indo diaspora from the former Dutch East Indies (now: Indonesia) Indo authors have mostly contributed to the postcolonial discourse of a.o. identity formation. =List of Indo authors= A considerable number of authors of Dutch Indies literature are Indo-European i.e. Dutch-Indonesian Eurasians. Authors include: * Louis Couperus (1863–1923) * Victor Ido (1869–1948) * Ernest Douwes Dekker (1879–1950) * Maria Dermoût (1888–1962) * Edgar du Perron (1899–1940) * Beb Vuyk (1905–1991) * Rob Nieuwenhuys (1908–1999) Much of the postcolonial literary discourse has been written by second generation immigrant authors of Indo (Eurasian) descent. Authors include: * Adriaan van Dis (1946– ) * Ernst Jansz (1948– ) * Marion Bloem (1952– ) The most significant and influential author that studied postcolonial identity formation however is the avant garde and visionary writer Tjalie Robinson (1911–1974), a first generation repatriant. Indonesian authors During the \\"Dutch Ethical Policy\\" in the interbellum period of the first half of the twentieth century, indigenous authors and intellectuals from the Dutch East Indies came to the Netherlands to study and/or work. During their stay of some years they participated in and contributed to the Dutch literary system. They wrote literary works and published literature in important literary reviews such as Het Getij, De Gemeenschap, Links Richten and Forum and as such contributed to Dutch Indies literature. By exploring new literary themes and/or focusing on indigenous protagonists, they drew at the same time attention to indigenous culture and the indigenous plight. An early example was the Javanese prince and poet Noto Soeroto, a writer and journalist from the Dutch East Indies. He was not a radical Indonesian nationalist, but a supporter of the so-called association politics, which sought collaboration between the Dutch and the native peoples of the Dutch East Indies. Noto Soeroto came to the Netherlands to study Law in Leiden in 1910. He published in the avant-garde review Het Getij. His non-political poems were published in many volumes. They had exotic titles such as Melati-knoppen, Melati buds, De geur van moeders haarwrong, the odour/smell of mothers hair knot or Lotos of morgendauw, Lotos or morning dew. He wrote a famous brochure on Kartini, the Javanese princess and Indonesian national heroine, whose popular letters were published in 1912 and also contributed to Dutch Indies literature. Although Dutch had no formal status in the Dutch East Indies, among the indigenous elite of the colony many were fluent in the Dutch language. Authors include: Chairil Anwar; Soewarsih Djojopoespito; Noto Soeroto; Sutan Sjahrir; Kartini.

Deze klassieker uit onze koloniale literatuur is nog steeds te vinden in zichzelf respecterende bibliotheken.\\" Giebels, Lambert U oordeelt over Moeder Indonesia zelf (Historisch Nieuwsblad, 2011) Another historic piece is Sutan Sjahrir's political pamphlet Onze Strijd (Our Struggle) or his book Indonesische Overpeinzingen (Indonesian Musings) of 1945, which were first written in Dutch and only later translated to Indonesian and English.Note: 'Our Struggle', first written in the Dutch language and soon thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' in 1945. Indonesische Overpeinzingen was translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York, 1949.

It is considered a lost film. Plot The story revolved around a man innocently accused of murder. The film was divided into chapters: #The Home in a Garret. #A Dastardly Murder. #Foong Lee's Opium Den. #Great Motor Boat Chase in Sydney Harbour. Cast *Casper Middleton as the villain *Ronald Conway as the hero *E.B. Russell as Ayr Arnold *Evelyn St Jermyn as Aileen Ayr, the heroine Original novel The film was based on a novel by Arthur Wright who specialised in stories about horse racing. The story had been first serialised in a newspaper in 1910 and published in novel form a year later. It was one of his most popular books. =Plot= Two men, good friends, love the same woman. One of the men is successful – a squatter. He marries the woman and they have a daughter. Then the squatter accidentally kills his wife by a blow meant for his friend. Over the years the old squatter is tormented by remorse; the friend falls in love with the squatter's daughter, although she is in love with one of her father's shearers. =Reception= A contemporary critic called the book a \\"wild and woolly farrago of delinquencies and stupidities. To'outline the \\"plot\\" is practically impossible. The story drifts from one absurdity to another. There seems to be no possibility of rational connection between the events: there is certainly no emotional sentiment, no principle, no characterisation, no redeeming feature whatever in the crude production.\\" Nonetheless film rights were sold early. Production The film was made by the short lived Australian Film Syndicate in North Sydney. A sequence involved the Sydney Cup race. The AJC would not allow scenes to be shot at Randwick so the producer used Victoria Park. According to Wright: > It was decided to shoot tho Cup scene first. A grey — Fitz Merv, I think— > won the handicap which was to represent the race for the Sydney Cup, after > making a brilliant run in the straight from the rear of the field. This was > a tiny stroke of luck for the producer who thereupon secured a grey horse to > be used right through the picture, and when he was seen winning the Cup in > the final scene the fans went crazy with delight. The cinematographer, George Wilkins, later became a noted polar explorer under the name \\"Hubert\\". He had become cinematographer for the Australian Film Syndicate after Lacey Percival left the company to join the Australian Photo- Play Company.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 31. Reception According to Wright the film \\"paid its way well... packed with action and thrills, [it] drew the crowds... If it could be shown to-day [in 1931] lecturer and all, no doubt it would be the laugh of a life time.\\". A contemporary review said \\"the story abounds is dramatic situations, which culminate in a motor-boat chase down Sydney Harbour, the death of the villain, and a promise of future happiness for the lovers and their bright little son.

He grew up in West Auckland, New Zealand. He earned a master's degree at the Ardmore School of Engineering, then a PhD in physical metallurgy at the University of Illinois. Robinson was director of the DSIR's Physics and Engineering Laboratory between 1985 and 1991. He continued to invent and develop seismic isolation devices, travel and lecture until his early 70s. Life's work Robinson is most well known for his invention of the lead rubber bearing (LRB) seismic isolation device. He designed the LRB in 1974 while working as a scientist for DSIR (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Zealand). As he was a public service employee when he invented the device, the LRB patent was owned by the state. The LRB is used under more than US$100 billion worth of structures around the world, including New Zealand's Te Papa Tongarewa (National Museum of New Zealand), the new Wellington Hospital, Victoria University Library and Parliament Buildings. Most significant bridges in NZ use base isolation technology. LRBs are also under the Bhuj Hospital (India) and the C-1 building (Tokyo)—the largest building in the world that is protected by these devices. The Christchurch Women's Hospital is the only building in that city that uses LRBs and it was able to continue operating without any problems throughout the devastating earthquakes that occurred between September 2010 and June 2011. During the severe 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, the LRB-protected University of Southern California Teaching Hospital remained operational while the ten other hospitals in the area were so badly damaged that they had to be evacuated. The William Clayton building in Wellington, New Zealand, was the first in the world to be base isolated with LRBs. It was built by the then Ministry of Works and Development. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications Computer Centre came through the 1995 Kobe quake unscathed and remained fully operational. This significant building is one that is pointed to as an example of how the lead rubber bearing technology saves a building and its contents. Following the Kobe quake there was a large uptake of seismic isolation technology and in particular the Lead Rubber Bearing in Japan. The second region in which these devices have been well used is California, following the Los Angeles and Northridge earthquake in 1994. The first use of an LRB in the USA was in 1984. Base isolators have since been inserted under more than 100 bridges and 70 buildings in the USA. Building codes in that country require all new hospitals to implement base isolation technology to ensure that they can continue functioning after a major quake. In more recent years severe earthquakes in India and Turkey have generated interest in seismic isolation technology and many new buildings and bridges are being fitted with seismic isolation. The costs of using base isolation for large structures have been found to be recouped in only a few years as insurance premiums are reduced so dramatically. Robinson also invented the Roball and the Roglider base isolation systems for medium-weight and low rise buildings, and the Lead Extrusion Damper, among other seismic isolation devices. He was founder, director and chief engineer of the world-leading seismic engineering company Robinson Seismic Ltd., which continues to test and manufacture his devices. In 1993 Robinson was co-author of An Introduction to Seismic Isolation, along with Ivan Skinner and Graeme McVerry.Published by John Wiley & Sons, 1993, England. Life Robinson grew up in Auckland, where he attended Avondale College. After completing a master's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Auckland's Ardmore campus, between 1958 and 1961, Robinson completed a PhD in Physical Metallurgy at the University of Illinois between 1962 and 1965, his thesis titled \\"High Temperature Internal Friction (Damping) in Potassium Chloride\\". During his time at Illinois, he spent a summer learning German so that he could complete the necessary reading for his research topic, due to the fact that a lot of important material in the field was published only in German. Following this he spent a short time as a research fellow in physics at the University of Sussex, from 1966 until 1967. After returning to New Zealand in 1967 Robinson joined the DSIR Physics and Engineering Laboratory (PEL) as a scientist. His work included developing experimental techniques using ultrasonics in solid state physics and initiating a research programme in the Antarctic on sea ice (where he spent a few summers between 1978 and 1989). He also worked at the Scott Polar Research Institute in 1981–1982 (Cambridge, UK). He later became director of PEL (1985–91) and showed particular foresight in giving his full support to the new field of the High Temperature Superconductivity programme. At the age of 52, Robinson suffered from a near-fatal stroke, spending 4 and a half months in hospital rehabilitation. His \\"indomitable spirit\\" enabled him to re-learn how to walk, write and drive, and within six months of the stroke he was back at work as a scientist. In 1995 he founded Robinson Seismic Ltd. to promote, develop and manufacture his seismic protection devices. He semi-retired during his 60s, spending most of his time on a lifestyle farm overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but continued to lecture, travel and develop his seismic engineering ideas part-time. Robinson married in his early 20s and had three children. Honours and awards Robinson was a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He was awarded: the Rutherford Medal (the Royal Society Gold Medal for Technology, 1999); an Honorary DSc from Victoria University of Wellington (1995); the Hutton Medal (NZ Institute of Physics, 1992); the ER Coopers Medal for Engineering Research (NZ Royal Society, 1991); the Michaelus Medal for Physics (University of Otago, 1976). He was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order, for services to engineering, in the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours. The Robinson Research Institute was formed at Victoria University of Wellington in 2014, and \\"named to honour the late Dr Bill Robinson—inspirational scientist, seismic engineer and early champion of HTS [high-temperature superconductivity] technology\\". In popular culture On 2 October 2019, Google honoured Robinson by celebrating what would have been his 81st birthday with a Google Doodle.

Then the river turns south in eastern part of Singavaram village and then flows east again. Second tributary Nariyar Odai joins Sankaraparani near Uranithangal village. Near Vallam village, the river turns southeast to flow toward of Rettanai, Nedimozhiyanur, towards Veedur Dam. The third tributary Thondiar joins near Vidur. The Vidur reservoir across Sankaraparani is situated just below. From Vidur reservoir, Sankaraparani flows southeast. Pambaiyar tributary joins near Radhapuram. Then Sankaraparani enters Puducherry Union Territory at Manalipet. Pambai tributary joins Sankaraparani near Sellipet. Then Guduvaiyar River, the last tributary joins near Boat House. At this point, Sankaraparani is also called Chunnambar. From here it flows for before draining into Bay of Bengal at Paradise Beach. The total length of the river is . Of the total length, flows in Puducherry.  Tributaries  Sankaraparani river has six tributaries namely: * Annamangalam surplus * Nariyar Odai * Thondiar * Pambaiyar * Pambai * Guduvaiyar  Distributary  The only distributary of Sankaraparani is Ariyankuppam River that branches near Thirukanchi.  History of a flood in times bygone  There is a history that there was once great flooding of this river. The exact timing of the flood may need experts in history to tell us. However, the two proofs are: (1) The fossil park at Tiruvakkarai is about 1–2 km away from the river and located on a hillock. The ASI maintained park mentions that there was a great flood once that would have washed away all the logs of trees on the hillock which have been preserved as fossils since then. (2) A visit to the Gangai Varaha Nadeeswarar Koil at ThiruKaanchi also gave us a similar history (Varalaru) from the priests of the temple. That the village was once severely flooded and the temple was destroyed. The main deities were however saved and the temple rebuilt at the present location.  Temples  Ancient temples are located on the banks of Sankaraparani. Out of 22 Paadal Petra Sthalam in Nadu Naadu, four temples are located on the banks of Sankaraparani. Among the temples Gangai Varaga Natheeswarar Temple located at Thirukanchi in Puducherry named after this river 'Varaga Nathi'. The name suggests that this river 'Sankaraparani' has the same power as of 'Gangai Nathi' (The River Ganges) as per Hindu Mythology. Every year in the Tamil month of 'Maasi' (Feb-March) during the 'Magam' Nachathiram day this temple festival is celebrated. 'Maasi Magam' - ten days festival is celebrated including car festival on the ninth day. = Villupuram district = Temples in Villupuram district include: * Ranganathar Koil, Singavaram * Ramanatheeswarar Koil, Esalam * Azhagiyanathar Koil, Thiruvaamaathur (Paadal Petra Sthalam) * Panankatteesar Koil, Puravar Panankattur (Paadal Petra Sthalam) * Chandarasekarar Temple, Thiruvakarai (Paadal Petra Sthalam) = Puducherry = Temples in Puducherry district include: * Mahedevar Koil, Madagadipet * Perumal Koil, Thirubhuvanai * Vadugurnathar Koil, Thiruvandarkoil (Vadukkur)(Paadal Petra Sthalam) * Thirukameswarar Koil, Villianur * Kasi Vishwanathar Koil, Thirukanchi * Gangai Varaha Natheeswarar Koil, Thirukanchi  Tourism  * Vidur Reservoir * Ossudu Lake Boat House, Poraiyur Agaram * Chunnambar Boat House, Ariyankuppam Resorts include Le Pondy, Kailash Beach Resort, and The Windflower Resort and Spa  See also  * List of rivers of Puducherry * List of rivers of Tamil Nadu  References  Category:Rivers of Puducherry Category:Rivers of Tamil Nadu Category:Viluppuram district Category:Rivers of India ta:சங்கரபரணி ஆறு ","title":"Sankaraparani River"},{"id":"33032628","text":"Lacey Percival (11 February 1885 - 7 August 1968) was an Australian cinematographer who worked on many early Australian silent films.

Rolfe directed three movies for Spencer, all starring himself and his wife Lily Dampier so there is a chance he may have directed this one and that is starred his wife.

It is considered a lost film.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 20. Synopsis The film consists of a series of episodes from the life and criminal career of bushranger Dan Morgan, leading up to his violent death at the hands of the police. It started with Morgan's dismissal on a station, after which he steals his former employer's horses and begins his criminal career. He murders several people, including policemen and mailmen. In the words of the Sydney Morning Herald, \\"it is a candid tale of a cruel, evil life. Dan Morgan is not made into a hero, but something quite the opposite. His robberies and cold blooded murders inspire horror and leave no room for regret when he dies riddled with bullets.\\" According to the Bathurst National Advocate, Morgan \\"shot people with as much compunction as a small boy would shoot flies. Consequently, it was with great relief that those present witnessed him get his just deserts—shot by police as he was in the act of crossing a stream by means of a fallen tree.\\" The chapter headings were: *dismissed for laziness; *his first crime; *horse stealing' *Kirby joins Morgan; *murder of gold buyer and a constable; *discovery of murder by mail man; *Morgan shoots Kirby to effect his own escape; *burning of the homestead; *sticking up the mail coach; *the beginning of the end; *the wages of sin. Cast *Alfred Rolfe \\"and company\\" *Stanley Walpole as old stockman Production Spencer had previously made several popular films about bushrangers, The Life and Adventures of John Vane, the Notorious Australian Bushranger, Captain Midnight, the Bush King and Captain Starlight. Unlike those, it appears Dan Morgan was written originally for the screen and not adapted from a play or novel. Production took place at a time when there were rising fears about the negative influence of bushranger films on the general public. Advertising tried to counterbalance this, claiming: > In the past some films descriptive of bushranging may have been inclined to > create a fale impression in the minds of young Australia. Mr Spencer has > produced at great expense the true story of Dan Morgan, the notorious > Australian outlaw, making no attempt to glorify his doings or palliate the > heiniousness of his crime, but presenting the subject in such a way as will > point a strong moral lesson, and show the ultimate fate of all evil-doers, > for the wages of sin is death. A 1946 article claimed the film was deliberately made to be anti-bushranger. Theatre actor Stanley Walpole made his movie debut in the cast. Reception The film was premiered at Spencer's Lyceum Theatre in Sydney on 17 May 1911 and ran until June. It then played other cinemas and country areas, although does not appear to have received the wide release enjoyed by Spencer's earlier bushranger movies. As was standard practice at the time, the film was usually screened with an actor commenting on the action. =Critical= Critical reaction was positive with the reviewer from the Sydney Morning Herald calling it: > A thrilling series relating to the life of the notorious outlaw Dan Morgan, > which was well received by a large audience. The picture-play shows > realistically the exploits of that criminal, amidst surroundings of some > beautiful Australian bush scenery, while the photographic quality is quite > equal to anything yet accomplished from Mr Spencer's factory. The Sunday Times said \\"in the technical sense the pictures are admirable, and the reproductions of bush scenery are wonderfully well done.\\" The Sydney Sportsman wrote that \\"the story abounds In thrilling episodes... with beautiful typical Australian scenery throughout. The quality generally is up to the high standard of all Mr. Spencer's productions.\\" The same paper later approved of the depiction of the police saying they were finally \\"receiving something in the nature of fair play. As in true life, they triumph over the bushrangers without being placed in the ignoble and ridiculous position of incapacity in which modern dramatists have been so prone to depict them.\\" The critic from the Sydney Referee said the movie had: > Realism without so much as a suggestion of romance. To phrase the matter > bluntly, the new film reproduces some of the sensational incidents in the > infamous career of a fierce outlaw, who stained his hands with blood. The > glorification of Australian bushrangers in moving pictures having been > condemned on all sides, Mr. Spencer claims that no harm can be done if, as > in this instance, the true character of the outlaw is presented. Still, it > is a point for argument whether the doings of bushrangers are proper > subjects for exhibition when there is a danger of the young receiving bad > impressions at a picture show. No good purpose is served by illustrating the > criminal side of life in Australia. Mr. Spencer's artist has apparently > taken the raw official records of the heartless Dan Morgan and constructed a > picture story in all its natural horrors. One is shown a series of > sensational encounters, in which Morgan murders his colleagues in cold > blood, shoots wholesale his pursuers from behind safe shelter, and robs > indiscriminately throughout his brief career, with never more than a natural > suggestion of wavering courage on the part of other people. The last stand > of the bushranger, when he is shot by a dozen bullets, closes the story. In > the technical sense, the Dan Morgan pictures are admirable. =Box Office= It appears the movie was a success at the box office. However, films about bushrangers were banned in New South Wales soon after and Charles Cozens Spencer made no more movies in that genre.David Lowe, AN OUTLAW INDUSTRY Bushrangers on the big screen: 1906-1993, March 1995 References External links * *Dan Morgan at AustLit Category:Australian films Category:Australian black-and-white films Category:1911 films Category:1911 Western (genre) films Category:Lost Western (genre) films Category:Australian silent films Category:Bushranger films Category:Films set in colonial Australia Category:Lost Australian films Category:1911 lost films ","title":"Dan Morgan (film)"},{"id":"33032677","title":"Roberto Bruce"},{"id":"33032688","text":"Dalailama is a genus of moths of the family Endromidae, previously placed in the subfamily Oberthueriinae of the family Bombycidae.

After Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and Sachal Sarmast, two stars that shone on the firmament of Sindhi poetry and who could measure up to them in excellence were the father and son – Bedil and Bekas. They wrote poetry in Sindhi and Persian. Early life Bedil was born to a very pious family of Rohri. His father Khalifa Muhammad Mohsun was a disciple of Sayed Mir Janullah Shah Rizwi who was a great saint of his time, highly venerated and was chief of forty cardinals of Sufi Shah Inayat Shaheed of Jhok Shareef. Thus Bedil was brought up in such an enlightened environment under the guidance of Mir Sahib. It is narrated in the book Diwan-e-Bedil by Abdul Hussain Musavi that the midwife came and announced the news of the birth of a child to father who was sitting in the gathering with Sufi Januallah Shah. She said, \\"You have been blessed with a child but alas, his one foot is physically twisted.\\" Upon hearing this father said,\\" He is not physically handicapped by one foot. In fact, he is the flag of Rohri city.\\" His father's statement proved true many years later.Musavi.A.H. (1954).Diwan-e-Bedil. Sindh Adabi Board Jamshoro,Sindh. On his birth, he was named Abdul Qadir but he preferred to be called Qadir Bux. He was a staunch Muslim who molded his life strictly according to Shariah law. He was very simple and frugal in his lifestyle and gave away whatever he received to the needy. He followed the path of Ishq-e-Majazi (platonic love) to attain the heights of Ishq-e-Haqiqi (spiritual love) as dictated by Mystic doctrine. He was a devotee of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar of Sehwan. Although he had a deformity in one foot, yet he undertook long journeys to Sehwan to pay homage to the Saint's Shrine. He went to Jhok Sharif to pay homage to shrine of Sufi Shah Inayat Shaheed and to Daraza, to visit the shrine of Sachal Sarmast.

Bedil was the most voluminous poet of Sindh, even more so than Shah Latif, with 10 books of poetry to his credit. Most of his poems were written in Persian, Seraiki, Sindhi, Arabic, and Urdu,. His famous Sindhi works were Wahdat Namo (Book of Union) and Surood Namo (Book of Melody).

The cephalosporins (and other β-lactams) have the ability to kill bacteria by inhibiting essential steps in the bacterial cell wall synthesis which in the end results in osmotic lysis and death of the bacterial cell. Cephalosporins are widely used antibiotics because of their clinical efficiency and desirable safety profile. The cephalosporins are diverse in their antibacterial spectrum, water solubility, acid tolerability, oral bioavailability, biological half-life and other properties. Therefore, the cephalosporins can be further classified into generations depending on antibacterial activity, time of invention and structural basis.  Basic structure of cephalosporins  Cephalosporin C The core of the basic cephalosporin molecule consists of a two ring system which includes a β-lactam ring condensed with dihydrothiazine ring. The core itself can also be referred to as 7-aminocephalosporanic acid which can be derived by hydrolysis from the natural compound cephalosporin C. Chemical compounds containing this core are relatively stable to acid hydrolysis and tolerance to β-lactamases. Cephalosporin C contains a side- chain which is derived from D-aminoadipic acid. Modification of side chains on the relevant positions has been used to create a whole new class of cephalosporin antibiotics. Modification of side-chains in position 7 of the lactam ring seems to affect the antibacterial activity while position 3 of the dihydrothiazine ring alters pharmacokinetic properties and receptor binding affinity. = Discovery = The first chemical compounds of the cephalosporin group were isolated from Cephalosporium acremonium, a cephalosporin-producing fungus first discovered by Giuseppe Brotzu in 1948 from a sewage outfall off the Sardinian coast. From crude filtrates of the Cephalosporium acremonium culture scientists got new antibacterial activity. It was noted that the crude filtrate could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. = Investigation = a) 7-ACA b) 7-ADCA Further investigations by Sir Edward Abraham and Guy Newton were made in England and isolation of culture fluids from the Sardinian fungus yielded cephalosporin P, N and C. These natural compounds were not found to be potent enough to use as antimicrobial agents but with chemical methods and removal of the natural side chain it was possible to produce 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) which could be further fit with unnatural side chains. 7-ACA is analogous to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), a starting block for making several derivatives of penicillins. In 1959 Abraham reported that his N-phenylacetyl derivative of cephalosporin C was much more potent against Staphylococcus aureus strains than the parent compound. This derivative was later named Cephaloram, a cephalosporin analogue of benzylpenicillin. Eli Lilly developed a method for producing 7-ACA based on cleaving the α-aminoadipoyl side chain of cephalosporin C. Further work by Robert Morin led to semisynthesis of 3-deacetoxy-7-ACA (7-ADCA) from penicillins which is convenient because penicillins can be fermented with more ease than cephalosporins. For example, 7-ADCA can be semisynthesized in seven chemical reaction steps from phenoxymethylpenicillin. = Results = Cephalothin, a first generation cephalosporin for parenteral use was the first cephalosporin to become available for patients in the US in 1964. It was chosen for clinical trials from series of 7-ACA derivatives prepared at Eli Lilly. The second cephalosporin for parenteral use became available little later and was marketed in the US under the name Cephaloridine. The clinical successes of these two cephalosporins urged researchers to improve the pharmacological properties and develop more agents. Today we are left with thousands of semisynthesized analogues of natural cephalosporin compounds based on the knowledge gained by intensive research on the chemistry of those two starting materials.  Mechanism of action  PBP are responsible for cross-linking in the bacterial cell wall. They make peptide bonds between lysine and alanine. Cephalosporins bind into the reaction site of PBP’s rendering the enzyme unable to cross-link the bacterial wall giving bactericidal activity. The bactericidal effects of β-lactam antibiotics are achieved through inhibition of the bacterial cell wall synthesis. The cell wall of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is a tight covalently bound and cross-linked peptidoglycan network and essential for bacterial growth, cell division and cellular structure. Therefore, bacteria need enzymes that can cleave the cell wall during bacterial growth and cell division. The cell wall of bacteria is built up in two steps from the outside of the cell. In the first step, molecules of disaccharide units linked with peptides on their ends are transported from the cytoplasm of the bacteria and joined together on the outside of the wall by a transglycolase. In the second step, a transpeptidase links together long polysaccharide chains which are linked together through peptide bonds. The amino acid sequence of D-alanyl-D-alanine is recognized by the transpeptidase at the end of the peptide chain. The enzyme cleaves off the alanine on the terminal end and joins the remainder to a peptide chain from an adjacent polysaccharide. This transpeptidation reaction is inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics like cephalosporins. Because of this inhibition the antibiotics are most effective when the bacteria are in the logarithmic phase of growth, were then they are synthesizing the cell wall. If the bacteria are in the stationary phase of growth then there is no wall synthesizing in progress and the antibiotics have much lower effect. Although the mechanism of action for β-lactam antibiotics is not completely known they are believed to exert their mechanism of action by mimicking the structure of the transition state of the chemical reaction when the transpeptidase is bound to the D-alanyl-D-alanine sequence. These proteins are often referred to as penicillin binding proteins (PBP). Opening of the β-lactam ring by a serine residue in the enzyme binding site leads to covalent binding of the antibiotic molecule with the active site of the enzyme. The result is an inactive irreversibly bound enzyme-complex which is incapable of further cell wall synthesis and the cell will die from osmotic-lysis.  Drug design  = Structure activity relationship = Relevant positions of cephalosporin structure activity relationship The molecular structure of cephalosporin can be altered in various ways to improve in vitro stability, anti-bacterial activity and resistance against β-lactamases. In the acidic conditions of the stomach, in vitro stability can be enhanced by the addition of an amino and a hydrogen to positions α1 and α2 of the cephalosporin structure. This results in a basic compound, an ammonium ion that is protonated in said conditions, giving us a more stable β-lactam which leads to an orally active drug. Anti-bacterial activity can be enhanced if A2 is an alkoxy group instead of a hydrogen. The 7-amino group is crucial for anti- bacterial activity. In some cases, adding a methoxy group in position A2, cephalosporin stability is enhanced toward β-lactamases. In position A1, sulfur and oxygen can be placed in the ring. Sulfur shows better anti- bacterial activity, but oxygen shows better stability towards β-lactamases. In position C6, hydrogen is crucial for biological activity. In position A3, anti-bacterial activity is greater when A3 is a 5-membered heterocycle instead of a 6-membered one. In position α1 and α2, the L-isomer is 30–40 times more stable towards β-lactamase than the D-isomer. Stability toward β-lactamase can be increased around 100-fold with the addition of methoxyoxime. Z-oxime is nearly 20,000-fold more stable than the E-oxime. = Binding site = Advances in the field of recombinant protein engineering and expression, protein purification, NMR, X-ray crystallography and computational chemistry have improved the skills of drug designers to use data that have been gathered on the three-dimensional structures of protein ligand complexes. Most bacterial species have various types of PBP which differ in various ways such as enzymatic function, molecular weight and the affinity for β-lactam antibiotics. There are two types of enzymes there are particularly interesting with regard to the binding site of β-lactams, PBP and β-lactamases. Target alterations in the binding site of PBP have led to high-level resistance of β-lactams among bacterias like staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. For example, the binding site of PBP2 in Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been structurally determined and has three sequence motifs that can be seen in nearly all β-lactam interacting enzymes. *SXXK motif located at the N-terminal end of α2 helix and includes two residues that are important for the enzyme function. **Ser-310 : Includes a serine nucleophile that is acylated by both peptide substrate and β-lactam antibiotics. **Lys-313 : Plays an important role in providing the dense hydrogen bound network at the active site and is in distance of Ser 310, ASN-364 and the carbonyl backbone of Ser-362. *SXN motif that includes Ser-362, Ser-363 and Asn-364 *KTG motif that includes Lys-497, Thr-498 and Gly-499 Research also implies that adjacent regions to the active site which differ between different PBP have significant influence on the rate of β-lactam acylation rate.  Antimicrobial resistance  Bacterial resistance to the cephalosporin compounds can take place by three mechanisms. * Modifications in target PBP * Drug inactivation by bacterial β-lactamases * Drug not being able to reach target PBP in the bacterial cell Cephalosporins must get through the bacterial cell wall in order to reach the target PBP. In comparison, it is easier to penetrate the cell wall of gram- positive bacteria than the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. The cell wall structure of gram-positive bacteria is made routinely up by peptidoglycan which allows the passage of cephalosporin-sized molecules. The cell wall structure of gram-negative bacteria is more complex, composed of polysaccharides, lipids and proteins, and is harder to penetrate. Particles get through the outer membrane through water-filled channels, or porins, which are trans membrane proteins. During exposure to cephalosporins the bacteria can form resistance by itself or as selection of the next generation of bacteria after reproducing itself, by mutation. Bacteria species such as pneumococci and meningococci can acquire exogenous genetic material, and incorporate it into their own chromosomes which leads to antimicrobial resistance. In that manner the target PBP can be altered to have their attraction for cephalosporins and other β-lactam antibiotics lowered. The bacteria can also replace the PBP that is vulnerable to Beta-lactam antibiotics with PBP that is less vulnerable. β-lactam antibiotics can be inactivated by many types of β-lactamases, which are produced by bacteria. The enzymes hydrolyze the bond between the carbon and nitrogen atom of the β-lactam ring. There are many beta lactamases which vary in substrate specificity and host range. The enzymes active site is easily regenerated hydrolytically so it is re-usable many times, in that way can a comparatively small amount of beta-lactamases destroy a large amount of drug. Gram-positive bacteria, such as a staphylococci, have a high release of beta-lactamases into their extracellular space, where they meet the drug outside the cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria on the other hand follow a more conservative course. They secrete their beta-lactamases into the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membrane so they can't easily escape into the extracellular space, and don't have to be biosynthesized in high quantities.  Drug development  This section will review the drug development from one generation to the next with emphasis on the structural differences between the generations. The generation classification system relies on dividing the cephalosporins by their chemical properties and their relative activity against gram-negative versus gram-positive bacteria. From the first generation cephalosporins to the third generation there is a development from being more effective against gram-positive bacteria to being more effective against gram- negative bacteria and less effective against gram-positive bacteria respectively. However the activity returns to a balanced effectiveness against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in the fourth generation. = Classification of cephalosporins = The cephalosporin class is very extensive so a good classification system is necessary to distinguish different cephalosporins from each other. There are few chemical and activity features that could be used for classification, for example chemical structure, side chain properties, pharmacokinetic, spectrum of activity or clinical properties. Despite these variable features the most common classification system for cephalosporins is to divide them into generations. The generation system is based on different antimicrobial activity shown by different cephalosporins. = 1st generation cephalosporins = The basic structure of first generation cephalosporins First generation cephalosporins were the first cephalosporins on the market. They have good antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria but limited activity against gram-negative species. The chemical structures of the first generation cephalosporins are fairly simple. As an example three drugs from this class (Cephalexin, Cephradine and Cefadroxil) all have a single methyl group at position C-3. The common side groups at C-3 for first class cephalosporins are small uncharged groups like methyl. The methyl group at position C-3 gives low affinity for common PBP which can in part explain the relatively low activity of these first drugs. Cefaclor however has a Cl group at position C-3 which gives it better binding to PBP and thus better antimicrobial activity. There is not an agreement on classifying Cefaclor as a first generation cephalosporin because of the Cl group at the C-3 position and therefore its improved activity, but it is often classified as such because of its C-7 side chain which is more related to the first generation than the second. All of the first generation cephalosporins have an α-amino group at position C-7. This structure makes them vulnerable to hydrolysis by β-lactamases. Examples of 1st generation cephalosporins : A) Cephadrine B) Cefadroxil C) Cefalexin = 2nd generation cephalosporins = the basic structure of 2nd generation cephalosporinsEarly second generation cephalosporins are very similar in basic structure to the first generation. Loracarbef however does not have the normal dihydrothiazin ring but is a carbacephem that has a carbon atom in the ring instead of a sulfur atom making it a tetrahydropyridine ring. This chemical property gives Loracarbef better stability in plasma while retaining oral absorption characteristics and affinity for binding to PBP. The 7-phenyl-glycine makes it orally available and the chlorine at position C-3 makes it as active as Cefaclor. An important structural change in the development of second generation cephalosporins was the introduction of an α-iminomethoxy group to the C-7 side chain. This gave an increased resistance to β-lactamases due to stereochemical blocking of the beta-lactam ring. Cefuroxime was the first cephalosporin to incorporate this side chain. Another very important group in the second generation is the aminothiazole ring to the C-3 side chain. This development drastically increased binding affinity to PBP and increased antimicrobial activity. The aminothiazole ring can be seen in the structure of Cefotiam. Examples of 2nd generation cephalosporins : A) Loracarbef B) Cefuroxime C) Cefotiam = 3rd generation cephalosporins = The basic structure of 3rd generation cephalosporinsThe majority of third generation cephalosporins have the aminothiazole group at position C-7. Different groups are found at the 7-α-position like 7-α-iminohydroxy and 7-α-iminomethoxy. Ceftibuten however possesses a 7-α-ethylidene group. This group gives ceftibuten higher resistance to enhanced spectrum β-lactamases. Many of the oral third generation cephalosporins are esters of parenteral forms and are hydrolysed by esterases in the digestive tract (Cefteram-pivoxil). Some of the third generation drugs can be absorbed orally without the need of esterification. This is for example done with Cefixime and Cefdinir by putting a vinyl group in the C-3 position. Examples of 3rd generation cephalosporins : A) Cefdinir B) Cefixime C) Ceftibuten = 4th generation cephalosporins = The fourth generation cephalosporins have greater activity against gram-negative bacteria than the second and third generation. This difference is attributed to them being dipolar ionic zwitterion compounds. The C-7 side chain is similar to third generation cephalosporins usually containing iminomethoxy-aminothiazole group or in the case of Cefclidine an aminothiadiazole. Because of the positively charged quaternary nitrogen in the C-3 side chain fourth generation cephalosporins can diffuse through the gram-negative bacterial membrane more readily than earlier cephalosporins. It is thought that the positive charge orients the drug molecule to the entrance of the porin channel. Examples of 4th generation cephalosporins : A) Cefzopran B) Cefclidine C) Cefepime = 5th generation cephalosporins = Currently there are only two drugs in this category, Ceftobiprole and Ceftaroline. These new drugs are also the only β-lactam antibiotics that are effective against methicillin-resistant- Staphylococcus-aureus (MRSA). Ceftobiprole is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem. The C-3 side chain was specifically designed to have a strong binding affinity to PBP2a and PBP2x. PBP2a is known to give staphylococci resistance to other β-lactam drugs and PBPx does the same for pneumococci. Ceftobiprole also has an aminothiazoylhydroxyimino side chain at the C-7 position which is known to give good resistance to β-lactamase from S. aureus. Together these active groups make Ceftobiprole bactericidal to MRSA. Ceftobiprole has poor water solubility and is therefore administered intravenously as an ester prodrug called Ceftobiprole medocaril. It is rapidly broken down into active Ceftobiprole by plasma esterases. Ceftaroline was developed from the fourth generation cephalosporin Cefozopran. It retains the alkoxyimino group at position C-7 from earlier generations so it is fairly stable in the presence of many β-lactamases. Since MRSA and penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae have resistance dedicated to new types of PBP, PBP2a and PBP2x respectively, both Ceftaroline and Ceftobiprole have C-3 side chains specially engineered to bind these new PBP. In the case of Ceftaroline this side chain contains a 2-thioazolythio spacer linkage optimised for its anti-MRSA activity. Ceftaroline has low water solubility but this problem was overcome by attaching a N-phosphonoamino group to the molecule making the intravenous prodrug Ceftaroline fosamil. The prodrug is dephosphorylated in plasma to form active Ceftaroline. 5th generation cephalosporins : A) Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) and B) Ceftobiprole medocaril (prodrug)  Current status  Antimicrobial resistance is the driving force for the development of new antimicrobial agents. The complexity and diversity of resistance mechanisms has defined the need for new and improved β-lactam antibiotics. With their broad spectrum the cephalosporins have come to dominate β-lactam chemotherapy although they often lack oral bioavailability. On 29 October 2010, a new cephalosporin agent - Ceftarolin - was approved by the food and drug administration (FDA). Teflaro (ceftaroline fosamil) is an injectable antibiotic prodrug to treat adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSI) and community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Ceftobiprole has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (excluding VAP) and community acquired pneumonia in 12 European countries, Canada and Switzerland.Basilea Medical Ltd.

The paintings are collectively listed as a National Treasure of Japan and held at the Nara National Museum. Overview The paintings are thought to have been created during the 12th century, during the reign of Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Heian period; they may have also been produced during the Kamakura period. The calligrapher is thought to be the same on the five scrolls as on the Hell Scroll and the Demon of Punishment, which were produced at roughly the same time. They are thought to have originally been a single handscroll, known as the \\"second edition of the Masuda family Hell Scroll\\", that was stored in the Rengeō-in Temple (now Sanjūsangen-dō). The paintings depict five benevolent deities in combat against evil, as represented by demons; the deities come from several cultures, including contemporary Japanese, Chinese, and Indian. They are thought to be associated with the Hell Transformation Screens then used in Nara for repentance ceremonies at the end of each year, where the devout recited the names of the buddhas at Heijō Palace. The paintings were designated National Treasures of Japan on 6 June 1985, with the accession number 1106. They are located at the Nara National Museum in Nara, Nara Prefecture. Works =Tenkeisei= Tenkeisei Tenkeisei (天刑星, literally meaning \\"the star [that metes out] heavenly punishment\\"), or the God of Heavenly Punishment, is a deity from the Chinese tradition of yin and yang.

C. Yadav (Kripal Chandra Yadav) is an Indian historian of modern and colonial Indian history. Life and career In 1974, K. C. Yadav was an elected a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (FRAS). From 1980-81, he served as a Visiting Professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Japan. Hailing from Haryana, Yadav has particular interest in the region. He was the founder and editor of the Journal of Haryana Studies, and the founding Director of the Haryana Academy of History and Culture where he held office till November 2014. He is part of the United Service Institution's project India and the Great War 1914-18. Academic works On the Revolt of 1857: One of Yadav's earliest contributions pertained to the 1857 mutiny and struggle by the Indian Princely states as well as Indian sepoys against the rule of the East India Company. Punjab was traditionally considered to have a pacifist role in the struggle. Yadav presented an argument that stated otherwise. Citing evidence from the mutiny records relating to Ambala, Yadav argued that the revolt first broke out in Ambala, and not Meerut. In a letter R. C. Majumdar wrote to K. C. Yadav, he said, '...the most important article is on the Mutiny at Ambala. That there was an open revolt of the sepoys there on the morning of 10 May, before the outbreak at Meerut, is, I must confess, a news to me and probably to many others. I congratulate you...'http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/21677/1/jaas017008.pdf Yadav has further written on the role of Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. In 2008, Yadav was a speaker at the National Conference on the 1857 Revolt organized by the Kurukshetra University and ICHR. He has also placed emphasis on the role of Rao Tula Ram. 'On Bhagat Singh: Bhagat Singh, a revolutionary of the Indian Independence movement, is one of Yadav's chief focus of interest. Yadav has produced 10 volumes on the revolutionary. In an interview to the national daily The Hindu, Yadav said, 'Nobody has tried to understand his [Bhagat Singh's] ideology and its relevance today. Part of the problem is his writings have been scattered and most of the published work on him is in the vernacular. No doubt the films that have been made on him have succeeded in taking him to the masses but here again the scripts lacked authenticity. That's why we undertook a thorough research and chose English as the medium.' In his works Yadav argues against the revolutionary's supposed 'confusion' and has discussed Singh's ideology, tracing his transition from a Gandhian to a socialist revolutionary. Speaking to The Tribune', Yadav stated, 'Bhagat Singh [...] had the potential of becoming a world leader and this is no exaggeration.' On the First World War: In recent years Yadav has worked on the involvement of Indian soldiers in the First World War, focusing mainly on Haryana and Punjab. He is part of the United Service Institution's project India and the Great War 1914-18. Yadav has focused on the recruitment of Indian soldiers, the social and economic implications of the war, and its impact. He examined letters from these soldiers for his research. Yadav explains one of the tactics used for recruitment of soldiers was to shame the young men in front of the village's women, thus forcing their enlistment. Yadav argues that despite the totalitarian nature of the 'Great War', the experience of the war brought about prosperity in these regions as, 'The soldiers returning after WWI started to buy land with the money they made abroad,'. Speaking to the Sunday Guardian, he further explained, 'The exposure to France, England and the other modern societies of Europe led them to question our condition [...] Even while they were still on the frontlines, they began to work to bring education, equality, cleanliness and hygiene to their villages,' Bibliography Selected works: *Yadav.

Synopsis Set in Victorian London, the story concerns a music hall chorus girl, Belle Adair, aka Rose Lynton, who blackmails a gentleman, Michael Drego, after seeing him leave the house where another dancer, Daisy Arrow, was found murdered. Instead of accepting money she demands to be invited to the man's stately home to experience the life of a lady. The woman becomes friends with the man's mother, Lady Margaret Drego, his fiancée, Audrey Ashton, but her peace is disturbed when the police inspector, Deputy Inspector Evans, arrives to question them further about the murder. Then another murder is committed in similar circumstances.

The film was immediately assigned to Peggy Cummins, who had been fired from Forever Amber. \\"Ethel Barrymore was in it\\", Vincent Price said. \\"I was terrified of her until one day between takes she waddles up and whispers, ‘Got a smoke?’\\" Bawden, James & Miller, Ron. You Ain’t Heard Nothin’ Yet. University Press of Kentucky: Lexington, Kentucky, 2017. Reception =Box-office= The film was a commercial disappointment. Darryl F. Zanuck called it \\"a catastrophe, for which I blame myself. Our picture was not as good as the original script and the casting was atrocious. The property lost $1,300,000 net.\\"Memo from Darryl F Zanuck to Charlie Feldman, 7 June 1950, Memo from Darryl F. Zanuck, Grove Press 1993 p 168. =Critical response= When the film was released, The New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther, praised the film, writing, \\"Readers of thriller fiction have been talking for quite some time about a writer called Joseph Shearing, whose many period mysteries are said to have a flavor and distinction all their own. And now it appears that film-goers will have reason to join the claque, if all of this author's output is as adaptable as the first to reach the screen. For Moss Rose, the first of several promised Shearing films, which hit the Roxy yesterday, is a suave and absorbing mystery thriller, neatly plotted and deliciously played ... Thanks to a splendid performance by Peggy Cummins in the role of the girl, there is something to watch when she is acting besides the consequence of the makeup artist's work. Her job as the Cockney chorine has spirit, humor and brass—and a surprisingly tender quality which nicely rounds the role.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, \\"Moss Rose Mystery Thriller at the Roxy Theatre, Offers Peggy Cummins and Victor Mature in the Principal Roles\\", July 3, 1947. Accessed: July 14, 2013. The staff at Variety magazine also gave the film a positive review. They wrote, \\"Moss Rose is good whodunit. Given a lift by solid trouping and direction, melodrama is run off against background of early-day England that provides effective setting for theme of destructive mother love ... Gregory Ratoff's direction develops considerable flavor to the period melodramatics. He gets meticulous performances from players in keeping with mood of piece.\\"Variety. Staff film review, 1947.

It was said that he was not a prominent eunuch early in his career, but was gradually promoted during the reigns of Emperor Xizong and Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, eventually becoming one of the directors of palace communications (Shumishi) and then one of the commanders (中尉) of the Shence Armies.New Book of Tang, vol. 208. However, the main sources on his rise — the New Book of Tang and the Zizhi Tongjian — disagree with each other (and somewhat internally) as to his career progression and actions. The Zizhi Tongjian referred to Liu Jishu as the commander of the Right Shence Army in 888, at the time of Emperor Xizong's death and Emperor Zhaozong's ascension to the throne (which was supported by Yang Fuguang),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. but then referred to him as acting director of palace communications in 897, further stating that he cooperated with the warlord Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) when Emperor Zhaozong was at Zhenguo's capital Hua Prefecture (華州) when Han, over Emperor Zhaozong's protest, killed 11 imperial princes whom Emperor Zhaozong had put in command of some of the imperial forces. Emperor Zhaozong was then at Hua Prefecture after fleeing the imperial capital Chang'an with his court after coming under attack by the warlord Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. According to the New Book of Tang, however, it appeared that Liu was director of palace communications when Emperor Zhaozong, at the instigation of the chancellor Cui Yin, killed the commanders of the Shence Armies Zhu Daobi (朱道弼) and Jing Wuxiu (景務脩) in 900 and replaced them with Liu and Wang Zhongxian (王仲先) — whereas the Zizhi Tongjian referred to Zhu and Jing, at their deaths, as directors of palace communications. Regardless, it appeared that by late 900, when Emperor Zhaozong had returned to Chang'an after making peace with Li Maozhen, Liu and Wang were the commanders of the Shence Armies and in enmity with Cui over Cui's role in instigating Zhu's and Jing's deaths.  Removal of Emperor Zhaozong  It was said that Emperor Zhaozong's mood became unpredictable and depressed after his return from Hua Prefecture, and he was often drunk. His attendants became fearful of him. Liu Jishu, in response, began plotting with Wang Zhongxian, as well as the directors of palace communications Wang Yanfan (王彥範) and Xue Qiwo (薛齊偓), to overthrow him and replace him with his son, the Crown Prince Li Yu, Prince of De. The eunuchs' plot was put into action after, one night late in 900, Emperor Zhaozong, in a drunken rage, killed several eunuch attendants and ladies in waiting. Liu, hearing of the incident, went to confront Cui Yin the next morning, arguing that Emperor Zhaozong was no longer fit to be emperor. Cui, fearing that Liu would kill him, did not dare to openly oppose Liu. Liu drafted a petition that he then forced Cui and other imperial officials to sign, asking Emperor Zhaozong briefly transfer imperial authorities to the Crown Prince; he and Wang Zhongxian then took Shence Army soldiers to enter the palace to confront Emperor Zhaozong. Emperor Zhaozong initially resisted the eunuchs' attempt to remove him, but his wife Empress He, fearful that the eunuchs would kill him, persuaded him to yield to the eunuchs and turn the imperial seals over to them. Liu and Wang escorted Emperor Zhaozong to Shaoyang Pavilion (少陽院) and put him under house arrest here; Liu went as far as rebuking the emperor for not following his advice on many prior occasions, using a silver cane to draw lines on the ground to count off the times. He then had Li Yu escorted to the palace, had his name changed to Li Zhen, and declared him emperor. Emperor Zhaozong was declared Retired Emperor and Empress He Retired Empress. With Liu in power, he executed Emperor Zhaozong's younger brother Li Yi (李倚) the Prince of Mu, as well as the attendants and Buddhist and Taoist monks that Emperor Zhaozong favored. He also considered killing Cui, but was fearful of a violent reaction by Cui's ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), only removing Cui from his secondary post as director of the salt and iron monopolies. Cui, meanwhile, was in secret communications with Zhu, thinking of ways to restore Emperor Zhaozong. Liu also tried to communicate with Zhu, sending his adoptive son Liu Xidu (劉希度) and another eunuch, Li Fengben (李奉本), to Xuanwu's capital Daliang, offering to let him take over the Tang throne. Zhu was initially unsure of what to do, but the advice of his staff member Li Zhen (not to be confused with the prince-emperor), Zhu put Liu Xidu and Li Fengben under arrest and sent his staff member Jiang Xuanhui (蔣玄暉) to Chang'an to confer with Cui. Cui was, at the same time, trying to undermine the eunuchs by persuading Shence Army officers to turn against the eunuchs. He persuaded Sun Dezhao (孫德昭) to work with him to restore the emperor. Sun then persuaded fellow officers Dong Yanbi (董彥弼) and Zhou Chenghui (周承誨) to join the plot as well. On lunar new year's day in 901, Sun assassinated Wang Zhongxian and went to Shaoyang Pavilion to free Emperor Zhaozong and Empress He. Meanwhile, Zhou captured Liu and Wang Yanfan and took them to the emperor's presence. Before Emperor Zhaozong could interrogate them, however, Liu and Wang Yanfan were battered to death by the soldiers. Xue committed suicide by jumping into a well. The four eunuchs' family members were slaughtered.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 184. * New Book of Tang, vol. 208. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 257, 261, 262.

She batted and threw right-handed. After being married in 1948 she played under the name of Margaret Silvestri. Early life Born in Mobile, Alabama, Marge Holgerson started her career at second base but turned into a solid pitcher after a slow start. She collected a 76–69 record during her seven years in the league, allowing a 1.07 base runner per inning pitched, while her 1.94 career earned run average ranks her eighth in the all-time list of AAGPBL pitchers with at least 1,000 innings of work.The Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary – W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Debut Season Holgerson entered the league in 1946 with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them through the 1949 mid-season before joining the Muskegon Lassies (1949–1950) and the Grand Rapids Chicks (1950–1952). She had a natural sidearm delivery, which the league had converted to in 1946. She posted a 2–2 record for Rockford as a rookie, while pitching 33 innings in five starts. At the plate, she hit a .190 batting average in 61 games. In 1947 Holgerson had more opportunities to show her talent. She made 27 pitching appearances, and went 9–15 with a 2.42 ERA and 48 strikeouts in 201 innings. But she would fare even better in 1948, when the league shifted strictly to overhand motion. She then turned in a competent pitcher, going 16–15 with a 1.92 ERA while setting personal records in wins, games pitched (37), strikeouts (194) and innings (277). She also finished fourth for the most strikeouts, sixth in ERA and seventh in innings. The Peaches, with Bill Allington at the helm, advanced to the best-of-five series of the Western Division and swept the Peoria Redwings in three games.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book – W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. Racine repeated the feat in the best-of-five first round, and upset the Kenosha Comets in three games. In Game 1, Lois Florreich recorded the first no-hitter in series history during a 6–0 victory, while Helen Fox followed with a two-hit, 3–2 win in Game 2. Then, Holgerson recorded a second no-hitter against the Comets, 4–0, helping Racine to advance to the final series.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book At the end, the Peaches never gave the Fort Wayne Daisies a chance as Rockford jumped out to a three-game lead and clinched the Championship Title four games to one. Fox won Games 2 and 5 (3–2, 4–2), while Florreich and Holgerson hurled shutouts in Game 1 (1–0) and Game 3 (10–0), respectively. In 1949, Holgerson divided her playing time between Racine and Muskegon, as the league shifted players as needed to help new teams stay afloat. She recorded a solid 1.70 ERA with both clubs, though she ended with a 5–10 mark because of lack of run support from the Lassies. Holgerson opened 1950 with Muskegon and was traded to Grand Rapids during the mid-season. She posted a combined 14–12 record and a 2.00 ERA in 33 games, while striking out 101 batters in 230 innings, ranking sixth both in ERA and strikeouts (101) and seventh in innings pitched (230). In 1951 Holgerson went 16–6, set a career-best 1.53 ERA, and matched her career-high wins mark. She crowned her successful year by ending second with 123 strikeouts, being surpassed only by Jean Faut of the South Bend Blue Sox (135). She also finished fourth in ERA and ninth in winning percentage (.727), while tying for fifth in shutouts (5), for sixth in complete games (21), and for ninth in innings (200). Holgerson had a 14–9 record with 78 strikeouts and a 2.36 ERA in her final season of 1952, while working 168 innings in 24 pitching appearances. Margaret Holgerson Silvestri, along with her former teammates and opponents, received their long overdue recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum dedicated a permanent display to the All American Girls Professional Baseball League in 1988. She died in her homeland of Mobile, Alabama, at the age of 63.

The bridge was designed by George Stevens of the Washington State Highways, and the main span was built by the Midland Structural Steel Company. Work began in August 1946. Floods in 1948 undermined the south main pier of the steel structure, causing the design to be changed from a section of earth fill to five additional T-beam concrete approach spans. Underwater blasting was required to remove the south pier for the altered work, resulting in a series of concrete approach spans on the south. The Northport Bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 1995.

The SIF seeks to follow in the footsteps of Prague’s “Cercle philosophique,” which was established by Czech and German professors from the University of Prague in 1934, but soon disbanded with the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. The Institute promotes philosophical research – with an emphasis on the phenomenological as well as on trans/ interdisciplinary. The Czech Republic, with its tradition of a rather unusual symbiotic alliance of Czech, Jewish, and German intellectuals is an ideal location for the SIF. The country has already birth to various influential movements: The Prague Circle literary school (Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Felix Weltsch, Franz Werfel, Oscar Baum), in art Czech cubism and surrealism along with other disciplines such as empirical criticism (Ernst Mach), phenomenology (Edmund Husserl), and psychoanalysis (Sigmund Freud). As one of its primary objectives, the SIF seeks to map the rich potential of the varied cultural and ethnic influences that shape the present day Czech state. This mapping enables a hypothesis as to the reciprocal influences of not only other European traditions but also non- European and the consequences these might hold for the present and the future. In keeping with this multi-cultural tradition, two directors guide the SIF: a Czech, Karel Novotny and a German, Hans Rainer Sepp. The Institute is composed of a staff of permanent and external members and is also supported by an international scholarly board of 36 professors or institutions representing twenty countries. All strive in close association so that SIF may bring together thinkers and scholars working in a wide range of disciplines concerned with the study of philosophical, historical, critical, and theoretical issues. In addition, SIF also is the home of the book series “Orbis Phaenomenologicus,” founded in 1993 and published by Königshausen & Neumann, Würzburg, Germany, as well as the newly established series “libri nigri. Thinking Across Boundaries” and “libri virides. The Young Forum,” published by Traugott Bautz, Nordhausen, Germany. A research project entitled “Philosophical Investigations of Body Experiences: Trans-disciplinary Perspectives” is currently underway at the SIF. In addition to its ongoing research projects, the SIF offers specialized advanced courses in conjunction with the EU Master Program “German and French Philosophy in the European Context.” The Institute also organizes and hosts international conferences and is very active in facilitating the publication of established and young scholars alike. To date the SIF has organized three international conferences and edited ten book publications. All of these activities attest to SIF’s commitment to providing a place of intellectual exchange, dialogue, and debate as scholars re-think the methodology and assumptions of their respective disciplines in light of the cultural perspectives and assumptions of others both past and present.

Black cross painted on a Peruvian household. In the background a Chilean flag. Chilenization of Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá describes a process of forced transculturation or acculturation in the areas (Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá) which were invaded and incorporated by Chile since the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). The aim of the Chilenization was to create a dominance of Chilean traditions and culture in that region, in preference to those of the Peruvian population. The British desire to reunite all saltpeter mines under one political administration was also a major factor that influenced the outcome of the war. After the failure of Chile to ratify the Billinghurst-Latorre protocol, Chile began in the provinces of Tacna and Arica a policy which has been called \\"Chilenization\\". This has consisted in the closing of school conducted by Peruvians, the extension of the military zone to Tacna, the dismissal of Peruvian prelates and interference with Peruvian religious establishments, the initiation of a Chilean press propaganda and restrictions upon Peruvian press and political agitation, and a colonization policy for Chileans. Background Starting from the Chilean silver rush in the 1830s, Atacama (a Bolivian region) was prospected and populated by Chileans backed by Chilean and European (mainly British) capital.Bethell, Leslie. 1993. Chile Since Independence. Cambridge University Press. pp. 13-14. Chilean and foreign enterprises in the region eventually extended their control to the Bolivian saltpeter mines. During the 1870s, Peru capitalized on the guano exploitation and nationalized all industries in Tarapacá, but Bolivian enterprises in its territory remained in private hands. Peru controlled 58.8% of all saltpeter production, while Chile held 19% and Great Britain 13.5%. British Influence on the Salt: The Origin, Nature and Decline, Soto Cárdenas, Alejandro. Santiago : Ed. University of Santiago de Chile, 1998. Page 50 According to the 1876 census Peruvians represented the majority of the population in Tarapacá, followed by Chileans and Bolivians. Conflicts between Chilean and Bolivian miners were common in Peruvian saltpeterworks. However, there was no dispute about the Peruvian sovereignty of this territory.

A site for the refinery was selected at Quarry Bay, Hong Kong and the capital for the venture was put up chiefly by John Samuel Swire himself, Holt's James Barrow, H J Butterfield, Messrs. Ismay and Imrie, W J Thompson and R N Dale.Hyde, F., Blue Funnel.

China was always the chief market but Australia, Japan and India were also important at different times. Competition The Taikoo Sugar Refinery (TSR) faced stiff competition from Jardine Matheson & Co. in its early years but, by the 1920s, the Japanese had become their greatest competitors. An up-country marketing system was established to counter this and to expand TSR markets in inland China, as well as efforts to widen the Far Eastern areas served by TSR. 1920 to 1945 The 1920s was a period of constant difficulties - a strike in 1923, poor markets in 1924 and a three- month boycott in 1925. 1925, however, also saw the expansion of the Taikoo Sugar Refinery into the largest single unit refinery in the world. In December 1941 Hong Kong fell to the Japanese and production was halted until the plant was returned to John Swire & Sons in the autumn of 1945. Modern times Taikoo's sugar refining activity appears to have ceased around 1970 and the company is now a major sugar importer.

Lutnick is the chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC Partners. After losing 658 employees, including his brother, in the September 11 attacks, Lutnick has become known for his charity efforts through the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, which helps to aid families of the attacks and natural disasters. As of September 2018, Lutnick owns 60% of Cantor Fitzgerald, with a net worth of \\"at least $1.5 billion\\". Early life Howard Lutnick was born to a Jewish familyJewish United Fund: \\"Lion Luncheon 2017: 'We are the first responders'\\" by JESSICA LEVING September 9, 2016 \\"\\"We grew up with the Jewish understanding that you helped others,\\" said Lutnick, who credited her late parents with instilling in her the Jewish values of charity and repairing the world\\" in Jericho, Long Island on July 14, 1961, the son of Solomon Lutnick, a history professor at Queens College and Jane Lutnick, an artist. Lutnick was the middle child of the family, whose siblings were an elder sister Edie and a younger brother Gary. In 1978, Lutnick was a senior in high school when his mother died of lymphoma. The following year, Lutnick entered Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania. During his first week at school, Lutnick's father died while in a hospital being treated for colon and lung cancers. A nurse treating Lutnick's father gave him 100 times the dose of chemotherapy drugs that he was supposed to receive. Now orphans, Lutnick and his two siblings were largely abandoned by extended family members and instead relied on themselves for support. Lutnick, then 18, was forced to hire a lawyer to settle the debt his father left behind. The president and dean of Haverford, an institution priding itself on a Quaker heritage, called Lutnick a week after his father's death and offered him a full scholarship for his education there. Lutnick went on to graduate from Haverford in 1983 with a degree in economics. Family On December 10, 1994, Lutnick married Allison Lambert, a law associate at Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker. They have four children together, including sons Brandon and Kyle, whose first days of pre-school and kindergarten respectively fell on September 11, 2001. Lutnick was dropping his son off at his kindergarten, which caused him to be late for work, thereby saving his life. Business career Lutnick joined Cantor Fitzgerald in 1983, the same year he graduated from college. Early on, Lutnick developed a warm relationship with the firm's founder Bernard Cantor as his personal mentor. In 1991, Lutnick was named President and CEO of the company, and he became Chairman in 1996. Lutnick placed a high value on technology early on, and in 1999 made the decision to take eSpeed, an electronic trading subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald, public. This electronic trading system required no brokers, and was a large part of the reason Cantor Fitzgerald was able to remain afloat when 70% of the brokers in their New York office, literally everyone who was in the office that morning, were killed in the September 11 attacks. In 2004, Lutnick and then head of the London office Lee M. Amaitis decided to split Cantor Fitzgerald into two separate operations. Cantor would continue handling big trades through stock and bond trading desks, while a newly formed BGC Partners would offer broker-driven trading. This move enabled the two entities to grow independently of each other, but required Cantor to borrow $400 million in loans and go into debt for the first time as a company in order to properly fund BGC's initial growth. In 2008, Lutnick oversaw the merger of BGC Partners and eSpeed, a deal valued at $1.3 billion. September 11 attacks and aftermath At the time of the September 11 Attacks, Cantor Fitzgerald's offices occupied the 101-105th floors in the World Trade Center's North Tower, just above where a hijacked plane hit the building. None of the employees who were in the Cantor offices that morning survived the attacks. In total, 658 of Cantor's 960 employees died that day, including Lutnick's brother Gary Lutnick. Lutnick himself would have been in the office as well that morning, but on September 11 he was taking his son Kyle to his first day of kindergarten. In a short time after the attacks, Lutnick made several public appearances, and quickly became one of the most iconic figures from September 11. Because Cantor Fitzgerald lost two-thirds of its workforce, the company was in a vulnerable state, and many observers expected them to close. Four days after the attacks, on September 15, Lutnick announced amid much controversy, that he would have to stop the paychecks of nearly 700 employees who were missing or had died. In a televised interview with CNN's Larry King on September 19, Lutnick addressed the issue, saying “I lost everybody in the company… I don't have any money to pay their salaries.” In that same interview, Lutnick went on to say that while paychecks had been stopped, families of Cantor employees who had died in the attack would receive a 25% share of future Cantor profits for five years as well as health insurance for the next ten years. Combined, this package totaled more than $100,000 for each family. In 2006, the firm donated $180 million to the relatives of their employees affected by the 9/11 attack. In recent years, Lutnick has been featured in events and specials relating to September 11, including the documentary “Out of the Clear Blue Sky” by director Danielle Gardner. The movie theater version prominently featured Mount Hebron Cemetery in Queens, NY. In the DVD version a large portion of cemetery footage and storytelling has been edited out. The cemetery has a clear view of Manhattan including the World Trade Center Towers and current Freedom Tower. Philanthropy =Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund= Just days after the September 11 attacks, Lutnick established the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund as a non-profit organization to aid families of Cantor employees who perished in the attacks of September 11. The fund was started with a $1 million donation from Lutnick himself, and provided assistance for families of 9/11 victims from 14 different companies as well as Cantor. Lutnick's sister Edie Lutnick, a former labor lawyer, agreed to join the charity as executive director and co-founder. To date, the fund has given out approximately $180 million to families of Cantor employees and approximately $280 million altogether as the fund has broadened the scope of its efforts to assist victims of natural disasters and other hardships.Goldberg, Eleanor (January 15, 2013). \\"Cantor Fitzgerald Slacks on 9/11 Pledge, But Promises $10 Million to Sandy Relief\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved September 10, 2016. =Global Charity Day= Each year on September 11 (or the business day closest to September 11 if that day falls on a weekend), Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate BGC Partners hold a Global Charity Day event and pledge 100 percent of the day's revenue to charity. Since 2005, Global Charity Day events have raised approximately $113 million. Celebrities, sports stars and other notable individuals take part in the event on Cantor's and BGC's trading floors by speaking with clients throughout the day. Previous event participants have included President George Bush, President Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, Lady Gaga, Venus Williams, Eli Manning, Susan Sarandon, and Prince Harry, who holds the record for the largest single Global Charity Day trade. =Haverford College= In 2012, Lutnick was appointed to the Haverford College Board of Managers following a term of six years as a vice-chair. Lutnick endowed five student scholarships at Haverford and funded or led the efforts to fund several campus institutions: * Cantor Fitzgerald Art Gallery * Douglas B. Gardner '83 Integrated Athletic Center * Gary Lutnick Tennis & Track Center * Lutnick Library He has donated $65 million so far.https://www.haverford.edu/college- communications/news/board-chair-howard-w-lutnick-gives-25-million-lives-speak- campaign =Hurricane Sandy Relief= When Hurricane Sandy hit New York and New Jersey in October 2012, Lutnick pledged $10 million to aid families who were severely affected by the storm. Cantor Fitzgerald “adopted” 19 schools in communities that were hardest-hit and distributed $1,000 debit cards to nearly 10,000 families in neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Staten Island, and New Jersey. Sen. Charles Schumer and other public figures appeared with Lutnick at several schools. Lutnick, with the assistance of his wife Allison, sister Edie, and team of volunteers and employees, personally distributed the debit cards to parents beginning at Public School 256 in Far Rockaway. =Oklahoma Tornado Relief= After a tornado in Oklahoma killed dozens of people and caused an estimated $2 billion in damage, Lutnick appeared on Piers Morgan Live on CNN and pledged that his companies and the Cantor Relief Fund would donate $2 million to victims of the disaster. = Fundraising for Donald Trump = On May 16, 2019, Lutnick hosted a fundraiser for Donald Trump at his home in Manhattan, raising some $5 million, according to the President's aide.

Evidence Mars Odyssey found much evidence for water on Mars in the form of pictures and with a spectrometer it proved that much of the ground is loaded with ice. In July 2003, at a conference in California, it was announced that the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on board the Mars Odyssey had discovered huge amounts of water over vast areas of Mars. Mars has enough ice just beneath the surface to fill Lake Michigan twice. In both hemispheres, from 55 degrees latitude to the poles, Mars has a high density of ice just under the surface; one kilogram of soil contains about 500 g of water ice. But, close to the equator, there is only 2 to 10% of water in the soil. Scientists believe that much of this water is locked up in the chemical structure of minerals, such as clay and sulfates. Previous studies with infrared spectroscopes have provided evidence of small amounts of chemically or physically bound water. The Viking landers detected low levels of chemically bound water in the Martian soil. It is believed that although the upper surface only contains a percent or so of water, ice may lie just a few feet deeper. Some areas, Arabia Terra, Amazonis quadrangle, and Elysium quadrangle contain large amounts of water. Analysis of the data suggest that the southern hemisphere may have a layered structure. Both of the poles showed buried ice, but the north pole had none close to it because it was covered over by seasonal carbon dioxide (dry ice). When the measurements were gathered, it was winter at the north pole so carbon dioxide had frozen on top of the water ice. There may be much more water further below the surface; the instruments aboard the Mars Odyssey are only able to study the top meter or so of soil. If all holes in the soil were filled by water, this would correspond to a global layer of water 0.5 to 1.5 km deep. The Phoenix lander confirmed the initial findings of the Mars Odyssey. It found ice a few inches below the surface and the ice is at least 8 inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. In fact, some of the ice was exposed by the landing rockets of the craft. View underneath Phoenix lander towards south foot pad, showing patchy exposures of a bright surface that was later proven to be water ice, as predicted by theory and detected by Mars Odyssey. Thousands of images returned from Odyssey support the idea that Mars once had great amounts of water flowing across its surface. Some pictures show patterns of branching valleys. Others show layers that may have formed under lakes. Deltas have been identified. For many years researchers believed that glaciers existed under a layer of insulating rocks.Lineated valley fill is one example of these rock- covered glaciers. They are found on the floors of some channels. Their surfaces have ridged and grooved materials that deflect around obstacles. Some glaciers on the Earth show such features. Lineated floor deposits may be related to Lobate debris aprons, which have been proven to contain large amounts of ice by orbiting radar. The pictures below, taken with the THEMIS instrument on board the Mars Odyssey, show examples of features that are associated with water present in the present or past.

The partially circular depressions on the left side of the channel in the image above suggests that groundwater sapping also contributed water. In some areas large river valleys begin with a landscape feature called \\"Chaos\\" or Chaotic Terrain.\\" It is thought that the ground collapsed, as huge amounts of water were suddenly released.

Biography  Louis Van Lint studied painting at the Academy of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode (Brussels) under Henry Ottevaere and Jacques Maes until 1939. He studied sculpture and architecture as well. His early work reflects a traditional figurative painting style with a unique sense of color. In 1940 he founded the group \\"La Route Libre\\" with Gaston Bertrand and Anne Bonnet. His art was influenced to some degree by the animist movement, but he eventually broke away with the presentation of his painting, The Flayed Body (L'Ecorche, 1943), a shocking expression of his wish for more artistic freedom that consequently sounded a revolt against animism. As his style matured, he switched to abstraction in which he excelled as colorist and master of form. After World War II he co- founded The Young Belgian Painters (La Jeune Peinture Belge) with Gaston Bertrand, Anne Bonnet and some others.Will Grohmann, Sam Hunter, New art around the world: painting and sculpture, H. N. Abrams, New York, 1966, p. 220 Van Lint experimented with geometric abstraction for a decade, and then, influenced by the French painter Bazaine, he started his lyrical abstraction period. He participated in the demonstrations and exhibitions of the CoBrA group.Cobra, Lannoo, Tielt, 2008 In 1958, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation gave him a prize and in 1960 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium. In the 1960s, he introduced Hergé to abstract painting and provided him with private lessons for one year.Michael Farr, The adventures of Hergé, cretor of Tintin, Last Gasp, San Francisco, 2007, p. 39, He has long been represented in Belgian section in outstanding exhibitions of contemporary paintingin The 1958 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Painting and Sculpture, Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute Press, 1958 and his work is held by several museums all over the world such as the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, the Uffizi Gallery of Florence,http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/en/mostre/mostra.php?t=5395c21df1c3bcf00f000000 the Guggenheim and the Brooklyn museums in New York, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, and the São Paulo Contemporary Art Museum in Brazil.

He has been guest soloist and recitalist in major festivals and venues in the United States and in Europe, notably the Weimar Franz Liszt Festival and the Beethovenfest in Bonn,Beethovenfest. 2006 Programme, p. 6 the Fetes Romantiques de Nohant Festival in France, as well as the Kennedy Center and the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Early on he entered the class of Earle C. Voorhies, whose own professor was Alexander Siloti, one of Liszt's pupils, and a cousin and teacher of Rachmaninov. After graduating from the University of Southern California, he moved to Europe in 1986 where he became a protege of Rudolf Buchbinder at the Musik-Akademie in Basel, Switzerland. In Basel, he studied chamber music with Walter Levin, founder and first violinist of the LaSalle Quartet, and pianist Gérard Wyss. Later, he was a Fulbright scholar in the class of Karl-Heinz Kammerling at the Hochschule für Musik in Hannover, Germany, and pursued doctoral studies at La Sorbonne in Paris. In chamber music, his partners include Michaela Paetsch, and Axel Strauss. He was artistic director of the Franz Liszt Festival in Alsace, France from 1997 to 2003. He now lives in the Los Angeles area with his family. Reception Le Van's recordings have been praised for their sensitivity, emotional depth, and power. His debut CD of Brahms' Sonatas no.1 & no.3 for Gallo Records immediately drew positive reviews. Jacques Bonnaure in Repertoire stated that he is one of the most important Brahms interpreters since Julius Katchen, and compared Le Van to Curzon and Arrau. Le Monde de la musique praised Le Van's \\"lyrical generosity and expressive sincerity.\\" The Revue Musicale de Suisse Romande wrote of him as \\"an artist of the highest caliber.\\" The BBC Music Magazine described his performances as \\"powerfully impressive\\". Bernard Jacobson in Fanfare Magazine elaborates on his \\"profound understanding\\" and his \\"sovereign technical facility\\". Le Van's survey of Liszt's chamber music, with cellist Guido Schiefen for Arte Nova (BMG), earned them the Neue Musik Zeitung's award \\"Critic Choice\\" for Best Chamber Music Disc of the Year in 2000. Adrian Corleonis in Fanfare qualified the performers' contribution to the Liszt discography as \\"significant\\", and lauded their \\"consummate artistry and hand-in-glove collaboration.\\" Donald Vroon in The American Record Guide expressed that \\"Le Van here is better than any pianist on any chamber recording of these pieces.\\" As for the premiere of Raff's works for piano and violin on Tudor Records, the Joachim Raff Society published an online review stating that: \\"if you plan to buy only one Raff recording this year, then this is the one.\\" On Classical Net, Donald Satz extensively reviewed the CD, concluding: \\"This is one of the most enjoyable recordings I have listened to in the past few years. Great music does not play itself; it needs exceptional performers to highlight its architecture and the compelling nature of its musical lines and progression. Neftel and Le Van have done this with a level of artistry and technique that is stunning. I give the recording a 10/10; the Satz Rating Scale shows the disc to be off the charts.\\" Likewise, his readings of the complete Scriabin Mazurkas for Music & Arts were described by Bryce Morrison in Gramophone as \\"magically fleet and affectionate,\\" \\"youthful, ardent and communicative.\\" The BBC Music Magazine gave it 4 stars, with Matthew Rye praising the \\"freshness and lustre of his tone--captured in one of the most natural piano recordings I have heard for some time.\\" Fanfare Magazine, citing \\"artistry of the highest order\\", described Mr. Le Van as \\" uncannily sensitive to Scriabin's nuances of phrase and harmonic subtleties,\\" and Peter J. Rabinowitz selected the recording for the Want List 2004 of indispensable new recordings to have: \\"Eric Le Van plays with a rhythmic flexibility that few other living pianists could carry off. It's what you might call a polemical disc--certainly, it offers an extreme and distinctive interpretive perspective. But Le Van expresses his position in a way that's convincing, even mesmerizing.\\" In an in-depth review on the website MusicWeb International, critic Donald Satz concluded: \\"it is not an easy task to be competitive with the greatest Scriabin pianists of the past as Vladimir Sofronitsky, Samuel Feinberg, Sviatoslav Richter, Roberto Szidon, Vladimir Horowitz, and Scriabin himself. Le Van deserves to be placed in this exalted company, and he enjoys the best sonics that modern techniques can offer.\\" Of second Brahms CD, the American Record Guide commented: \\"it is exhilarating to hear Brahms playing that feels so alive.\\" L'éducation musicale hailed Le Van as \\"a worldwide Brahms authority.\\" Le Van's recording \\"Exil. Piano Music by Composers with Roots in Two Continents\\" was released in 2013 with Music & Arts. It features the works - including world premieres - of five Jewish composers who were amongst the wave of intellectuals and artists who left Europe in the 1930s for the United States: Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Erich Zeisl, Ernst Toch, Arnold Schoenberg, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. These emigres, fleeing the upsurge of European fascism, contributed to make Southern California one of the capitals of world culture, and profoundly altered the horizons of American music and the arts. Zeisl biographer Malcolm Cole heralds these composers' works as \\"magnificently served\\" in Le Van's own readings, and Barbara Zeisl Schoenberg, daughter of Erich Zeisl and daughter-in-law of Arnold Schoenberg, endorses the CD as \\"deeply moving and thrilling\\": \\"Le Van played my father's pieces with so much emotion and beauty. I have listened to all the pieces on the CD and he plays them all wonderfully, including the Schoenberg which I have heard many times: he renders them so lyrically which makes them sound, though modern, so romantic and beautiful!\\" The New York Times' chief music critic Anthony Tommasini has praised the CD as \\"a fascinating new recording.\\". Le Van's recording was featured on HBDirect's magazine, and was also recommended on Expedition Audio. He has given several interviews on this release, including for Pizzicato magazine.

He is a recording artist and a frequent performer, initially in and around his birthplace in Birmingham UK, and more recently in Adelaide, Australia, presenting concerts featuring original solo piano music with a classical influence. Batsford is also a co-creator of creative network Project X Presents and Musituality, a platform for musicians of various faiths to perform together. Biography =Early life= Born in Birmingham, Batsford lived from early childhood in and around the suburban Moseley area, known as a focal point for the city’s musical and creative communities. Beginning his musical and vocal training as a choirboy in St Marys Church, he went on to sing in the National Youth Choir and the CBSO Chorus. =Early career= In the 1990s Batsford performed as singer and main songwriter in Indie Guitar bands including Maroon. Two of his dark, short stories were published in fiction magazines in the UK and America. For ten years, he booked and promoted comedy show The GAG Club, worked as a booking agent and artist agent as well as performing as a stand up comic, and he was one of the original partners in setting up the Birmingham Comedy Festival. He wrote numerous preview articles about stand up comedy and classical music for the Metro Newspaper and appeared as an actor in 'Perfect Scenario', a featurette produced as an extra for the BBC DVD release of Doctor Who serial 'Frontier in Space'. Solo career In 2007 Batsford collaborated with krautrock/shoegaze band Einstellung, for a concert named 'Das Land Ohne Musik' in which Batsford both supported and accompanied the band, highlighting elements of post-rock shared by both artists. A live album recording of the concert was released in early 2018. In September 2009, Batsford released Valentine Court, a debut album of solo piano music on his own Mouflon Music label drawing comparisons with minimalist composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass and impressionist Claude Debussy. A new recording of the album was released in 2018 entitled Valentine Court Recaught. In 2009 he made his major festival debut with an appearance at The Big Chill music festival performing in the Vida La Vida tent curated by ambient DJ Mixmaster MorrisBig Chill Festival programme, page 69 and was given an encore. Other festival appearances include Gigbeth, Drop Beats Not Bombs and ArtsFest \\\\- the latter on an outdoor stage in Birmingham's Centenary Square. In June 2011 he showcased Mindfulmess, an album of songs with a well received concert at mac (the Midlands Arts Centre). The album, released in 2012, features lyrics partly inspired by his Buddhist spiritual practice with elaborate vocal harmonies owing a debt to a lifelong appreciation of pop artist Brian Wilson, all accompanied by his delicate trademark piano patterns. He performed his show \\"Mindfulmess\\" at both the Edinburgh and Melbourne Fringes in 2012 and the Adelaide Fringe in 2013 presenting a biographical performance which was praised by Fringe Review for its \\"harmonious and artful transitions from light to dark, despondent to hopeful\\". He performed at the Adelaide fringe again in 2014, with a show called \\"Classically Chilled Piano\\", which was rated as an 'Outstanding Show' by Fringe Review and again in 2015, with a show called \\"Piano Amoroso\\". His third album, In The Moment, a collection of ten solo piano improvisations was released in 2014. Also in 2014 Batsford was chosen via a competitive process to compose and perform a score to Australian silent feature film Robbery Under Arms. A piano piece called \\"Saticity\\" has been included in the release of Erik Satie et les Nouveaux Jeunes Version 2, an album of tributes to the composer Erik Satie by French label Arbouse Recordings and another, \\"Mysterious Moment\\", on an album by Greek pianist Kosmas Lapatas. In early 2016 Batsford collaborated with projection artist Zero from Illuminart to produce an audio visual project called \\"Piano Illuminato\\" which was presented in Adelaide Town Hall. Batsford's own recordings of his solo piano music have been broadcast on Australia's national classical radio station ABC Classic FM. Since July 2018 a relationship with US digital label Sonder House has resulted in the release of several solo piano tracks and also an EP recorded in collaboration with Australian sound artist Jason Sweeney. Batsford plays a Roland FP4 digital piano. Collaborative projects =Project X Presents= Batsford co-created the creative network Project X Presents with Marc Reck, Anne-Marie Pope and Anthony Ramm, producing a series of five events dubbed \\"Omnimedia Experiences\\" beginning with Like Fxck in July 2006 in the Epic Skate Park in Birmingham. The events featured artists from a wide range of disciplines coming together to blend their work into a seamless, immersive event lasting up to seven hours, usually presented across three stages, with the audience in the middle The Birmingham Post described the event as \\"destabilising the established role of the ‘spectator’ in performance theatre and drawing you in to an impressively eclectic and complex mix of art forms\\". =Musituality= The Musituality project grew out of a series of concerts called \\"Music by Candlelight\\" St Mary’s Church, Moseley, organised by Rich Batsford as part of the Moseley Festival. The concert held in July 2008 included a small choir called St Mary’s Schola, which consists of a double quartet of singers drawn from St Mary’s Church Choir, alongside performances of Qawwali and nasheed from Islamic vocal group A’ashiq Al Rasul. Inspired by the success of the event, in particular the coming together of Christian and Islamic elements in a Christian building, Mick Perrier of St Marys Schola and Amran Ellahi of A’ashiq Al Rasul joined with Rich Batsford to create Musituality—a portmanteau combining the words music and spirituality. The project was launched to a full capacity audience at Birmingham Cathedral in 2009 in a concert well received by the local music community. A further concert in 2010 at the Birmingham Buddhist Centre saw the same collaboration.  Personal life  Batsford stood as candidate for the Green Party in Acocks Green ward in the 2004 local government elections. In 2012 he emigrated to Adelaide, Australia, where he is training for ordination into the Triratna Buddhist Order.

It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, and type inference. History Dart was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, Denmark, October 10–12, 2011. The project was founded by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund. Dart 1.0 was released on November 14th, 2013. Dart initially had a mixed reception and the Dart initiative has been criticized by some for fragmenting the web, due to the original plans to include a Dart VM in Chrome. Those plans were dropped in 2015 with the 1.9 release of Dart to focus instead on compiling Dart to JavaScript. In August 2018, Dart 2.0 was released, with language changes including a sound type system. Dart 2.6 introduced a new extension, dart2native. The feature extends native compilation to the Linux, macOS, and Windows desktop platforms. Earlier developers were able to create new tools only using Android or iOS devices. Moreover, with this extension it becomes possible to compose a Dart program into self-contained executables. Thus, according to the company representatives, it’s not obligatory now to have Dart SDK installed, the self- contained executables can now start running in a few seconds. The new extension is also integrated with Flutter toolkit, thus making it possible to use the compiler on small services (backend supporting for example). ;Standardization Ecma International has formed technical committee TC52 to work on standardizing Dart, and inasmuch as Dart can be compiled to standard JavaScript, it works effectively in any modern browser. Ecma International approved the Dart language specification first edition in July 2014, at its 107th General Assembly, and a second edition in December 2014. The latest specification is available at Dart language specification. Usage There are four ways to run Dart code: ;Compiled as JavaScript: To run in mainstream web browsers, Dart relies on a source-to-source compiler to JavaScript. According to the project site, Dart was \\"designed to be easy to write development tools for, well-suited to modern app development, and capable of high-performance implementations.\\" When running Dart code in a web browser the code is precompiled into JavaScript using the dart2js compiler. Compiled as JavaScript, Dart code is compatible with all major browsers with no need for browsers to adopt Dart. Through optimizing the compiled JavaScript output to avoid expensive checks and operations, code written in Dart can, in some cases, run faster than equivalent code hand-written using JavaScript idioms. ;Stand-alone:The Dart software development kit (SDK) ships with a stand-alone Dart VM, allowing Dart code to run in a command-line interface environment. As the language tools included in the Dart SDK are written mostly in Dart, the stand-alone Dart VM is a critical part of the SDK. These tools include the dart2js compiler and a package manager called pub. Dart ships with a complete standard library allowing users to write fully working system apps, such as custom web servers. ;Ahead-of-time compiled:Dart code can be AOT-compiled into machine code (native instruction sets). Apps built with Flutter, a mobile app SDK built with Dart, are deployed to app stores as AOT-compiled Dart code. ;Native:Dart 2.6 with dart2native compiler to compile to self-contained, native executables code. Before Dart 2.6, this feature only exposed this capability on iOS and Android mobile devices via Flutter. Isolates To achieve concurrency, Dart uses isolates, which are independent workers that do not share memory, but instead use message passing. This is similar to Erlang processes (see also Actor model). Every Dart program uses at least one isolate, which is the main isolate. Since Dart 2 the Dart web platform no longer supports isolates, and suggests developers use Web Workers instead. Snapshots Snapshots are a core part of the Dart VM. Snapshots are files which store objects and other runtime data. ;Script snapshots :Dart programs can be compiled into snapshot files. These files contain all of the program code and dependencies preparsed and ready to execute. This allows fast startups. ;Full snapshots :The Dart core libraries can be compiled into a snapshot file which allows fast loading of the libraries. Most standard distributions of the main Dart VM have a prebuilt snapshot for the core libraries which is loaded at runtime. ;Object snapshots :Dart is a very asynchronous language. With this, it uses isolates for concurrency. Since these are workers which pass messages, it needs a way to serialize a message. This is done using a snapshot, which is generated from a given object, and then this is transferred to another isolate for deserializing. Native mobile apps Google has introduced Flutter for native mobile app development on both Android and iOS. Flutter is a mobile app SDK, complete with framework, widgets, and tools, that gives developers a way to build and deploy mobile apps, written in Dart. Flutter works with Firebase and other mobile app SDKs, and is open source. Compiling to JavaScript The Dart SDK contains two Dart-to-JavaScript compilers. During development, dartdevc supports quick refresh cycles. For the final version of an app, dart2js produces deployable JavaScript. The first compiler to generate JavaScript from Dart code was dartc, but it was deprecated. The second Dart-to-JavaScript compiler was Frog. It was written in Dart, but never implemented the full semantics of the language. The third Dart-to-JavaScript compiler was dart2js. An evolution of earlier compilers, dart2js is written in Dart and intended to implement the full Dart language specification and semantics. On March 28, 2013, the Dart team posted an update on their blog addressing Dart code compiled to JavaScript with the dart2js compiler, stating that it now runs faster than handwritten JavaScript on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for the DeltaBlue benchmark. Editors On November 18, 2011, Google released Dart Editor, an open-source program based on Eclipse components, for macOS, Windows, and Linux-based operating systems. The editor supports syntax highlighting, code completion, JavaScript compiling, running web and server Dart applications, and debugging. On August 13, 2012, Google announced the release of an Eclipse plugin for Dart development. On April 18, 2015, Google announced that the Dart Editor would be retired in favor of the JetBrains integrated development environment (IDE), which is now the recommended IDE for the language. The Dart plugin is available for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, PhpStorm and WebStorm. This plugin supports many features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, analysis, refactoring, debugging, and more. Other plugins are available for editors like Sublime Text, Atom, Emacs, Vim and Visual Studio Code. =Chrome Dev Editor= In 2013, the Chromium team began work on an open source, Chrome App-based development environment with a reusable library of GUI widgets, codenamed Spark. The project was later renamed as Chrome Dev Editor. It was built in Dart, and contained Spark which is powered by Polymer. In June 2015, Google transferred the CDE project to GitHub as a free software project and ceased active investment in CDE. As of April 2019 Chrome Dev Editor is no longer in active development. =DartPad= The Dart team created DartPad at the start of 2015, to provide an easier way to start using Dart. It is a fully online editor from which users can experiment with Dart application programming interfaces (APIs), and run Dart code. It provides syntax highlighting, code analysis, code completion, documentation, and HTML and CSS editing. SIMD In 2013, John McCutchan announced that he had created a performant interface to single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction sets for Dart. The interface consists of two types: * Float32×4, 4× single precision floating point values * Uint32×4, 4× 32-bit unsigned integer values Instances of these types are immutable and in optimized code are mapped directly to SIMD registers. Operations expressed in Dart typically are compiled into one instruction with no overhead. This is similar to C and C++ intrinsics. Benchmarks for 4×4 matrix multiplication, 3D vertex transformation, and Mandelbrot set visualization show near 400% speedup compared to scalar code written in Dart. Example A Hello World example: void main() { print('Hello World!'); } A function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number: int fib(int n) => (n > 2) ? (fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)) : 1; // A Fibonacci function implementation with a conditional operator in Dart // This code is read as: // given an integer n, // if n > 2, return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); // otherwise, return the integer 1 as result void main() { print('fib(20) = \${fib(20)}'); } A simple class: // Import the math library to get access to the sqrt function. // Imported with \`math\` as name, so accesses need to use \`math.\` as prefix. import 'dart:math' as math; // Create a class for Point. class Point { // Final variables cannot be changed once they are assigned. // Declare two instance variables. final num x, y; // A constructor, with syntactic sugar for setting instance variables. // The constructor has two mandatory parameters. Point(this.x, this.y); // A named constructor with an initializer list. Point.origin() : x = 0, y = 0; // A method. num distanceTo(Point other) { var dx = x - other.x; var dy = y - other.y; return math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy); } // Example of a \\"getter\\". // Acts the same as a final variable, but is computed on each access. num get magnitude => math.sqrt(x * x + y * y); // Example of operator overloading Point operator +(Point other) => Point(x + other.x, y + other.y); // When you instantiate a class such as Point in Dart 2+, new is // an optional word } // All Dart programs start with main(). void main() { // Instantiate point objects. var p1 = Point(10, 10); print(p1.magnitude); var p2 = Point.origin(); var distance = p1.distanceTo(p2); print(distance); } Influences from other languages Dart is a descendant of the ALGOL language family, alongside C, Java, C#, JavaScript, and others. The method cascade syntax, which provides a syntactic shortcut for invoking several methods one after another on the same object, is adopted from Smalltalk. Dart's mixins were influenced by Strongtalk and Ruby. Dart makes use of isolates as a concurrency and security unit when structuring applications. The Isolate concept builds upon the Actor model, which is most famously implemented in Erlang. The Mirror API for performing controlled and secure reflection was first proposed in a paper by Gilad Bracha (who is a member of the Dart team) and David Ungar and originally implemented in Self.

Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. The building was formerly the home of Dance Theatre Workshop, with which the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company merged 2011 to form New York Live Arts.Its activities encompass commissioning, producing, and presenting works of dance, performance and music, together with allied education programming and services for artists. Live Arts is located in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood. Its building features a 184-seat theater, rehearsal studios and offices. History New York Live Arts was created in 2011 through the merger of Dance Theater Workshop and The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. Dance Theater Workshop was struggling with operating costs related to the building it opened in 2002 and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company had been looking to establish its first studio/office facility. The latter organization had recently been advised that its bid to become a tenant of a new building in Harlem had been rejected despite its having secured commitments of $13 million in public funding to support the development of the space. News of the merged concerned the New York City contemporary dance scene. This concern was mostly addressed through a series of community discussions and board proposals that presented it as necessary for the organizations' survival. Simultaneous with the merger announcement, the two entities unveiled the New York Live Arts name, noting that the omission of the word \\"dance\\" was meant to suggest potential future directions encompassing a wider range of art forms. Governance and management New York Live Arts is overseen by an 18-member board. Bill T. Jones serves as Artistic Director, supported by Associate Artistic Director Janet Wong. Kim Cullen is Executive Director overseeing day-to-day operations in concert with approximately 25 full-time staff members New York Live Arts' annual budget is approximately $5 million, supported by philanthropic contributions, earned income, and government support. Major programs The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company is the largest and most visible program of New York Live Arts. The company, founded in 1982, tours internationally and has long been considered a leading force in contemporary dance. It has been a primary vehicle for Bill T. Jones to realize his creative vision, and is noted for its engagement with political and social issues. The company rehearses at New York Live Arts and occasionally performs there. In addition to Bill T. Jones' programming, New York Live Arts mounts an annual season of performances at its theater that features of a range of artists and companies, presented both independently and in partnership with other organizations. These programs include: Live Ideas, a humanities festival; The Randjelovic/Stryker Resident Commissioned Artist, a two-year residency for distinguished mid-career artists; another residency program known as Live Feed; and Fresh Tracks a professional development program and showcase for early-career artists. Building New York Live Arts occupies the basement and first three levels of an 11-story condominium tower. The basement and first level are dedicated to the 184-seat theater, lobby and supporting spaces. In the theater, a high- ceilinged black-box space with a 42 x 30 foot sprung floor abuts a steeply- raked fixed seating area on one side. The second level of the building is devoted to offices and meeting rooms. The third level features two 1,200 square-foot windowed rehearsal studios, also with sprung floors, that can be combined to create a single space.

The owner and operator of Copper Fox Distillery is Rick Wasmund. History Before starting Copper Fox, Wasmund apprenticed for six weeks at the Bowmore distillery on the Isle of Islay, learning the art of floor malting. Copper Fox was licensed to begin distilling by the Virginia ABC board in 2005 as a limited distiller (<5,000 gallons), and that year Copper Fox opened its first distillery in Sperryville, VA, in a converted apple packaging plant. Pursuing an additional location, Copper Fox purchased the historic Lord Paget Motor Inn in Williamsburg, VA, in 2015. They opened their second distillery location in July 2016, and both are operational today. Process Barrels aging at the Copper Fox Distillery in Sperryville, VA Copper Fox uses barley bred specifically for the distillery and grown in Virginia, and Copper Fox is the only distiller in the United States to do 100% of its own malting. During the malt drying process, fruitwood (including applewood and cherrywood) smokes the grain, similar to peat smoke use in Scotch whiskies. All the wood used for the smoke comes from local orchards. In addition to malting for their own products, Copper Fox sells a portion of their malt to breweries, who use it to make beer.\\"Copper Fox Distillery: Meet Virginia Makers.\\" The Virginia Distillers Association - Virginia Spirits Home, Virginia Spirits, 9 Jan. 2018 Copper Fox whisky is distilled in a copper pot still and aged in used bourbon barrels (from another Virginia distillery, A. Smith Bowman, maker of Virginia Gentleman bourbon). Copper Fox utilizes 'chipping' in the aging of their whisky, adding a sachet of small chunks or 'chips' of charred wood to the aging barrel. Using this accelerated technique, Copper Fox whiskies are aged at a minimum of twelve months, compared to the 3 year minimum for Scotch Whisky. In addition to single malt whiskies, Copper Fox produces whiskies made from rye, clear spirits, and a botanical gin. They also plan on releasing a bourbon in the future. All bottles of alcohol produced at Copper Fox are filled and labelled by hand.

History and details Throughout the centuries, the Vienna Protestants did not have their own graveyard but were buried among Catholics in Catholic cemeteries. In May 1856 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria agreed to reformations which allowed for the creation of cemeteries of other denominations. The Protestant church acquired a plot of land at the outlying village of Matzleinsdorf that same year and began the construction of their first cemetery in Vienna. The original plans included a chapel, a home for undertakers, a mortuary and various storage facilities. The famous Austrian architect Theophil Hansen was contracted for the project. However the construction of the cemetery would take two years as the Protestant church ran out of money and needed to finance construction through donations. On May 7, 1858 the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery finally opened and on September 27, 1860 the chapel Christuskirche (Chapel of the Holy Christ) was completed and consecrated. The Chapel has a distinct architectural style which is reminiscent of an Eastern Orthodox Church. The architect, Theophil Hansen, was influenced heavily by historical features prominent during the 19th century and constructed the church in a Byzantium style with a large dome and crowned corner pillars. The entrance has a golden mosaic that shows Christ holding a holy scroll. The interior of the chapel is characterized by 35 statues of angels made in a style similar to figureheads of Spanish galleons. They symbolize worship, dogma and annunciation. The ornate stained glass windows are ornamented with Christian symbols and pictures of birth, crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ. During its long history, the Matzleinsdorf cemetery became so popular among the Viennese Protestants that it needed to be enlarged twice due to a lack of space. However, when the Zentralfriedhof got its own Protestant section, the Matzleinsdorf fell into disuse and discussion about its retention embarked and lasts ever since. Finally, in 1943 the cemetery suffered heavy destruction during Allied bombings due to its proximity to the Vienna Railway Station South, a primary target of the Allied forces. Today, it has been largely restored but still suffers from competition of the more popular Protestant Section at Zentralfriedhof.

Biographies Ed Davenport was born February 9, 1899, in Pittsburgh or McKeesport, Pennsylvania, the son of John Wesley Davenport of Fort Hamilton, New York.Ed Davenport's Los Angeles Public Library reference file No. 1 He studied business administration at the University of Pittsburgh and law at Southwestern University. In his working life, he was in the advertising business in Upstate New York from 1920 to 1926 and then was general manager of a department store in Utica, New York, from 1926 to 1929. He then became advertising and public relations manager for Frank Knox, the general manager of Hearst Publications, from 1929 to 1932, after which he moved to California and started his own agency. Harriett Goodmanson, who was born in Victoria, British Columbia, was brought to the United States when she was less than a year old and became a U.S. citizen through the citizenship of her father. She attended high school in Bellingham, Washington, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley.

Because of the Gallery’s sometimes association with Dada and the prevalent use of the pointing index finger by Dada artists, some have conjectured that the Gallery East logo was lifted, thereby identifying it with that particular anti-art movement. However, it was a pure coincidence. The deco-style pointing index finger was from a shipping label used on freight boxes and was found in a desk when the gallery moved into the 24 East Street location.

A metaphor is a literary figure of speech that uses an image, story or tangible thing to represent a less tangible thing or some intangible quality or idea; e.g., \\"Her eyes were glistening jewels\\".

These companies benefit from special taxation rules and duty-free imports. The enabling act for Registered Free Zones in Nigeria came into effect in 1992. The Calabar Free Trade Zone, the first of these, was fully completed by 1999 and started operation after official commissioning in November 2001. The CFTZ is owned by the Federal government. Lack of dredging in the Calabar River channel was also affecting the zone, forcing companies to rely on Port Harcourt or Lagos for import and export of goods. These problems had not been addressed by December 2010, when the General Manager of the zone said the epileptic power supply, poor quality roads and non dredging of the river channel had slowed development of the port. He said \\"... often times we have had cases of containers dropping from trucks due to bad roads. It is also additional cost to transport containers from Port Harcourt and Lagos to Calabar\\". The Tinapa Free Zone & Resort, to the north of the Free Zone, was commissioned on 2 April 2007, intended to combine business and recreational functions with duty-free shopping. The legal status of the Tinapa Free Trade zone has been uncertain. It is owned by the Cross River state government, but only the Federal government can operate a free trade zone. Governor Liyel Imoke appealed to the Federal Government to take a stake in the project, and to remove uncertainty about Tinapa's status, which is hindering investment. In September 2009, Cross River Governor Liyel Imoke said the 1992 laws that established the Calabar Export Processing Zone should be overhauled to match its current status as a Free Trade Zone. He also said the 2005 gazette that made Calabar Port a Free Port should be implemented. In August 2011, Olusegun Aganga, the Federal Minister of Trade and Investment, visited the Calabar Free Trade Zone and the Tinapa Business and Leisure resort. He said that the government planned an extensive review of Free Trade Zones across the country to ensure they met the requirements to attract Foreign Direct Investment and to create jobs.

Hearne (; 189329 March 1969https://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/p0291-hearne-john- descriptive-catalogue.pdf) was an Irish legal scholar and diplomat whose role in the drafting of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland was so important that he was referred to as \\"Ireland's Thomas Jefferson\\". Biography John Hearne was the youngest son of Alderman Richard Hearne, a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, who twice served as Mayor of Waterford, and Alice Mary Hearne (née Power). His older brother Canon Maurice Hearne served as parish priest in Cahir. Hearne attended Waterpark College (Christian Brothers). He went to train for the priesthood at St. John's College, Waterford transferring in 1911 to Maynooth College after a year. Here he completed a BA degree in Arts and Philosophy from National University of Ireland, enrolling in a Theology Degree which he didn't complete. He left in 1916 having decided not to become a priest, and studied for the degree of barrister at law at the King's Inns. He also studied law at University College Dublin being awarded an LLB Degree. In 1937, during the government of Éamon de Valera, he was working as a legal expert in the Department of External Affairs when de Valera called on him to assist in the writing of the new constitution, which would replace the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State. With Maurice Gerard Moynihan, Hearne drew up the first draft of the constitution; according to Moynihan, Hearne had been instrumental in convincing de Valera that a new constitution was necessary in the first place. The exact role of Hearne is not evident from the remaining documents; it is not clear who actually wrote the first draft, and according to the Irish historian John Joseph Lee, \\"Much remains to be uncovered about the planning and drafting of the constitution, including not least the roles of John Hearne, the legal adviser to External Affairs, and of Maurice Moynihan.\\" After his legal career, Hearne filled a number of diplomatic positions. In 1939, he was appointed High Commissioner to Canada. In March 1950, he became the first Irish ambassador to the United States, and was welcomed in Boston on 13 May 1950. He began the tradition of presenting a bowl of shamrock to the White House on St Patrick's Day. Ireland's first ambassador to the US to be honoured, Irish Times, April 22, 2018 In 1954, he gave the commencement address at Boston College, and on that occasion was awarded with an honorary degree. In 1960, after retiring from the diplomatic service, he became a legislative consultant to Nigeria and Ghana, which had recently acquired independence, albeit within the Commonwealth. He died in Dublin in 1969. On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Irish constitution, Hearne's birthplace (8 William Street in Waterford) was marked with a tribute. A bust of Hearne was unveiled in Waterford on 3 July 2017 on the 80th anniversary of the constitution. A bust of Hearne stands in the garden of Iveagh House, headquarters of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. A biography of Hearne, \\"John Hearne: Architect of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland\\" by Eugene Broderick was published in 2017.

It is situated in the neighbourhood of Chepauk in Chennai, India and is constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture.  History  By the end of the Carnatic Wars, the previously independent kingdom of the Carnatic had virtually become a protectorate of the British East India Company. The Nawab Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah (VIII) was a close friend and ally of the British and was dependent on Company troops for his protection. So, in 1764, he thought of constructing a palace for himself within the ramparts of Fort St George. However, due to space constraints, Wallajah was forced to abandon his plans and instead constructed a palace at Chepauk, a few miles to the south of the fort. Known for its intricate carvings, wide arches, red brick walls and lime mortar, Chepauk Palace was built by the engineer Paul Benfield, who completed it in 1768. It was one of the first buildings in India to be built in the Indo-Saracenic style. According to historian S. Muthiah: \\"Paul Benfield, an East India Company engineer turned contractor, made buildings to last, a reputation that made him rich.\\" When the principality of Carnatic was abolished in 1855 as per the Doctrine of Lapse, the Chepauk Palace was brought to auction to pay off the Nawab's debts and was eventually purchased by the Madras government. The palace functioned as the office of the revenue board and the Public Works Department (PWD) Secretariat. The palace comprises two blocks, namely, Kalas Mahal and Humayun Mahal. Kalas Mahal was the official residence of the Nawabs from 1768 to 1855. Humayun Mahal, the northern block, was virtually rebuilt between 1868 and 1871 by Robert Chisholm when assigned the work of creating a new records office and building for the Revenue Board by Governor Lord Napier. Originally Humayun Mahal had been single story with the Diwan-e-Khana Durbar Hall in its middle over which there was a dome. To transform Humayun Mahal, Chisholm removed the tower, added a first floor and Madras terraced roof. He also added a facade that matched the Khalsa Mahal, which can be seen from the Wallajah Road. To compensate for removing the dome he also added a new eastern entrance, also in the style of the Khalsa Mahal, that faces the beach. Rather than being part of the Humayun Mahal, this new entrance was built as a square block in front of the Mahal and was called the Records Office. In 1859, the former Survey School became the Civil Engineering College and moved into part of Kalasa Mahal. The college was renamed College of Engineering in 1861. In 1862 the accommodation for the College was extended to a part of the lower floor and the whole of the upper floor. The Government Carnatic Agent occupied the remainder of the lower floor.

This move finally occurred in 1923. In 2010, a roof collapsed in the Humayun Mahal and as of 2013 the Public Works Department, which was charged with the palace's maintenance, had not cleared the debris. Also in 2010, following an inspection, the building was declared not fit for occupation as it was structurally unstable. Commenting on this in 2013 an engineer said \\"We realised that it was beyond restoration.\\" In 2012, a fire, which killed a member of the fire service, gutted the Khalsa Mahal. K. V. Ramalingam, Public Works Department minister, said that as only the walls remained the building would have to be demolished. A descendant of the Nawab Wallajah, Nawab Muhammed Abdul Ali, called on Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to restore Chepauk Palace. Until the southern building, Khalsa Mahal, was gutted by fire, it had remained virtually as it was first built. It had at the west and south minareted entrances and was a handsome two-story building. In 2013, there was a further roof collapse in the Humayun Mahal. In 2017, Kalas Mahal was restored and will be the home of the National Green Tribunal, Southern Bench. Also in 2017 the PWD started the process of restoring Humayun Mahal.  Architecture  The Chepauk Palace comprises two blocks—the northern block is known as Kalas Mahal while the southern block is known as Humayun Mahal. The palace is built over an area of 117 acres and is surrounded by a wall. The Humayun Mahal is spread over 66,000 square feet and has ventilators on the terrace and a connecting corridor to the Kalas Mahal. In 2017, the Public Works Department submitted a proposal to the tourism department to restore Humayun Mahal at a cost of 380 million.

On September 2014, Nakamoto's p2p account was allegedly hacked and a post was made to his account that said his information was being sold on Darknet.  Chokepoint Project  The Chokepoint project was established in 2011 following the Internet blackouts in Egypt and Libya. The internet blackouts inspired two members of the P2P Foundation, James Burke and Chris Pinchen, to create the Chokepoint Project. The project's aim is to create a live visual map of the internet that identifies Chokepoints and people holding access to these Chokepoints. Chokepoints are defined as points of Internet access vulnerability. This map would potentially allow people to identify the degree and precise location of internet outages. Much of the data used for the mapping is supplied by volunteers. The Chokepoint project also works to dispel the assumption that the internet is a decentralized medium that is not subject to government power. For those who are subject to internet blackouts, the Chokepoint projects also provides methods of circumventing these chokepoints and information on legal matters regarding the internet blackouts. The Chokepoint project was awarded the Prix Arts Electronica in May 2011 in the Next Idea category.

He played five games in Major League Baseball with the Boston Braves in 1943. Biography A native of Danvers, Massachusetts, Creeden attended Danvers High School and St. John's Preparatory School. Creeden played summer baseball for two seasons in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). In 1938 with Orleans, he batted over .400 to lead the CCBL. In 1939, Creeden again flirted with the .400 mark while leading Falmouth to the CCBL title. In 1941, he was appointed athletic director at the Falmouth community center. Creeden made his major league debut with the Boston Braves in 1943. He pinch hit in five games over the span of eight days, and did not play in the field. In his five plate appearances, he recorded one hit, one walk, and one RBI.Career statistics and history at Baseball-Reference.com His only major league hit came on May 2 in the first game of the Braves' doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies at Shibe Park. With the game tied at 1-1 in the top of the ninth, Creeden delivered the game-winning RBI, a single off Phillies hurler Si Johnson that scored Chuck Workman to give the Braves the lead. Creeden was lifted for a pinch runner, and the Braves went on to win, 3-1. In the second half of the twinbill, Creeden reached base via walk off Johnny Podgajny in the 12th inning, and was again removed for a pinch runner. Creeden spent the remainder of the 1943 season with the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), and in 1944 played for the PCL's Seattle Rainiers. He went on to play for the Little Rock Travelers and Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association. In the summer of 1949, Creeden played for the Galt Terriers of the semipro Intercounty League in southern Ontario. Creeden died in Santa Ana, California in 1969 at the age of 54.

Cognitive reframing is the process by which such situations or thoughts are challenged and then changed. In the context of cognitive therapy, cognitive reframing is referred to as cognitive restructuring.  History  Aaron T. Beck developed cognitive therapy in the 1960s. Through working with patients diagnosed with depression, he found that negative thoughts would persist in the minds of these patients. Beck helped his patients recognize the impact of their negative thoughts, and aided them in shifting their mindset to think more positively. This eventually led to the lessening of, or sometimes getting rid of, the patients' depression. This process was termed \\"cognitive restructuring\\", and aimed principally at rethinking perceived negative thoughts and turning them into positive thoughts. Beck, A (1997). \\"The past and the future of cognitive therapy\\". Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research, 6, 276-284. Using cognitive restructuring as a tool in therapeutic settings led other researchers to recognize that this process happens outside the clinic, and would lead them to develop the term \\"cognitive reframing\\" as a way to describe the more generalized process.  Therapeutic uses of cognitive reframing  Cognitive reframing can be useful in many ways, such as when trying to improve memory, reduce test anxiety, and helping parents and children cope with disabilities. For example, people with memory problems were told that their memory could be improved by shifting their perspective on their problem. After receiving treatment, their memory improved.Lachman, M.E., Weaver, S.L., Bandura, M., Elliot, E. & Candlewick, C.J. (1992). Improving memory and control beliefs through cognitive restructuring and self-generated strategies. Journal of Gerontology, 47, P293-P299. Another example are parents with disabled children. Some parents harbored negative thoughts about their disabled children. Cognitive reframing helped these parents to view their children and their experiences in a more positive light.Woolfson, L. (2003). Disabled children, parents and society: A need for cognitive reframing. Proceedings of the British Psychological Society, 11, 5 = Humor and cognitive reframing = One behavior that has been shown to facilitate cognitive reframing is humor, especially humor that is based on positivity, rather than mean-spirited. For example, in one study, participants were exposed to a series of unpleasant pictures. To cope with these pictures, participants were invited to create a positive joke about the picture, a negative joke about the picture, or no joke about the picture. The positive joke tended to elicit positive emotions instead of negative emotions. The authors concluded that positive humor might epitomize a variant of cognitive reframing in which individuals shift their perspective of some unfavorable event or circumstance towards a more positive outlook of the same circumstances.  Differentiated from cognitive restructuring and distortion  Cognitive reframing can refer to almost any conscious shift in a person's mental perspective. For this reason, it is commonly confused with both cognitive restructuring and cognitive distortion. However, there are distinct differences between the three. Reframing is the general change in a person's mindset, whether it be a positive or negative change. Restructuring is the act of therapeutically changing one's mindset to strengthen oneself—meaning that it always has a positive connotation. In this way, cognitive restructuring is a particular instance of cognitive reframing. Distortions are exaggerated and typically negative thoughts not supported by a rational thought process. If someone suffers from a series of distortions (which can lead to depression, poor decisions, and other negative results), the need for cognitive restructuring may present itself. Therefore, distortion is a problem which may be solved by cognitive reframing. Yet another major distinguishing feature between cognitive reframing and cognitive restructuring is awareness. Cognitive reframing can happen subconsciously, while cognitive restructuring, something usually done under the guidance of a therapist, is conscious.Ray, R.D., Ochsner, K.N., Cooper, J.C., Robertson, E.R., Gabrieli, J.D.E. & Gross, J.J. (2005). Individual differences in trait rumination and the neural systems supporting cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience, 5, 156-168 Since cognitive restructuring is a therapeutic technique, it requires the patient to recognize and consciously shift their frame of reference to a more ‘positive’ one. However, since reframing just requires any mental frameshift, there does not need to be any conscious decision to alter one's perspective. For example, when an individual exhibits hindsight bias, they are unconsciously changing their frame of reference to retain pride and self-esteemLouie, T.A. (1999). Decision makers’ hindsight bias after receiving favorable and unfavorable feedback. Journal of Applied Psychology, 84, 29-41 Though the need to negatively reframe thoughts is arguably not as frequent as the need to positively reframe them, there are instances in which it is beneficial to negatively reframe thoughts. For example, in theatre, an actor may need to appear sadder or in a more negative state of mind. In order to accomplish this, he or she may alter his or her state of mind through cognitive reframing, in an attempt to appear more dysphoric externally. Another use of cognitive reframing can be seen when one tries to make one's viewpoints objective, which is shifting your perspective to be neutral and less polarized about a certain situation.

It occupies the campus of the former Pacific Christian High School.Landsberg, Mitchell. \\"County gives Los Angeles International Charter High School a second chance.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 10, 2010. Retrieved on September 8, 2011. History Clifford Moseley and Vaughn Bernandez, who taught and were coworkers at another charter school, established LA International. Moseley was raised partly in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles and partly in various other countries, and he wanted a high school with an international theme that would allow its students to connect to other countries. Originally the school operated under a four-year charter from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). It began with 80 students; Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times said that the figure is what \\"most charter experts would say is too few to be financially sustainable.\\" The school began in the basement of an American Legion hall. The school was denied usage of that site, and at the last minute, it had to move into a site in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley for its second year. This led to a lot of students leaving the school, and the school's bus transportation costs became very high. The original LAUSD charter would later be renewed for one year. In March 2009 LAUSD stated that it would not renew the charter because of fiscal issues and because LA International had an academic program that it called \\"unsound.\\" The school filed an appeal to the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Even though some staff members and Darline Robles, the superintendent of the county school office, had objected to the renewal, the Office of Education approved the charter. In January 2010 most students at LA International wanted to attend universities and colleges. Landsberg said that in 2010 \\"Today, the school has a new principal, some new teachers and a new lease on life. Students and parents speak enthusiastically, saying it is safe, nurturing and academically challenging.\\" Mosley said that the school had received more support from the county education office than from LAUSD. Landsberg said that \\"L.A. International is an example of a charter school that has struggled to get on its feet, a reflection of just how difficult it is to start a new school from scratch. It is also an example of the relatively lax oversight -- and scant support -- that charters have historically received from the Los Angeles Unified School District. Finally, its students' devotion demonstrates how even academically struggling charters can connect to pupils who don't fit in at large, traditional schools.\\" Academic performance In a three-year turnaround, for the 2012-13 school year, its Academic Performance Index was 785,http://api.cde.ca.gov/Acnt2013/2013GrowthSch.aspx?allcds=19101990109942 154 points higher than its 2010 figure when the Times article was written, shortly after leaving LAUSD. That 2013 API was also 72 points higher than the 713 score posted by Franklin High Schoolhttp://api.cde.ca.gov/Acnt2013/2013GrowthSch.aspx?allcds=19647331933043 and 132 points higher than the 653 posted by Wilson High Schoolhttp://api.cde.ca.gov/Acnt2013/2013GrowthSch.aspx?cYear=2005-06&allcds;=19647331939859—the two closest LAUSD high schools serving the same neighborhoods and which also have predominantly Hispanic and Latino student bodies. In May 2014, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson announced that Los Angeles International Charter High was one of four high schools in California (among the 106 total public schools) to receive the 2013-14 Title I Academic Achievement Award;http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/ne/yr14/yr14rel47.asp the only high school so recognized in the Los Angeles area. To receive this distinction, the school must demonstrate that all students are making significant progress toward proficiency on California's academic content standards. Additionally, the school's socioeconomically disadvantaged students (77 percent of L.A. International's students at the time) must have doubled the achievement targets set for them for two consecutive years. This Award is given to schools receiving federal Title I funds as authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Title I, the single largest federal educational program for K-12 public education, assists schools in meeting the educational needs of students living at or below the poverty line. Of the approximately 10,000 schools in California, more than 6,000 of them participate in the Title I program.

The features of cognition include high level mental constructs (such as concepts and categories) and performance on various cognitive tasks (such as reasoning or judgment). The aspects of the body include the motor system, the perceptual system, bodily interactions with the environment (situatedness), and the assumptions about the world that are built into the structure of the organism. The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as cognitivism, computationalism, and Cartesian dualism. It is closely related to the extended mind thesis, situated cognition, and enactivism. The modern version depends on insights drawn from recent research in psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, dynamical systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, animal cognition, plant cognition and neurobiology. Embodiment thesis In philosophy, embodied cognition holds that an agent's cognition is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent's body beyond the brain itself. In their proposal for an enactive approach to cognition Varela et al. defined \\"embodied\\" as: :\\"By using the term embodied we mean to highlight two points: first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context.\\" :::— Francisco J. Varela, Evan Thompson, Eleanor Rosch : The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience pages 172–173 The Varela enactive definition is broad enough to overlap the views of extended cognition and situated cognition, and indeed, these ideas are not always carefully separated. Some authors explain the dependence of cognition upon the body and its environmental interactions by saying that cognition, in real biological systems, is not an end in itself but is constrained by the system's goals and capacities. However, they argue, such constraints do not mean cognition is set by adaptive behavior (or autopoiesis) alone, but rather that cognition requires “some kind of information processing...the transformation or communication of incoming information”, the acquiring of which involves \\"exploration and modification of the environment\\". :\\"It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that cognition consists simply of building maximally accurate representations of input information...the gaining of knowledge is a stepping stone to achieving the more immediate goal of guiding behavior in response to the system's changing surroundings.\\" :::— Marcin Miłkowski: Explaining the Computational Mind, p. 4 The separation of embodied cognition from extended cognition and situated cognition can be based upon the embodiment thesis, a narrower view of embodiment than that of Varela et al. or that of Dawson: :Embodiment thesis: Many features of cognition are embodied in that they are deeply dependent upon characteristics of the physical body of an agent, such that the agent's beyond-the-brain body plays a significant causal role, or a physically constitutive role, in that agent's cognitive processing. :::—RA Wilson and L Foglia, Embodied Cognition in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy This thesis omits direct mention of some aspects of the \\"more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context\\" included by Varela et al. The _Extended_ mind thesis, in contrast with the _Embodiment_ thesis, limits cognitive processing neither to the brain nor even to the body, but extends it outward into the agent's world. See also: _Situated_ cognition emphasizes that this extension is not just a matter of including resources outside the head, but stresses the role of probing and modifying interaction with the agent's world.  Philosophical background  In his Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven (1755),Immanuel Kant, Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, p.367; translated by Stephen Palmquist in Kant's Critical Religion (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), p.320. philosopher Immanuel Kant advocated a view of the mind–body problem with parallels to the embodied view. Some difficulties with this interpretation of Kant include (i) the view that Kant holds the empirical, and specific knowledge of the body, which cannot support a priori transcendental claims, and (ii) the view that Kant holds that transcendental philosophy, although charged with the responsibility of explaining how we can have empirical knowledge, is not itself empirical. José Ortega y Gasset, George Santayana, Miguel de Unamuno, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others in the broadly existential tradition have proposed philosophies of mind influencing the development of the modern 'embodiment' thesis.Cowart, Monica 2004 Embodied Cognition The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, , , retrieved 27 Feb 2012. The embodiment movement in artificial intelligence has fueled the embodiment argument in philosophy and a revised view of ethology: :\\"Species-typical activity patterns must be thought of as emergent phenomena in three different senses of the word. They have emerged...through natural selection, ....by a process of maturation and/or learning, ...and from interactions between the creature's low-level activities and its species- typical environment.\\" :::—Horst Hendriks-Jansen Catching Ourselves in the Act, p. 10 These developments have also given emotions a new status in philosophy of mind as an indispensable constituent, rather than a non-essential addition to rational intellectual thought. In philosophy of mind, the idea that cognition is embodied is sympathetic with other views of cognition such as situated cognition or externalism. This is a radical move towards a total re- localization of mental processes out of the neural domain.Di Paolo, Ezequiel Shallow and Deep Embodiment University of Sussex, 29.10.2009 12:43 Duration: 1:11:38 https://cast.switch.ch/vod/clips/74nrkbwys (Video, retrieved 27 Feb 2012 Connections with the sciences Embodied cognition is a topic of research in social and cognitive psychology, covering issues such as social interaction and decision-making. Embodied cognition reflects the argument that the motor system influences our cognition, just as the mind influences bodily actions. For example, when participants hold a pencil in their teeth and engaging the muscles of a smile, they comprehend pleasant sentences faster than unpleasant ones. On the other hand, holding a pencil between their nose and upper lip to engage the muscles of a frown has the reverse effect. George Lakoff (a cognitive scientist and linguist) and his collaborators (including Mark Johnson, Mark Turner, and Rafael E. Núñez) have written a series of books promoting and expanding the thesis based on discoveries in cognitive science, such as conceptual metaphor and image schema.; ; ; ; Irina Trofimova around the same time experimentally confirmed the phenomena \\"projection through capacities\\", as a prototype of the embodiment theory Robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Rolf Pfeifer have argued that true artificial intelligence can only be achieved by machines that have sensory and motor skills and are connected to the world through a body., , The insights of these robotics researchers have in turn inspired philosophers like Andy Clark and Horst Hendriks-Jansen., Neuroscientists Gerald Edelman, António Damásio and others have outlined the connection between the body, individual structures in the brain and aspects of the mind such as consciousness, emotion, self-awareness and will., Biology has also inspired Gregory Bateson, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Eleanor Rosch and Evan Thompson to develop a closely related version of the idea, which they call enactivism., The motor theory of speech perception proposed by Alvin Liberman and colleagues at the Haskins Laboratories argues that the identification of words is embodied in perception of the bodily movements by which spoken words are made. In related work at Haskins, Paul Mermelstein, Philip Rubin, Louis Goldstein, and colleagues developed articulatory synthesis tools for computationally modeling the physiology and aeroacoustics of the vocal tract, demonstrating how cognition and perception of speech can be shaped by biological constraints. This was extended into the audio-visual domain by the \\"talking heads\\" approach of Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, Rubin, and other colleagues. Psychology =Visual search= Graph of the visual search task results showing that participants made fewer object orientation errors when grasping than pointing. One embodied cognition study shows that action intention can affect processing in visual search, with more orientation errors for pointing than for grasping. Participants either pointed to or grasped target objects of 2 colors and 2 orientations (45° and 135°). There were randomized numbers of distractors as well (0, 3, 6, or 9), which differed from the target in color, orientation, or both. A tone sounded to inform participants which target orientation to find. Participants kept their eyes on a fixation point until it turned from red to the target color. The screen then lit up and the participants searched for the target, either pointing to it or grasping it (depending on the block). There were 2 blocks for pointing and 2 for grasping, with the order counterbalanced. Each block had 64 trials. Results from the experiment show that accuracy decreases with an increase in the number of distractors. Overall, participants made more orientation errors than color errors. There was no main effect of accuracy between the pointing and grasping conditions, but participants made significantly fewer orientation errors in the grasping condition than in the pointing condition. Color errors were the same in both conditions. Because orientation is important in grasping an object, these results fit with the researchers' hypothesis that the plan to grasp an object will aid in orientation accuracy. This supports embodied cognition because action intention (planning to grasp an object) can affect visual processing of task-relevant information (orientation). =Distance perception= Internal states can affect distance perception, which relates to embodied cognition. Researchers randomly assigned college student participants to high-choice, low-choice, and control conditions. The high-choice condition signed a “freedom of choice” consent form indicating their decision to wear a Carmen Miranda costume and walk across a busy area of campus. Low-choice participants signed an “experimenter choice” consent form, indicating the experimenter assigned the participant to wear the costume. A control group walked across campus but did not wear a costume. At the conclusion of the experiment, each participant completed a survey which asked them to estimate the distance they walked. The high-choice participants perceived the distance walked as significantly shorter than participants in the low-choice and control groups, even though they walked the same distance. The manipulation caused high-choice participants to feel responsible for the choice to walk in the embarrassing costume. This created cognitive dissonance, which refers to a discrepancy between attitudes and behaviors. High-choice participants reconciled their thoughts and actions by perceiving the distance as shorter. These results show the ability of internal states to affect perception of physical distance moved, which illustrates the reciprocal relationship of the body and mind in embodied cognition. =Perspective= Graph depicting the percentage of responses by perspective for each photograph condition. Researchers have found that when making judgements about objects in photographs, people will take the perspective of a person in the picture instead of their own. They showed college undergraduate participants 1 of 3 photographs and asked where 1 object in the picture was compared to the other object. For example, if the 2 objects were an apple and a banana, the participants would have to respond to a question about the location of the apple compared to the banana. The photographs either had no person, a person looking at the object, in this case the banana, or a person reaching for the banana. The photograph and question appeared in a larger set of questionnaires not related to the study. Results show that participants who viewed photographs that included a person were significantly more likely to respond from another's perspective than those who saw photographs with no person. There were no differences in perspective of responses for the person looking versus reaching. Participants who saw the scene without a person were significantly more likely to respond from their own perspective. This means that the presence of a person in the photograph affected the perspective used even though the question focused solely on the two objects. The researchers state that these results suggest disembodied cognition, in which the participants put themselves into the body of the person in the photograph. =Language comprehension= Some researchers extend embodied cognition to include language. They describe language as a tool that aids in broadening our sense of body. For instance, when asked to identify “this” object, participants most often choose an object near to them. Conversely, when asked to identify “that” object, participants choose an object further away from them. Language allows us to distinguish between distances in more complex ways than the simple perceptual difference between near and far objects. The change in \\"relative phase shift\\" for different conditions in the study. Participants had a significantly larger change for \\"performable\\" sentences than \\"inanimate\\" sentences and swinging only. The motor system is involved in language comprehension, in this case when sentences were performable by a human, there was a change in participants' overall movement of a pendulum. Researchers performed an experiment in which college undergraduate participants swung a pendulum while completing a \\"sentence judgement task.\\" Participants would swing the pendulum with both hands for 10 seconds before a prompt and then a sentence would appear on the screen until the participant responded. In the control condition, participants swung the pendulum without performing the \\"sentence judgement task.\\" Each trial had half \\"plausible\\" and half \\"implausible\\" sentences. The \\"plausible\\" sentences made sense semantically, while the \\"implausible\\" ones did not. The \\"performable\\" sentences could be performed by a human, while the \\"inanimate\\" sentences could not. Participants responded by saying \\"yes\\" to the \\"plausible\\" sentences. Results show a significant \\"relative phase shift,\\" or overall change in movement of the swinging pendulum, for the \\"performable\\" sentences. This change did not occur for \\"inanimate\\" sentences or the control condition. The researchers did not expect an overall phase shift, instead they expected a change in the variability of movement, or the \\"standard deviation of relative phase shift.\\" Although not entirely expected, these results support embodied cognition and show that the motor system is involved in the understanding of language. The researchers suggest that the nature of this relationship needs to be further studied to determine the exact correlation this task has to bi-manual motor movements. Embodiment effects emerge in the way in which people of different sex and temperament perceive verbal material, such as common adjectives and abstract and neutral nouns. Trofimova, who first described this phenomenon in her experiments, called it \\"projection through capacities\\". This phenomenon emerges when people's lexical perception depends upon their capacities to handle the events; when their information processing registers mostly those aspects of objects or of a situation that they can properly react to and deal with according to their inherent capacities. For example, in these studies males with stronger motor-physical endurance estimated abstractions describing people-, work/reality- and time-related concepts in more positive terms than males with a weaker endurance. Females with stronger social or physical endurance estimated social attractors in more positive terms than weaker females. Both male and female temperament groups with higher sociability showed a universal positive bias in their estimations of neutral words, especially for social and work/reality-related concepts, in comparison to participants with lower sociability. Capacities related to the tempo of activities also appeared to impact the perception of lexical material: men with faster motor-physical tempo estimated neutral, abstract time-related concepts significantly in more positive terms than men with slower tempo. =Memory= A study examining memory and embodied cognition illustrates that people remember more of the gist of a story when they physically act it out. Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were \\"Read Only,\\" \\"Writing,\\" \\"Collaborative Discussion,\\" \\"Independent Discussion,\\" and \\"Improvisation.\\" All participants received a monologue about teen addiction and were told to pay attention to details about the character and action in the monologue. Participants were given 5 minutes to read the monologue twice, unaware of a future recall test. In the \\"Read Only\\" condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading the monologue. In the \\"Writing\\" condition participants responded to 5 questions about the story from the perspective of the character in the monologue. They had 6 minutes to answer each question. In the \\"Collaborative Discussion\\" condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the \\"Writing\\" group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women. They were also given 6 minutes per question and everyone participated in answering each question. The \\"Independent Discussion\\" condition was the same as the \\"Collaborative Discussion,\\" except 1 person answered each question. In the \\"Improvisation\\" condition participants acted out 5 scenes from the monologue in groups of 5 women. The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory for the monologue. Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once. Participants were given short prompts from lines in the monologue, which were excluded from the memory test. Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations. The recall test was the monologue with 96 words or phrases missing. Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible. Researchers gave the recall test to a group who did not read the monologue. They scored significantly lower than the other groups, which indicated that guessing was not easy. In coding the answers to the recall test, exact words were labeled \\"Verbatim\\", and correct content but varied wording was labeled \\"Gist\\". The combination of \\"Verbatim\\" and \\"Gist\\" was called \\"Total Memory.\\" The \\"Improvisational\\" group had more \\"Gist\\" memories than any other group and had more \\"Total Memory\\" than both of the discussion groups. The results fit the researchers' hypothesis that the \\"Improvisational\\" group would remember more because they actively rehearsed the information from the monologue. Although other groups had also elaborately encoded the information, the \\"Improvisation\\" group remembered significantly more than the discussion groups and marginally more than the \\"Reading Only\\" and \\"Writing\\" groups. Simply experiencing the monologue in an active way aids in remembering the \\"Gist.\\" There were no differences across groups for \\"Verbatim\\" memory, which they suggest could take longer than the limited time during the experiment to develop. =Learning= Ideas stemming from embodied cognition research have been applied to the field of learning. It has been shown that bodily activity can be used to enhance learning in several studies. Research on embodied learning often utilizes educational technology in the form of virtual reality, mixed reality, or motion capture to transform learning activities into immersive experiences. There are theoretical approaches that define the level of embodiment of these learning platforms based on factors such as their capabilities for immersion and sensorimotor activity. Other theoretical systems analyze embodied learning in terms of the degree of bodily engagement and whether the embodiment is integrated into a learning task. Reasoning A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance. A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently. These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls. Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts. =Approach and avoidance= Table showing response times for the positive, negative, and neutral valence conditions in the approach and avoidance experiment. Participants were significantly faster for the \\"positive toward\\" condition regardless of the central word's valence. In research focused on the approach and avoidance effect, people showed an approach effect for positive words. In the \\"positive toward condition,\\" participants moved positive words toward the center of the screen and negative words away. In the \\"negative toward condition,\\" participants moved negative words toward the center and positive words away. Participants were given feedback about their accuracy at the end of each of the 4 experimental blocks. In the first experiment the word at the center of the screen had a positive valence, while in the second experiment the central word had a negative valence. In the third experiment, the center of the screen had an empty box. As predicted, in the first experiment participants in the \\"positive toward condition\\" responded significantly faster than those in the \\"negative toward condition.\\" This fits the approach/avoidance effect in embodied cognition, which states that people are faster to approach positive things and avoid negative ones. In the second experiment, researchers expected participants in the \\"negative toward condition\\" to be faster, yet those in the \\"positive toward condition\\" responded significantly faster. Although effects were smaller in the third experiment, participants in the \\"positive toward condition\\" were still faster. Overall, people were faster in the \\"positive toward condition,\\" regardless of the valence of the central word. Despite mixed results regarding the researchers' expectations, they maintain that the motor system is important in processing higher level representations such as the action goal. In this study, participants showed strong approach effects in the \\"positive toward condition,\\" which supports embodied cognition. As part of a larger study, researchers separated participants into 5 groups with different instructions. In the \\"approach\\" condition, participants were instructed to imagine physically moving the product toward them, but in the \\"avoid\\" condition, participants had to imagine moving the product away from them. In the \\"control\\" condition, participants were instructed to simply observe the product. The \\"correction\\" condition involved the same instructions as the approach condition, except participants were told that the body can affect judgment. In the \\"approach information\\" condition, participants had to list 5 reasons why they would obtain the product. After viewing a picture of an aversive product, participants rated on a scale of 1 to 7 how desirable the product was and how much they approached of or avoided the product. They also provided how much they would pay for the product. An approach/avoidance effect was found in relation to product evaluation. Participants in the \\"approach\\" condition liked the aversive product significantly more and would pay more for it. There were no differences between the \\"avoidance,\\" \\"control,\\" \\"correction,\\" and \\"approach information\\" conditions. Simulation of approach can affect liking and willingness to pay for a product, but the effect can be reversed if the person knows about this influence. This supports embodied cognition. =Self-regulation= As part of a larger study, one experiment randomly assigned college undergraduates to 2 groups. In the \\"muscle-firming\\" condition participants grasped a pen in their hand, while in the \\"control\\" condition participants held the pen in their fingers. The participants were then asked to fill out donations to Haiti for the Red Cross in sealed envelopes. They were told to return the envelope regardless of whether they donated. They also filled out questionnaires about their feelings about the Red Cross, their tendency to donate, their feelings about Haiti, what they thought the purpose of the study was, etc. Significantly more participants in the \\"muscle-firming\\" condition than in the \\"control\\" condition donated money. Condition did not affect the actual amount donated when participants chose to donate. As the researchers predicted, the \\"muscle-firming\\" condition helped participants get over their physical aversion to viewing the devastation in Haiti and spend money. Muscle-firming in this experiment may also be related to an increase in self-control, suggesting embodied cognition can play a role in self-regulation. Another set of studies was conducted by Shalev (2014), indicating that exposure to physical or conceptual thirst or dryness-related cues influence perceived energy and reduce self-regulation. In Study 1, participants primed with dryness-related concepts reported greater physical thirst and tiredness and lower subjective vitality. In Study 2, participants who were physically thirsty were less persistent in investing effort in an unsolvable anagram task. In Study 3, images of arid land influenced time preference regarding when to begin preparation to make a monetary investment. Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b, exposure to the names of dryness-related products influenced impressions of the vitality of a target person. Some suggest that the embodied mind serves self-regulatory processes by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal. Thus, the embodied mind has a facilitative effect. Some judgments, such as the emotion of a face, are detected more quickly when a participant mimics the facial expression that is being evaluated. Individuals holding a pen in their mouths to freeze their facial muscles and make them unable to mimic the expression were less able to judge emotions. Goal-relevant actions may be encouraged by embodied cognition, as evidenced by the automated approach and avoidance of certain environmental cues. Embodied cognition is also influenced by the situation. If one moves in a way previously associated with danger, the body may require a greater level of information processing than if the body moves in a way associated with a benign situation. =Social psychology= Results from the social embodied cognition study that illustrate the relationship between positive emotions, observed behavioral synchrony, and embodied rapport. Some social psychologists examined embodied cognition and hypothesized that embodied cognition would be supported by embodied rapport. Embodied rapport would be demonstrated by pairs of same-sex strangers using Aron’s paradigm, which instructs participants to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self-disclose. The researchers predicted that participants would mimic each other’s movements, reflecting embodied cognition. Half the participants completed a control task of reading and editing a scientific article, while half the participants completed a shortened version of Aron’s self-disclosure paradigm. There is a significant correlation between self-disclosure and positive emotions towards the other participant. Participants randomly assigned to the self-disclosure task displayed more behavioral synchrony (rated by independent judges watching the tapes of each condition on mute) and reported more positive emotions than the control group. Since bodily movements influence the psychological experience of the task, the relationship between self-disclosure and positive feelings towards one's partner may be an example of embodied cognition. =Evolutionary view = Embodied cognition may also be defined from the perspective of evolutionary psychologists. Evolutionary psychologists view emotion as an important self-regulatory aspect of embodied cognition, and emotion as a motivator towards goal-relevant action. Emotion helps drive adaptive behavior. The evolutionary perspective cites language, both spoken and written, as types of embodied cognition. Pacing and non-verbal communication reflect embodied cognition in spoken language. Technical aspects of written language, such as italics, all caps, and emoticons promote an inner voice and thereby a sense of feeling rather than thinking about a written message.  Cognitive science and linguistics  George Lakoff and his collaborators have developed several lines of evidence that suggest that people use their understanding of familiar physical objects, actions and situations (such as containers, spaces, trajectories) to understand other more complex domains (such as mathematics, relationships or death). Lakoff argues that all cognition is based on knowledge that comes from the body and that other domains are mapped onto our embodied knowledge using a combination of conceptual metaphor, image schema and prototypes. = Conceptual metaphor = Lakoff and Mark Johnson showed that humans use metaphor ubiquitously and that metaphors operate at a conceptual level (i.e., they map one conceptual domain onto another), they involve an unlimited number of individual expressions and that the same metaphor is used conventionally throughout a culture. Lakoff and his collaborators have collected thousands of examples of conceptual metaphors in many domains. For example, people will typically use language about journeys to discuss the history and status of a love affair, a metaphor Lakoff and Johnson call \\"LOVE IS A JOURNEY\\". It is used in such expression as: \\"we arrived at a crossroads,\\" \\"we parted ways\\", \\"we hit the rocks\\" (as in a sea journey), \\"she's in the driver's seat\\", or, simply, \\"we're together\\". These metaphors involving the concept of love are tied to the physical embodied experience of traveling and the emotions associated with a journey. = Image schema = = Prototypes = Prototypes are \\"typical\\" members of a category, e.g. a robin is a prototypical bird, but a penguin is not. The role of prototypes in human cognition was first identified and studied by Eleanor Rosch in the 1970s. She was able to show that prototypical objects are more easily categorized than non-prototypical objects, and that people answered questions about a category as a whole by reasoning about a prototype. She also identified basic level categories: categories that have prototypes that are easily visualized (such as a chair) and are associated with basic physical motions (such as \\"sitting\\"). Prototypes of basic level categories are used to reason about more general categories. Prototype theory has been used to explain human performance on many different cognitive tasks and in a large variety of domains. George Lakoff argues that prototype theory shows that the categories that people use are based on our experience of having a body and have no resemblance to logical classes or types. For Lakoff, this shows that traditional objectivist accounts of truth cannot be correct.Lakoff, G. Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind. University of Chicago Press. . A classic argument against embodiment in its strict form is based on abstract meaning. Whereas the meanings of the words ‘eye’ and ‘grasp’ can be explained, to a degree, by pointing to objects and actions, those of ‘beauty’ and ‘freedom’ cannot. It may be that some common sensorimotor knowledge is immanent in freeing actions or instantiations of beauty, but it seems likely that additional semantic binding principles are behind such concepts. So might it be necessary, after all, to place abstract semantics in an amodal meaning system? A remarkable observation has recently been offered that may be of the essence in this context: abstract terms show an over-proportionally strong tendency to be semantically linked to knowledge about emotions. This additional embodied–semantic link accounts for advantages in processing speed for abstract emotional terms over otherwise matched control words. In addition, abstract words strongly activate anterior cingulate cortex, a site known to be relevant for emotion processing Thus, it appears that at least some abstract words are semantically grounded in emotion knowledge. If abstract emotion words indeed receive their meaning through grounding in emotion it is of crucial relevance Therefore, the link between an abstract emotion word and its abstract concept is via manifestation of the latter in prototypical actions. The child learns an abstract emotion word such as 'joy' because it shows JOY-expressing action schemas, which language- teaching adults use as criteria for correct application of the abstract emotion word Thus, the manifestation of emotions in actions becomes the crucial link between word use and internal state, and hence between sign and meaning. Only after a stock of abstract emotion words has been grounded in emotion-expressing action can further emotion terms be learnt from context.  Artificial intelligence and robotics  = History of artificial intelligence = The experience of AI research provides another line of evidence supporting the embodied mind thesis. In the early history of AI successes in programming high-level reasoning tasks such as chess-playing led to an unfounded optimism that all AI problems would be relatively quickly solved. These programs simulated intelligence using logic and high-level abstract symbols (an approach called Good old-fashioned AI). This \\"disembodied\\" approach ran into serious difficulties in the 1970s and 80s, as researchers discovered that abstract, disembodied reasoning was highly inefficient and could not achieve human-levels of competence on many simple tasks.See Funding agencies (such as DARPA) withdrew funding because the field of AI had failed to achieve its stated objectives, leading to difficult period now known as the \\"AI winter\\". Many AI researchers began to doubt that high level symbolic reasoning could ever perform well enough to solve simple problems. Rodney Brooks argued in the mid-80s that these symbolic approaches were failing because researchers did not appreciate the importance of sensorimotor skills to intelligence in general, and applied these principals to robotics (an approach he called \\"Nouvelle AI\\"). Another successful new direction was neural networks—programs based on the actual structures within human bodies that gave rise to intelligence and learning. In the 90s, statistical AI achieved high levels of success in industry without using any symbolic reasoning, but instead using probabilistic techniques to make \\"guesses\\" and improve them incrementally. This process is similar to the way human beings are able to make fast, intuitive choices without stopping to reason symbolically. = Moravec's paradox = Moravec's paradox is the discovery by artificial intelligence and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level reasoning requires very little computation, but low-level sensorimotor skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec (whence the name) and others in the 1980s. As Moravec writes: > Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human > brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how > to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, > the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported > by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, > sensorimotor knowledge.

We have > not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just > seems so when we do it. = Approach to artificial intelligence =  Solving problems of perception and locomotion directly  Many artificial intelligence researchers have argued that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak as well as a human being. As early as 1950, Alan Turing wrote: > It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the > best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and > speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a child. > Things would be pointed out and named, etc. (Turing, 1950). Embodiment theory was brought into artificial intelligence most notably by Rodney Brooks who showed in the 1980s that robots could be more effective if they 'thought' (planned or processed) and perceived as little as possible. The robot's intelligence is geared towards only handling the minimal amount of information necessary to make its behavior be appropriate and/or as desired by its creator. Others have argued for including the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment: otherwise we cannot accurately replicate language acquisition, comprehension, production, or non-linguistic actions.Paradowski, Michał B. 2012. Developing embodied multisensory dialogue agents. In: Rzepka, Rafał, Michał Ptaszyński & Paweł Dybala (Eds.) Linguistic and Cognitive Approaches to Dialogue Agents. Birmingham: The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour, 6–14. They suggest that while robots are unlike humans, they could benefit from strengthened associative connections in their optimization. Also robots could improve through reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, human-machine interaction, multisensory integration and linguistic input. The embodied approach to AI has been given several names by different schools of researchers, including: Nouvelle AI (Brooks' term), Situated AI, Behavior based AI and Embodied cognitive science. Neuroscience One source of inspiration for embodiment theory has been research in cognitive neuroscience, such as the proposals of Gerald Edelman concerning how mathematical and computational models such as neuronal group selection and neural degeneracy result in emergent categorization. Rohrer (2005) discusses how both our neural and developmental embodiment shape both our mental and linguistic categorizations. The degree of thought abstraction has been found to be associated with physical distance which then affects associated ideas and perception of risk. The embodied mind thesis is compatible with some views of cognition promoted in neuropsychology, such as the theories of consciousness of Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, Gerald Edelman, and Antonio Damasio. The modeling work of cognitive neuroscientists such as Francisco Varela and Walter Freeman seeks to explain embodied and situated cognition in terms of dynamical systems theory and neurophenomenology, but rejects the idea that the brain uses representations to do so (a position also espoused by Gerhard Werner). Criticisms Research on embodied cognition is extremely broad, covering a wide range of concepts. Methods to study how our cognition is embodied vary from experiment to experiment based on the operational definition used by researchers. There is much evidence for this embodiment, although interpretation of results and their significance may be disputed. Researchers continue to search for the best way to study and interpret the theory of embodied cognition.. =Infants as examples= Some criticize the notion that pre-verbal children provide an ideal channel for studying embodied cognition, especially embodied social cognition. It may be impossible to know when a pre- verbal infant is a \\"pure model\\" of embodied cognition, since infants experience dramatic changes in social behavior throughout development. A 9-month old has reached a different developmental stage than a 2-month old. Looking-time and reaching measures of embodied cognition may not represent embodied cognition since infants develop object permanence of objects they can see before they develop object permanence with objects they can touch. True embodied cognition suggests that children would have to first physically engage with an object to understand object permanence. The response to this critique is that infants are \\"ideal models\\" of embodied cognition. Infants are the best models because they utilize symbols less than adults do. Looking-time could likely be a better measure of embodied cognition than reaching because infants have not developed certain fine motor skills yet. Infants may first develop a passive mode of embodied cognition before they develop the active mode involving fine motor movements. =Overinterpretation?= Some criticize the conclusions made by researchers about embodied cognition. The pencil-in- teeth study is frequently cited as an example of these invalidly drawn conclusions. The researchers believed that the quicker responses to positive sentences by participants engaging their smiling muscles represented embodied cognition. However, opponents argue that the effects of this exercise were primed or facilitated by the engagement of certain facial muscles. Many cases of facilitative movements of the body may be incorrectly labeled as evidence of embodied cognition.  Six views of embodied cognition  The following \\"Six Views of Embodied Cognition\\" are taken from Margaret Wilson: # \\"Cognition is situated. Cognitive activity takes place in the context of a real-world environment, and inherently involves perception and action.\\" One example of this is moving around a room while, at the same time, trying to decide where the furniture should go. # \\"Cognition is time-pressured. We are 'mind on the hoof' (Clark, 1997), and cognition must be understood in terms of how it functions under the pressure of real-time interaction with the environment.\\" When you're under pressure to make a decision, the choice that is made emerges from the confluence of pressures that you're under. In the absence of pressure, a decision may be made differently. # \\"We off-load cognitive work onto the environment. Because of limits on our information-processing abilities (e.g., limits on attention and working memory), we exploit the environment to reduce the cognitive workload. We make the environment hold or even manipulate information for us, and we harvest that information only on a need-to-know basis.\\" This is seen when people have calendars, agendas, PDAs, or anything to help them with everyday functions. We write things down so we can use the information when we need it, instead of taking the time to memorize or encode it into our minds. # \\"The environment is part of the cognitive system. The information flow between mind and world is so dense and continuous that, for scientists studying the nature of cognitive activity, the mind alone is not a meaningful unit of analysis.\\" This statement means that the production of cognitive activity does not come from the mind alone, but rather is a mixture of the mind and the environmental situation that we are in. These interactions become part of our cognitive systems. Our thinking, decision-making, and future are all impacted by our environmental situations. # \\"Cognition is for action. The function of the mind is to guide action and things such as perception and memory must be understood in terms of their contribution to situation-appropriate behavior.\\" This claim has to do with the purpose of perception and cognition. For example, visual information is processed to extract identity, location, and affordances (ways that we might interact with objects). A prominent anatomical distinction is drawn between the \\"what\\" (ventral) and \\"where\\" (dorsal) pathways in visual processing. However, the commonly labeled \\"where\\" pathway is also the \\"how\\" pathway, at least partially dedicated to action. # \\"Off-line cognition is body-based. Even when decoupled from the environment, the activity of the mind is grounded in mechanisms that evolved for interaction with the environment – that is, mechanisms of sensory processing and motor control.\\" This is shown with infants or toddlers best. Children utilize skills and abilities they were born with, such as sucking, grasping, and listening, to learn more about the environment. The skills are broken down into five main categories that combine sensory with motor skills, sensorimotor functions. The five main skills are: ## Mental Imagery: Is visualizing something that is not currently present in your environment. For example, imagining a future activity, or recalling how many windows are on the first floor of a house you once lived in (even though you did not count them explicitly while living there). ## Working Memory: Short term memory ## Episodic Memory: Long term memory of specific events. ## Implicit Memory: means by which we learn certain skills until they become automatic for us. An example of this would be an adult brushing his/her teeth, or an expert race car driver putting the car in drive. ## Reasoning and Problem-Solving: Having a mental model of something will increase problem- solving approaches. =Criticism of the six claims= Margaret Wilson adds: \\"Some authors go so far as to complain that the phrase 'situated cognition' implies, falsely, that there also exists cognition that is not situated (Greeno & Moore, 1993, p. 50).\\"Wilson (2002: 627). Of her six claims, she notes in her abstract, \\"the first three and the fifth claim appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.\\"Wilson (2002: 625).

The procedure was pioneered by James Deese in 1959, but it was not until Henry L. Roediger III and Kathleen McDermott extended the line of research in 1995 that the paradigm became popular. The procedure typically involves the oral presentation of a list of related words (e.g., bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, wake, snooze, blanket, doze, slumber, snore, nap, peace, yawn, drowsy) and then requires the subject to remember as many words from the list as possible. Typical results show that subjects recall a related but absent word (e.g., sleep), known as a 'lure', with the same frequency as other presented words. When asked about their experience after the test, about half of all participants report that they are sure that they remember hearing the lure, indicating a false memory – a memory for an event that never occurred. The simplicity of the paradigm and the ease with which DRM studies can be conducted have helped the DRM paradigm become popular among human memory researchers, as well as researchers from other fields. Background The foundations of the DRM paradigm were developed by James Deese while working at Johns Hopkins University. In his 1959 article, \\"On the prediction of occurrence of particular verbal intrusions in immediate recall\\", Deese attempted to better understand why, when reciting a previously learned list of words, people sometimes recall a word that was never presented. He orally presented 50 undergraduate students with lists of 12 words, all strongly associated to an absent critical lure, and then immediately after each list was presented asked the students to recall all the items from the list. He found that the critical lure was recalled up to 44% of the time, but that this result varied over different lists. Although all the words in any list were associated with the critical lure, Deese found that the likelihood of false recall depended heavily on the ability of the list words to activate the critical lure – for example Deese claimed that a list containing 'short' could produce recall of the lure 'man', but a list containing 'man' could not produce recall of the lure 'short'. Other research into false memories had tended to rely on experiences or stories, rather than word lists. Frederic Bartlett famously pioneered this area of research with his studies on remembering using the Indian folktale 'The war of the ghosts'. His studies had British college students learn the Indian folktale and then recall it again and again over time. He found that performance decreased over time, but also found that over time the students 'remembered' the story in a manner that increasingly followed British cultural norms. Although many researchers had trouble replicating Bartlett's results, a number of researchers followed this precedent of using meaningful prose to probe false memories, leaving the more controlled method of list learning underrepresented in the literature. While a few studies had looked at false memories for word lists, their results were not robust and tended to show very small effects. Roediger and McDermott Little attention was given to Deese's experiment until the early 1990s when Henry L. Roediger III came across the 1959 article and decided to further explore the findings. He gave the job of piloting further research to a young graduate student, who subsequently left the field of psychology without conducting any of the proposed research. Roediger eventually offered the project to his PhD student Kathleen McDermott, who completed the experiments as part of her PhD dissertation. First, Roediger and McDermott replicated Deese's research by using the six lists from Deese's study that were the most successful in producing false recall. Roediger read the lists of 12 words to a class of students, and after each list asked them to recall as many words as possible from that list. Following the recall of the sixth list the students were given a pen-and-paper recognition memory test: a list of words comprising 12 studied and 30 unstudied items (including the critical lures) on which the students rated how confident they were that each word had appeared on one of the previous lists. The results showed that students recalled the critical lure 40% of the time, and that most were confident that the critical lures had actually appeared on the lists. To follow up this study, Roediger and McDermott conducted a second experiment that allowed better experimental control. This time they created extra lists similar to those used by Deese, except the new lists had 15 items instead of 12 and the design was manipulated in a few minor ways. The major difference in this second experiment was the inclusion of a 'remember-know' judgement task. This task is applied to a recognition test in order to determine whether subjects recognise an item based on their memory, or based on familiarity. Subjects are first asked if an item is one they have seen before (old) or one that they have not (new), then for items that they have classified as 'old', subjects are asked to judge if they can mentally relive the experience of the item being presented (remember), or if they are confident that it occurred without having a memory for the event (know). Roediger and McDermott predicted that subjects were recalling an absent word because of a high sense of familiarity induced through the presented lists, and as such they would predominantly judge 'old' critical lures as being 'known' rather than 'remembered'. This prediction was not supported. The second experiment showed an increase in recall of the absent critical lures (to a level marginally significantly greater than actually presented words), which was paired with 72% of recognised critical lures being judged as 'remembered'. These results show clear evidence of subjects 'remembering' events that never occurred. The robustness of the DRM effect and the simplicity of the experimental methods were welcomed in an area of research where small effects and elaborate stimuli were the norm. Furthermore, this paradigm allowed researchers to move past their reliance on recognition tests for false memories. Recall tests are better at showing false memories than recognition tests because subjects are required to access and recall the memory in full themselves, rather than being able to rely on some sense of familiarity. Roediger and McDermott were able to demonstrate a robust effect using recall tests as well as recognition tests, while employing simple word-list stimuli. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the experiments were able to show that subjects not only confidently recognised the absent word, but that they consciously remembered this lure appearing on the list, rather than relying on some feeling of familiarity to make an 'old' judgement. Explanations Roediger and McDermott are quick to point out that their results could be explained by an associative model of memory. That is, the presentation of associated words could spread activation through an associative network to the absent lure word, and thus the false recognition of words could be due to residual activation. This model explains the higher false recognition in the second experiment as a product of more activation being spread due to the longer word-lists used. This theory has parallels with prototype theory, which claims that the presentation of patterns that match some prototype activates and increases the recognition of the prototype, even when it has never been presented. In terms of Roediger and McDermott's study, prototype theory would suggest that the list words activate the lure word (the prototype) that is then more easily recognisable. However, the fact that subjects reported 'remembering' the presentation of the critical lure suggests that there is some sort of explicit awareness of the lure during the presentation of words, which cannot be explained by prototype theory or by associative models of memory. To supplement the idea of an associative model, Roediger and McDermott suggest that retrieval processes might play an important role in explaining the DRM phenomenon. They suggest that, by simply recalling the actual list words, the availability of the lure increases to a point where it is mistaken for a presented word. However, further research showed that retrieval processes could not account for the findings without also including encoding processes – Roediger and his colleagues later found that providing subjects with a warning about developing false memories had no effect if it was presented before the recall phase of the experiment, but it did reduce false memories if it was presented before the lists were read to subjects. Other attempts at explaining the phenomenon have attributed it to a source- monitoring error, suggesting that subjects could have a memory for thinking about the lure during the reading of the list, and then mistakenly attributing the memory to the list presentation rather than their own thoughts. Alternatively, other scholars have claimed that the DRM effect is better explained by the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, whereby the surprise of being tested drives the effect rather than the spreading of activation to some prototype. Although their findings do not relate directly to the controversy, Roediger and McDermott assert that their results show that an individual's claim of a vivid memory for an event cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that the event actually occurred. Critics, however, have argued that the DRM paradigm does not reflect real life events because of the nature of the stimuli and the setting in which the study is conducted. Critics like Kathy Pezdek and Shirley Lam have suggested that it is inappropriate to compare the recognition of a word with the implantation of a memory for an entire childhood event. Roediger and McDermott maintain that their use of college students in a laboratory setting with mundane stimuli only strengthens their point, because these conditions should promote the most accurate remembering, and yet false memories are still formed. Applications Because the DRM paradigm is easy to use, produces a clear and robust effect, and because Roediger and McDermott included full copies of the lists they used in their 1995 paper, the paradigm has become a popular research tool to help answer a number of questions. False memory research using the DRM paradigm has highly contested implications for the criminal justice system. Memory plays an imperative role in criminal proceedings with evidence coming from witnesses, victims, suspects, interrogations and much more. This means the reliability and minimization of false memories is of extreme importance. Studies have been conducted with the DRM to understand important relationships like the correlation between false memories and varying stress levels, to understand the effects of a high stress environment on a witness, and the correlation between false memories and age, to understand the reliability of a child witness. Although these studies relate to the witness testimonial process, they cannot be used to make broad claims about the criminal justice system. The overall ecological validity of these experiments is very low due to the specific nature of the replication task making it is difficult to generalize the findings. Researchers have also proposed the use of DRM lists in investigating the controversial issue of recovered memories for childhood sexual abuse. While studies shows that individuals claiming to have recovered previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse are more likely to falsely recall and recognize critical lures than other individuals, this finding is not directly related to self-reported traumatic experiences. Rather, studies found that fantasy proneness as scored by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) is the main factor rather than self-reported traumatization. A similar study found that individuals with higher PTSD scores and greater fearful-avoidant attachment tendencies showed less proficient memory monitoring for childhood sexual abuse word lists, and future research should approach this topic with caution. Scientists from the University of Missouri have used the DRM paradigm to look at brain activity for real and false memories. They found evidence that suggests different brain processes may underlie the retrieval of real and false memories, with false-memory retrieval showing distinctly different patterns of neural activity to retrieval of real memories. Further work on false memories has been conducted using the DRM paradigm including delving deeper into the methods of memory recall. In a five experiment study using different examples of the DRM paradigms from previous work, researchers recorded data consistent with the dual-retrieval processes of free recall. These retrieval processes are direct access, the retrieval of detailed items or verbatim memory, and reconstruction, the retrieval of the sense of meaning or gist memory. They also used this understanding and the robust results of the DRM tests to reaffirm the notion that these gist traces are the source of all false memories. Another important application of the DRM paradigm is examining how the paradigm shifts from children to adults. Studies show that younger children have lower rates of false recall and recognition, likely due to a less developed semantic memory and therefore lacking the ability to make connections outside of the word lists given.Metzger, R.L., Warren, A.R., Shelton, J.T., Price, J., Reed, A.W., & Williams, D. (2008). Do children 'DRM' like adults? False memory production in children. Developmental Psychology, 44, 169–181. Similarly, another study found that information processing differences at encoding between children and adults result in a lower rate of false recall among children due to an inability to activate lexical connections in word lists. The DRM paradigm has also been used to probe a number of other psychological issues including: how stereotypes influence human thought; the thought process employed by drug addicts; and the types of impairments suffered by patients with amnesia.

Nantgarw tradition is a style of Morris dancing from the South and Valleys regions of Wales, specifically associated with the small village of Nantgarw. The style encompasses both handkerchief and stick dances. The dances call for eight dancers in four pairs. There are now five dances in the Nantgarw tradition: Y Gaseg Eira (The Snow Mare), Hela'r Sgwarnog (Hunting the Hare), Ty Coch Caerdydd (Red House of Cardiff), Y Derwydd (The Druid) and Y Goron (The Crown). They are most frequently performed by Cardiff Morris. The style was first put into dance notation by Dr. Ceinwen Thomas (1911-2008) who wrote down what her mother, Catherine Margretta Thomas, could remember of the dances that had been danced locally when she was young.  Etymology  The Nantgarw dances take their name from the village of Nantgarw in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf where they are said to have first been performed.  History  = Origins = Catherine Margretta Thomas (1880–1972). Her memories of Welsh folk dance helped keep alive a tradition Catherine Margretta Thomas was born in 1880 in the village of Nantgarw. Her parents were Daniel and Hannah Davies. As a child she enjoyed watching the local dances as they were performed in an open space below Twyn Chapel in Caerphilly and at Nantgarw and Y Groes Wen. Due to the hostility of the local churches to folk dancing, Catherine Margretta Thomas' own mother was not keen on her daughter going to see these dances, but Catherine was able to convince her father to take her along to witness the displays. The rise of Nonconformism in Wales meant that by the time Catherine Margretta Thomas was in her teens folk dancing had practically been eradicated in Nantgarw. = The Welsh National Folk Dance Society = Dancing had died hard if inconsistently by 1911 when Catherine Margretta Thomas' daughter, Ceinwen Thomas (later Dr. Ceinwen Thomas), was born. But the influence of Nonconformism waned and by the time Ceinwen Thomas was attending school she was discussing the tradition of dancing in Nantgarw with her mother. After Ceinwen Thomas had left college she met Walter Dowding of the Welsh National Folk Dance Society. She told him about her mother's recollections of folk dancing in Nantgarw. He put her in touch with Doris Freeman. Together Catherine Margretta Thomas, Ceinwen Thomas and Doris Freeman worked to notate the dance steps from the traditional dances that Catherine Margretta Thomas could remember. These notes were then passed on to the Welsh National Folk Dance Society by Ceinwen Thomas. A complete set of the dance notation for Y Gaseg Eira was published, alongside the tune Ymdeithgan Gwŷr Penllyn (March of the Men of Penllyn), in the 1959/60 Welsh Folk Dance Magazine. = Revival = The United Kingdom experienced a revival in folk dancing and Morris dancing in the 1960s. In Wales this meant, in part, a resurgence in interest in the Nantgarw tradition from sides who were looking for Welsh dances to add to their English ones.The Real Cardiff Morris. Myweb.tiscali.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-09-27. Cardiff Morris Men began piecing together a Morris dance from the notes that had been written down by Ceinwen Thomas on one particular dance that she called Y Gaseg Eira . After this 'original' dance had been pieced back together sides began to create more dances that were 'in the style of' this traditional Nantgarw Morris dance. Many of these new creations, such as Y Derwydd, are now held to be just as much a part of the Nantgarw tradition as the original dance.Cardiff Morris. Retrieved on 2011-09-27. Today there are five Morris dances that are commonly recognised as being a part of the Nantgarw tradition.  The Moves  = Figures = The figures can be summarised as Foot Up, Corners Change, Top Hey, Bottom Hey and Circular Hey, with usually a distinctive verse figure unique to each dance. = Steps = There is double step throughout, except when 'chipping' (hopping in one spot whilst simultaneously rotating). The basic pattern is two double steps followed by four capers. There had been a tendency to truncate the second double step and leap straight into the capers, leading to a loss of balance and poise. The hand movements are straight up-and-down, with Adderbury-style circular movements at waist level for the capers. In the 'chipping' sequences in Y Gaseg Eira and Hunting the Hare the arms are raised in turn and in time with the single stepping which accompanies it.  The Dances  = Y Gaseg Eira (The Snow Mare) = Cardiff Morris in Carmarthen finish a Nantgarw stick dance in distinctive style, by surrounding the mascot, Idris. This handkerchief dance has a pattern entirely peculiar to itself and was the first Nantgarw dance to see the light of day with the Cardiff Morris. The name of the dance is a Welsh idiom for a very large snowball, and it is so named because at one point in the dance the hand waving movements resemble the movements of somebody rolling a large snowball. This is the original Nantgarw dance and was being danced by Cardiff Morris by 1974. An article in the Welsh Folk Dance Magazine published in 1959 featured an article on this dance along with a photograph of a side performing it. = Hela'r Sgwarnog (Hunting the Hare) = This is the first of three dances which conform to a standard pattern; which can, with a little care, be memorised and need, therefore, no calling. Like Y Gaseg Eira it is a handkerchief dance. The current practise with the music is to use hornpipe time, which lends a lilt to the dance that some people find attractive. It had been added to the Nantgarw repertoire by 1984. = Ty Coch Caerdydd (The Red House of Cardiff) = Sixteen sticks lend a certain weight to the stick bag, if not the proceedings. The sticks are held skiing-fashion (as in downhill, not slalom or cross-country) and are brought up in front of the face to clash. It was being danced by 1984. = Y Derwydd (The Druid) = Previously known as Y Gamel (The Camel) until it was renamed after the tune it is danced to. There are only eight sticks in this dance and no clashing except in the chorus. The dance pattern is identical to that of Hunting the Hare, even down to the half-heys in the chorus, except that the corner figures are completely replaced with Stars. It was put together in 1991. = Y Goron (The Crown) = This is a stick dance based around circular hays. = Nos Galan (New Year's Eve) = This is a processional dance. Unlike the other dances which take place in one location this dance takes the dancers from one place to another. It takes its name from an old Welsh carol, the tune for which was used for the melody of \\"Deck the Halls\\".  Practitioners  There are no hard and fast rules as to which Morris sides can perform dances from a tradition, but the original Nantgarw dance, Y Gaseg Eira, is considered to be a dance for the Welsh sides. Consequently, it is often performed by the sides Isca Morris and Cardiff Morris. It was members of Cardiff Morris who developed the modern Nantgarw dances and so they are the most common performers of these dances.  Criticism  There has been skepticism expressed over the claims by Dr. Ceinwen Thomas that the dances which her mother recalled were authentic and original Welsh dances reflecting a long and integral Welsh culture of folk dancing. The BBC Welsh Affairs Editor Vaughan Roderick wrote in a blog in 2009 that he doubted the history of these dances. He questioned why only Margretta Thomas had any recollection of these dances being performed. He wrote that his great grandfather had been a minister in Nantgarw in the 1880s but had not seen these dances. He linked it to a romantic nationalist desire to create a longstanding tradition in Wales even if one had not existed in reality. It has been pointed out that there are \\"obvious\\" similarities between the Welsh Nantgarw style of Morris dance and the English Lichfield style of Morris dance. It is known that there were potteries in Nantgarw and these were largely staffed by workers from Staffordshire where Lichfield Morris was danced.

It centers on the fortunes of shortstop Henry Skrimshander and his career playing college baseball with the fictional Westish College Harpooners. The novel was nominated for the Guardian First Book Award, and was featured on several year- end lists. Plot Henry Skrimshander begins the novel as a 17-year-old playing on a Legion baseball team in Lankton, South Dakota. Although physically short and not muscular, Henry has an unusual gift for fielding, and excels at the demanding position of shortstop. After playing a game against a team from Chicago, Westish College student Mike Schwartz sees Henry play and recruits him to attend Westish and improve the baseball team. By his junior year, Henry is excelling as a player (especially on defense) and is drawing significant attention from Major League Baseball scouts. Westish College is a small liberal arts college located in northeastern Wisconsin on the shore of Lake Michigan. The school has a particular attachment to author Herman Melville, ever since a Westish student named Guert Affenlight discovered that Melville had visited Westish as part of a lecturing tour in the 1880s. The school re-branded itself around the Melville visit, erecting a statue of the author and renaming its sports teams as the Harpooners. After publishing a well-received book and spending many years as a professor at Harvard, Affenlight returns to his alma mater as president of the college. His estranged daughter Pella comes to live with him during Henry's junior year, after leaving her architect husband and life in San Francisco. Much of the novel focuses around members of the Westish baseball team, during their best season in the history of the college. As Henry approaches the NCAA record for most consecutive errorless games by a shortstop (held by his baseball hero, Aparicio Rodriguez), a throw of his goes awry and hits his roommate, right fielder Owen Dunne, who is sitting in the dugout at the time. Owen is hospitalized by the injury, an incident which shakes Henry's confidence deeply. His fielding quickly deteriorates to the point where he can no longer complete a simple throw to first base. Examples given in the novel of Major League players with similar situations are Steve Blass, Mackey Sasser, Mark Wohlers, Chuck Knoblauch, Steve Sax, and Rick Ankiel. Off the baseball field, the novel explores the relationships between several pairs of people. This includes romantic relationships between Mike Schwartz and Pella Affenlight, as well as one between Owen Dunne and Guert Affenlight. The mentor-student relationship between Schwartz and Henry also comes to the forefront, as each examines their hopes for the future and the extent to which it rests on their baseball ability. Reception A great deal of publicity focused on the story of the book's publication, as Harbach worked on the novel, his debut, for ten years, subsequently receiving an advance of more than $650,000 after a bidding war for the publishing rights. The book was well received, making The New York Times bestseller list and was named one of the ten best books of 2011 from the newspaper. Amazon.com named it one of Best Books for the Month of September 2011 and later named it the Best Book of that year. \\"The Art of Fielding belongs in the upper echelon of anybody’s league, in this case alongside Bernard Malamud’s The Natural, Scott Lasser’s Battle Creek and W.P. Kinsella’s Shoeless Joe.\\" However, not all press was in praise of the book, with some criticizing its lightness. =Accolades= The Art of Fielding was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award in 2012, although the book Yellow Birds by Kevin Powers ultimately won. Adaptations In August 2011, it was reported that HBO was in talks to develop the novel into a television drama. Scott Rudin was attached as executive producer, with Harbach to serve as a consulting producer. In May 2017, it was reported that IMG and Mandalay Sports Media would be adapting the novel into a movie. Craig Johnson will be directing and Tripper Clancy writing the script. Controversy In September 2017, writer Charles C. Green sued Chad Harbach claiming \\"large-scale misappropriation\\" by Harbach. The suit noted a very strong plot and style resemblance between The Art of Fielding and Green's previously completed screenplay, Bucky's 9th. In July 2018, Green's suit was dismissed, though he claimed he intends to appeal.

The splitting is a combined effect of spin–orbit interaction and asymmetry of the crystal potential, in particular in the direction perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane (as applied to surfaces and heterostructures). This effect is named in honour of Emmanuel Rashba, who discovered it with Valentin I. Sheka in 1959E. I. Rashba and V. I. Sheka, Fiz. Tverd.

Bihlmayer, O. Rader and R. Winkler, Focus on the Rashba effect , New J. Phys. 17, 050202 (2015) Remarkably, this effect can drive a wide variety of novel physical phenomena, especially operating electron spins by electric fields, even when it is a small correction to the band structure of the two-dimensional metallic state. An example of a physical phenomenon that can be explained by Rashba model is the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).AMR in most common magnetic materials was reviewed by . A more recent work () focused on the possibility of Rashba-effect-induced AMR and some extensions and corrections were given later (). Additionally, superconductors with large Rashba splitting are suggested as possible realizations of the elusive Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, Majorana fermions and topological p-wave superconductors. Lately, a momentum dependent pseudospin- orbit coupling has been realized in cold atom systems. Hamiltonian The Rashba effect is most easily seen in the simple model Hamiltonian known as the Rashba Hamiltonian : H_{\\\\rm R}=\\\\alpha(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{p})\\\\cdot \\\\hat{z} , where \\\\alpha is the Rashba coupling, \\\\mathbf p is the momentum and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma is the Pauli matrix vector. This is nothing but a two-dimensional version of the Dirac Hamiltonian (with a 90 degree rotation of the spins). The Rashba model in solids can be derived in the framework of the k·p perturbation theory or from the point of view of a tight binding approximation. However, the specifics of these methods are considered tedious and many prefer an intuitive toy model that gives qualitatively the same physics (quantitatively it gives a poor estimation of the coupling \\\\alpha). Here we will introduce the intuitive toy model approach followed by a sketch of a more accurate derivation.  Naive derivation The Rashba effect is a direct result of inversion symmetry breaking in the direction perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane. Therefore, let us add to the Hamiltonian a term that breaks this symmetry in the form of an electric field : H_E= - E_0 z , Due to relativistic corrections an electron moving with velocity v in the electric field will experience an effective magnetic field B : \\\\mathbf{B}=-(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E})/c^2 , where c is the speed of light. This magnetic field couples to the electron spin : H_{\\\\mathrm{SO}}=\\\\frac{g\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}}{2c^2}(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{E})\\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} , where -g\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B} \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}/2 is the electron magnetic moment. Within this toy model, the Rashba Hamiltonian is given by : H_{\\\\mathrm{R}} = -\\\\alpha_{\\\\rm R}(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{p})\\\\cdot \\\\hat{z}, where \\\\alpha_{\\\\rm R} = -\\\\frac{g\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}E_0}{2mc^2}. However, while this \\"toy model\\" is superficially convincing, the Ehrenfest theorem seems to suggest that since the electronic motion in the \\\\hat{z} direction is that of a bound state that confines it to the 2D surface, the time-averaged electric field (i.e., including that of the potential that binds it to the 2D surface) that the electron experiences must be zero! When applied to the toy model, this argument seems to rule out the Rashba effect (and caused much controversy prior to its experimental confirmation), but turns out to be subtly-incorrect when applied to a more realistic model.. While the above naive derivation provides correct analytical form of the Rashba Hamiltonian, it is inconsistent because the effect comes from mixing energy bands (interband matrix elements) rather from intraband term of the naive model. Consistent approach explains large magnitude of the effect that includes in the denominator instead of the Dirac gap of mc^2 of the order of MeV combination of splittings the energy bands in a crystal that are about eV, see next section.  Estimation of the Rashba coupling in a realistic system – the tight binding approach In this section we will sketch a method to estimate the coupling constant \\\\alpha from microscopics using a tight-binding model. Typically, the itinerant electrons that form the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) originate in atomic and orbitals. For the sake of simplicity consider holes in the p_z band.Typically in semiconductors the Rashba splitting is considered for the band around the \\\\Gamma_6 point. In the discussion above we consider only the mixing of the anti-bonding bands. However, the induced Rashba splitting is simply given by the hybridization between and bands. Therefore, this discussion is actually all one needs to understand the Rashba splitting at near the \\\\Gamma_6 point. In this picture electrons fill all the states except for a few holes near the \\\\Gamma point. The necessary ingredients to get Rashba splitting are atomic spin-orbit coupling : H_{\\\\mathrm{SO}}=\\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{SO}} \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} , and an asymmetric potential in the direction perpendicular to the 2D surface : H_{E}=E_0 \\\\,z , The main effect of the symmetry breaking potential is to open a band gap \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{BG}} between the isotropic p_z and the p_x, p_y bands. The secondary effect of this potential is that it hybridizes the p_z with the p_x and p_y bands. This hybridization can be understood within a tight-binding approximation. The hopping element from a p_z state at site i with spin \\\\sigma to a p_{x} or p_{y} state at site j with spin \\\\sigma' is given by : t_{ij;\\\\sigma \\\\sigma'}^{x,y}=\\\\langle p_z,i;\\\\sigma  H  p_{x,y},j ;\\\\sigma'\\\\rangle , where H is the total Hamiltonian. In the absence of a symmetry breaking field, i.e. H_E= 0, the hopping element vanishes due to symmetry. However, if H_E e 0 then the hopping element is finite. For example, the nearest neighbor hopping element is : t_{\\\\sigma \\\\sigma'} ^{x,y}=E_0 \\\\langle p_z,i ;\\\\sigma z  p_{x,y},i+1_{x,y} ;\\\\sigma'\\\\rangle = t_0 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{sgn}(1_{x,y}) \\\\delta_{\\\\sigma \\\\sigma'}, where 1_{x,y} stands for unit distance in the x,y direction respectively and \\\\delta_{\\\\sigma \\\\sigma'} is Kronecker's delta. The Rashba effect can be understood as a second order perturbation theory in which a spin-up hole, for example, jumps from a p_z,i;\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle state to a p_{x,y},i+1_{x,y};\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle with amplitude t_0 then uses the spin–orbit coupling to flip spin and go back down to the p_z,i+1_{x,y};\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle with amplitude \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{SO}}. Note that overall the hole hopped one site and flipped spin. The energy denominator in this perturbative picture is of course \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{BG}} such that all together we have : \\\\alpha\\\\approx {a \\\\,t_0 \\\\,\\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{SO}}\\\\over \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{BG}}} , where a is the interionic distance. This result is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the naive result derived in the previous section. Application Spintronics - Electronic devices are based on the ability to manipulate the electrons position by means of electric fields. Similarly, devices can be based on the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom. The Rashba effect allows to manipulate the spin by the same means, that is, without the aid of a magnetic field. Such devices have many advantages over their electronic counterparts.Rashba Effect in Spintronic Devices Topological quantum computation - Lately it has been suggested that the Rashba effect can be used to realize a p-wave superconductor. Such a superconductor has very special edge-states which are known as Majorana bound states. The non-locality immunizes them to local scattering and hence they are predicted to have long coherence times. Decoherence is one of the largest barriers on the way to realize a full scale quantum computer and these immune states are therefore considered good candidates for a quantum bit. Discovery of the giant Rashba effect with \\\\alpha of about 5 eV•Å in bulk crystals such as BiTeI, ferroelectric GeTe, and in a number of low-dimensional systems bears a promise of creating devices operating electrons spins at nanoscale and possessing short operational times.  Dresselhaus spin–orbit coupling  The Rashba spin-orbit coupling is typical for systems with uniaxial symmetry, e.g., for hexagonal crystals of CdS and CdSe for which it was originally foundE. I.

Bychkov and E. I. Rashba, Properties of a 2D electron gas with a lifted spectrum degeneracy, Sov. Phys. - JETP Lett. 39, 78-81 (1984) All these systems lack inversion symmetry. A similar effect, known as the Dresselhaus spin orbit coupling arises in cubic crystals of AIIIBV type lacking inversion symmetry and in quantum wells manufactured from them.

Most psychologists differ in defining the offset of childhood amnesia. Some define it as the age from which a first memory can be retrieved. This is usually at the age of three or four, but it can range from two to eight years. Changes in encoding, storage and retrieval of memories during early childhood are all important when considering childhood amnesia. History Childhood amnesia was first formally reported by psychologist Caroline Miles in her article \\"A study of individual psychology\\", in 1895 by the American Journal of Psychology. Five years later, Henri and Henri published a survey showing that most respondents' earliest recollections occurred from the age of two to four. In 1904 G. Stanley Hall noted the phenomenon in his book, Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education. In 1910, Sigmund Freud offered one of the most famous and controversial descriptions and explanations of childhood amnesia. Using psychoanalytic theory, he postulated that early life events were repressed due to their inappropriately sexual nature. He asserted that childhood or infantile amnesia was a precursor to the ‘hysterical amnesia,’ or repression, presented by his adult patients. Freud asked his patients to recall their earliest memories and found that they had difficulty remembering events from before the age of six to eight. Freud coined the term \\"infantile\\" or \\"childhood amnesia\\" and discussed this phenomenon in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. In 1972, Campbell and Spear published a seminal review about childhood amnesia in Psychological Sciences recapping the research conducted to understand this topic from neurological and behavioral perspectives in both human and animal models. Methods of retrieval The method of memory retrieval can influence what can be recalled. Specifically, whether an individual is prompted to remember a specific event, given more general guidelines, or asked to recall any memory possible, the cue method generates different results. =Cued recall= Many studies use cued recall to retrieve memories. In its basic form, the experimenter gives the participant a word, and the participant responds with the first memory they think of associated with that word. This method has generally estimated the age of offset at about three to five but can vary. However, there are several objections to the cue method. One memory is recorded per cue word, so it can be difficult to know whether this memory is their earliest memory or the first memory that popped to mind. It may be a problem if participants are not asked to record the earliest memory they can recall which relates to the cue. If the experimenter asks the participant to specifically use childhood memories or the earliest memories associated with a cue, the age estimate can be two to eight years. Even with this measure, cued recall is only useful for bringing to mind memories formed several months after the introduction of that word into the participant's vocabulary. One study performed by Bauer and Larkina (2013) used cued recall by asking children and adults to state a personal memory related to the word and then state the earliest time that it occurred. The researchers found that the younger children need more prompts or cues. However, for both children and adults, the earliest memory retrieval was around three years old. =Free recall= Free recall refers to the specific paradigm in the psychological study of memory where participants study a list of items on a specific trial and are then prompted to recall the items in any order. Free recall, in regard to childhood amnesia, is the process by which experimenters ask individuals for their earliest memories, and allow the participant to respond freely. There is no significant difference when people are instructed to recall their earliest memories with cued recall compared to free recall; however, it is thought that a major benefit of free recall is that every question gets answered which may, in turn, elicit memories from an earlier age. =Exhaustive recall= In the exhaustive recall method, participants are asked to record all the memories they can access before a specific age. This method, like free recall, relies on participants to come up with memories without cues. Exhaustive recall yields a better understanding than others on the number of memories surviving from early childhood but can be demanding for the subjects who often have to spend many hours trying to remember events from their childhood. No major differences among word cued, interview, focused and exhaustive recall have been found. Accessible and inaccessible memories The amount of early childhood memories a person can recall depends on many factors, including the emotion associated with the event, their age at the time of the remembered event and the age at the time they are asked to recall an early memory. Although people assume that not recalling a childhood memory means they have forgotten the event, there is a difference between availability and accessibility. The availability of memory is the idea that the memory is intact and is in-memory storage. Accessibility of memory is dictated by the moment in time that a person attempts to recall that memory. Therefore, cues may influence which memories are accessible at any given time even though there may be many more available memories that are not accessed. Some other research suggests that people's earliest memories date back to the ages of 3 or 4 years. Usher and Neisser reported that some events, like the birth of a sibling and a planned hospitalization, can be readily remembered if they occurred at age 2. However, the bits and pieces of such memories that were obtained in their research may not be indicative of genuine episodic memory. An alternative hypothesis is that these apparent memories are the result of educated guesses, general knowledge of what must have been, or external information acquired after the age of 2. According to a study by West and Bauer, their research suggests that earlier memories have less emotional content than later memories, and are less personally meaningful, unique, or intense. Earlier memories also do not seem to differ greatly in perspective. However, certain life events do result in clearer and earlier memories. Adults find it easier to remember personal, rather than public, event memories from early childhood. This means a person would remember getting a dog, but not the appearance of Halley's Comet. Psychologists have debated the age of adults' earliest memories. To date, estimates have ranged from 2 to 6–8 years of age. Some research shows that the offset of childhood amnesia (earliest age of recall) is 2 years of age for hospitalization and sibling birth and 3 years of age for death or change in houses. Thus, some memories are available from earlier in childhood than previous research has suggested. Some research suggests that until around the age of 4, children cannot form context-rich memories. Although more evidence is needed, the relative lack of episodic memories of early childhood may be linked to maturation of prefrontal cortex. It also suggest adults can access fragment memories (isolated moments without context, often remembered as images, behaviors, or emotions) from around age 3, whereas event memories are usually recalled from slightly later. This is similar to research showing the difference between personal recollections and known events. Known memories change to more personal recollections at approximately 4.7 years old. Fading memories Children can form memories at younger ages than adults can recall. While the efficiency of encoding and storage processes allows older children to remember more, younger children also have great memory capacity. Infants can remember the actions of sequences, the objects used to produce them, and the order in which the actions unfold, suggesting that they possess the precursors necessary for autobiographical memory. Children's recall is 50% accurate for events that happened before the age of two whereas adults remember near to nothing before that age. By age two, children can retrieve memories after several weeks, indicating that these memories could become relatively enduring and could explain why some people have memories from this young. Children also show an ability to nonverbally recall events that occurred before they had the vocabulary to describe them, whereas adults do not. Findings such as these prompted research into when and why people lose these previously accessible memories. Some suggest that as children age, they lose the ability to recall preverbal memories. One explanation for this maintains that after developing linguistic skills, memories that were not encoded verbally get lost within the mind. This theory also explains why many individuals' early memories are fragmented – the nonverbal components were lost. However, contrary findings indicate that elementary aged children remember a greater amount of accurate details about events than they had reported at a younger age and that 6–9 year old children tend to have verbally accessible memories from very early childhood. However, research on animal models seems to indicate that childhood amnesia is not only due to the development of language or any other human proper faculty. This increased ability for children to remember their early years does not start to fade until children reach double digits. By the age of eleven, children exhibit young adult levels of childhood amnesia. These findings may indicate that there is some aspect of the adolescent brain, or the neurobiological processes of adolescence, that prompts the development of childhood amnesia.  Animal models  The phenomenon of infantile amnesia is not specific to humans. This initially was researched in rat models and found that younger rats forget a conditioned avoidance response to a shock-paired compartment faster than older rats did. These findings have also been replicated in a number of different species with different learning paradigms. The importance of animal model research should not be understated as these studies have informed neurobiological findings about childhood amnesia and would be impossible to ethically conduct in humans. Because infantile amnesia has been observed in animals, the occurrence cannot be explained just by cognition specific to humans such as language or an understanding of self. Of course, a main criticism of animal models is that development and cognition in animals and humans are starkly different. Researchers have attempted to address this by creating timelines for animal development based on changes in learning and memory abilities, brain development, and hormones. Individual differences Many factors affect memory in humans, including gender and culture. Differences in early memory between these groups can tell us about potential causes and implications of childhood amnesia. Importantly, the individual differences described below tell us that elaborative parenting styles and emphasis of cultural history when teaching children may result in recollection of earlier childhood memories. This suggests that childhood amnesia offset is modifiable by parenting and teaching styles and is therefore not only predetermined or completely biological. =Sex= Generally, when a sex discrepancy is found in the age at first memories, females have earlier memories than males. Women's earlier first memories may be accounted for by the fact that mothers generally have more elaborative, evaluative, and emotional reminiscent style with daughters than with sons, which has been shown to result in more richly detailed childhood memories. Women across cultures tend to have more information-dense memories than men, and women tend to refer to others more than themselves in their earliest memories. Men, on the other hand, exhibit more early memory focus on their individual selves. Men have been found more likely than women to mention negative memories. Contrarily, studies have shown that girls are more likely to remember traumatic and transitional events, whereas boys more often remember play events. Early recollections have also been found more accurate in their reflections of friendliness for men and dominance for women. =Ethnicity, culture, and society= MacDonald et al. found that Chinese participants had later first memories than New Zealand European (Pakeha) or Maori participants. This effect was due to Chinese females, whose average age at first memory was 6.1 years. This indicates that Chinese women have later first memories than Chinese men, which differs from the general finding that women report earlier first memories than men. It has been suggested that since sons are prized far over daughters in China, parents may have more elaborate, evaluative, and emotional reminiscent styles with boys than with girls. Among American subjects, it has been found that Black women have later memories than Black males or White females. Black women also tend to report a low proportion of personal experience which is independently correlated with being older at the age of first memory. It may be that White parents are more likely to use directives to elaborately reminisce than Black parents are with daughters in Black American culture. Findings that Korean individuals have significantly later first memories than American individuals were originally thought to be caused by the collectivist nature of Asian cultures. The lack of an age discrepancy between Chinese males and New Zealand European individuals serves to cast doubt on this theory. Additionally, studies on the Black American population, which is considered a more collectivist society, have not indicated later first memories than non-collectivist cultures. It has been shown, however, that children from Western cultures tell more elaborated, detailed, and emotional narratives than children from eastern cultures. Maori adults report significantly earlier memories than either Pakeha or Chinese individuals. The traditional emphasis on the past in Maori culture may have led to an earlier understanding of the nature of time, and to the retrieval of earlier memories. Maori are also more likely than Pakeha or Chinese individuals to indicate a family story as a source for their memory. Implications =Personality= Individuals' first memories significantly reflect their personality traits. People who reveal a more detailed memory are more likely to be open in their daily lives and disclose a range of personal information to others. Characteristics of early recollections are reflective of friendliness for males and dominance for females. =Forgotten memories= Even when childhood events are not remembered episodically, they can be implicitly remembered. Humans can be primed and implicitly trained earlier before they can remember facts or autobiographical events. This is most important in terms of emotional trauma. Adults can generally recall events from 3–4 years old, and have primarily experiential memories beginning around 4.7 years old. However, some suggest that adults who had traumatic and abusive early childhoods report an offset of childhood amnesia around 5–7 years old. It has been suggested that this is because stressful experiences can injure memory centers and possibly make it harder to form memories. This coupled with the fact that priming can occur at a younger age may indicate that children in abusive situations have implicit memory connections that were formed in response to the abuse. Whether or not these 'repressed' memories can affect individuals is a matter of considerable debate in psychology. =False memories= Very few adults have memories from before 2.5 years old. Those who do report memories from before this age usually cannot tell the difference between personal memory of the event and simple knowledge of it, which may have come from other sources. Events from after the age of 10 years are relatively easy to remember correctly, whereas memories from the age of 2 are more often confused with false images and memories. Memories from early childhood (around age two) are susceptible to false suggestion, making them less trustworthy. These should be treated with caution, especially if they have severe consequences. Imagining details of a false event can encourage the generation of false memories. Studies have shown that people who merely imagine a childhood event are more likely to believe that it happened to them compared to events they did not imagine. This term has been coined imagination inflation and shows that merely imagining an event can make it seem more plausible that it really happened. Using the same paradigm, people that are shown a doctored photograph of themselves as a child in an event that never occurred can create false memories of the event by imagining the event over time. Therefore, this implies that it would be possible for false memories to be generated in and/or fed by a court case. This concern has led the APA to advise caution in accepting memories of physically and sexually abusive events from before the age of 2. However, they also recommend that these memories not be entirely discounted, due to the heinous nature of the crimes. Proposed explanations =Freud's trauma theory= Sigmund Freud is famous for his theories of psychosexual development which suggest that people's personality traits stem from their libido (sexual appetite) which develops from early childhood experiences. Freud's trauma theory, originally named \\"Seduction Theory\\" posits that childhood amnesia was the result of the mind's attempt to repress memories of traumatic events (i.e. sexual abuse by caretakers) that occurred in the psychosexual development of every child. This supposedly led to the repression of the majority of memories from the first years of life when children were supposedly obsessed with exploring their sexuality. Notably, Freud himself abandoned this theory in the late 1800s. Freudian theory, including his explanation for childhood amnesia, has been criticized for extensive use of anecdotal evidence rather than scientific research, and his observations that allow for multiple interpretations. While the Freudian psychosexual theory is debated, there are some insights to be made into the effect of childhood emotional abuse on memory. Examining the effects of emotional trauma and childhood amnesia shows that stressful experiences do in fact disrupt memory and can damage central parts of the memory system such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Adults who were abused or traumatized in childhood form their earliest memories about 2–3 years after the general population. In addition, they demonstrate considerable problems with visual, pictorial, and facial memory storage and retrieval compared to non-traumatized individuals. This implies that trauma can disrupt the formation of early childhood memories, but does not necessarily give evidence for Freud's theory of repression. =Emotion= The amygdala (which is primarily concerned with emotions and emotional content of memories) and the hippocampus (which concerns primarily autobiographical memories) are generally independent, but emotions and the amygdala are known to play a role in memory encoding, which is typically associated with the hippocampus. Research has found that later memories in childhood have more propositional and emotional content than earlier memories and are rated as more meaningful and vivid. It has been suggested that differences in the emotions experienced by infants and adults may be a cause of childhood amnesia. Whether highly emotional events can stimulate and improve reliable recall (flashbulb memories) is still highly debated. Some studies have discovered that emotional experiences are connected with faster retrieval times, leading to the belief that emotional events have heightened accessibility in our memories. If an event is particularly surprising, it receives prioritized processing in the brain, most likely due to evolutionary reasons. The evolutionary psychology states that if a past event was particularly frightening or upsetting, one is apt to avoid a similar situation in the future, especially if it is endangering to one's well-being. In addition, the more significant an event, the bigger impact it has and the more rehearsal it receives. Various findings have shown that events such as hospitalization and the birth of a sibling are correlated with an earlier offset of childhood amnesia, which may be because they were more emotionally memorable. However, other seemingly emotional memories such as the death of a family member or having to move do not affect offset, possibly because the events were not as meaningful to the child. Some memories are therefore available from earlier in childhood than others, which has led to the conclusion that very emotional events can be encoded and recalled earlier than non-emotional events. =Neurological= One possible explanation for childhood amnesia is the lack of neurological development of the infant brain, preventing the creation of long term or autobiographical memories. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, two key structures in the neuroanatomy of memory, do not develop into mature structures until around the age of three or four. These structures are known to be associated with the formation of autobiographical memories. The physiological approach appears to support findings of memory loss in relation to amnesiacs and others who have experienced damage to the hippocampus. They cannot efficiently store or recall memories from past events, but still exhibit perceptual and cognitive skills and can still learn new information. The development of the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL), which contains the hippocampus, has been found to specifically have a defining impact on the ability to encode and maintain memories from early childhood. While the neurological explanation does account for blanks in very young children's memories, it does not give a full explanation for childhood amnesia because it fails to account for the years after the age of four. It also fails to address the issue that children themselves do not show childhood amnesia. Children around the age of two to three have been found to remember things that occurred when they were only one to two years old. This discovery that three-year-olds can retrieve memories from earlier in their life implies that all necessary neurological structures are in place to recall episodic information over the short-term, but evidently not over the long-term into adulthood. The finding that all altricial species experience profound forgetting of episodic information formed during infancy suggests that human- centric explanations of infantile amnesia are inherently incomplete. A comprehensive understanding of infantile amnesia will require a neurobiological explanation of why infants forget. There are, however, reasons to believe that different associations within the cerebral hemisphere have an effect on remembering events from a very early period in a person's life. Mixed-handedness and bilateral saccadic eye movements (as opposed to vertical or pursuit eye movements) have been associated with an earlier offset of childhood amnesia, leading to the conclusion that interactions between the two hemispheres correlate with increased memory for early childhood events. = Neurobiological = Research into the neural substrates of infantile amnesia using animal models has found that the major inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) may be involved in the regulation of retrieval of infantile memories in adults. GABA activity is known to be higher in early childhood development than it is in adulthood, not just in animals but also in humans. Researchers have hypothesized that increased GABA activity in development has an effect on memory retrieval later in life. Past studies have shown that GABA aids in forgetting of fear memories in infancy and that it may be a general mechanism for regulating infant memory retrieval. This can also be seen in humans. Benzodiazepines are a class of psychiatric medication which increase GABA expression and are known to produce anterograde amnesia, or a failure to encode memories after taking the medication. Subjects taking benzodiazepines are found to perform worse on learning and memory tasks compared to drug-naive subjects. Previously, it was assumed that neurogenesis, or the continued production of neurons, ended after development. However, recent findings have shown that there are high levels of neurogenesis in the hippocampus in early childhood which taper out into adulthood, although neurogenesis continues to persist slowly. As the hippocampus is known to be vital to memory processes, there are obvious implications for childhood amnesia. Animal research has shown that the age of high neurogenesis is in the developmental period when persistent memories are least likely to be formed. It has been proposed that hippocampal neurogenesis degrades existing memories. This may be due to increased competition between the new and existing neurons, followed by the replacement of synapses in preexisting memory circuits. This theory has been supported in mouse models in which increasing neurogenesis levels also increased forgetting. Additionally, decreasing neurogenesis after new memory formation resulted in decreased forgetting. Are 'lost' infant memories permanently erased (i.e., storage failure) or do they become progressively inaccessible with time (i.e., retrieval failure)? Consistent with a deficit in memory retrieval, optogenetic reactivation of neuronal ensembles that encoded the memory drive memory recall in adulthood.Guskjolen, A., Kenney, J. W., de la Parra, J., Yeung, B. R. A., Josselyn, S. A., & Frankland, P. W. (2018). Recovery of “lost” infant memories in mice. Current Biology, 28(14), 2283-2290. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.059 In addition, memories are consolidated via transferral from the hippocampus to the cortex. This transferral occurs preferably during periods of elevated excitability in the hippocampus i.e. during ripple oscillations. Ripple oscillations represent increased hippocampo-cortical communication. This increase in experience-associated activity does not occur up to a certain age suggesting that this might be a mechanism for infantile amnesia. =Developmental= The development of a cognitive self is also thought by some to have a strong effect on encoding and storing early memories. As toddlers grow, a developing sense of the self begins to emerge as they realize that they are a person with unique and defining characteristics and have individual thoughts and feelings separate from others. As they gain a sense of the self, they can begin to organize autobiographical experiences and retain memories of past events. This is also known as the development of a theory of mind which refers to a child's acceptance that they have beliefs, knowledge, and thoughts that no one else has access to. The developmental explanation asserts that young children have a good concept of semantic information but lack the retrieval processes necessary to link past and present episodic events to create an autobiographical self. Young children do not seem to have a sense of a continuous self over time until they develop awareness for themselves as an individual human being. Some research suggests this awareness is thought to form around the age of 4 or 5, as children in this time period can understand that recent past events affect the present, while 3-year old children still seem unable to grasp this concept. This acknowledged link of the past to the present and the concept of continuous-time and therefore a continuous self is also helped by memory talk with adults. Through elaboration and repetition of events experienced, adults help children to encode memories as a part of their personal past and it becomes essential to their being. =Language= The incomplete development of language in young children is thought to be a critical cause of childhood amnesia as infants do not yet have the language capacity necessary to encode autobiographical memories. The typical schedule of language development seems to support this theory . There appears to be a direct correlation between the development of language in children, and the earliest age at which we can obtain childhood memories (around the age 3-4). Performance on both verbal and nonverbal memory tasks shows that children with more advanced language abilities can report more during a verbal interview and exhibit superior nonverbal memory compared to children with less advanced language skills. If children lack language, they are unable to describe memories from infancy because they do not have the words and knowledge to explain them. Adults and children can often remember memories from around three or four years of age which is during a time of rapid language development. Before language develops, children often only hold preverbal memories and may use symbols to represent them. Therefore, once language develops, one can actively describe their memories with words. The context that one is in when they encode or retrieve memories is different for adults and infants because language is not present during infancy. Language allows children to organize personal past and present experiences and share these memories with others. This exchange of dialogue makes children aware of their personal past and encourages them to think about their cognitive self and how past activities have affected them in the present. Several studies have shown that simply discussing events with children, in general, could lead to more easily retrievable memories. There has also been researching that suggests the degree to which a child discusses events with adults shapes autobiographical recollection. This has implications for gender and cultural differences. Autobiographical memory begins to emerge as parents engage in memory talk with their children and encourage them to think about why a certain event happened. Memory talk allows children to develop memory systems in order to categorize generic versus unique events. The social-cultural developmental perspective states that both language and culture play a role in the development of a child's autobiographical memory. An important aspect of this theory considers the difference between parents who discuss memories at length with their children in an elaborative style, and those who do not. Children of parents who discuss memories with them in an elaborative style report a greater number of memories than children who do not discuss their memories. Memories are described in greater detail. This has implications for cultural differences.

Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 563 U.S. 776 (2011), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that title in a patented invention vests first in the inventor, even if the inventor is a researcher at a federally funded lab subject to the 1980 Bayh–Dole Act.. The judges affirmed the common understanding of U.S. constitutional law that inventors originally own inventions they make, and contractual obligations to assign those rights to third parties are secondary.Baer MF, et al 9 Stanford v. Roche: Confirming The Basic Patent Law Principle That Inventors Ultimately Have Rights In Their Inventions les Nouvelles March 2012:19-23 Background To understand the case, a brief description of the dispute and of common understandings of ownership of inventions is required. =Dispute= The case arose from a dispute over patents covering diagnostic tests for HIV infection (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,968,730,US5,968,730 6,503,705,US6,503,705 and 7,129,041US7,129,041), originally owned by Stanford University, and HIV diagnostic tests sold by Roche.Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 131 S.Ct. 2188 (2011) When Stanford sued Roche for infringing the patents in 2005, Roche countered by claiming that it jointly owned the patents, due to an agreement that a Stanford faculty member, Dr. Mark Holodniy, signed in the late 1980s when he did research at Cetus, the biotechnology company that invented PCR and that was later acquired by Roche. When Holodniy had joined the faculty of Stanford shortly before he had visited Cetus, he, like all scientific personnel at companies and research institutions, had signed an agreement in which he agreed that his employer would own any inventions he made. Stanford's agreement, in particular, stated that he \\"'agree[d] to assign' to Stanford his 'right, title and interest in' inventions resulting from his employment at the University.\\" The Stanford lab in which Holodniy worked had been working on developing better HIV tests, and wanted to try the new PCR method, so Holodniy's supervisor had arranged for him to work at Cetus to learn the technique. Under standard business practice, Cetus had Holodniy sign a confidentiality agreement before allowing him into their facilities. The particular agreement that Holodniy signed stated that Holodniy “will assign and do[es] hereby assign” to Cetus his “right, title and interest in each of the ideas, inventions and improvements” made “as a consequence of [his] access” to Cetus. After completing his training at Cetus, Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he and other Stanford employees tested the HIV measurement technique. Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written assignments of rights from the Stanford employees, including Holodniy, and filed several patent applications related to the procedure. Stanford secured three patents to the HIV measurement process. Some of Stanford's research that was related to the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the Bayh-Dole Act. Accordingly, Stanford disclosed the invention to the government, granted the government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to use the patented procedure, and formally notified NIH that it elected to retain title to the invention. =Ownership of inventions= The U.S. Constitution grants inventors ownership of inventions they make under the Copyright Clause which grants Congress the authority \\"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\\" However, for inventors who are employed, complications ensue.Scott Thompson for the Houston Chronicle. What Is the Purpose of the Inventions Clause in an Employment Contract? In the absence of a written agreement, under common law an employee will own an invention he or she makes, unless the employee was hired specifically to invent and provided means and direction to make the invention.Eric S. Freibrun, Esq Rights to Inventions: Employers v. Employees However, companies and universities that hire scientists to conduct research obligate their employees to sign contracts in which inventions are assigned to the employer, and these contracts are governed by a mixture of federal law and state law.Parker A. Howell (2012) Whose Invention Is It Anyway? Employee Invention-Assignment Agreements And Their Limits Washington Journal of Law, Technology & Arts 8(2):79-106 When the employer itself contracts with third parties, those contracts may also create obligations with respect to intellectual property invented by employees. Especially in fee-for-service contract research, assignment of inventions from the contract research organization (CRO) to the sponsor is common.Michael McCoy (2008) Life After Big Pharma Chemical & Engineering News 86(49):38-41 Therefore, the inventor could either first assign his or her invention to the CRO, which would in turn assign it to the sponsor, or for the sake of simplicity, the CRO employee could assign directly to the sponsor. Before the Bayh-Dole Act was passed in 1980, research grants and contracts issued by the US government often obligated recipient institutions and companies to assign inventions to the US government, and scientists generally directly assigned inventions to the US government.Ashley Stevens (2004) The Enactment of Bayh–Dole Journal of Technology Transfer 29:93–99 The Bayh-Dole Act changed this; the specific language of the statute is: \\"Each nonprofit organization or small business firm (that receives a federal grant) may... elect to retain title to any subject invention\\" and also: \\"If a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention in cases subject to this section, the Federal agency may consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations promulgated hereunder.\\" It is this specific language upon which Stanford would rely in its dispute with Roche. District Court case In 2005, the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University filed suit against Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., alleging that Roche's HIV detection kits were infringing the three patents. Roche argued that it had acquired rights to the patents when it purchased Cetus, and pleaded the ownership theory in three forms: (i) as a declaratory judgment counterclaim; (ii) as an affirmative defense; and (iii) as a challenge to Stanford's standing to sue for infringement. The district court held that Roche's counterclaim for ownership of the patents was barred by California statutes of limitation. Stanford also argued that it had a \\"right of second refusal\\" to the patents subject to the Government's right of first refusal, under 35 U.S.C. § 202(d) of the Bayh-Dole Act as described above. The district court agreed with Stanford, holding that Holodniy could only keep title to his inventions \\"[i]f a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention.\\" However, the district court also held that the patent claims were invalid for obviousness. Both parties appealed.George R. McGuire October 28, 2009 Intellectual Property: Bd. Of Trs. Of The Leland Stanford Junior Univ. V. Roche Molecular Sys., Inc. Federal Circuit case The Federal Circuit agreed with the district court that Roche's ownership counterclaim was barred by the California statutes of limitation, but held that the affirmative defense of ownership was not barred, and that \\"questions of standing can be raised at any time and are not foreclosed by, or subject to, statutes of limitation.\\" The court then determined that Cetus (and therefore Roche) had in fact acquired rights to the three patents due to the agreement that Holodniy had signed with Cetus. Citing two prior Federal Circuit cases, the court held that the language \\"agree to assign\\" in the agreement that Stanford had Holodniy sign, was merely a promise to assign his invention rights to Stanford at some undetermined future point. Also, when Holodniy signed the contract, Stanford's Administrative Guide to \\"Inventions, Patents, and Licensing\\" stated that: \\"[u]nlike industry and many other universities, Stanford's invention rights policy allows all rights to remain with the inventor if possible.\\" And with respect to the Cetus contract, the Federal Circuit interpreted the contract language \\"do hereby assign\\" to be \\"a present assignment of Holodniy's future inventions to Cetus,\\" thereby giving Cetus immediate rights in Holodniy's future inventions. By the time Holodniy executed an assignment to Stanford three years later with respect to the patent applications that Stanford filed, his rights had already transferred to Cetus and the subsequent assignment was void. The Court found that Stanford itself received constructive notice of Cetus's ownership rights at least through Holodniy's employment by Stanford—in other words, Holodniy's knowledge of the Cetus agreement was imputed to his employer. The Court also found that Stanford had similar constructive notice through Holodniy's supervisor, who directed Holodniy to work with Cetus and executed agreements of his own that transferred intellectual property rights to Cetus. Although Stanford asserted that Holodniy signed the agreement with Cetus solely on his own behalf, not Stanford's, the Court found that this argument missed the point. According to the Court, the agreement with Cetus indicates that Holodniy was acting as an independent contractor with respect to Cetus, not with respect to Stanford, and that “Holodniy [had] signed away his individual rights as an inventor, not Stanford’s.”Sean A. O'Donnell, September 30, 2009. Plaintiff Lacked Standing to Sue for Patent Infringement Where an Inventor Validly Transferred His Titleto a Third Party Before Reducing It to Practice With respect to Stanford's claims about the Bayh-Dole Act, the Federal Circuit overruled the District Court decision, holding that the Act does not void an otherwise valid prior transfer of rights. As a result, Stanford was entitled to only those rights that remained after the Government declined to exercise its option. According to the Court, Stanford therefore lacked standing to sue Roche, the district court lacked jurisdiction over Stanford's infringement claim, and the district court should not have addressed the validity of the patents. Accordingly, the Court vacated the district court's finding of invalidity and remanded the case for dismissal due to lack of standing. Stanford appealed to the Supreme Court based on its argument that Bayh-Dole overrides normal ownership of inventions.Dennis Crouch for Patently-O. November 1, 2010. Supreme Court to hear Bayh-Dole Patent Ownership Dispute: Stanford v. Roche Supreme Court case In November 2010 the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The case was decided on June 6, 2011. The decision was \\"largely moot\\" as the majority, led by Chief Justice Roberts, held that U.S. patent rights have always (since 1790) initially vested in \\"the inventor\\" and that the non- specific language of the Bayh-Dole Act does nothing to change the original setup.Dennis Crouch for Patently-O. June 6, 2011. Supreme Court: Inventors Can Retain Rights Even for Federally Funded Inventions Effects The effects on patent law were negligible: \\"The Supreme Court’s grant of certiorari for this case came as a surprise to many intellectual property attorneys who did not believe that the Bayh-Dole Act changed the centuries old proposition that inventors ultimately have rights in their patents. As a result, the Supreme Court’s decision certainly reassured inventors, as well as all those involved in the practice of law involving inventions, that their longstanding belief that the ownership rights in inventions belong first and foremost to inventors is correct.\\" As the case unfolded, it was clear that the problems arose because of Stanford's \\"failure to negotiate a tight assignment agreement with its researchers and scientists\\" and further that the simple solution would be to have existing university employees agree to a new, more explicit and immediately effective assignment agreement and have all new employees sign such agreements.

The locomotive was designed by MLW, based on the specifications for the Class MJ Mallet which had been designed by D.A. Hendrie, the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1910 to 1922. Eight of these branch line locomotives were built and delivered by MLW in November 1918, numbered in the range from 1666 to 1673. Characteristics The locomotives were superheated, had Walschaerts valve gear and, like the Class MJ Mallets, had Belpaire fireboxes, but slightly larger boilers. When compared to the Class MJ, a distinguishing feature of the Class MJ1 was the sandbox which was mounted on top of the boiler to the rear of the steam dome in North American style. In general appearance, they bore a family resemblance to the Class 14C and Class 15B 4-8-2 locomotives which were also built by MLW in 1918. During 1922, the coupled wheels were retyred and their diameter was increased from to . Reboilering During 1939, while W.A.J. Day was the CME of the SAR, the Classes MJ and MJ1 were modified slightly to be reboilered with the same standard boiler. Service The Class MJ1 was the last Mallet locomotive class to be placed in service by the SAR. All the Railway’s subsequent new articulated locomotives were to be Garratts, Modified Fairlies and Union Garratts. The Class MJ1 was also intended for branch line working and joined the Class MJ Mallets in service in the Eastern Cape.

The site The Kent Wildlife Trust reserve occupies 5 hectares at grid reference TQ438609, but the SSSI covers a wider area of 17.7 hectares. There is an area of ancient woodland called Hangrove Wood, and chalk downland called 'Rough Pell' on a tythe map of 1840, but known to Darwin as Orchis Bank, because many wild orchids grew there.Darwin's Landscape Laboratory, Downe Bank It has a good diversity of chalk grassland species, including toothwort, adder's tongue and false oxlip. Up to 31 species of birds have been recorded, together with dormice and invertebrates. It is one of the few sites in the area to have remained almost unaltered since Darwin's day, due to the efforts of local naturalists. Access is by a footpath, which goes through the reserve, between Christmas Tree Farm on Cudham Road in Downe and Overshaws on Cudham Lane near Cudham. The footpath is part of the Cudham Circular Short Walk (not the full Walk). The entrance, which has no car parking, is on Hangrove Hill. The southern part is open to the public, and access to the more important northern part is by prior arrangement with the Trust. Charles Darwin Darwin's observations of orchids and their insect pollinators at Orchis Bank provided the evidence for his important book, Fertilisation of Orchids, published in 1862, and experts agree that it inspired his famous conclusion to On the Origin of Species: :It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us .... and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.Natural History Museum, Downe, Bromley, Kent According to his son, Francis: :Another favourite place was \\"Orchis Bank,\\" above the quiet Cudham valley, where fly- and musk-orchis grew among the junipers, and Cephalanthera and Neottia under the beech boughs; the little wood \\"Hangrove,\\" just above this, he was also fond of, and here I remember his collecting grasses, when he took a fancy to make out the names of all the common kinds. He was fond of quoting the saying of one of his little boys, who, having found a grass that his father had not seen before, had it laid by his own plate during dinner, remarking, \\"I are an extraordinary grass-finder!\\"Francis Darwin, The life and letters of Charles Darwin, including an autobiographical chapter, Volume 1, London, John Murray, 1887, p. 116 Darwin's daughter, Henrietta Lichfield, wrote: :Just on the other side of the narrow steep little lane leading to the village of Cudham, perched high above the valley, was 'Orchis bank,' where bee, fly, musk, and butterfly orchises grew.

It first aired on 4 July 2011. The programme features Jake, a nine-month- old baby. Jake is the youngest of ten children all living in a windmill with their parents. Each episode features Jake embarking on an adventure with a host of magical characters that may include Pengy Quinn the Penguin, Toot Toot the Tractor, Captain Spacey and the Hamsternauts, Nibbles the Rabbit and Sydney the Monkey. These characters are always doing something related to the adventure that Baby Jake is on. The show features a child narrator and all ten children are depicted in real life, although Baby Jake is given a multi-angle photographic face on an animated body. Jake's babbling is translated by his 5-year-old brother Isaac. Isaac is voiced by a real-life 5-year-old boy, in a move described by the Guardian as \\"a risk\\" since the majority of successful children's television is narrated by adults. The roles of Jake and Isaac are portrayed by real-life brothers Adamo and Franco Bertacchi-Morroni respectively, with Kaizer Akhtar providing the voice of Isaac.  Production  The programme cost £1.85m to produce, and was funded by the Irish Film Boardhttp://www.irishfilmboard.ie/irish_film_industry/news/Irish_Animation_Firm_JAM_Media_Announces_22_New_High_Spec_Animation_Jobs/1674 and CBeebies. Darrall Macqueen Ltd originated the series and produced the animated elements of the programme through JAM Media. JAM Media are an Irish animation studio who also made Tilly and Friends.https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/childrens2012/cbeebies/tilly.html Maddy Darrall was quoted by the Metro as gaining inspiration for the show from watching her 7-year-old nephew understanding her 1-year-old son. The series is animated by Jam Media in Dublin and the lead writer is Dave Ingham (Charlie and Lola, Koala Brothers). Location The windmill featured in the series is Sibsey Trader Mill just outside the village of Sibsey near Boston in Lincolnshire. In the programme it is shown as a large family home with additional floors, rooms and windows rather than a working mill, although it shows full working sails. Wheat harvesting in fields in and around the mill at the time had to be delayed to allow filming to take place back in the late summer of 2010 so that they had the correct ripened wheat colours. Series Series one of Baby Jake ran in the UK each weekday from July to August 2011 and consisted of 26 episodes in total. Series two began on 10 September 2012 also consisting of 26 episodes. Series two was the last series commissioned. There has been no request for a further series since. The series has also been shown on Al-Jazeera. Reception The show was relatively popular at launch compared to other BBC Children's TV programs, occupying all top five positions on the BBC Ceebies iplayer for a week.

History In 1877, J. B. Holmes and B. D. Holmes built a mill to saw lumber and shingles at the site of March Rapids on the Big Eau Pleine River in the pine forest of central Wisconsin. A village named Hope formed around the mill, with possibly 75 inhabitants. In 1887 the mill was bought by Thomas March, who had grown up in New York and had run mills in nearby Spencer. In 1891 a logging railroad reached the town and began hauling out as many as five carloads of lumber a day. A post office was established with the name March. But a flood in December damaged the operation and in May the dam washed out, losing many sawlogs. In late 1892 Thomas March sold the mill to Doud & Sons, a barrel-making enterprise with factories in Winona, Rudolph and Pittsville. They added machines to make staves and headings for barrels. By 1897 they were shipping most of the headings, staves and lumber to Superior, where Doud operated a barrel factory. The town grew to around 200 residents, with a general store, hotel, butcher, two saloons, shoemaker, blacksmith, dance hall, church and school. In 1905 the Wisconsin Central Railroad decided to pull up the tracks that had carried out March Rapids' products, despite Doud's objections. Doud and Sons obtained two early tractors to tow wagons of lumber out to the railroad at Stratford. This worked well until 1911, when the bridge at Noisy Creek collapsed under the steam-pull tractor and two operators were killed. In 1913 a disastrous fire destroyed the entire mill. Doud replaced it with a more modern mill with a band saw and electric lights. In 1914 Doud built its own railroad from March Rapids five miles to Staadt to haul out logs. But the timber ran out. The mills shut down. In 1921 the population was down to 100. Today all that remains of Marsh Rapids is a park where County P crosses the Big Eau Pleine River, with a picnic area and a historical marker.

Description Sveltonectes is known from the holotype IRSNB R269, an almost complete three-dimensionally preserved skeleton including a partial skull. It was collected in unnamed locality, in Ul’yanovsk, dating to the late Barremian stage of the early Cretaceous, about 126 million years ago. Another thunnosaur described from the same locality, by Bogolubow (1909), is \\"Ichthyosaurus\\" steleodon. It is a nomen dubium that is twice the size and more robust than Sveltonectes. Like some other ophthalmosaurids, Sveltonectes has a projection on the nasal bone of the skull into the naris, a prefrontal forming part of the margin of the naris and a frontal forming part of the margin of the supratemporal fenestra. Sveltonectes is unique in that it has small, sharp teeth and numerous other peculiar features such as a very primitive prootic. The distinctive shape of these teeth suggest that it had a different feeding habit than other cretaceous ophthalmosaurids. Within the Ophthalmosauridae, Sveltonectes is most closely related to Aegirosaurus. Etymology Sveltonectes was named by Valentin Fischer, Edwige Masure, Maxim S. Arkhangelsky, and Pascal Godefroit in 2011 and the type species is Sveltonectes insolitus. The generic name is derived from sveltos, Greek for \\"agile\\", and nektes, Greek for \\"swimmer\\", and refers to its small size, streamlined skull, and powerful girdle musculature. The specific name is derived from insolitus, Latin for \\"unusual\\", in reference to the numerous unusual features of this ichthyosaur, as well as its unusual tooth morphology.

The band consisted of Thomas Sanders (vocals), Peter Hefferan (vocals and guitar), David Thorpe (guitar), Peter Cattermoul (bass) and Jonny Sanders (drums).  History  =Beginnings and Get Even EP (2004-2005)= Brothers Tommy Sanders and Jonny Sanders grew up playing music together at home in their early teens. Jonny later played in a band with Guitarist David Thorpe while attending Maiden Erlegh School in Reading. It was not until they all left school that they met with Bassist Peter Cattermoul and Guitarist Peter Hefferan, who had also played music together in their late teens, that the band was formed. Initially, the lineup did not include Tommy Sanders and was fronted by Peter Hefferan. After playing just a few shows around Reading, the band were invited on a short tour with all-girl punk band Wetdog, who took them to play at The Spitz in Spitalfield Market. It was here that the band was picked up by a new indie label Stolen Recordings and where they would begin to build their reputation as an exciting live act. Just a few months later, the bands was in a studio in Hornsey making their first EP. The band's first release, the Get Even EP, was limited to 500 numbered CDs, all with handmade covers. Rough Trade wrote of the EP \\"The six tracks have folk bits, byrdsy harmony bits, kraut-rock frug-outs, punk blasts of power and superb pop moments all segued and strewn together carelessly but precisely. It's oddball and charming and would sit perfectly next to the englishness of the Mystery Jets or Wire, although they sound like neither.\\" =Wait, Stop, Begin EP (2006-2007)= After the release of their first EP, the band came to the notice of Jason Lamont of CMO Management. The band continued to play more shows around London and the UK and Tommy Sanders joined the group in 2006. Sometime after this the band were approached by Lamont for management and also by William Morris Endeavor for live bookings. Songs from Wait, Stop Begin would appear later on the debut album Little Death. On 25 August 2007 the band played in the Carling Tent at Reading Festival. They also played guerilla gigs in the campsite later that day, which came to the attention of the NME who featured an article in their magazine. =Little Death (2008-2010)= In June 2007 they released their debut single \\"Come On Feet\\" on Stolen Recordings and were championed by Steve Lamacq on his In New Music We Trust radio show on BBC Radio 1. It also featured in EA Sports game, UEFA Euro 2008. Their first album Little Death, produced by Gareth Parton and the band, was released on 17 February 2008. It was described by NME as \\"perfect pop without the pretence\\". Pitchfork gave Little Death 8 out of 10 saying \\"Even if you'd be to admit it to your friends, \\"Dry Wings\\", with lines like, \\"Time for bed / Find a girl and go to bed / Close your eyes / Stars are falling from the sky,\\" is mighty affecting—a winking galaxy of jangled wist, sweet, staggered harmonies and a gawky, yearning sense of wonder.\\" The Guardian gave the album 3 out of 5 stars saying, \\"this eclecticism does make Little Death feel like the work of several different bands. No matter. There is imagination to spare here, as well as the occasional winning lyric.\\" Conversely, in a review by Vice Magazine, Little Death was given 0 out of 10 and winner of the \\"worst album of the month\\" category. In this review, written by Stewy Matterson, the album was described as \\"jangly guitar music that doesn't actually sound like it wants to be heard by anybody apart from [the band's] mothers\\". The band played several support dates with Maxïmo Park, Vampire Weekend, Pigeon Detectives and Gossip and were the headline act at Club NME at London's KOKO in September 2008. Pete and the Pirates also performed BBC 6 Music sessions on shows with Stephen Merchant (co-creator of The Office), George Lamb and more frequently Marc Riley. \\"Mr Understanding\\" was the band's biggest track to date and featured on many TV shows including The Inbetweeners and also in the trailer for the film Hamlet 2 starring Steve Coogan. =One Thousand Pictures (2011-2012)= The band's second album, One Thousand Pictures, produced by Brendan Lynch, was released in the UK on 23 May 2011 to much critical acclaim - the Sunday Express and Artrocker both gave the Album 5 star reviews and Mark Beaumont from NME gave the Album an 8/10 score, describing the music as \\"Pop in a tar-pit – black and sticky but wonderfully pure at heart\\". It was also reviewed in The Guardian, Q and many other magazines and broadsheets. The band had become known for their straight-up accented vocal delivery, as noted by Johnny Dee for The Guardian, \\"you can practically smell the Thames on every word\\". The first single from the album, \\"Come to the Bar\\", was released on 14 March 2011. The promo video was directed by Rohan Thomas and Tylie Cox and was shot at The Lexington in Angel, London. The video features an interpretive dance performance from Daniela Neugebauer and colour grading from Reuben Sutherland. The song later appeared during the end credits of the Channel 4 show Sirens. To promote the record the band toured the UK in April and May 2011 with a sold-out show at Heaven, London on 26 May. The Fly reviewed \\"Celebrating the release of new album 'One Thousand Pictures', the band have refined their audience, marking out a clear divide between their work and that of countless indistinguishable landfill indie bands\\". They also played an in-store show at Rough Trade East on 2 June 2011. The second single \\"United\\" was released on 16 May 2011. The band requested footage of cats from fans through their website and mailing list to include in the video for the song. The video also features the band hanging around with various cats. Marc Riley of BBC 6 Music has been one of the band's most prominent enthusiasts, inviting them to perform on his show on numerous occasions. The band have achieved playlists on BBC 6 Music and XFM as well as spot plays on BBC Radio 1, where Zane Lowe gave \\"Come To The Bar\\" his \\"Hottest Record in the World\\" for the song's first radio play. \\"Blood Gets Thin\\" was used in an episode of The Protector and of American Horror Story, and in a trailer for the fourth season of Breaking Bad. A large number of CD and vinyl copies of the album were scorched in a fire at Sony's distribution warehouse during the 2011 England riots. The band toured the UK and Europe from September to November 2011, with a headline show at the Scala in London on 4 October and a 9,000 capacity show with Kaiser Chiefs at Kirkstall Abbey on 10 September. However, their activity was minimal during 2012, and in late October 2012, Marc Riley, on his BBC 6 Music radio show, confirmed the rumours that the band had split up. No official statement has been released. Tommy, Jonny and Peter Cattermoul have reformed under the name Teleman. Peter Hefferan now fronts a band called The 3.1419 Wonders, and recently toured with Dan le Sac, as well as singing on a track on his latest album Space Between the Words.

Founding figures of this approach are Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, two post-Marxist political theorists, who, disillusioned with economic reductionism, tried, since the 1970s, to reinterpret Gramsci’s theory of hegemony to highlight the role of meaning and of processes of interpellation and identification in the creation of political identities and in the articulation and sedimentation of political discourses and hegemonic orders. The paradigmatic formulation of this innovative orientation and of its various conceptual innovations can be found in Laclau’s and Mouffe’s Hegemony and Socialist Strategy, first published in 1985, as well as in many subsequent contributions of the two thinkers.See Laclau, Ernesto & Mouffe, Chantal, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy, London: Verso, 1985. The approach developed by Laclau and Mouffe and the theoretical traditions influencing their thought – mainly Saussurean linguistics, Lacanian psychoanalysis and deconstruction – provided the teaching backbone of the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis Laclau founded at the University of Essex in the early 1980s.See the Center for Ideology and Discourse Analysis website: https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/ideology-and-discourse-analysis Already from its inception, the programme attracted many MA and PhD students from around the globe, especially from Argentina, Mexico, Greece, Denmark, Spain, the US and the UK. Many PhD theses further developing Laclau’s and Mouffe’s discourse theory and/or applying it in the empirical analysis of concrete empirical cases have since been completed. Graduates of the programme are now employed by universities in many parts of the world, while the programme itself is run by three members of staff at Essex: Aletta Norval, David Howarth and Jason Glynos, all ex-PhD students of Laclau. Academics associated with the programme have also set up a World Network in Ideology and Discourse Analysis,See: http://www.essex.ac.uk/idaworld/ which provides a web-based channel of communication between its 203 registered members and has also organized the Inaugural World Conference in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, which took place from 8-10 September 2008 at Roskilde University, Denmark, with Ernesto Laclau as keynote speaker.See: http://magenta.ruc.dk/isg/discourse/ Apart from setting up a distinct graduate programme, now in its third decade, three other factors are indicative of the increasing international recognition and the gradual institutionalization of the research tradition initiated by Laclau and Mouffe: (i) The activities of the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences, also founded by Laclau at the University of Essex (and now co-directed by Norval and Howarth), which functioned as the intellectual hub of the Ideology and Discourse Analysis group;See: http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/Theostud/ (ii) The publication, from 2000 onwards, of a series of monographs, edited collections and textbooks by members of the group, some of them based on the doctoral research conducted within the programme;Especially see: Howarth, David, Discourse, Buckingham: Open University Press, 2000; Howarth, David, Norval, Aletta & Stavrakakis, Yannis (eds) Discourse Theory and Political Analysis: identities, hegemonies and social change. Manchester - New York: Manchester University Press – St Martin's Press, 2000; and Howarth, David & Torfing, Jacob (eds) Discourse Theory in European Politics, Houndmills: Palgrave, 2005. (iii) The inclusion of the orientation developed by Laclau and Mouffe and their students as a distinct research direction within the field of discourse analysis in textbooks and introductions to the field published by independent scholars.See, for example, Phillips, Louise & Jorgensen, Marianne, Discourse Analysis as Theory and Method. London: Sage, 2002. As a result of all these developments, the distinct identity of the group and of its research output gradually triggered a process of naming. From 2003 onwards, when critics wanted to refer to the work of members of the group, they used the phrase ‘the Essex School’,See Townshend, Jules, ‘Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, British Journal of Politics and International Relations, Vol. 5, 2003, pp. 129–142, and ‘Laclau and Mouffe’s Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far’, Political Studies, 52, 2004, pp. 269-288. which is now widely used by both members of the group and ‘outsiders’.See, for example, Robinson, Andrew, ‘The Politics of Lack’, British Journal of Politics and International Relations, Vol. 6, 2004, pp. 259-269; Selg, Peeter & Ventsel, Andreas, ‘An Outline of a Semiotic Theory of Hegemony’, Semiotica, 182, 2010, pp. 443-474; Soage, Ana, ‘La teoria del discurso de la escuela de Essex an su contexto teorico’, clac circulo, no. 25, 2006: http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/soage.pdf The Essex School does not limit the research direction of its ‘members’, each one of whom develops her or his own orientation independently; it offers, however, a loose framework within which a multitude of theoretical and political interventions can flourish, enriching the original vision of Laclau and Mouffe.

In his growth model, Kaldor attempts \\"to provide a framework for relating the genesis of technical progress to capital accumulation\\", whereas the other neoclassical models treat the causation of technical progress as completely exogenous. Nancy J. Wulwick (1992). Kaldor's Growth Theory. Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 14, pp 36-54 According to Kaldor, \\"The purpose of a theory of economic growth is to show the nature of non-economic variables which ultimately determine the rate at which the general level of production of economy is growing, and thereby contribute to an understanding of the question of why some societies grow so much faster than others.\\"Nicholas Kaldor: A Model of Economic Growth, Economic Journal, 1957. Nancy J. Wulwick (1992). Kaldor's Growth Theory. Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 14, pp 36-54 Assumptions The basic properties of Kaldor's growth model are as follows: # Short period supply of aggregate goods and services in a growing economy is inelastic and not affected by any increase in effective monetary demand. As it is based on the Keynesian assumption of \\"full employment\\". # The technical progress depends on the rate of capital accumulation. Kaldor postulates the \\"technical progress function\\", which shows a relationship between the growth of capital and productivity, incorporating the influence of both the factors. Where the capital-output ratio will depend upon the relationship of the growth of capital and the growth of productivity. # Wages and profits constitute the income, where wages comprise salaries and earnings of manual labour, and profits comprise incomes of entrepreneurs as well as property owners. And total savings consist of savings out of wages and savings out of profit.

She is also known as a historian of the Liao and Jin dynasties. Her works include a grammar of Manchu (1983), a dictionary of Jurchen (2003), and a study of Khitan memorial inscriptions (2005), as well as various studies on the phonology and grammar of the Khitan language. Biography Aisin-Gioro was born in Beijing, the second daughter of Jin Qizong (1918–2004), and the granddaughter of Jin Guangping (1899–1966), both of whom were also renowned scholars of Manchu and Jurchen. She is a direct descendant of the Qianlong Emperor as Jin Guangping was a sixth generation descendant of Qianlong's fifth son, Prince Rongchun (Aisin-Gioro Yongqi). Other ancestors include the poet Gu Taiqing, who was the wife of Prince Rongchun's grandson, Aisin-Gioro Yihui (1799–1838). Aisin-Gioro studied at the Minzu University of China in Beijing, before obtaining a doctorate at Kyoto University in Japan. She worked as a research scholar at the Center for Eurasian Cultural Studies at Kyoto University, and is currently a professor at the Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Beppu. Aisin-Gioro now lives in Japan, and is married to (born 1959), a Japanese historian of China. Since her marriage she has adopted the Japanese name . The Japanese given name Chieko means \\"wisdom\\", which corresponds to her Manchu given name, Ulhicun, which means \\"knowledge\\". Jurchen studies One of Aisin-Gioro's contributions to the study of Jurchen has been the identification of the Jurchen small script. According to the History of the Jin Dynasty there were two different Jurchen scripts: a \\"large script\\" that was devised in 1120 by command of Wanyan Aguda, the first emperor of the Jin Dynasty; and a \\"small script\\" that was created in 1138 by the Emperor Xizong (r. 1135–1150), but which was first officially used in 1145. It is presumed that the Jurchen large script was modelled on the Khitan large script, and the Jurchen small script was modelled on the Khitan small script, but all the extant examples of Jurchen writing, including the Sino-Jurchen Vocabulary of the Bureau of Interpreters (Nǚzhēn Yìyǔ 女真譯語) and monumental inscriptions, are written in basically the same script, which is similar in form to the Khitan large script. During the 1970s a number of gold and silver paiza were unearthed in China; these all had the same inscription which was assumed to be written in the Khitan small script. Aisin-Gioro has analysed the inscription on these paiza, and although the structure of the characters is identical to the Khitan small script she concludes that the script is not actually the Khitan small script but is in fact the otherwise unattested Jurchen small script. She argues that this small script was only used briefly during the last five years of the reign of its creator, Emperor Xizong, and when he was murdered in a coup d'état the small script fell out of use as it was less convenient to use than the earlier large script.

The Hyper III had twin fins and rudders canted at 40° from the vertical, and hinged elevons on the horizontal surface. The landing gear was a fixed tricycle type, using spring steel legs from a Cessna aircraft. It was fitted with an emergency parachute system and controlled by 5-channel radio link; instrument data was downlinked using a 12-channel radio. On 12 December 1969 the Hyper III was launched from a helicopter at 10,000 feet. It glided 5 km, turned round, came back and landed.

It ranked third among The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2016,theworlds50best.com Eleven Madison Park and topped the list in 2017.  History  The restaurant, designed by Bentel & Bentel, is located in the Metropolitan Life North Building, facing Madison Square, at the intersection of Madison Avenue and 24th Street. The restaurant originally opened in 1998 and was owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer. In 2006, Chef Daniel Humm and Will Guidara began working at Eleven Madison Park and in 2011 they purchased it from Meyer. Humm and Guidara also own and operate the NoMad restaurant in the NoMad Hotel, opened in 2012, and Made Nice, a counter- service restaurant in Manhattan. Their restaurants are under the Make It Nice group.Eleven Madison Park Restaurant in the Make It Nice group http://makeitnicenyc.com/ Eleven Madison Park was closed for renovation between June 9 and October 11, 2017, mainly to revamp the kitchen which had not been updated in nearly 20 years.Eleven Madison Park renovations The restaurant closed again during the COVID-19 pandemic, instead producing meals for the food-insecure in New York City in cooperation with the non-profit Rethink Food. Humm has said reopening may prove prohibitively expensive, putting the future of the establishment in question.  Menu  The restaurant offers guests one multi-course tasting menu inspired by the agricultural bounty of New York and its culinary traditions. This concept has come under occasional criticism. In 2015, Tanya Gold wrote of the menu, \\"It is not, to me, food, because it owes more to obsession than to love. It is not, psychologically, nourishing. It is weaponized food, food tortured and contorted beyond what is reasonable; food taken to its illogical conclusion; food not to feed yourself but to thwart other people.\\"  Cookbooks  The Eleven Madison Park Cookbook was published in 2011;Eleven Madison Park Cookbook Humm and Guidara have released additional cookbooks including: I Love New York: Ingredients and Recipes,I Love New York: Ingredients and Recipes The NoMad Cookbook,The NoMad Cookbook and Eleven Madison Park: The Next Chapter.Eleven Madison Park: The Next Chapter Awards * La Liste, the list of the 1,000 best restaurants in the world according to France's Foreign Ministry, ranked Eleven Madison Park 4th in the United States and 241st overall worldwide in its inaugural edition of December 2015.La Liste, Eleven Madison Park * Relais & Châteaux – Eleven Madison Park designated as Grand Chef, 2008 * The New York Times – Four Stars, 2015 and 2009 * James Beard Foundation Award – Outstanding Service, 2016; Outstanding Chef, Daniel Humm, 2012; Outstanding Pastry Chef, Angela Pinkerton, 2011; Outstanding Restaurant, 2011; and Best Chef: New York City, Daniel Humm, 2010 * S.

While networked advocacy has existed for centuries, it has become significantly more efficacious in recent years due in large part to the widespread availability of the internet, mobile telephones, and related communications technologies that enable users to overcome the transaction costs of collective action. The study of networked advocacy draws on interdisciplinary sources, including communication theory, political science, and sociology. Theories of networked advocacy have been heavily influenced by social movement literature, and refer to the preexisting networks used to create and support collective actions and advocacy as well as the networks that such actions and advocacy create. History and scope of advocacy networks Examples of formal transnational advocacy networks date back to 1823 with the formation of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions. Other examples include the women's movement, the environmental movement,Keck, M.E. and Sikkink, K. (1998). Activists beyond borders. Advocacy networks in international relations Ithaca: Cornell University Press. and the anti-landmine movement. However, the number, size, and professionalism of networks, as well as the speed, density and complexity of international linkages between and within them, has grown dramatically since the 1960s.Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. \\"Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics. Cornell University Press, 1998, p. 10. While advocacy networks as a whole have been able to grow in size in recent years, they nonetheless continue to vary in scale individually, with Keck and Sikkink noting that networks may operate transnationally, regionally, or domestically.http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic446176.files/Week_7/Keck_and_Sikkink_Transnational_Advocacy.pdf One of the most important changes in recent decades has been in the ability of less formally organized or professionally run networks to grow and develop. Sometimes these networks eventually take on the characteristics of their more professionally managed counterparts and other times they remain strikingly informal. Networked advocacy, by its nature, is more likely to be conducted (and to be identified) in a transnational context than a domestic one. But the mistake should not be made of considering only transnational networks of activists to be networked advocacy. A transnational character makes it easier to spot networked advocacy, but an international context is not a prerequisite. Two examples of advocacy networks from different ends of the American political spectrum serve as good illustrations of this point. Tea party activists and the protesters of Code Pink, though advocating for opposing political views, both have a horizontal, loosely connected network structure. Each group comprises smaller nodes dispersed throughout the country that are loosely connected with one another on a national level. These nodes can share lessons, techniques, and even resources, and they occasionally come together for larger conferences or actions. Both of these groups are also primarily focused on U.S. policy, defying the assertion that networked advocacy can only operate in a transnational context. Elements of networked advocacy =Imagined communities= Benedict Anderson's 1983 book Imagined Communities defined nations as socially structured communities, and thus nationalism as something imagined by a group of people who perceive themselves as a part of that nation. By the time of Anderson's writing, social constructivism in the concept of nationality was hardly a new phenomenon. Walter Lippmann coined the phrase \\"pseudo-environment\\" in his 1922 book Public Opinion to refer to the ways people make sense of their worlds based on what they have individually experienced, what he called \\"the pictures in our heads\\". In popular culture, and much more cynically, Kurt Vonnegut had coined the term granfalloon to refer to a group which claims to have a common purpose but is actually meaningless. Vonnegut's main example is the group of people who claim to be Hoosiers and hence believe themselves intertwined by common identity despite having no other social or material connection. What set Anderson apart from these two other writers was his description of the connection between modes of communication and the formation of the modern nation state. According to Anderson, the rise of print-capitalism came with a standardization of language and writing in the vernacular. The standardization of writing allowed for a common discourse to emerge between people who were separated by long distances and experienced no direct personal interactions. This, in turn, enabled common identities to form and \\"imagined communities\\" to arise. Such imagined communities have significantly affected the nature of networked advocacy. The development of international networks concurrent with the rise of inexpensive yet sophisticated information communication technologies has allowed events of seemingly local significance to be scaled to global significance with fewer impediments. The implications of this change in the nature of international advocacy come in terms of both the scope of what organizations and individuals can accomplish and in the scale of their accomplishments. The inherently transnational nature of the associations and tools utilized in such efforts make it quite possible that new nations may arise without the identity of a nation state. =Collective action= Collective action is the pursuit of a goal or set of goals by more than one person. A group coalesces around a single goal or issue and agitates for change. Collective action is made easier through networked advocacy because the search and information costs of organizing are lowered by new communication networks, especially the internet. The scale-free nature of many organizational networks allows for collective action to be at once organized and leaderless. James Madison provided a gateway for thinking about collective action in his Federalist No. 10.Hamilton, Alexander; Madison, James; and Jay, John. The Federalist. Edited by Jacob E. Cooke. Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1961. Madison was concerned with a faction of the population rising up and forming a mob. Madison saw collective action as the workings of factions: Men whose “instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into public councils, have in truth been the mortal disease under which governments have perished.” He feared collective action and wanted to avoid and suppress it. In order to limit the contagiousness of conflict, Madison wanted to raise the transaction costs required for collective action by expanding the size of the public. To Madison, the key to political stability was found in raising the barriers to collective action so that the aggrieved could not find others with similar grievances. Madison advocated for a polity containing a highly varied body of citizens from within a very large geographic entity, making collective action less probable. The model of extending the public sphere lowered the influence of factions, increased the transaction costs for groups attempting to mobilize, and decreased disruption of government affairs. Transaction costs have had evolving identities since the beginning of their existence. James Madison speaks of transaction costs in Federalist 10. Transaction costs is the cost of the exchange and sharing of information so that individuals, groups and organizations can work together, communicate and achieve a common goal. During the time of James Madison, transaction costs were high. Information technology was crude in form and it took much time and energy to communicate ideas and information with others. Madison knew that this was to his advantage when it came to quelling conflict in the American masses. So long as transaction costs were high, people had less incentive to communicate common grievances with each other and start any conflict with the government or other groups of people. Transaction costs have since evolved and have played key roles in the mobilization of organizations and groups. With the expansion of information technology involving telephones and the internet, people are more apt to share information at low costs. It is now fast and inexpensive to communicate with others. As a result, transaction costs regarding communication and the sharing of information is low and, at times, free. Low transaction costs have allowed for groups of people to join together in common causes. The growth of shared information, conflict can be socialized rather than privatized. As a result, people can become more involved in decision making processes and functionality of government and organizations. However, even though there are very low transaction costs among greater populations, there is still the growing issue of changing social capital. Some scholars have suggested, however, that some elements of Madison's arguments in Federalist #10 need to be revisited. For example, by expanding the sphere, Madison has indeed raised transaction costs. But scholars like E.E. Schattschneider have argued that \\"the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly choir sings with a strong upper class accent.\\" The upper classes are the only ones in society who have the resources necessary for the \\"mobilization of bias\\", and thus Madison has unintentionally disenfranchised the lower classes access to political influence. Other holes in Madison's argument are that, in today's digital world of modern telecommunications and instant communication, geographical distance may be meaningless. Mancur Olson might be called the father of modern collective action theory. His 1965 book, The Logic of Collective Action, takes an economics-based approach to studying when groups do and do not collaborate to achieve common goals. Starting with the assumption of individual rationality, Olson posits that rational individuals will always act in their own self-interest, rather than a collective or group good, unless the group is small or they are coerced in some way. In his model, the costs of participation create an incentive for individuals to \\"free ride,\\" or rely on others to provide the collective good. This tendency is especially acute in the context of large groups, where individual contributions are difficult to perceive by other group members. Olson suggests that \\"selective incentives,\\" positive or negative inducements that affect only members of a particular group, along with coercive measures can play a part in overcoming the rational disinclination toward collective action.Olson, Mancur. 1971. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. 2nd ed. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press: 51. Overcoming rational self-interest through Olson's selective incentives can involve significant time and resources, which is why he concludes that “[a]ny group that must organize to obtain a certain good, then, will find that it has a certain minimum organization cost that must be met.”Olson, Mancur. 1971. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. 2nd ed. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press: 47. He argues that these costs increase as the size of the group increases, making it more likely that a large group will become “latent,” or exist only with the potential to mobilize for a common good. He uses these assumptions to conclude that small groups are more efficient than large groupsOlson, Mancur. 1971. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. 2nd ed. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press: 3. and that formal organizations are necessary for larger groups to meet large, collective objectives.Olson, Mancur. 1971. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. 2nd ed. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press: 65. Central to this point is the idea that organizations can shoulder the burden of high collaboration and information costs, both through resources and by managing and coordinating the flow of information. In Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone, declining social capital is linked to a decline in civic engagement and a general malaise hanging over American democracy. Putnam argues, \\"[T]he norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the performance of representative government.\\" Putnam, Robert D. \\"Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital.\\" Journal of Democracy 6(1), 1995, 65-78. He suggests that the decline in social capital formation and civic engagement might be due to women entering the workforce, the “re-potting hypothesis” involving suburbanization and mobility of the American people, demographic changes in American family life, and/or the technological transformation of leisure. He ultimately dismisses the women in the workforce factor, as well as the re-potting hypothesis as major contributing factors to declining social capital, but he suggests that changing demographics as well as the changing nature of the American economy—from family-owned grocery stores to massive supermarkets—may play a role. He encourages further exploration of the technological transformation of leisure, the factor he seems to attribute most to America's declining social capital. Because social norms are continuously changing and people are relying less and less on each other for entertainment and survival, there are new barriers to communication that can hinder collective action. People are less likely to work together in some senses as they are more isolated than ever. Sidney Tarrow's examination of social movements and contentious politics echoes the sentiments of Putnam's argument and builds on Olson's fundamental understanding of group formation. Tarrow argues that individuals engage in collective action, more specifically “contentious politics,” when changes in the political environment generate either opportunities or constraints that create openings for organizations to mobilize individuals to act collectively or to air grievances. When they do so in a sustained way, he argues, it can be called a “social movement.”Tarrow, Sidney. 2011. Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics. 3rd ed. New York: Cambridge University Press: 28. As Sidney Tarrow explains, leaders (whether political, community, or local) employ tactics that appeal to the emotions and identity of the people, and they gain support because the people feel unified emotionally and are easily able to associate with and sympathize towards others in that group.Tarrow, Sidney. \\"Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics\\". Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2010, p. 38 Tarrow's contentious politics arise when people respond to political opportunities and act collectively. Tarrow explains that changes to ICT affect the way that communities deal with contentious politics, which “occurs when ordinary people – often in alliance with more influential citizens and with changes in public mood – join forces in confrontation with elites, authorities, and opponents.”Tarrow, Sidney 2010: Power in Movement, Cambridge, 19th edition, p. 31 She continues, explaining that, “ordinary people take advantage of incentives created by shifting opportunities and constraints…they transform social networks and cultural frameworks into action …the Internet and other forms of electronic communication are changing the nature of mobilization.” Tarrow, Sidney 2010: Power in Movement, Cambridge, 19th edition, p. 32 It is through these changes, Tarrow argues, that “ordinary people have power because they challenge power holders, produce solidarities, and have meaning to particular population groups, situations, and national cultures.” Tarrow, Sidney 2010: Power in Movement, Cambridge, 19th edition, p. 33 Tarrow also argues that when a collective action is supported by \\"dense social networks and connective structures,\\" the ostensibly weaker participants in the collective action can sustain their activities against a more powerful opponent.Tarrow, Sidney. \\"Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics\\". Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2010, 10. While Tarrow is unsure of whether Putnam's social capital is a necessary condition for collective action, both authors speak of networks as being necessary for collective action. And Tarrow warns that without some formal organization and hierarchy “movements frequently fade away or dissipate their energies,” reinforcing the importance of formal, hierarchical organizations.Tarrow, Sidney. 2011. Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics. 3rd ed. New York: Cambridge University Press: 124. In Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics, Tarrow suggests that the conditions of a political and social environment influence the likelihood of and possibilities for contentious collective action, as \\"changes in political opportunities and constraints create the most important incentives for initiating new phases of contention.\\" Steven Livingston follows a similar line of theory introduced by Bryan D. Jones and Frank R. Baumgartner in discussing the conditions of political change, arguing that \\"bursts of rapid and often unpredictable policy change punctuate the patterns of relatively long-term policy equilibria.\\" In \\"Networks of Outrage and Hope\\" Manuel Castells argues that movements are “usually triggered by a spark of indignation related to a specific event or to a peak of disgust with the actions of the rulers.” (2012, p. 224). Castells makes the case for the importance and relevance of new technologies as a tool for organizing action. Networks are created in multiple ways, resulting in online and offline actions. Groups that are repressed or angry, use digital networks to find each other and create and consolidate their connections: “Enthusiastic networked individuals, having overcome fear, are transformed into a conscious collective actor.” (219) His work focuses on the outrage that protesters have generally used as a catalyst for movements throughout history: \\"[Social movements] usually stem from a crisis of living conditions that makes everyday life unbearable for most people. They are prompted by a deep distrust of the political institutions managing society. The combination of a degradation of the material conditions of life and of a crisis of legitimacy of the rulers in charge with the conduct of public affairs induces people to take matters into their own hands, engaging in collective action outside the prescribed institutional channels, to defend their demands and, eventually, to change the rulers and even the rules shaping their lives.\\" Castells, M. (2012, p. 218). Networks of outrage and hope: social movements in the Internet age. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press. Others suggest that when the costs—the relative amounts of time, money or effort required—of information and collaboration are low due to an area's \\"information abundance\\" or the affordances of information and communication technologies, collective action will be more likely to occur and more capable of occurring on a large scale. Castells further argues that this sense of outrage stems from individuals reacting against the networks of power that have come to fail them. In the case of Iceland he writes, “their outrage from the realization that the democratic institutions did not represent the interests of citizens because the political class had become a self- reproducing cast that was catering to the interests of the financial elite, and to the preservation of their monopoly over the state,” (Castells, p. 42, 2012.) Here, the organizations and institutions meant to provide, in a sense, for the well-being of the individuals have failed in their mission, and the people (Icelanders) need to look elsewhere if they are going to have their grievances rectified. This why these individuals come to operate in the “networked space” because it is where they hope to switch which networks hold the power, something that Castells expands on in his additional work. It is in this space where individuals and fellow grievance-holders can connect with one another and create a larger social movement.Castells, M. Networks of Outrage and Hope. Polity Press. 2012. It is in this space where technology also starts to examine properties similar to organizational forms used to promote political autonomy (Castells, p. 103, 2012.) Castells points to prior research showing how different ICTs contributed to changing the level of social participation in places like Egypt, and how involvement in these digital networks made for stronger social movements. In describing the connection between ICTs and the strength of movements, Castells writes that the research found a “significant effect on the intensity and power of these movements, starting with a very active debate on social and political demands in the social media before the demonstrations’ onset,” (Castells, p. 104, 2012.) This arguably makes for a better illustration, or understanding, of Earl and Kimport’s Theory 2.0, where individual use of technology starts to affect the process that can be transformative prior to the actual outcome. This transformative use of technology can also be seen in Castells’ brief discussion of Iceland's newest constitution. In drafting of its national constitution, the Constitutional Assembly Council fielded thousands and thousands of suggestions and comments of what should be included in the document text. Citizens interacted with members of the council via digital networks, across social media platforms and in-person debates, (Castells, p. 39, 2012) a construction of suggestions built essentially through crowdsourcing, as Castells notes. This exemplifies a change in the participatory process brought on not because of technology, but because of how the individuals chose to use technology for the purpose of collective action – in this case to write a national constitution. In international relations, collective action is often required to traverse vast geographic distances and to cross national borders. Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink create a foundation for understanding collective action and transnational advocacy networks, taking the theories of social movements defined by Tarrow and others to a transnational level – increasing the scale of collective action while staying grounded in Olson's high-cost understanding of group formation and the need for formal organizations. Keck and Sikkink differentiate transnational advocacy networks (TANs) from traditional modes of organizing by explaining that they are “motivated by values rather than by material concerns or professional norms.”Keck, Margaret and Kathryn Sikkink. \\"Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics\\". Cornell University Press: Ithaca, 1998, p. 2 TANs form around ethical issues, particularly those involving physical harm and inequality of opportunity: the abolition of slavery and the influence of the British anti-slavery movement on public opinion in the United States; the international movement advocating for women's right to vote, which gained traction from the anti-slavery moment; the movement to ban female foot binding in China and the movement against female genital mutilation in Kenya.Keck, Margaret and Kathryn Sikkink. \\"Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics\\".

Their boomerang model is an international relations collective action theory that creates a framework for how an advocacy movement travels from one country to another through different actors. In their model, blockages exist between domestic NGOs and their domestic governments. These blockages amount to more than the governments simply ignoring the grievances of people and domestic NGOs. They can include censorship, incarceration, violence, and death. For Keck and Sikkink, the goal of transnational advocacy is to lower these barriers, or decrease transaction costs, in order for change to occur. When this is not possible, the NGO will go to outside sources, using information exchanges, to find an entity that is able to put pressure on the state in question. NGOs seek help from other states, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations in order to achieve a goal within an offending state. In the face of blockage by the state, NGOs are forced work with a secondary, outside entity to make their problems heard and addressed. This theory of blockages is similar to John Gaventa's Second Dimension of Power, in which “power is exercised not just upon participants within the decision-making process but also towards the exclusion of certain participants and issues altogether.”Gaventa, John. Power and Powerlessness (University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 1980), p. 9 Keck and Sikkink's boomerang model is relatable to John Gaventa's assertion that routines and internalization of roles or false consensus lead to acceptance of the status quo by the dominated, simply because over time they become oblivious to their own conditions. However, they advance this notion and argue that the way to escape this is via third-party states and advocacy on the behalf of those dominated communities. In essence, Keck and Sikkink define a form of transnational collective action that uses information as a tactic. The result is that transnational advocacy networks’ “ability to generate information quickly and accurately, and deploy it effectively, is their most valuable currency; it is also central to their identity.”Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. 1998. Activists beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politics. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press: 10. Just as Olson and Tarrow make clear, when information is a resource (and, in this case, a commodity) with some scarcity, collaboration costs can be high and organizations become more important. Keck and Sikkink acknowledge this, particularly from the global perspective. That is why, just like Olson and Tarrow, their theory is dependent on formal, hierarchical organizations. In their case, a network of them that work together to compile information and then deploy it when opportunities arise. According to E.E. Schatschneider's socialization of conflict thesis, expanding the scope of a conflict is an essential strategy for weaker parties and is the basis of collective action.Schattschneider, E.E. \\"The Semisovereign People\\". Wadsworth Cendage Learning: Boston, 1975, p. 39. Individuals band together when attempting collective action in order to overcome the power of their opponent. Their efforts are more sustainable when the collective actions are strengthened by networks. In networked advocacy, the networks in question are not necessarily strong social networks like Putnam describes, but instead consist of the numerous weaker connections people can make every day through modern mass communication. Bruce Bimber attempts to bring existing theories of group formation and collective action up-to-date by directly addressing what he identifies as shifts in information technologies and collaboration costs, while building on many of the concepts identified by Olson, Tarrow, and Keck and Sikkink. Bimber identifies four “information regimes” that are defined both by the dominant ways in which information was shared during the set periods of time – representative democracy, the Penny Press, political intermediaries broadcasting – and the political structures that resulted from them.Bimber, Bruce. 2003. “Abstract of Information and American Democracy.” In Robles, Jose M. “Debate on Bruce Bimber’s Book Information and American Democracy. Cambridge University Press, 2003.” Revista Internacional de Sociología 69(3): 749. He argues that the current regime is characterized by “information abundance” and that information “is easily produced by virtually anyone, widely distributed, and cheap or free,” which he says means that collective action no longer requires the formal organization.Bimber, Bruce. 2003. “Abstract of Information and American Democracy.” In Robles, Jose M. “Debate on Bruce Bimber’s Book Information and American Democracy. Cambridge University Press, 2003.” Revista Internacional de Sociología 69(3): 750. Bimber sees collective action as a function of interaction and engagement. He argues that the present era is a time of organizational fecundity featuring a rise in many types of organizations, including social media networks, organizationless organizations having no tangible presence except perhaps on a computer server, and more traditional organizations. Despite this fecundity, Bimber argues that organizations still matter and that formal organizations still thrive. Lance Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg propose a new model called the “logic of connective action” – in direct response, or as a direct update, to Olson's 1965 work. As they explain, the “emerging alternative model… applies increasingly to life in the late modern societies in which institutions are losing their grip on authority and group ties are being replaced by large- scale, fluid social networks.”Bennett, W. L., and Alexandra Segerberg. 2011. “The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics.” Presented at the 6th General Conference of the European Consortium for Political Research, Reykjavik: 9. They also point to the needs of younger generations, arguing that not only has the technology changed, but so has the public's familiarity with organizations and different forms of action.Bennett, W. L., and Alexandra Segerberg. 2011. “The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics.” Presented at the 6th General Conference of the European Consortium for Political Research, Reykjavik: 29 Bennett and Segerberg connect this new model to Olson's theory of rational choice and the foundation of Tarrow and Keck and Sikkink by explaining that old models were based on “overcoming individual resistance.” They argue that the new information environment, with new increases in the availability of information, the ability to personalize messages and individual incentives to share, has created a situation where groups can self-organize and self-interest is less of a hurdle to achieving collective goods. A key piece of Bennett and Segerberg's theory is what they call “personalized action frames” that can originate with an organization that chooses to step back and let the public adapt them, or they can happen spontaneously. As they explain, referring back to Olson and rational choice theory, new technology and the ability to easily engage with content can overcome individual resistance, the need for selective incentives and, thus, the costs of collective action. They suggest that there is now a fundamental interest in sharing one's ideas and content, not purely for altruistic reasons.Bennett, W. L., and Alexandra Segerberg. 2011. “The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics.” Presented at the 6th General Conference of the European Consortium for Political Research, Reykjavik: 30. Bimber, Flanagin and Stohl direct attention to how uses of modern information and communication technologies in collective action directly challenge two main tenets of traditional theory. These are the “free-rider” problem and the importance of formal, hierarchical organization. The authors point to a series of examples, like the 1999 “Battle in Seattle,” to show how substantial collective action occurred without rigid organizational structures. This collective action, “involved a loosely coupled network without central financing or a fixed structure for leadership, decision making, and recruitment. Instead, of these traditional features, the network employed low-cost communication and information system…” (Bimber, Flanagin & Stohl, 2005, p. 370.)Bimber, B., Flanagin, J. & Stohl, C., Reconceptualizing Collective Action in the Contemporary Media Environment,” Communication Theory, November 2005. Expanding on the work of Bimber and his colleagues in discussing the “Battle in Seattle” protests of the World Trade Organization in 1999 as an example of new forms of loose, often leaderless networks, Bennett presses this further in labeling it an example of a “hyper- organization” or a meta-organization that “existed mainly in the form of the website, e-mail traffic and linked sites”.Bennett, L.W. (2004). Social movements beyond borders: Organization, communication, and political capacity in two eras of transnational activism. In D. Della Porter & S.G. Tarrow Eds.), Transnational protest and global activism (pp. 203-226). New York, NY:Rowman & Littelfield:218 Instead of simply magnifying the effectiveness of the various transnational organizations involved in mobilizing protests, online and mobile technologies have now begun to transform the organizational forms of such groups into the looser, less hierarchical structures to which Bimber and his colleagues eluded. Similarly, along with reduced costs, Lance Bennett finds that digital environments, and the people that enjoy working in them, are naturally predisposed to favor large-scale networks of people with loose personal and ideological ties. He observes that this digital influence has created a new kind of advocacy “organization,” one that is more like an “association” of people who are drawn to “easy-to-personalize, but politically ambiguous themes.” These organizations can reach scale quickly, even spontaneously, as information about “crisis, dramatic events, and widely shared grievances travel” quickly through the digital space, and social media. Bennett identifies a trade off between this increased ease of mobilizing large numbers of people quickly and cheaply, and the fact that they are characterized by loose ties and less clear ideological interests – maybe even at the risk of “incoherence.” Although, Bennett and Segerberg discuss the possibility of self-organization facilitated by new technologies and kept intentionally separate from formal organizations, they argue that these networks lack the organization necessary to form coherent political agendas. Their proposal is, therefore, intended to be a “middle way” or “third pattern” of organization that falls somewhere between self-organizing and traditional networks so that organizations can provide a “networking backbone” after largely self-organized groups have formed.Bennett, W. L., and Alexandra Segerberg. 2011. “The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics.” Presented at the 6th General Conference of the European Consortium for Political Research, Reykjavik: 16. =Transaction costs= Transaction costs are barriers to collective action that might prevent like-minded individuals from forming a group, faction or social movement based on shared values, ideas or sentiments. Transaction costs include search and information costs, bargaining and decision-making costs, and policing and enforcement costs. The advantage of networked advocacy lies in its ability to lower the transaction costs of collective action by taking advantage of modern mass communication media and scale-free networks. In Federalist No. 10 James Madison argues that, in order to preserve the union, governing should be left \\"to a small number of citizens elected by the rest\\" and that by expanding the size of the republic \\"you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength.\\" Madison is essentially arguing that, in order to preserve the United States, the transaction costs of forming tyrannical majorities must be raised. Institutions and geographic distance are the costs Madison seeks to impose on factions, through the United States Congress and the sheer size of the United States. Robert Putnam argues that due to the decrease in group membership throughout society within the last few decades, individuals no longer have as many social ties to organizations and the other people belonging to those organizations. This creates increased transaction costs for collective action. Without the pre- existing connections associated with organizational membership, increased effort is required to find those with similar grievances, which raises transaction costs for collective action. Sidney Tarrow refers to transaction costs as political constraints because they discourage the development of contentious politics that permit ordinary people to join forces in order to confront elites, authorities, and opponents.Tarrow, Sidney. \\"Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics\\". Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2010, p. 20. In Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink's Boomerang Model, State A raises the costs of collective action on domestic NGOS to the point where the domestic NGOs must appeal to other NGOs, states, and intergovernmental organizations for assistance in a transnational advocacy network. E.E. Schattsneider's concept of privatization of conflict is another example of increasing transaction costs to limit the scope of a conflict and thus the likelihood of collective action.Schattschneider, E.E. \\"The Semisovereign People\\". Wadsworth Cendage Learning: Boston, 1975, p. 7. =Scope of conflict= The scope of conflict is an aspect of the scale of political organization and the extent of political competition. Pressure groups are small-scale organizations while political parties are large-scale organizations. Hence, the outcome of the political game depends on the scale on which it is played. As Schattschneider notes, \\"People are not likely to start a fight if they are certain that they are going to be severely punished for their efforts. In this situation repression may assume the guise of a false unanimity.\\" Schattschneider develops the idea of controlling the scope of conflict. The most important strategy of politics and advocacy is concerned with the scope of conflict.Schattschneider, E.E. \\"The Semisovereign People\\". Wadsworth Cendage Learning: Boston, 1975, p. 3. A conflict can either be privatized, containing its scope, or socialized, expanding its scope. The audience determines the contagiousness of the conflict. The relative power of the two disputants plays little part in the perceptual outcomes of the conflict. An actor or disputant who has successfully created collective action frames that win the hearts and minds of the audience is slated to be perceived as the winner despite any actual weakness. When privatizing conflict, a disputant who desires to control the audience may limit audience participation by a variety of means, including localizing the conflict or minimizing audience size. When socializing conflict, an audience's size may demonstrate potential for alliances and eventual expansion of audience dynamics. Such methods of audience management are meant to diminish or maximize benefits within the scope of conflict. Madison first referenced the scope of a conflict through his discussion of privatization of conflict by means of extending the public sphere. Schattschneider also raises the issue of the mobilization of bias. Advocacy organizations reflect their costs of organizing. In his argument, Schattschneider emphasizes that resources are not evenly distributed. To Schattschneider, the \\"flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent.\\"Schattschneider, E.E. \\"The Semisovereign People\\". Wadsworth Cendage Learning: Boston, 1975, pp. 34–35. Only the wealthy have the capability to have their interests heard. Therefore, the wealthy are more likely to find representation through advocacy, which Schattschneider refers to as the “upper class tendency.”Schattschneider, E.E. \\"The Semisovereign People: A Realist's View of Democracy in America\\". Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers, 1960, p. 30-32. Bruce Bimber argues that Schattschneider's view that only wealthy interests can be represented in the pressure group system is largely irrelevant today due to the low transaction costs of using electronically enabled networks.Bimber, Bruce \\"Information and American Democracy: Technology in the Evolution of Political Power\\". Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2003. We now live in a world of information abundance; the cost of information and the transaction costs associated with it are much lower due to the availability and manageability of information. Thus, the ability to socialize a conflict is greatly enhanced by the use of information technology. He acknowledges that the internet has allowed for information to become abundant, inexpensive, and widely available to the public. As a result of easy access to information, traditional boundaries faced by organizations are changing and becoming less significant. Adaptation is necessary for many more established organizations. Organizations such as political parties and older non-profits must change the way they market themselves and communicate with the public in order to keep their message and outreach as strong as it was prior to the birth of the internet. Because of the birth of this new information technology, people are also becoming more adept at founding organizations and reaching out to a broader population. The internet is allowing people to come together under their specific interests. Additionally, organizations are no longer restricted from forming due to the limitations of “brick and mortar”. Movements and groups can have a presence without having a physical home base. =The importance of social ties= Another aspect of Networked advocacy, and one that has been hotly debated by theorists and thinkers, is the question of how important strong social ties are to the success of advocacy. Traditional social movement theorists, like Sidney Tarrow, Doug McAdams, and others, believe that strong social ties between members are essential to maintaining a movement. Even Keck and Sikkink,Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. \\"Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals.\\" Cornell University Press, 1998, p. 16. writing about more attenuated communities of activists, underscore the importance of social ties forged at conferences and meetings. They believe these kinds of strong connections facilitate the maintenance of transnational networks. The rise of networked advocacy and Internet-enabled social organization created a schism in the field of advocacy studies. Researchers including Robert Putnam, Sidney Tarrow and W. Lance Bennett argue that the Internet is an essentially impersonal organizational experience. Princeton researcher Alejandro Portes argues that true social networks depend on face-to-face contacts and the social cohesion of shared physical geography.http://digicult.net/moss_texts/SOCIALCAPITAL_ItsOriginsandApplicationsinModernSociology.pdf Recent research on the role of networked advocacy using Facebook led to the term \\"slacktivism\\" to define the low-impact advocacy involved in simply \\"liking\\" a cause as opposed to taking an active role in a defined group. Evgeny Morozov discussed the applications of slacktivism in foreign policy in a May 19, 2009, blog post for Foreign Policy magazine. Putnam's frustration with the changing role of social ties in civic engagement and social capital formation pre-dates the rise of the internet, but strongly mirrors Evgeny Morozov's criticism about low-effort acts of social engagement. As noted by Putnam in \\"Bowling Alone\\", mass membership organizations like The Sierra Club and American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) are significantly different from civic associations and other venues for collective action of the past. These mass membership organizations, Putnam argues, allow members to be very loosely connected, perhaps only by shared values or ideals. Members may never knowingly encounter another member of the organization and their ties are to the organization's principles and not to one another as in traditional civic groups. Membership in such mass membership organizations may solely consist of writing a check or reading a newsletter and not sustained or more in-depth actions, which may facilitate more active engagement leading to a higher propensity for social change. Manuel Castells believes that organizations occupy a hybrid-space, often moving fluidly on and off of online spaces. Therefore, they gain all the advantages of digital networks, without sacrificing strong ties. He lauds this ability to transition, which gives participants both, \\"possible face-to-face interaction, sharing the experience, the danger and the difficulties, as well as facing together the police and enduring together rain, cold and the loss of comfort in their daily lives. While, social networks on the Internet allowed the experience to be communicated and amplified, bringing the entire world into the movement, and creating a permanent forum of solidarity, debate and strategic planning.\\" Castells provides a bridge of sorts between traditional observers of collective action and the most radically pro-digital literature. While he rejoices in the possibilities for digitally enabled communication and the creation of a new space where the elite and non-elite begin on a more even playing field, he clearly has a deep appreciation for the strong ties that come with sharing physical experiences – especially the risk and fear associated with public actions. On January 19, 2011, Clay Shirky broached the subject of whether online activism is the result of a community that truly exists as an online community, or whether online activism merely enables connected activists to expand the sphere of conflicts that are essentially local. Morozov explained Shirkey's main critique of electronically enabled activism networks: > On Clay's account, \\"social media\\" is just a tool that people use to > coordinate. So, saying that people want a revolution because of \\"social > media\\" is akin to saying that people want a revolution because of the > telephone. =Social movements= Networked advocacy theory builds in part on the social movement theory of Sidney Tarrow. In his 1998 book Power in Movement, Tarrow tries to explain the cyclical history of social movements (visible in the form of the protest cycles). Like Schattschneider and Madison, Tarrow believes politics is contentious and riddled with conflict. He also shows how movements can affect various spheres of life, such as personal lives, policy reforms and political cultures. According to Tarrow there are four prerequisites for sustainable social movements: #Political opportunities; #diffuse social networks; #familiar forms of collective action (also known in Charles Tilly's terms as repertoires of contention); and 4) cultural frames that can resonate throughout a population. A cornerstone of Tarrow's contentious politics is the “Repertoires of Contention,” a concept originally developed by Tilly as “the ways people act together in pursuit of shared interest,” (Tarrow, 2011, p. 39.) A key aspect of the “repertoires of contention,” is that the repertoires include, “not only what people do when they are engaged in conflict with others but what they know how to do and what others expect them to do,” (Tarrow, 2011.) An example of a repertoire, as discussed in Power in Movement, is the barricade used during the later periods of the French Revolution in the 1840s. The barricade illustrates the “do” and “what they know how to do,” dynamic. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted of the barricades they were, “skillfully constructed by a small number of men who worked industrially – not like criminals…Nowhere did I see the seething unrest I had witnessed in 1830…” (Tarrow, 2011, p. 38.)Tarrow, Sidney. Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics. Cambridge Press. 2011. Despite Tarrow's work having been published before the widespread use of Internet-based social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook, Tarrow's theoretical framework provides a means of analyzing whether and how social media outlets and digital communications technologies develop sustained, diffuse networks of social advocates. The role of the Internet and digital social media in lowering opportunity costs related to social action has since been studied in-depth by communications scholars such as Steven Livingston and Matthew Hindman, as well as by TIME Magazine foreign policy writer Lev Grossman.http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2010/cs4001B_summer/documents/Time- Iran-Twitter.pdf  Relationship between social movements and networked advocacy  The delineation between social movements and advocacy networks is a particularly thorny issue for understanding and defining networked advocacy. In a real world context, the difference can be easily identified. Think, for example, of the 2011 insurgent movement in Egypt as opposed to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. The former was a grassroots, somewhat spontaneous movement with no designated leader. The latter comprises a network of organizations in different countries, as well as a central organization, which employ elite staffs of professionals, and which work with governments and intergovernmental bodies to ban land mines. This high/low dichotomy is one clear example of the difference between the two types of action and advocacy, but often the distinction is blurred. Social movements can work with and rely on the support of advocacy networks, though the reverse is less common. The notion of networked advocacy can encompass both types of action and contributes to the success, structure and development of each. The question remains, however, whether networked advocacy could or should bridge the gap between the two. According to Tarrow, transnational advocacy networks are powerful in promoting change for three reasons: \\"First, many of them are biographically and thematically in the debt of social movements. Second, given the undemocratic or semiauthoritarian conditions of many parts of the world today, they provide a safer alternative to social movements for millions of people. Third, their most important role may be to provide a mechanism for the diffusion of collective action frames to resource-poor domestic actors that can help them construct their own social movements.\\" Despite their effectiveness in these capacities, Tarrow considers advocacy networks \\"second- best\\" to social movements and notes that they lack \\"the drama, the deliberate contentiousness, and the broad goals\\" of international movements because of their dependence on funding and support from foundations and government. =Information exchange= Bennett and Manheim describe a modern one-step flow of communication, in contrast to the traditional model of a two-step flow: “[T]he availability and content of each message having been shaped upon transmission to anticipate and replace the social interaction component of the two step flow.”Bennett, W. Lance and Jarol B. Manheim. \\"The One-Step Flow of Communication.\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science November 2006 608: 213-232. Bennett and Manheim argue for the existence of a different type of information recipient who is no longer dependent on opinion leaders to contextualize a message. Rather, technological changes have isolated citizens from each other and have redefined our individual communication habits. Where citizens once contextualized social cues from each other, social cues can now be embedded in the media and technology content itself. Bennett and Manheim stress that technology and audience relationships “point to an increasing individuation and reception of information.” Given an environment where social connectivity has become increasingly fragmented, as Putnam has argued, the emergence of new technologies with more targeted approaches creates a new type of interaction between and among people. As noted by Keck and Sikkink, the role of information exchange is central to networked advocacy. Actors within a network mobilize information strategically to persuade, pressure, and gain leverage over much more powerful organizations, including governments.Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. \\"Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals.\\" Cornell University Press, 1998, p. 2. Keck and Sikkink describe four tactics that actors within networks can use to persuade and pressure. First is information politics, where networks gather credible and politically acceptable information quickly. Second is symbolic politics, where networks use symbols, actions or stories to appeal to audiences in different locations. Third is leverage politics, where networks appeal to powerful actors that can influence the situation when weaker actors in the network may not be capable. Fourth is accountability politics, where networks use the policies and statements of powerful actors to hold them to their words. The central theme of all four tactics is information and the ability of networks to use it effectively. Other scholars studying advocacy have made similar arguments. While some disagree over the most accurate model of successful transnational advocacy, almost all of the relevant literature places a premium on analyzing the communications strategies chosen by advocacy campaigns and determining how and why those strategies were or were not effective.Bob, Clifford. \\"The marketing of rebellion: insurgents, media, and international activism.\\" Cambridge University Press, 2005Manheim, Jarol. Strategy in Information and Influence Campaigns: How Policy Advocates, Social Movements, Insurgent Groups, Corporations, Governments and Others Get What They Want. Taylor & Francis, 2010. =Communications theory in networked advocacy= Research demonstrates that individuals receive and process information today differently from before new media entered the information market. Societal habits have changed as the reception and processing of information have been affected. Though individuals are less likely to participate in groups, “they have gained greater command of their own information environments, often participating in multiple, fluid social networks oriented to self-expression, generally organized around lifestyles.” Bennett, W. Lance and Jarol B. Manheim. \\"The One-Step Flow of Communication.\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science November 2006 608: 213-232. Lance Bennett and the one-step flow of communication shows that communicators substitute their own audience selection with what was “formerly assigned to peer group interaction.” This notion delineates the transitional period of two communication eras, where people are paradoxically more isolated and vastly more interconnected at the same time. “(…) It appears that the chosen emphasis is more toward the stealthy technologies that isolate individuals than toward transparent networking technologies that may unite citizens in common cause.” The “water cooler effect” of the two-step flow was a means of assigning messages meaning, leading to the development of opinion dynamics. The one-step flow shatters this dynamic by eliminating the traditional groups that provided cues, bringing in social isolation, communication channel fragmentation, and targeted messages via new technology. The one-step flow portrays a very individualistic participant; someone who no longer participates in groups, but rather finds fluid networks where they can control their information reception, voice their opinions, and dictate what parts of their lifestyle they would like share. Taking into account the new media environment, Bruce Bimber shows that the lowered costs of information and increased supply does not make citizens “better informed in a rational or objective sense. (…) Citizens acquire and learn information in ways that are biased toward reinforcing previously held beliefs and mental constructs.” Bruce Bimber Bimber takes into account the one-step flow information environment, but shows what conditions are needed to increase or foster participation and engagement. Group identification has declined, according to the first model, and attention to message content is harder to buy in this environment. Bimber suggests that while this may be true, the ability to find groups that were previously impossible catalyze motivation to participate in them as people are becoming increasingly able to shape the groups they belong to. The gap between intention and action is widened due to the low cost of aggregating information. This also allows for “the formalization of sharing among people tracking a particular subject.” Clay Shirky takes the idea of facilitated collective action one step further than most, and analyses its effect on the individual and the group, and therefore on a culture itself. He shows through various examples, such as Flickr and other interactive bases, that the new proficiency to disseminate information “changes group awareness,” but is increased in its potency by a change in collective action.Shirky, Clay. Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations. New York: Penguin Group, 2008. “Revolution doesn’t happen when society adopts new technologies- it happens when society adopts new behaviors.” This means that cooperating is harder than sharing because it involves changing the way one behaves in order to synchronize. =Framing in advocacy and contentious politics= One of the most important devices used by activists in social movements, transnational advocacy networks, and other realms of contentious politics is the framing of issues and causes in ways that appeal to potential collaborators and targets. According to Tarrow, collective action frames simplify and condense the external environment by selectively emphasizing and highlighting the gravity of social conditions or reinterpreting conditions and behaviors that were previously seen as tolerable as harmful or unjustTarrow, S. (1998, p. 110). Power in movement: social movements and contentious politics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Framing in advocacy is most successful when it follows a set of rules: “identify an injustice, attribute the responsibility for it to others, and propose solutions to it\\".Tarrow, S. (1998, p. 111). Power in movement: social movements and contentious politics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. This task is particularly challenging in transnational advocacy because it requires appealing to the values, beliefs and ideologies of multiple countries and cultures at once, leading many activist groups to use general, overarching frames that encapsulate universal values. A number of common types of frames have been employed successfully in activism, particularly injustice and emotionality frames, as Tarrow describes in detail, and frames that deal with human rights, as discussed by Keck and Sikkink; the latter suggest that the most common issue characteristics in which to frame collective action are issues involving bodily harm to vulnerable individuals and issues involving denial of legal equality of opportunity.Keck, M.E., & Sikkink, K. (1998). Activists beyond borders: advocacy networks in international politics. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. In their work on transnational advocacy networks, Keck and Sikkink identify successful use of both of these issue characteristic frames, including the re-framing of female circumcision in Kenya, which had previously been regarded as a cultural ritual and rite of passage, to focus on the more violent and visceral term “female genital mutilation”.Keck, M.E., & Sikkink, K. (1998). Activists beyond borders: advocacy networks in international politics. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. As Tarrow and Keck and Sikkink describe the importance of framing to attract diverse sets of people to support collective action for a certain issue, Bennett describes “metaframes”Bennett, L.W. (2004). Social movements beyond borders: Organization, communication, and political capacity in two eras of transnational activism. In D. Della Porter & S.G. Tarrow Eds.), Transnational protest and global activism (pp. 203-226). New York, NY:Rowman & Littelfield: 205 \\\\- more broad, relaxed framing devices in which diverse groups of advocates can package their particular issue of choice allowing them to support movements larger than just that specific issue, whether it be “diversity, inclusiveness” or “social justice”Bennett, L.W. (2004). Social movements beyond borders: Organization, communication, and political capacity in two eras of transnational activism. In D. Della Porter & S.G. Tarrow (Eds.), Transnational protest and global activism (pp. 203-226). New York, NY:Rowman & Littelfield: 205 Though this sort of loose framing may result in the type of “purposeful misunderstandings” witnessed among members of an anti- Iraq war protest in Washington, D.C., Bennett believes that metaframing addresses the problem many previous social movements have had when “common framing (frame bridging) has been a common source of tensions and fragmentation”.Bennett, L.W. (2004). Social movements beyond borders: Organization, communication, and political capacity in two eras of transnational activism. In D. Della Porter & S.G. Tarrow (Eds.), Transnational protest and global activism (pp. 203-226). New York, NY:Rowman & Littelfield: 204 By creating larger, less ideological sets of frames, various groups with diverse interests are better able to package their issues within those sets. In later work, Bennett and Segerberg transform this idea of metaframes into what they simultaneously call “memes” and “personalized action frames”. No matter which phrase is used, these are symbolic packets of information that are shared among individuals and groups with different interests because it is “easy to imitate, adapt personally, and share broadly”.Bennett, L.W. and Segerberg, A. (2011) “The Logic of Connective Action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics,” Information, Communication & Society 15(5):4 These “memes” or “political action frames” therefore become adaptable “network building and bridging units of social information.” Bennett, L.W. and Segerberg, A. (2011) “The Logic of Connective Action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics,” Information, Communication & Society 15(5):4 According to Castells, framing, which uses communication to shape people's minds and how they construct meaning, is a crucial tool for activists and groups who want to build power. He presents a detailed argument for framing's particular importance in today's rapidly advancing technological environment: \\"Because communication, and particularly socialized communication, the one that exists in the public realm, provides the support for the social production of meaning, the battle of the human mind is largely played out in the processes of communication. And this is more so in the network society, characterized by the pervasiveness of communication networks in a multimodal hypertext. Indeed, the ongoing transformation of communication technology in the digital age extends the reach of communication media to all domains of social life in a network that is at the same time global and local, generic and customized in an ever-changing pattern. As a result, power relations…as well as the processes challenging institutionalized power relations are increasingly shaped and decided in the communication field.\\"Castells, M. (2007). Communication, power and counter-power in the network society. International Journal of Communication, 1, 239. As communicators and activists continue to gain access to advanced, powerful technological tools, then, they will benefit from the skilled use of these tools to spread their messages and be able to facilitate more expansive, successful movements. =Development theory in networked advocacy= Much of what has been discussed about new technologies and its influence on collective action in a global public sphere refers mainly to developed countries and social classes that have these technologies readily available to them; media systems and social technologies in the developing world have yet to experience much of this phenomenon. Collin Sparks has organized a chronology of development communication theory that explains the limits and changes in a more global sense, rather than a simple developed-global sense.Sparks, Colin. Globalization, Development and the Mass Media. Sage Publications: London, 2007. Sparks takes a survey of development communication theory from three failed paradigms to modernity. Changing social structures in his analysis meant not only the stratification of distribution between rural and urban, but also of the distribution of mass media and development information in rural areas. Economic development was therefore paramount in the acceptance of the development message, rather than the other way around. (45) Following the failure of this paradigm came a continuity variant. This new approach to the dominant paradigm meant minimal adjustments to the goals and methods, but a need for the modern expert to understand the world of non-modern object of the communication strategy. The participatory paradigm, arising later, was a radical shift. There “was no self-evident category of modernity, whether embodied in a western society or elsewhere, and therefore no single goal towards which every nation should aspire: ‘development is not a series of known steps through which each country passes towards pre-defined goals.’” It stressed industrialization and urbanization as stepping-stones, and that societies were likely to have different trajectories and their own normative goals and standards. This meant most importantly that there was no universal development model, needs were based on those of the local community, and vertical communication replaced horizontal communication. Manuel Castells argues that the public sphere is the most important part of sociopolitical organization because it is where people can articulate their views; when this is done in an organized fashion, a civil society is created as well as a democracy.Castells, Manuel. \\"The New Public Sphere: Global Civil Society, Communication Networks, and Global Governance.\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616(2008): 78-93. “The diversity of values in contemporary societies, and their proponents’ passion for them, mean that staid debate signals either an issue's triviality- or the subtly workings of hegemonic power.” In this, there “exist problems with deliberative democracy theory both empirically and normatively.” The political spectacle,Edelman, Murray. Constructing the Political Spectacle. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1988. soaked in vagaries and trivialities, has moved from a national scale to a global scale, leaving its residue as far as it can reach. In this fight for relevance, group dominance, and political power, “(…) there is a public sphere in the international arena. It exists within the political/institutional space that is not subject to any particular sovereign power, but, instead, is shaped by the variable geometry of relationships between states and global non-state actors.” This is to say that state power, once the only power, faces unprecedented challenges not only from global actors, but from global problems created by a global political spectacle in which any one group can help create. This global civil society is not necessarily civil. The groups that have the power to stir public debate, even though their access to the global public sphere makes them almost elite, are not traditional elites. This is to say that those with access become empowered groups, charged with tools for relevance and distribution of messages to a global audience even if the issue was once national. The political spectacle once controlled by state elites has been opened to those who can compete and adapt to a new media controlled by a new global elite. Complex global networks carry and re-frame ideas, insert them in policy debates, pressure for regime formation, and enforce existing international norms and rules, at the same time that they try to influence particular domestic political issues. As Shirky, Sandler, and countless other political scientists conclude, Keck concludes that although transnational organization, or organization in general, is difficult, trans-cultural resonance and high value in transnational problems gives rise to global collective action within advocacy networks. Traditionally, the media was what organized the civil society's wishes in the public sphere, expressing its desires to influence the state. This means that digital communication networks form our public sphere. “However, if the concept of the public sphere has heuristic value, it is because it is inseparable from two other key dimensions of the institutional construction of modern societies: civil society and the state. The public sphere is not just the media or the sociospatial sites of public interaction. It is the cultural/informational repository of the ideas and projects that feed public debate.” If there is a problem in the components of communication, a “crisis of legitimacy” occurs because the society's wishes are not being directed to authority, and “citizens to not recognize themselves in the institutions of society.” This compromises the power structure. The state's inability to construct a political spectacle that fuels debate in the direction a state wishes causes this crisis of legitimacy. If a state's sovereignty or inherent perception of power is undermined, the public sphere turns somewhere else. When considering the arrival of a transnational public sphere, the need for a sovereign power ceases, and is shaped instead “by the variable geometry of relationships between states and global non-state actors.” =Power law distributions and the long tail of political organizing= An example power law graph, being used to demonstrate ranking of popularity. To the right is the head, or the popular hits; to the left is the long tail, where niches are noticed, but only by a few (also known as the 80-20 rule). Modern technology, especially cellular telephony and the Internet, have made it much easier for people to find one another. Search engines, like Google.com, allow people to find any niche interest or group online within seconds. This is a very important development for networked advocacy because it means that those groups and interests that have traditionally been unable to overcome the transaction costs associated with traditional organizations are now able to organize cheaply and selectively online. The implication for politics is evident: people with shared interests or grievances can overcome distance and cost to share their ideas. Organizing in order to advocate a political belief happens quite fluidly online. Online networks support a long tail of political sentiments: a distribution where the minority can connect and organize advocacy. A power law distribution is a special type of mathematical distribution which can model the distribution of many real world phenomena. The Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto observed in 1906 that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population and thus land ownership in Italy followed a power law distribution. The same is true today, with 20% of the population holding 80% of the wealth. Chris Anderson, in his book The Long Tail, applies Pareto's observation to different aspects of the modern entertainment distribution economy.Anderson, Chris. The Long Tail. Hyperion: New York, 2006. The low cost of doing business online has allowed the business models of Amazon.com and Netflix to profit from the long tail of the entertainment power law distribution. It can be profitable by aggregating the small niche markets in the tail, which can add up to be as equally profitable as the hits in the head of the curve. The Internet's low cost of entry has reduced the barriers to organizing and increased the viability of operating in the long tail of a power law distribution. The ability for niche interests to gain a small but passionate following because of the low costs of online organizing mean that the costs for organizing any sort of collective action have fallen as well. Lance Bennett and Jarol Manheim have argued that because the modern media environment is so fragmented, the two-step flow of communication model presented by Paul Lazarsfeld et al. in 1944 has become a one-step flow. Corporate and political organizations can now target messages specifically to hundreds of niche groups. On the one hand, this means that people may be more susceptible to manipulation because of the vast amounts of data available on people's niche interests. However, this also means that a committed group of people can more easily organize and communicate with each other about a specific cause or issue without the mediating influence of mainstream media and the costs associate with organizing offline. Matthew Hindman offers a critique of the long tail hypothesis, noting that very few blogs and news sources account for the vast majority of online readers. Bloggers also tend to be more educated, white and male than the population in general and the population of traditional media journalists and opinion writers.Hindman, Matthew. \\"What is the Online Public Sphere Good For?\\" in Joseph Turow's The Hyperlinked Society. University of Michigan Press: Ann Arbor 2008. The discoverability of niche interests has increased because of the Internet, but political discourse is still driven by the head of the power law distribution. Hindman's critique places emphasis on the total number of readers of online political content but does not take into account how passionately those readers are engaging with the content. This stands in sharp contrast to the more optimistic work of Anderson, who interprets the purpose of electronic power law distributions as providing \\"unlimited shelf space\\" to products of ideas. Hindman only considers the head of a power law distribution, while Anderson considers the potential for all segments of the tail to equally serve the interests of a variety of consumer - under Anderson's logic, the most powerful item in a power law distribution may not be of use to a potential customer, driving that customer further down the tail distribution to websites more likely to cater to the browser's specific interest. Hindman's corollary to Anderson, focusing solely on political discourse in an electronic space, fails to account for the individuality of consumer taste among a diverse and free-choosing population, a phenomenon originally observed in its electronic state by Clay Shirky. Like Hindman, Clay Shirky also focuses his attention on the head of the curve, looking at the blogosphere. Shirky finds a power law distribution within the blogosphere, with a preference premium to those sites within the head of the distribution curve. This system of premium linkage, where blogs of high viewership link to other blogs, capturing a larger audience and creating an inequality among the blogosphere. Within a system of abundance, there is diversity and freedom of choice, thus creating inequality. Newcomers to the blogosphere enter an environment shaped by earlier viewers. “Though there are more new bloggers and more new readers every day, most of the new readers are adding to the traffic of the top few blogs, while most new blogs are getting below average traffic, a gap that will grow as the weblog world does.” Although the system is still young, Shirky believes that's as of now the inequality within the blogosphere is fair. In the future, the nature of the blogosphere in the head and tail will change. Those in the head, with high viewership and linkage, will be considered mainstream media because the author is simply broadcasting their ideas, not participating actively in conversations. Within the long tail, these active conversations will thrive, yet audience size will remain below average. =Electronic networks and advocacy= Bruce Bimber argues that there has been a transformation in collective action and electronic networks in the last two decades. There are new approaches to the way people are being organized and there has been an increase in organizational fecundity. This includes traditional organizations, as well as an uprising in organization- less advocacy. Today's media environment, according to Bimber, is one of \\"information abundance, \\" in which information is easily produced by nearly anyone, widely distributed and either cheap or free. The cost of information and the transaction costs associated are much lower due to the availability and manageability of information. By having an easily accessible avenue to self-actualize as well as identify personal interests people can seize the opportunity to participate in a larger movement. As Bimber correctly identified, political scientists generally fail to understand motivation behind action, rather are best able to identify opportunities to pique interests. The combination of social media and one- step communication significantly advances this methodology. In Bimber's quadrant, the new wave of self-actualization takes the user to the far left of the ‘X axis’ and maximizes on Personal Interaction. But what is intriguing is that there is not an effective barometer—within Bimber's framework—to properly identify the user as achieving both Entrepreneurial and Institutional Engagement, as modeled on the ‘Y axis’. However, in the new era, they are not mutually exclusive. One can both be interacting to seek out a personal interest or gain, while simultaneously being part of a collective. The rapid changes that have swept across the Middle East provide an ideal case study as to how Personal Interaction, Institutional Engagement and Entrepreneurial Engagement can now be interwoven within each other. In understanding the way that electronic networks and advocacy interact, Steven Livingston has proposed a framework by which to visualize where states lie in their ability and resources. In Livingston's theoretical model, states fall within four distinct quadrants of consolidated statehood and information/collaboration costs. Further defining these quadrants, Livingston explains that Quadrant 1 (Consolidated statehood/High info. costs) “relies on extant collaborative organizations.” He continues, explaining that it is “a historical condition and a politically advantageous condition” – some regimes seek more collaboration only for sanctioned activities and only on a level that the government approves of. However, the ability of technology to facilitate collaboration across broad populations is easily applied to fight against these institutions and their restrictions. The four quadrants postulated by Livingston are defined as follows, with the works/theories of authors that correspond to each one: * Quadrant 1 (High Information/Collaboration Costs, Consolidated Statehood): Tarrow, Tilly, McCarthy & Zald, Keck & Sikkink, others in classic collective action theory. * Quadrant 2 (Low Information/Collaboration Costs, Consolidated Statehood): Castells, Bimber, Bennett & Segerberg, Earl & Kimport, Shirky, others in new collective action theory. * Quadrant 3 (Low Information/Collaboration Costs, Limited Statehood): Livingston & Walterdrop, others researching new areas in which ICT is used to acquire public goods and advance collective action when the state cannot or will not. * Quadrant 4 (High Information/Collaboration Costs, Limited Statehood): Theories/strategies similar to those traditionally applied by the World Bank in their development efforts. Quadrants define countries along axes of limited or consolidated statehood and high or low information/collaboration costs. The x-axis defines a range of limited to consolidated statehood and the y-axis establishes a range of low to high information/collaboration costs. Livingston and Kinkforth argue that information and communication technology (ICT) has already affected transnational advocacy in two significant ways:Steven Livingston & Kristina Kinkforth, Narrative Shifts: Exploring the Role of Geospatial Information Technologies in Global Governance, paper presented at APSA 2010 Annual Meeting. #Advocacy amplification: New technologies have made it easier for existing transnational advocacy networks to gather, monitor and frame information about issues, as well as to marshal the expertise of other groups in their network. The microelectronics revolution has created new opportunities for global networked advocacy by expanding both the number of globally networked nongovernmental organizations and social movements, as well as by allowing individuals to link together in social networks such as Twitter and Facebook.Steven Livingston & Gregory Asmolov, \\"Networks and the Future of Foreign Affairs Reporting,\\" Journalism Studies, Volume 11, Issue 5 October 2010, pp. 745–760 #Creating entirely new forms of advocacy: New technologies have enabled new types of advocacy and organization. This is especially true in regions of the world that have limited state governance. Jennifer Earl and Katrina Kimport, whose digital advocacy research suggests that organizations can be completely unnecessary for collective action in some cases of online activism, propose similar ideas. They suggest that modern social movements exist on a continuum of online activism. The “poles” of this continuum are “e-mobilizations,” which “use online tools to bring people into the streets for face-to-face protests,” and “e-movements,” which emerge and thrive entirely online, and between the two poles exist “e-tactics,” in which activists may use both online and off-line components to facilitate movements. They cite the strategic voting e-movement of 2000, in which a small group of websites run by individuals and small groups paired voters from different states in ways that both influenced the presidential election and allowed voters to adhere to their political beliefs, as an example of organizing without organizations. Additionally, they reject Bimber, Flanigan, and Stohl's use of the term “organizational fecundity” to the wide variety of organizing forms used to facilitate collective action in favor of more open “organizing fecundity,” which suggests that “the process itself is being opened up, not just the variety of units that participate in it.” For all the discussion of E-tactics by Earl & Kimport it seems easy to suggest that what it is really being described here is a situation of “what’s old is new again,” but this time active in a digital space. The authors point to historical uses of petitions, boycotts and letter-writing campaigns that were used to spark social movement campaigns to advocate for farm workers, civil rights, all to varying degrees of success. The description of how these forms of protest translate into “E-tactics” in an online environment, like with “warehouse” and “non-warehouse” petition sites do not seem to be a radically new design of how to engage in protest or collective action.Earl, J. & Kimport, K. Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age. MIT Press. 2011. An important question that has been addressed in recent advocacy research is whether today's activists are using a new repertoire of contention or merely incorporating technological tools and advancements into the set of strategies and perspectives they have used in the past. Earl and Kimport, in concepts similar to those in Livingston and Kinkforth's work, give names to the two schools of thought on the question: the supersize model, which “does not find that ICT usage in any way changes the processes of activism, although it changes the scale on which activism takes place [and] augments—or supersizes—the processes of activism we already understand,” and theory 2.0, which “suggests that scholars may need to change their theoretical models of how organizing and participation take place to fully understand and describe Web activism [and that] the engine driving protest would lRisse, R., & Lehmkuhl, U. “Governance in Areas of Limited Statehood - New Modes of Governance?” Research Program of the Research Center (SFB) 700, 2006. ook and operate differently than it has before.” A 2006 Risse and Lehmkuhl paper suggests that by supplanting would-be government structures in failed states with different modes of governance that approach tends to leave more questions than answers. They suggest that organizations should not necessarily concern themselves with replicating state-centered solutions for areas of limited statehood that focus on “conventional instruments of a state monopoly,” (Risse & Lehmkhul, p. 11, 2006.) New modes of governance in areas of limited statehood, then, represent an arena of some uncharted waters where new approaches and ideas must be put forth. A new starting point, outside the typical functions and understanding, of how governance and collective action is used to provide for critical needs like public safety, clean water and health care, for example. One such new approach involves ICTs and builds on the literature discussed early that considered how ICTs could be used to achieve advocacy and collective action goals in the context of a consolidated state. In their paper, “Information and Communication Technologies in Areas of Limited Statehood (2012), Livingston and Walter-Drop consider how ICTs can be used as a modes of governance to provide goods, protection or the enforcement of political decisions when states are incapable or hindered in ability to do so. The authors write that, “failing statehood does not necessarily translate to the absence of governance,” suggesting that surely something like ICTs could be used to fill the void of service delivery, (Livingston & Walter-Drop, p. 7, 2012.)Livingston, S. & Walter-Drop, G. “Information and Communication Technology in Areas of Limited Statehood,” Research Program of the Research Center (SFB) 700, 2012 The authors make their case by pointing to prior cases where ICTs have been used in the developed world, with a chief focus on mobile telephony, given the reach and availability of the technology. They also highlight a variety of “innovation centers” and ICT projects in Africa, like Ushahidi, for example, to illustrate a sort-of ground floor of where innovation is happening now, (Livingston & Walter-Drop, 2012.) A more concrete example is the Satellite Sentinel Project that uses remote sensing satellites to provide a public service. In this case, the service is monitoring human rights violation in the Sudan, a place of limited statehood. The group using the technology is a non-state actor, using the satellite images to have visual access to places in the Sudan that are considered inaccessible because of a lack of road infrastructure. Livingston and Walter-Drop refer to this visibility provided by satellites as a new form of governance (Livingston & Walter-Drop, p. 9, 2012.) The significance of electronic networks The advent of digital communication tools and media has introduced the possibility that the nature of the social ties discussed above has been radically altered. Whereas these ties were traditionally developed through face to face interaction, some argue that equally relevant relationships can be developed over electronic networks, including email, Skype, or Twitter. Clay Shirky represents thinkers who believe that such connections can be- and are being- created using new technologies, as exemplified by his book Here Comes Everybody. Others, such as Malcolm Gladwell and Evgeny Morozov, take issue with the notion that the ties formed electronically are \\"strong\\" enough to matter in terms of advocacy. This issue remains a contested one. =The relationship between offline and online action in advocacy= Tarrow displays skepticism at the notion that digital ties and communication can overcome interpersonal trust and ties. He argues “loose mobilizing structures have defects in their virtues (149).” If the Internet can only produce weak, diffuse ties, Tarrow concludes that social movements still require organizations that work out of an identifiable, physical space. Keck and Sikkink echo this misgiving about the diffuse ties digital technology cultivates, maintaining “networks are more effective when they are strong and dense (206).” However, the rapid expansion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) prompts a reevaluation of the traditional understandings of collective action models provided by Olson, Tarrow, and Keck and Sikkink. W. Lance Bennett also highlights the agility provided by technology in his exploration of digital social movements. Bennett interprets ideas of transnational advocacy developed by Keck & Sikkink and places them in the context of a world with low information costs, and high state consolidation. “Large-scale transnational activism, framed loosely around social justice issues, has displayed remarkable organizational capacities in recent years to wage sustained protests against corporations and transnational organizations at the core of global economic trade and development.” Bennett observes that in the digital age, transnational protests have begun to exhibit a movement toward (1) inclusive organization models, (2) social technologies that allow for decentralized, networked activism, and (3) the leveraging of political capabilities of network members to form effective relationships with targets. Inclusive organization models allow organizations greater fluid movement between issues and targets without being restrained by limited ideologies that restrict collaboration. The ability to easily slide between issues leads to a proliferation of multi-issue campaigns and allegiances with different kinds of campaign organizations and groups. The utilization of social technologies combines online and offline relationships to establish trust, credibility and loyalty among participants at the individual level. Much in line with Tarrow and Keck and Sikkink, Bennett recognizes the importance of personal relationships for social movements. However, instead of dismissing digital ties as weak, Bennett stresses the need for integrated on- and offline relationships. “Technology is often aimed at getting people together offline, and one purpose of offline associations is to clarify and motivate online relations (217).” This distinction highlights an important aspect of digital advocacy—the technologies themselves are not organizing movements. They simply facilitate and augment the interpersonal relations that make up the core of social action networks. Different kinds of advocacy networks interact with technology differently. Bennett describes “hyper-organizations” as a form of advocacy existing solely in the digital domain. These organizations act without the kind of physical space that Olson (1965) and Tarrow associated with models of advocacy organizations. What Bennett may fail to fully appreciate is that the flexible identities and consumerist ideas about advocacy and politics may only hold true for the Global North. Outside of developed regions, the stakes may be higher and the “luxury of relative indifference” may not exist. Expanding upon the idea of the hyper- organization, Bennett and Segerberg explore how loosely tied organizations born out of digital technologies pair with traditional hierarchical organizations. Collaborations between digitally enabled movements and traditional advocacy networks effectively enhance the ability for both organizations to pursue collective action. “Classic social movement activities based on collective identifications and strongly tied networks continue to play a role in this political landscape, but they have become joined, interspersed, and in some cases supplanted by personalized collective action formations in which digital media become integral organizational parts (46).” The creation of hybrid coalitions provide legitimacy and grounding for fluid digital advocacy organizations and agility for more traditional organizations. Prior to the emergence of digital technology, advocacy groups organized through interpersonal networks, and tools like flyers, posters, billboards. Each of these mechanisms for information sharing tend to require the resources of the kinds of hierarchal organizations Tarrow recognized as critical to collective action. With technology, movements expand more quickly and at a lower cost. Earl and Kimport argue, “truly meaningful collaboration—the power of collective action—can be created and facilitated without copresence for protest (126).” Technology allows what Earl and Kimport refer to as supersizing, or the use of online tactics to create or organize physical offline action. Manuel Castells provides an example of supersizing in his discussion of the Tunisian revolution, “The connection between free communication on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter and the occupation of urban space created a hybrid public space of freedom that became a major feature of the Tunisian rebellion (23).” Castells highlights how digital technology creates both a tool and a space for stressed, repressed, and angry communities to connect with one another. Once individuals in an online community recognize and discover their common emotions, Castells points to the occupation of urban spaces as the next step for action. According to Castells, the Internet creates the possibility a ‘space of autonomy’—a hybrid of cyberspace and urban space in which information can be exchanges to share feelings of collective hope or outrage. While Castells calls these spaces of autonomy, “the new spatial form of networked social movements (222),” Earl and Kimport also recognize a level of digital activism that exceeds this kind of supersized action. Theory 2.0 suggests that the use of digital technologies changes the underlying processes of advocacy. In particular, the theory holds that collective action can exist without copresence, or with limited copresence (127). In the past, the collective understanding of advocacy was limited by institutional and contextual questions. Today, advocacy may mean finding patterns in data—perhaps, a new conception of framing in which words take a back seat to data to tell a story, or algorithms define the patterns of things that exist in the world. As Bimber noted, digital technology has changed the entire structure and understanding of information. However, like the information revolutions past, these changes may not completely overcome the institutions of the past. The collective action theories of Olson, Tarrow, and Keck and Sikkink retain important conceptual principles to guide the understanding of advocacy networks. Technology has simply thrown off the constraints posed by collaboration and information costs, raising broader, deeper, complex questions about what advocacy means, how it can be achieved, and from whence it stems. =Electronic networks in free and open-source software= The concept of free software is much older than the Free Software Movement or the free software community, it is generally distinguished from the more popular open source software by its philosophical definition. Free software is generally referred to as \\"free speech,\\" not \\"free beer.\\" Essentially, those who are in favor of free software are in favor of freely accessing, reading, modifying, and redistributing the software. In the 1970s and 80's, two versions of Unix were being distributed from AT&T; and Berkley Software Distribution (BSD), and the model favored by AT&T; tended to receive more downloads than the BSD model. Several commercial innovations occurred because of these developments, including Apple's macOS. This was indicative of a movement within commercial software development to earn more profit from their products. Many argue that in 1976, Bill Gates signaled the beginning of the software-for-pay business with his Open Letter to Hobbyists, which referred to those people tinkering with the Altair BASIC system, which he developed with Paul Allen, criminals and guilty of copyright infringement. In response, Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Movement to ensure that either Unix or the alternate which he developed, GNU, would be free for people to use and develop on their own. This does not mean, however, that revised versions of free software can not be obfuscated or used in commercially sold products. Open source software is similar in its mission, but the major difference is that there is no obfuscation allowed for any part of a code which is based on open source software and that no open source software can be used as a commercially sold product. The most famous open source code is the Linux operating system, which is used and distributed both non-commercially and commercially (not sold). Free and open source software, however, are not in competition with each other. Linux and GNU, including other open source or free software such as MINIX, are often used in combination in original software development. Wikipedia, otherwise known as the free encyclopedia, is free because it follows the mantra of free software as defined by Richard Stallman. Collaborations such as Wikipedia, the free software movement, and open source software are successful in that they take advantage of small contributions by many people and that the cost of failure is low. The model of free or open source software may be one of the older forms of electronically enabled networks, but its format has remained relatively unchanged since the early 1990s. Networked advocacy in free and open source software movements is specifically designed to maintain an open flow of communication and development alive between those interested in various software projects. They take advantage of the soft ties between people of common interests and varying levels of skill to come together to create software which is at times effective and cheap enough to be a better choice for governments and business than commercially developed software products. =Electronic networks and politics= It is vital that citizens have the training to utilize new technology to disseminate information, decentralize local governance and hold their government accountable; these tools ultimately bring the government closer to the people by strengthening citizens’ political voices to engage their government to ensure improved quality and transparency. Recent events in the Middle East and North Africa are evidence of the power of collective mobilization and how new technologies can be implemented to inspire individuals and communities to act. Turning to specific recent events, some cite the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests and Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution as examples of the power of online technology to aid social advocacy and protest. Other critics doubt its impact, saying instead that grievances mobilize people, not technology. In a January 2011 article for Foreign Policy, commentator Ethan Zuckerman gave social networking technology some credit, but argued that the sustained nature of the revolts, as well as the solidarity shown between the revolts of different nations, is a phenomenon beyond the scope of online networked advocacy. While the Middle East revolutions garnered attention for the ability for grassroots organizations to launch, social media platforms can also effectively be mobilized for a top down organization as well. As Congress debated the merits of funding for Planned Parenthood, the organization was able to utilize Facebook and Twitter to educate people about the effects of a funding reduction. What was so stunningly effective was that most people who participated in the online educational campaign were not originally “fans” of Planned Parenthood's Facebook page, but rather were influenced—to use Bennett and Manheim's word—by seeing a peer's Facebook posting. Each reposting helped spread information and the campaign went “viral”. Viral marketing relies heavily on networked communications, whether Internet bulletin board systems (BBS), chat rooms or social media services like Twitter and Facebook. At the foundational level, viral marketing entails producing a large media outcome with limited resource input, in effect turning the Hindman model of power law distribution on its head by allowing a new website or idea to rise quickly up the rankings of a power law distributed network. Direct action by the viral marketing production team is only involved at the beginning of a project, and relies extensively on demonstrated networking phenomena to spread news or information about a product to a wider base. Among the first to write about viral marketing on the Internet was the media critic Douglas Rushkoff.1994, Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture The assumption is that if such an advertisement reaches a \\"susceptible\\" user, that user becomes \\"infected\\" (i.e., accepts the idea) and shares the idea with others \\"infecting them,\\" in the viral analogy's terms. As long as each infected user shares the idea with more than one susceptible user on average (i.e., the basic reproductive rate is greater than one--the standard in epidemiology for qualifying something as an epidemic), the number of infected users grows according to an exponential curve. Of course, the marketing campaign may be successful even if the message spreads more slowly, if this user-to-user sharing is sustained by other forms of marketing communications, such as public relations or advertising. This is substantially similar to a modified one-step flow theory outlined by Jarol B. Manheim and W. Lance Bennett, with substantial additions designed to turn the theory into a direct-marketing strategy. Those who see the Internet as having played a crucial role believe ICT reinforced portions of theoretical concepts behind networked advocacy in protests in Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen and Iran. For instance, the self-repairing nature of networks connected to outside information centers is notable. Despite Egyptian government attempts to block Internet access and reduce the organizing and communicative potential of social networking websites, Egyptian protesters effectively expanded the sphere of their complaint to capture the attention of the Western and world media, including Google, which offered technology to circumvent the Internet shutdown. These peripheral technologies included posting status updates and event information via phone using a novel new \\"Text-to-Tweet\\" program. In addition, The Egyptian appeal to private businesses and Western governments is an example of the networked advocacy \\"Boomerang Effect,\\" described as early as 1984 by Millard F. Mann of the University of Kansas but popularized in the work Activists Beyond Borders by communications experts Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink. There is also a compelling link between the ready availability of information provided by Internet websites such as Twitter and the speed with which organized, concerted protests spread across national borders. Networked advocacy tools such as Facebook and Twitter appear to have played a role in coalescing the horizontally structured Egyptian Revolution of 2011. It is possible that older technologies, such as cable television, played an equally large role in fomenting and sustaining protests. On the other hand, other critics caution against overstating the role of electronic advocacy in the Middle East protests. Criticisms include: *Shared grievances, coupled with strong solidarity—not technology—cause protest. *Online protests have low entry barriers, but they also have exceptionally low commitment levels, hence there is a constant danger of overestimating the degree of support a particular cause enjoys. *Internet penetration, and use of platforms like Twitter and Facebook is low in much of the developing world, thus these protests are more likely to reach elite or developed countries rather than large masses of poor people around the world. *Malcolm Gladwell argues that social media-driven activism favors weak-tie connections that only give information as opposed to strong-tie personal connections that help people persevere in the face of danger. =Networked advocacy in areas of limited statehood and the Global South= Much of the available scholarship on networked advocacy deals with areas of the world in which states are consolidated. Such states are willing and able to provide basic public goods. People who hope to enact political change in such places direct their advocacy toward the state. This literature relies on the assumption that advocates have a state on which it can direct political pressure. But this work excludes situations in which statehood is limited or where not much of a state exists at all. Areas of limited statehood do not have to necessarily refer to a state's entire geographic area but could be confined to certain regions. Mancur Olson sees the state as the pinnacle of a large organization. In the first pages of The Logic of Collective Action, he explains that the state—like the other organizations on which he focuses his study—is “expected to further the interests of its citizens.”Olson, The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups p. 7 He invites no possibility of organizing in a non-state environment. Similarly, the modes of governance Sidney Tarrow discusses in Power in Movement rely on the centrality of the state. He characterizes contentious politics—his iteration of collective action—as “not only…the expression of societies’ submerged groups putting pressure on the state, but as an intermediary set of processes between states and societies.”Tarrow, Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics p. 72 For Tarrow, the state is a necessary condition, the arena in which advocacy happens. In the state’s absence, contentious politics are just local protests. But what of the “submerged groups” that exist in an area of limited statehood? While Keck and Sikkink mention some areas of limited statehood in the case studies presented in Activists Beyond Borders, their theory of collective action still focuses primarily on the interaction between nation states and non-state actors. Their boomerang model addresses the idea of an uncooperative government, positioning NGOs as interlocuters between specific a population and its state. However, in the absence of a central government, how would this model change? In “Social Movements beyond Borders,” Lance Bennett's examination of political capacity also seems to assume the existence of a state. In examining the flexible, fluid networks facilitated by a digital information environment, he asks whether these networks in particular are able to “to influence larger publics and establish effective political relationships with the targets of their protest.”W. Lance Bennett, Social Movements beyond Borders: Organization, Communication, and Political Capacity in Two Eras of Transnational Activism, p.208 Bennett's examples of social movements all involve protests against concrete targets inseparable from the state. But what happens in an area of limited statehood, when establishing relationships with targets—or perhaps even having targets at all—is not an option? Castells overtly discusses the centrality of the state in his theory of collective action. As noted before, Castells sees collective action and social movements as struggles between power and counterpower. He discusses these power dynamics exclusively in terms of the state: “Power relations are imbedded in the institutions of society, and particularly in the state…The actual configuration of the state and other institutions that regulate people’s lives depend on the constant interaction between power and counterpower.”Manuel Castells, Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age, p. 5 He even goes as far as to say that in order for power networks—and, by extension, social movements—to function, a state must exist. In his words, “the state constitutes the default network for the proper functioning of all other networks.”p. 8 With this assertion, he seems to doom all areas of limited statehood to powerlessness when it comes to mobilizing their outrage and engaging in collective action. By presupposing a “global north” society, Earl and Kimport also limit their vision when it comes to the potential of digitally enabled collective action. Though they never assert it explicitly, their theories seem to rely on the existence of a consolidated state. Nearly all of the examples of e-tactics they offer are online petitions; what they neglect to take into account is that some states are not open to being persuaded by petitions. Furthermore, their characterization of “theory 2.0” only takes into account a very narrow range of collective action possibilities and forms. They hypothesize that “theory 2.0” will create an environment conducive to a “wide” range of protest areas, including “saving television shows, supporting boy bands and challenging corporate game producers.”Jennifer Earl and Katrina Kimport, Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age, p. 155 Not only are these examples exclusive to the “global north,” but they also ignore the potential of “theory 2.0” to allow for mechanisms that empower marginalized populations in areas of limited statehood, such as Reclaim Naija or Ushahidi. Steven Livingston and Gregor Walter-Drop argue that not just new technology but new uses of information and communication technology can fill the void left by dysfunctional, extractive states. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's Why Nations Fail distinguishes between extractive and pluralistic nations. The former are designed to benefit and preserve the wealth of an elite. Institutions in these nations extract natural resources for this group and sacrifice the security of the larger population to protect it. Such an environment breeds resentment and unrest, which sets states on the path to instability and ultimately failure. Meanwhile, pluralistic political and economic institutions provide opportunities for economic advancement and protect the hard-won property of citizens. A free press sets pluralistic states apart from extractive ones, holding powerful institutions accountable for their actions. Pluralistic nations also foster participation through a robust civil society. Event- mapping platforms such as Ushahidi, which relies largely on crowdsourcing, or Syria Tracker have monitored and visually displayed incidences of violence across the world. Such platforms gather information from locals on the ground and turn that data into digital, interactive maps. M-Pesa, a money-transfer service based on mobile telephony, allows users with limited access to banks to transfer money without ever having to exchange physical currency. In recent years, new technological tools and increased access to information have combined to enable substantial growth in activism efforts in Latin American regions of the Global South. Google technologies—particularly Google Street View and Google Earth Engine, an online environment monitoring tool updated daily—have proven transformative for several groups, including the Amazon Conservation Team and the Surui tribe, in measuring and mapping the Amazon region in order to aid protection of the rainforest and isolated indigenous groups.“Amazon Conservation Team;” “Google Street View,” 2012; “The Surui Carbon Project,” 2011 After Guatemala's 36-year civil war ended in 1996, “the country was a vast unmarked grave” with more than 200,000 people missing or dead as a result of the conflict, and, following the war, the government, army, and other official groups maintained silence about victims’ identities and hid important information about the crimes committed during the war.Doyle, 2007, p. 52; “The pursuit of justice in Guatemala,” 2012; “Notes from the evidence project,” 2012 Over the past several years, however, human rights groups and investigators have gained access to a growing body of crucial police and government records and undertaken the analysis and organization of a massive archive of records.Doyle, 2007, p. 52; “Recovery of the Guatemalan police archives,” 2008\\"Notes from the evidence project,” 2012\\"Update: the Guatemalan death squad diary,” 2012 They have done this through physically locating, digitally scanning, and storing many of the millions of pages of records, gathering and housing witnesses’ and victims’ experiences in databases, and conducting quantitative analyses of interviews and other knowledge gathered.“Guatemala  Human Rights Data Analysis Group;”Doyle, 2007, p. 54-59; “Update: the Guatemalan death squad diary,” 2012 These records have aided Guatemalan families in learning the whereabouts of missing loved ones and provided evidence in multiple human rights cases.“Notes from the evidence project,” 2012 Livingston and Walter-Drop argue that these tools, while each have the potential to be effective individually, are most powerful when they “come together to empower communities against the harsher aspects of day-to- day life in areas where the government is both weak and corrupt”.Livingston, S., & Walter-Drop, G. (2012). Information and communication technologies in areas of limited statehood. SFB-Governance Working Paper Series, 38, p. 16) Crowdsourcing platforms, for example, often combine a number of technologies to provide populations with the tools to report corruption, violence, and other problems and encourage institutional response and rectification; Google's tools combine in similar ways to provide transparency, share information, and facilitate the protection of compromised regions and populations. =Electronic networks and event mapping= Remote sensing data, geographical information system (GIS) platforms, mobile telephony work together to allow crowdsourcing initiatives that have created new types of organization around the world. One example of this is the event mapping, an advocacy activity that relies on geospatial data collected by commercial remote sensing satellites, GPS coordinates and GIS. One example is Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, a GIS platform established in 2008 to monitor and map post-election violence in Kenya. Ushahidi has grown from an ad hoc group of volunteers to a more focused organization not only working in Kenya, but much of Africa, Europe, South America and the United States. Individuals on the ground can establish their own monitoring system and observers from all over the world can monitor elections to look for signs of fraud and/or violence. Other examples of the uses of the Ushahidi platform include organizing resources in post-earthquake Haiti, the Help Map Russia system which coordinates resources to fight wildfires in Russia, and a system for mapping violence and protests in Libya. One particularly successful campaign using event mapping was a joint collaboration project with Vote Report India and Ushahidi. A citizen-driven election monitoring platform was created in 2009 to report on voting habits and voter turnout. This was intended to be a campaign to increase voter turnout, engagement and awareness by promoting democracy. Aside from fighting corruption, as seen in Kenya, research has shown that as mobile phone penetration in a community increases, the feeling that society is wholly corrupt decreases. This is likely due to the mobile phone's facilitation of networked information systems that increase access to a broader array of information and allow relatively simple fact- checking.Catie Snow Bailard, “Mobile Phone Diffusion and Corruption in Africa,” Political Communication 26, no. 3 (July 2009), 338 Event mapping, however, can be used in a variety of ways. It can illuminate problems, create communities with common goals, bring attention to injustice, and even redefine the idea of an \\"international\\" or \\"domestic\\" issue by simply showing the physical location of an event. Patrick Meier is an internationally renowned expert in the application of new technologies for crisis early warning and humanitarian response. He has demonstrated the success of information and communications technologies in crisis mapping – live maps being updated with information from sources on the ground via SMS technology, email, and social media. Meier has been successful in aiding humanitarian organizations like the United Nations, the World Health Organization, Amnesty International and other to mobilize social media and digital technology resources to resolve humanitarian crises. According to Meier, “Situational awareness is key to allocating resources and coordinating logistics… Gaining information like this straight from crisis zones is a game changer; these technologies didn’t exist just a few years ago.” Meier, a former Director of Crisis Mapping at Ushahidi, sees the power of ICT's for “democratizing information access, participation, and agency.”Patrick Meier. (December 2011). New information technologies and their effect on the humanitarian sector. International Review of the Red Cross 93(884), 1239–1263 p.1240 Meier focuses on the use of crisis mapping in the humanitarian sector by exploring the cases of the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake, forest fires in remote parts of Russia and the humanitarian crisis in Libya. Meier, by examining collective action in the realm of humanitarian disasters, sheds light on what might be a way forward in terms of how ICT can create digitally enabled modes of governance when he recommends a “more decentralized, bottom-up approach.”Patrick Meier. (December 2011). New information technologies and their impact on the humanitarian sector. International Review of the Red Cross 93(884), 1239–1263 p.1261 Perhaps a more robust digitally enabled governance modality will occur when citizens of an area of limited statehood are provided with new information and communication technology and then left on their own to figure out how governance challenges can be “met and responded to locally.” Rather than simply relegating locals to simply recorders of governance issues, a new form of governance modality will allow these populations to “make better use of new information technologies to support their immediate self-organized response efforts.” Perhaps the key to digitally enabled governance modalities is not simply the introduction of new ICT's to a population, but also the extent to which local populations are allowed to own the technology and its usage for themselves and in doing so develop their own locally melded governance structures. =Electronic networks and environmentalism= Networked collective action has shown promise for enhancing environmental activism around the globe. One prominent example is the Google Earth Engine, which uses 25 years of satellite images and current data to provide a live model of the earth. The project, posted online for free, is aimed to help developing nations track deforestation rates and other environmental changes in real time. In the US, the nonprofit group Appalachian Voices uses the tool to show the world what mountaintop removal mining has done to their home. In Brazil, the Suruí tribe is using Google Earth Engine to measure the removal of trees from their rainforest by illegal loggers. Through the Suruí Carbon Project, several members of the community were given Android phones that allowed them to calculate the carbon emissions of trees in their forest. Now, when they can monitor their forests for suspicious changes by illegal loggers. Other technologies are also at play in networked activism. IBM offers an iPhone app that allows users to crowdsouce water quality. Called \\"Creekwatch\\" it asks users to take a photo of a creek or stream they walk by, then answer the water level, flow and trash level. This water is released publicly, and can allow water boards in cities and countries to monitor and manage water supplies more effectively, prevent leaks in water pipelines and help activists monitor their watersheds. In India, Neerjaal is a newer project that allows people to crowdsource information about water sources, consumption, harvesting and shortages for use on an interactive platform. In 2007, the Blue Planet Run Foundation launched Peer Water Exchange, a “unique participatory decision-making network of partners, [which] combines people, process, and technology to manage water and sanitation projects around the world – from application, selection, funding, implementation, and impact assessment.”. In the project, communities who apply for funding for water- related projects must provide information about their proposals, which are voted on by other members of the online community. Any group that wants to apply for funding, must agree to evaluate at least 5 other project proposals. Not only does this provide transparency for donors and communities, but it also allows people to come together from communities around the world to share information and best practices. =Youth advocacy in civic and political participation= =Youth advocacy organizations= There are many well- established organizations that support advocacy efforts around issues that affect youth both on national and international levels. Some of these organizations like Youth Advocate Program International,yapi.org for example, which attempts to educate policy makers about issues as such child slavery and trafficking to help establish protective policies for children, are led by adults who advocate on behalf of children. Others, like the Youth Advocacy Center,youthadvocacycenter.org work with youth to advocate for themselves. YAC mentors youth who are or about to be in the foster system to advocate for their rights. But of a more important, related note, there has been a rise in youth advocacy organizations and participation by youth themselves, specifically in the participation and involvement in advocacy efforts and the creation of organizations and projects to support these causes. As suggested by the research mentioned earlier (another CIRCLE supported study found roughly 60 percent of youth said they used social networking to address social issues), youth have become more active participators in civic and political life through the use of digital and social media. One example of this has been the increase in youth participation in advocacy networking sites and organizations like TakingItGlobal] and the Global Youth Action Network. TakingItGlobal (TIG) is an international social networking site that encourages youth to connect to organizations and their peers for advocacy efforts on international topics that interest them. As of 2011, the network had 340,000 members that included 22,000 nonprofits and 2,400 schools in 118 countries. In addition to connection facilitation, the network also hosts conferences and summits and offers resources for educators and organizations to build capacity and increase scope. TIG works in partnership with the Global Youth Action Network, which serves as the ground level outreach organization for a number of the partner projects. Both TakingItGlobal and the Global Youth Action Network connect directly with many international and national NGOs, as well as other organizations, to increase support for such causes. TIG and GYAN also support projects through organizations like Youth Service America, a U.S. based-nonprofit focused on improving youth participation in national service. Through efforts using digital and social media, organizations like TIG, GYAN, and YSA, aim to help youth see their potential as stakeholders and global citizens, encourage their participation in national and international issues that are or could be important to them, connect them to their national and international peers who are like-minded to do the same, and expose the availability of resources and organizations they can use to facilitate advocacy and change. =Electronic networks and arts exchange= There are certain areas of collective action that have always challenged governments–the arts is one area in which government sponsorship traditionally falls short. Often not seen in as high a position of priority as defense, for instance, artistic endeavor and exchange is often faced with coordination challenges for which it has proven difficult to overcome with government funding alone. With electronic networks we see many new ways private institutions and interested individuals have been able make art more accessible to the public worldwide. Google began making the world's masterpieces more accessible by including The Prado museum and select works in the Google Earth platform. By simply locating The Prado users can zoom in to view up close high definition images of select art works. The high definition images not only allow the user to see a painting clearly, but even allow the user a close enough look to study individual brush strokes on a painting. Google Earth's inclusion of The Prado was just the beginning of applying these kinds of technologies to accessing the arts. In February 2011 Google unveiled Google Art Project, a platform devoted to bringing online museums around the world and their most famous works to the online public. Google Art Project is a platform housing many of the world museums and a variety of works from each location. Users can use this technology to get high definition, close up views of some of the world's most famous paintings, much like in the Google Earth presentation of The Prado. With Google Art Project users can also take virtual tours of certain areas and exhibits of the museums, creating a more realistic visitor experience. This platform allows a person with a computer and an Internet connection in say, Arkansas, can take a virtual, high definition tour of, for instance, the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, Germany, the National Gallery in London, England, or the Palace of Versailles in Versailles, France. Because of online platforms like Google Earth and Google Arts an area once largely reserved for the wealthy–the arts–because of limited accessibility, is increasingly accessible. Looking beyond the mainstream, museum-housed art, online networks have enabled access to a wider variety, or long tail of art, whether for display, learning, or purchase. Art.Net, for instance, is a non- profit web-based artist collective of more than 450 artists, poets, musicians, painters, sculptors, animators, hacker artists, and other creative people from around the world, aimed at helping artists share their works on the World Wide Web. Artists create and maintain studio web spaces on the site and gallery pages where they show their works and share information about themselves. Artists are also encouraged to collaborate and to help each other promote and improve their art. Several member artists also teach art in their studio spaces located on Art.Net. Art.net should not be confused with Artnet, which is an information platform for the international art market, including fine arts, decorative arts and design. It provides services allowing its clients to attain price transparency, giving them an effective overview of the art market and enabling them to contact galleries directly. The network caters specifically to art dealers, as well as buyers. Another online network for collectors is the recently established VIP Art Fair, virtual trade show for buyers and sellers of art. VIP Art Fair gives contemporary art collectors access to artworks by a wide range of artists and the ability to connect one- on-one with internationally renowned dealers anywhere in the world. With electronic networks and online platforms devoted to art becomes more accessible to everyone, whether that means an artist can easily share his or her work and a student or art lover can access a greater variety of works for study or enjoyment online. Potential Pitfalls of Networked Advocacy Networked advocacy has great potential to improve lives around the world, but it is also important to recognize the potential risks associated with this form of collective action. In particular, advocacy powered by various forms of Information and communications technology may put participants at risk of reprisal by states or other entities with strong interests in the status quo. In Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed, James C. Scott argues that most consolidations of state power have their roots in efforts to make populations more \\"legible\\" to ruling elites. He further argues that these efforts have the ultimate goal of facilitating \\"taxation, political control, and conscription.\\"Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 2. Scott argues that efforts at legibility require simplification, which can often lead to loss of useful local knowledge. Ultimately, Scott believes that increased legibility can put citizens at risk of exploitation, and in the worst cases, physical harm. In terms of standardization, according to Scott measurement practices were one of the most important areas to standardize and eventually out of this standardization emerged the metric system, which was “at once a means of administrative centralization, commercial reform, and cultural progress”.Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 31 To Scott, “the crowning artifact of this mighty simplification is the cadastral map”Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 36 which was a survey of landholdings used to accurately levy taxes. In broad terms, the cadastral map allowed the state to monitor who owned land where. Scott sees immense and transformative power in maps, especially those created by the state. As with any object of simplification created by the state, maps “are designed to summarize precisely those aspects of a complex world that are of immediate interest to the mapmaker and to ignore the rest.”Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 87 Often states, in order to reflect their own power, will ignore certain areas on maps as is obvious when one searches for the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya which is pictured as a blank area in Google maps. To counter this simplification and reframing of this area by the state, ICT's like OpenStreetMap.org allow for crowdsourced mapping by locals. However, the question must then be considered, by making this area legible does this crowdsourcing also open up the area to domination from the state? Although Scott was writing before the ICT revolution had taken off, his concerns about legibility are newly applicable in the age of cellular telephony and GIS data created on the fly. It is possible that certain networked advocacy efforts could make it easier for states to control populations that were previously illegible. If this occurs, it is unclear whether such efforts will leave a given population better off than they were previously. Scott warns that the most tragic \\"state episodes\\" in recent history originates with a genuine desire to improve the human condition. These tragic state episodes begin with an authoritarian state implementing policies reflecting high modernist ideals amidst a weak civil society. While Scott is not categorically opposed to high modernism or legibility, he warns that a false perception of human knowledge and social engineering is a dangerous combination. As a result, the negative implications of legibility should be thoroughly considered when contemplating networked advocacy plans, even if they are well-intentioned. The anonymity of data is one area of concern that deserves special attention. If states seek to impose their scientific beliefs, and methods for making populations legible, what does that mean for ICTs whose very purpose is to lower the cost of collaboration and information? The prior literature discussed here has shown that digital technologies and platforms can be leveraged for collective and social benefits, can hold state's accountable, or can provide modalities of governance in areas where no state seemingly exists. ICTs have the ability to play a very different role when examined against a backdrop of James Scott and population legibility, one that aims for control and repression rather than liberation and collaboration. This raises the possibility for the state to use ICTs for purposes that are enslaving, quite the opposite of liberating. One of the problems with such state initiated standardization, even when done with the best of intentions, is that it robs a community of its very ability to resist to this state imposition and control, and even total authoritarian repression. Another problem arises from, in the case of a digital and abundant information environment, who controls the data? If the state also has a total monopoly over the information environment, then control and manipulation in this day and age become as easy as pressing a button, wiretapping a phone call, or locating political dissidents to within mere feet of their physical location represented on a GIS map. As Scott states, the technologies and capabilities now available to “enhance the legibility of a society to its rulers have become vastly more sophisticated, but the political motives driving them have changed little - appropriation, control, and manipulation remain the most prominent (77).” If the overarching concern of the state's political, economic, or theologic regime is with self-preservation, then ICTs such as those discussed prior in the hands of a dictator or authoritarian ruler can be a powerful tool for quashing any sort of challenges. This does however, bring up an interesting point - if state's adopt and implement ICTs in order to make populations more legible and to control and manipulate them or any opponents, what kind of cycle does that create? Just for a moment let's imagine a hypothetical situation: Activist A is either living under a repressive, authoritarian regime, state, or political institution. In order to circumvent the controls and monitoring of the state, Activist A takes to digitally enabled ICTs and other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. in order to communicate and collaborate with much lower costs, and possibly without fear of being outed by the state. Sensing, or experiencing collaboration and collective action on the part of a partial or full segment of the population, the state then leverages ICTs in order to track and monitor dissidents, to ensure a monopoly control over the data, and to generally secure self-preservation of the regime. Noting that those particular platforms or ICT's no longer are available as a means of bringing redress to the state, what does Activist A do in response? Does he look for more, and newer ICTs and platforms that are unbeknownst to the state? Or does he abandon all hope of using electronic networks and ICTs to look for assistance in the mold of Keck and Sikkink's ‘boomerang model?’ When ICTs can no longer be leveraged because they are controlled, monitored, and owned by the state, what is left in the activists’ arsenal? It would seem that he would revert then to either traditional repertoires of contention (Tarrow 2011), boomerang throwing (Keck & Sikkink 1998), or some combination of both. It would appear that both sides are caught in a vicious cycle, and until either the regime or state changes, collapses, or gives in, they are stuck. So in that way, when the state actually controls the ICTs, can governance truly be brought to areas of limited statehood, or effective in holding states accountable and transparent? Maybe leaving it up to James Scott to sum up is best: “The legibility of society provides the capacity for large-scale social engineering, high- modernist ideology provides the desire, the authoritarian state provides the determination to act on that desire, and an incapacitated civil society provides the leveled social terrain on which to build (5).” One thing that seems pertinent in Scott's discussion of “High Modernism” as it relates to ICTs and advocacy efforts is the focus on scientific progress and the idea that measurement represents improvement, and that society should consistently pursue that highest version of progress. This seems to be the actual purpose of legibility and the role of ICTs in bringing legibility to areas of limited statehood. It is using the best that humanity has to offer, in terms of technological development, to organize people and provide services absent what were once considered the best structures to do so. Yes, Scott's work points to how progress can be co-opted by individuals and states with bad intentions, but that should not put limitations on how progress can be beneficial. The literature from Livingston and Walter-Drop provide testimony to how certain populations in the world are only exposed to public health services through ICTs, which is a direct result of our technical progress as a society.Scott, J., C. Seeing Like a State. Yale University Press. 1998. The work done by theorists such as Risse and Lehmkuhl and Livingston and Walter-Drop paints a somewhat optimistic picture of the power of information and communication technologies in areas of limited statehood and the Global South, and the Amazon and Guatemala case studies further illustrate technology's ability to empower disenfranchised, isolated populations to improve their situations and gain crucial insights. On the other end of the spectrum is Scott's work, which suggests that advancements in science and technology have the potential to be detrimental to populations when authoritative states with unrelenting faith in science and technology impose designs based on this mentality on groups incapable of resisting these designs. Activists and advocacy researchers may need to further explore whether technological advancements are ever purely beneficial to populations or whether the potential for governments to impose these tools on populations and leverage technology to police, control, and oppress them outweighs any potential benefits. It seems that Scott has the most comprehensive, satisfying answer to this dilemma in the conclusion of his book. He cites several examples of states implementing technically masterful designs replete with standards and scientific support in their societies, only to fail due to a lack of consideration of the people living in those societies and their often useful mētis, or “situated, local knowledge.\\" Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 318. These observations do not denounce high modernism or science; rather, they serve as a reminder to states of the importance of avoiding imperialism in implementing knowledge- based designs.Scott, James C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 339. Scott's work, while seemingly pessimistic on its face, imparts important advice for activists working with technology and stresses the importance of diversity in planning and knowledge sharing and empowering each institution to “take much of its shape from the evolving mētis of its people [to] enhance their range of experience and skills.\\" Scott, James C. 1998.

It was discovered in 1972 and was the first natural peptide found that contained an ureylene group. It has been crystallised in complexes with carboxypeptidase, which is obtained from wheat,PDB ENTRY and Leishmania major oligopeptidase B.PDB ENTRY In both cases, the backbone carbonyl of the terminal arginine of antipain forms a covalent bond to the active site serine in the protease.  Antiretroviral and Protease inhibitors  There are several Serine proteases, which are enzymes that cleave the protein bond, in the human genome. The abnormal functioning of these proteases can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. Protease inhibitors or antipain are enzymes that are used to regulate their performance. The antiretroviral drug Nelfinavir is one example of an antipain. It was classified as an antipain after a study published by Ovid that investigated the in vitro effect of Nelfinavir using proteolytic foot printing and found that it selectively inhibited HER2- positive, a growth factor in breast cancer.  Protease inhibitors and DRUG neurons  Protease- activated receptors (PARs) are a unique class of G protein-coupled receptors activated by proteolytic cleavage of the receptor N terminus. PARs are activated by some Serine Proteases and are important for the physiological, psychological, and pathological functions of the human body. During the study, an antipain analogue Y was developed and studied. It was shown to have properties as a protease inhibitors but it had a low IC50 than a antipain. Antipain analogue Y was able to suppress Trypsin, which inhibits the secretion of an excitatory neuropeptide that leads to inflammation and other disorders. = References = Category:Peptides Category:Aldehydes ","title":"Antipain"},{"id":"33035944","text":"Anti-pain may refer to: * A colloquial term for analgesia * Antipain, a peptide used in biochemical research ","title":"Anti-pain"},{"id":"33035945","text":"Milanović or Milanovic () is a South Slavic surname derived from a masculine given name Milan.

History The desire for a permanent connection across the Limfjord at Aggersund dates back to the early 1900s. In the mid-1920s, citizens in Løgstør reduced a selection, which appeared with a number of suggestions for a bridge. However, the initiative stranded controversy about the alignment and funding. In 1936, the idea was resumed by the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transport as a possible employment measure, and in 1939 the construction of the bridge, which was funded by Aalborg, Hjørring and Thisted Amter, began. The bridge was projected by Christen Ostenfeld. The initiation took place on 18 June 1942. The bridge cost about 3.5 million DKK. During the German occupation of Denmark, the bridge was strategically important for the German shipments of crew and equipment to and from Norway. Therefore, a military support point was built in 1943-44, consisting of 11 concrete plants on the north side and 6 on the south side. In addition, minefields and other types of barriers were introduced. Two large Flak bunkers on the south side and one on the north side are still available and are available. The other smaller bunkers have either been removed or located in a private area without public access. http://www.aggersund.optimus.dk/attached/406195090729322070124459044/studtpunkt%20aggersund.pdf In 2000, the Aggersund Bridge beams were strengthened, increasing the carrying capacity of the bridge.

Como had many offers before and after he was back in his home town. As he was preparing to sign a lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a telephone call from Tommy Rockwell, who was with General Artists Corporation. Rockwell, who also represented Ted Weems, offered Como a sustaining (non-sponsored) radio program on CBS and also to get him a recording contract. The offers made by Rockwell meant remaining in New York to perform with no more road tours as had been the case for many years when Como was with both Freddie Carlone and Ted Weems. On the advice of his wife, Roselle, Como agreed to go to New York as it meant he could continue working in the music business and not be separated from his family. Como began his Columbia Presents Como radio show on March 12, 1943. The fifteen-minute program aired on CBS every weekday afternoon. Shortly after he went on the air with this show, he was offered an engagement at New York's Copacabana night club; one week later, he signed a recording contract with RCA Victor. Como continued with the CBS radio program until he was offered the opportunity to have his own sponsored evening radio program on NBC, The Chesterfield Supper Club, which he moved to on December 11, 1944.(subscription required) When Como went on the air for CBS, the 1942–44 musicians' strike was in full force. The strike by union musicians was meant to force the record companies into paying royalties to their members. Union musicians were able to play live engagements and for radio programs, but not for any recordings until the strike was settled. Record companies used background vocal groups during this time to replace the striking musicians on studio recordings. The only exception to the ban was made for V-Discs after October 27, 1943, which were distributed to the Armed Forces. During this time, vocalists could only be heard with full orchestral backing in a concert setting or on radio broadcasts. Como's first recording for RCA Victor, \\"Goodbye Sue\\", was recorded three months after he began his radio program. Because of the strike, it was recorded without the use of studio musicians. A version of the song with full musical accompaniment was not recorded until 1944 for the V-Disc program. Como performed the song on his Columbia Presents Como radio program with the backing of the Raymond Scott Orchestra and it is one of the selections in this box set. As is the case with compilation albums produced from broadcast transcripts, there is also the opportunity to hear the singer perform many songs which he or she never recorded otherwise. The recordings on this 3 disk box set are taken from transcripts of Como's radio programs for CBS in 1943. On the Air originally issued these disks individually in 1996 under the titles The Perry Como Shows-1943: Volume 1, The Perry Como Shows-1943: Volume 2, and The Perry Como Shows-1943: Volume 3. Como is heard throughout with the Raymond Scott Orchestra; the orchestra also has some instrumental tracks in the collection.

He was born in Heanor, Derbyshire, and was responsible for the construction of the Chesterfield Canal. He died in 1809 and is buried at All Saints Church, Harthill, Derbyshire.  Early life  John Varley was born on 8 June 1740 to Francis Varley (1719-1789) and Rebekah Varley in Heanor, Derbyshire. He married Hannah Pattern (1752-c.1784) on 13 March 1770.  Early canal engineering  James Brindley appointed John Varley as an Assistant. The proposed canal from the River Don to Cinderbridge was surveyed by John Varley.  Chesterfield Canal  The Chesterfield canal surveyed in 1769. Published in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1777. The route of the canal was surveyed by James Brindley and John Varley, who estimated the cost at £94,908 17s. Brindley presented his proposals to a meeting in Worksop on 24 August 1769. An application was made to Parliament and the Act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 28 March 1771, entitled An Act for making a navigable Cut or Canal from Chesterfield, in the county of Derby, through or near Worksop and Retford, to join the River Trent, at or near Stockwith, in the county of Nottingham. The promoters consisted of one hundred and seventy-four persons, amongst whom were the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Newcastle, Lord Scarsdale, the Dean of York, and Sir Cecil Wray. They were incorporated by the name of The Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation from Chesterfield to the River Trent, and empowered to raise among themselves the sum of £100,000, in one thousand shares of £100 each, to fund the construction.Richardson, Christine (ed) (1996). Minutes of the Chesterfield Canal Company 1771-80. . Immediately on the passing of the act, construction began under the direction of Brindley. Upon his death in September 1772, John Varley moved from Clerk of Works to Resident Engineer with Hugh Henshall, Brindley's brother-in-law, appointed Chief Engineer in 1773. The canal was to be built as a narrow canal, but in 1775, nine shareholders offered to fund the extra cost of making it a broad canal from Retford to Stockwith. Retford Corporation joined them, and each contributed £500. The additional cost exceeded £6000. The canal was opened throughout in 1777, but the only record of wide-beamed boats using it at Retford is prior to 1799.Stamford Mercury 12 July 1799, column 3. As built, the canal was almost long, being from the Trent to WorksopInland Waterways of Great Britain, 8th Ed., (2009), Imray Laurie Norie and Wilson, with a rise of .Chesterfield Canal map and elevations, Chesterfield Canal Society From Worksop to the entrance to Norwood Tunnel it was with a further rise. From there to Chesterfield it was a further with a fall of followed by a rise of . There were 65 locks in all, with two tunnels: a short tunnel near Gringley Beacon, and the major 2,880 yard long Norwood Tunnel. At the time of construction, Norwood Tunnel was the joint longest canal tunnel in Britain, and it was sixth longest by the time it collapsed. The canal was a typical Brindley contour canal, following the contours to avoid costly cuttings and embankments, which resulted in a less than direct route in places. The canal was initially fairly successful, with dividends being returned to the investors. However, the building of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway line parallel to the canal (1849) left much of the navigation redundant, and the Worksop to Chesterfield stretch ceased to serve commercial traffic in 1908, when problems with mining subsidence necessitated the closure of Norwood Tunnel. The stretch between the tunnel and Worksop subsequently fell into ruin and became un-navigable, while parts of the isolated section from the tunnel to Chesterfield were infilled and redeveloped.  Later years  The Erewash Canal as surveyed by J.Smith in 1776 Varley was also instructed by the Canal Company to build a house near to the east end of the Norwood Tunnel which later was known as Pennyholme. The house was the home of John Varley and his descendants for a number of years. Other canal projects included the Erewash Canal where Varley was appointed Engineer, and Varley also produced the surveys for the Nutbrook Canal and the Leicestershire Line. John Varley died at Pennyholme on 16 February 1809 and was buried in Harthill Parish Churchyard.  Chesterfield Canal Trust  John Varley is one of the forgotten heroes of the early Industrial Revolution. The Chesterfield Canal Trust have named one of the boats which runs trips on the canal the John Varley. A plaque dedicated to Varley in commemoration of the two hundredth anniversary of his death was unveiled in the presence of the Mayor and Mayoress of Rotherham on 28 February 2009.

In 1849, Dr. Knoblecher, the third leader of the Vicariate Apostolic Central Africa, which reached Khartoum, Sudan in 1848, led an exploratory expedition to southern Sudan and set up the first Catholic mission there at Gondokoro in 1852. That same year, 8 men were baptized. An additional station was opened at modern-day Kansia in 1854. By 1858, 22 missionaries had died in Sudan. Father Matthias Kirchner became leader of the mission and gave the mission up to the Franciscans believing that they had the numbers and resources to survive sicknesses. More deaths led Pope Pius IX to close the mission. In 1864, Daniele Comboni developed A Plan for the Regeneration of Africa by means of Africans, in which he proposed training centers for priests and missionaries in Central Africa. He did not return to southern Sudan, but Deng Sorur, the first southern Sudanese Catholic priest, studied with Comboni. Wheeler, Andrew C., \\"Christianity in Sudan\\", \\"Dictionary of African Christian Biography\\" (accessed November 8, 2019). The Comboni Mission was established between 1895 and 1910 and played a role in spreading Christianity in South Sudan.

In 1900, Monseigner Antonio Riveggio established a mission in Lul. In 1904, three more missions were started in Bahr al-Ghazal. In 1905, Catholics opened Stack Memorial School as a mission station and to prepare children of chiefs to work for the colonial government. In February 1907, Father Paolo Maroni baptized the first 8 Christians at Kangnjo. By 1913, between 200 and 300 Southerners had been baptized at Wau. Wau became the administrative center of the Vicariate Apostolic that same year.Tounsel, \\"God will crown us,\\" 98-100. It became a diocese in 1974. Fath, \\"Les missions,\\" VI. When the government wanted increased cooperation with missions in education in the 1920s, the Catholic missions differed from the Protestant missions in that they believed the government should help the Church educate southern Sudanese.Tounsel, \\"God will crown us,\\" 1277. Comboni technical schools in [Bahr el Ghazal] had boys learning carpentry, bricklaying and gardening. Girls learned religion, English, needlework and hygiene.Tounsel, \\"God will crown us,\\" 142. The language of school teaching was addressed a lot in the 1930s, with some Catholic schools using a local language and other schools arguing that it was better to use English.Tounsel, \\"God will crown us,\\" 150.

Børve started an architectural practice in Porsgrunn in 1889 and designed numerous buildings in Telemark and Vestfold, many of them influenced by Dragestil and the Nordic National Romantic style. Among his best-known works are Dalen Hotel from 1894 and Porsgrunn City Hall from 1904/1905. Background Børve was born in Ullensvang in 1857 to farmer Lars Jørgensen Børve (1815–91) and Anna Haldorsdatter Eidnes (1822–1911). He attended Trondheim Technical Vocational School () from 1877 to 1880, after which he worked for a few years as a junior architect. His only major project during this time was managing the restoration of Ullensvang Church in Ullensvang from 1883 to 1886, a project led by Bergen architect Christian Christie. In 1887, he pursued further education at the Polytechnic Institute of Hannover in Germany. He was among the last of the great Norwegian architects to attend the architectural school in Hannover, which had greatly influenced Norwegian architecture in the latter half of the 19th century. He finished his studies in 1889, and with the help of a government grant for engineers, he moved to Porsgrunn in Telemark, Norway and started his own architectural firm that same year. In 1890, he married Kristine Jørstad (1861–1941). Career Porsgrunn Town Hall Dalen Hotel at Tokke in Telemark, Norway Haldor Larsen Børve's first work under the new firm was the Borgestad school (Borgestad skole) built in Skien in 1889. The building was bestowed upon the local school district by local shipping magnate and future prime minister Gunnar Knudsen. Though the building has long since been demolished, it was once a grand three-story stone building in the Neo- Gothic style, a symmetrical design with steep gables on both ends which featured Gothic window designs and pointed arches.Borgestad skole Slekt.org While Børve had learned a great deal about contemporary German architecture during his studies in Hannover, as shown in his use of Neo-Gothic and Swiss chalet styles. He was also a great proponent of Norwegian romantic nationalism and often integrated elements from Dragestil and National Romantic style into his work, as exemplified by Dalen Hotel, Børve's best-known work. In addition to his architectural practice, Børve was also the head teacher and later administrator at Porsgrunn Technical Evening School (). He was active as an architect until the early 1920s, and died in 1933 at Porsgrunn, aged 75. Following Børve's death, his daughter, architect Alfhild Børve, took over her father's practice along with Haldor Larsen Børve's assistant Ødegaard. The next year, Johannes Laurentius Borchsenius (1903-2003) took over as co-owner with Alfhild Børve, and the firm changed its name to Børve Borchsenius Arkitekter. Borchsenius was an architect from Skien who studied at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. He was responsible for the construction of camps for Norwegian refugees in Sweden during World War II and, following the war, the reconstruction of areas in Finnmark such as Vadsø and Kirkenes. The newly named firm designed several buildings in the Porsgrunn area using functionalist principles, including the Folkets hus just across from Børve's Vår Frue Church. The company still exists today under the same name, making it one of the longest-running architectural firms in Norway. Major works =Croftholmen= With the exception of Gunnar Knudsen's Borgestad School in 1889, the mansion on Croftholmen (now Croftholmen High School) in Stathelle was Børve's first major work under his new firm. The work was commissioned by Frederic Croft in 1890. Croft was a very wealthy Englishman whose father, William Croft, was a mine owner in Yorkshire who also had a high position in \\"The Norway Mining Timber Company\\" in Hull. Frederic Croft had trained in England as an engineer, but in 1870 he took one of his father's boats and sailed away to Norway, reportedly to forget a painful love story from back home. Croft also had a reputation of being a very eccentric figure. He was among the first people to own an automobile in the county, and one story involved him being ticketed for scaring the horses while driving through Porsgrunn. The policeman issued him a fine of twenty kroner, and Croft handed him forty kroner instead. When told again that the fine was only twenty kroner, Croft replied, \\"But I will also return home.\\" After considering several properties on which to build his estate, including on the island of Bjørkøya in Langesundfjord, Croft settled on the island Gjermundsholmen in Stathelle, for which he paid 10,000 kroner. Before Croft bought the island, Gjermundsholmen was densely forested and a popular location for vagrants, and it allegedly received its name from a man who was killed by vagrants there. Croft commissioned Børve to build the main house on the island in 1890. While digging the building's foundation, the workers found a human skeleton that they estimated could have been there for ten or fifteen years. The construction was led by master builder Sigurdsen from Skien and it took 25 builders until 1895 to complete. Since 1957 the building has been used as a school, first as a navigational school for sailors and now as a high school. The building has a distinctive Dragestil architectural style and is painted dark red, originally with a high-quality paint imported from England. It exhibits many features of the style, including eaves adorned with dragon heads and a roof with several decorative spires. The building has an area of and has two floors and a well-secured wine cellar. When Croft lived there the home was lavishly furnished, and some of the pieces of furniture can now be found on display at the Porsgrunn City Museum. The living room was furnished in the rococo style, while the smoking room had heavy brown leather chairs and the hall included some pieces of antique Elizabethan furniture. =Customs House= =Dalen Hotel= =Vår Frue Church= Vår Frue Church in Porsgrunn, built 1899 =Skotfoss Church= Skotfoss Church, built 1900 The initiative to build a church in Skotfoss was taken by Gustav Fangel Smidt, who managed the nearby Skotfoss Bruk paper mill. At the time, the townspeople of Skotfoss and Dalsbygda had to travel many miles west along the banks of Norsjø to Melum Church (Melum kirke) in order to attend mass. The founders of Union Co. (later the Norske Skog Union), who owned Skotfoss Bruk, agreed to donate 1,000 kroner each towards the construction of the new church, and the remaining 38,000 of the 42,000 kroner cost was split between wholesaler Thor Eger and Rittmester Heftye. The church's site, located on Sandåsen near the entrance to Løveid Canal, was donated by the board of directors of the Norsjø–Skien Canal. Haldor Børve designed the building, and planning and joinery work was completed by workers from Skotfoss Bruk. =Porsgrunn City Hall= Timeline of works Langangen Church, built 1891 Herre Church, built 1905 Strandlykkja Chapel, built 1915 Fjågesund Church, built 1916 =Churches= * 1883–6: Restoration of Ullensvang Church, Ullensvang * 1891: Langangen Church, Langangen * 1899: Vår Frue Church, Porsgrunn * 1899–1900: Skotfoss Church, Skotfoss * 1905: Herre Church, Bamble * 1906–7: Immanuel Church, Christopher Hvidts plass 6, Sandefjord * 1915: Strandlykkja Chapel, Stange * 1915: Kviteseid Church, Kviteseid * 1916: Fjågesund Church, Fjågesund * 1916–18: Sandefjord Methodist Church, Sandefjord =Businesses and public buildings= * 1889: Borgestad School, Skien * 1891: Customs House, Porsgrunn * 1891–92: Fredensborg Woman's Home, Porsgrunn * 1893: Meat inspection building, Sandefjord * 1894: Dalen Hotel, Dalen * 1895: Porsgrunn Swimming Hall, Porsgrunn * 1897: Gjerpen dairy, Gjerpen * 1899–1900: Sandefjord Middle School, Sandefjord * 1899–1901: Porsgrunn Dairy Company, Porsgrunn * 1900–1901: Porsgrunn Fire Station & Power Station, Porsgrunn * 1903–8: Sandefjord Retirement Home, Bjerggaten 38, Sandefjord * 1904–5: Porsgrunn City Hall, Porsgunn * 1905–6: Hans Cappelens Minne Orphanage, Skien * 1904: Dyrings Bookstore at Storgaten 154, Porsgrunn * 1907–9: Bratsberg County Hospital, Skien * 1908–12: Sandefjord Aktie- Kreditbanken Bank, Rådhusgaten 11, Sandefjord * 1911: Porsgrunn Lutheran Hospital, Porsgrunn * 1912: Årlifoss Power Plant, Notodden * 1915: Hardanger Folk High School, Ullensvang * 1915-20: County Hospital for Aust-Agder, Arendal * 1918: Haukerød School, Sandefjord * 1922: Holt Agricultural School, Tvedestrand * 1923: Foldsæ Agricultural School, Fyresdal =Residences= * 1890–1895: Croftholmen mansion, Stathelle * 1891: Børve's personal villa, Aallsgate 13, Porsgrunn * 1891: Aallsgate 15, Porsgrunn * 1891: Farmhouse on Helleland farm, Ullensvang * 1894: Hjertnespromenaden 3, Sandefjord * 1896: Holengården villa, Jernbanegaten 6, Porsgrunn * 1906: J.C.

In his long career, Vaughan was a dancer, choreographer, actor and singer whose work had been seen in London, Paris, and in New York, both on- and off-Broadway,David Vaughan at the Internet Off- Broadway Database as well as in regional theatres across the United States, in cabarets, on television and on film.\\"David Vaughan\\" on TCM.com Vaughan's ballet choreography was used in Stanley Kubrick's 1955 film Killer's Kiss, danced by Kubrick's wife at the time, ballerina Ruth Sobotka.\\"Killer's Kiss: Full Credits\\" on TCM.com\\"Killer's Kiss: Full Credits\\" on AllRovi.com He has worked with both modern dance and ballet companies.\\"Administration/Staff: David Vaughan\\" on the Merce Cunningham Dance Company website Life and career Vaughan was born in London, to Albert, who was the secretary of the British Linoleum Manufacturers’ Association, and Ada Rose (née Starks). He studied at Oxford, but did not begin dance training until he was 23 years old. At the age of 26, in 1950, Vaughan came to the New York City from London on a scholarship to study at the School of American Ballet, where he first met Merce Cunningham, who briefly taught there. Vaughan began studying with Cunningham in the mid-1950s, and became the company's paid secretary when Cunningham opened his own studio, after which he served in various staff capacities with Cunningham. He began to collect dance artifacts in the late 1950s, leading to an interest in collecting documentation to make a chronology of Cunningham's works. This resulted in his being formally made the company's archivist in 1976,Sobsey, Adam (January 7, 2011)\\"Interview: Cunningham Archivist David Vaughan\\" The Thread, Duke Performances, Duke University assisted by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.Burke, Siobhan (October 27, 2017) \\"Beloved Dance Historian, Writer and Archivist David Vaughan Has Passed Away\\" Dance Magazine He was the first in-house archivist for an American dance company. He held this position until the disbanding of the Merce Cunningham Company in 2012, after Cunningham's death in 2009. The Cunningham archive was then donated to the dance collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. At Cunningham's suggestion, Vaughan coordinated the Cunningham Company's 1964 six-month world tour to Europe and Asia, with composer John Cage serving as music director, and artist Robert Rauschenberg as resident designer and stage manager, a tour which greatly enhanced the company's reputation in the dance world. In 1988, after The Rockettes hired their first black dancer, Vaughan wrote an opinion piece for The New York Timess criticizing major ballet companies for falling behind other types of cultural organizations in giving artists of color regular opportunities to perform because of long-held ideas about the need for uniformity among dancers on stage. He observed that, “ballet technique has always accommodated itself to human bodies in all their variety.” Both Vaughan and Cunningham took part in the Westbeth Oral History Project of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, since the Merce Cunningham Dance Company's studio was located in the complex.

A single engine monoplane with a crew of two, the 80 GR set an absolute record for flight over a closed circuit in April 1931, covering 8,960 km (5,569 mi). Modifications led to a new designation as the Bernard 81 GR but no more records were set despite several attempts. Design and development In 1929 France regained the world straight line and closed circuit distance records with the Breguet 19 TR Point d'Interrogation. Both non-stop flights in this open cockpit aircraft covered about 8,000 km (5,000 mi) and it was obvious that longer flights would require better crew protection. Albert Claquot, the French air minister, therefore announced a prize of one million francs for the prototype of an aircraft that could fly for 10,000 km (6,215 mi) against a 35 km/h (22 mph) head wind. Three manufacturers responded, resulting in the Blériot 110, the Dewoitine 33 Trait d'Union and the Bernard 80 GR L'Oiseau Tango. Tango referred both to the orange colour of the aircraft and to an earlier Bernard aircraft named L'Oiseau Tango, the Bernard 18 GR. The GR designation used by both Bernard designs and by other long range French aircraft stood for Grand Raid or extreme long distance flight. The last of the three to fly, the Bernard was flown for the first time on 27 November 1930 by Antoine Paillard. The Bernard 80 was a monoplane with a cantilever wing of high aspect ratio (8.6). The wing planform was straight tapered with elliptical tips. Five fuel tanks on each side provided a total capacity of 7,000 L (1,540 Imp gal, 1,850 US gal). Differential ailerons were fitted. The wing was a single piece wooden structure with two spars and plywood ribs, plywood skinned with canvas covering. It thickened continuously towards the centre where its depth increased rapidly to form part of the fuselage. This centre section contained four parallel steel tubes which joined the front and rear fuselage sections to it. An oval internal opening, 0.7 m (28 in) high and 0.45 m (17 in) wide, gave access from the nose to the rear. The nose section contained the V-12 Hispano- Suiza 12Nb engine, which produced 462 kW (620 hp) at 2,000 rpm and drove a two blade propeller. A chin radiator was mounted below the fuselage firewall, with a long, prominent fairing behind it. The engine mountings were extended rearwards beyond the pilot's cabin to join the steel tubes in the wings. The cabin, fitted with dual controls, was accessed via glazed triangular doors, which provided sufficient sideways vision for cruising flight. A hatch, provided with a small windscreen was used for take-offs and landings by raising the pilot's seat. The navigator sat alongside the pilot on a drop seat. His space, 2 m (79 in) long and 1 m (39 in) wide, had side and roof windows for sightings. Internally, the rear part of the fuselage, mounted on the other end of the wing's four steel tubes, provided a space for the crew to rest during a long flight. The aerodynamically clean, tapered, elliptical rear section was built around four longerons, with a plywood skin and outer fabric sheath. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin and rudder together were roughly elliptical. The fixed, tailwheel undercarriage had split axles hinged to the bottom of the fuselage, with the wheels and main legs enclosed in narrow, wide chord fairings. After the successful record flight of March 1931 described below, the aircraft returned to the factory at Bourget to be modified for further record attempts. The wing area was increased by a 2 m (79 in) span extension, the wheel fairings were refined and, most noticeably, the chin radiator was removed and replaced with ones in the wing leading edges. The engine was replaced by a similar but geared down version, the Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr, driving a three blade propeller, which was later replaced by one with four blades. Post-modification, the aircraft was re-designated as the Bernard 81 GR. It first flew in this form in August 1931, named the Antoine Paillard in memory of its first pilot who had died suddenly under surgery for appendicitis two months before. Later it was renamed the L'Oiseau Canari II, recalling the earlier record breaking Bernard 191 L'Oiseau Canari. Operational history In response to several fatal crashes the French government had imposed restrictions on the long range flights from France required by attempts on the straight-line distance record. Bernard therefore concentrated on the closed circuit record, which at the time of the 80 GR's first flight was held by the Italians Umberto Madalena and Fausto Cecconi. They had flown 8,188 km (5,089 mi) in a Savoia-Marchetti S.64. The 80 GR was taken to Oran in Algeria, then part of Metropolitan France, in February 1931. In a first attempt, flying a 15 km (9.3 mi) for over 50 hours, Paillard and Louis Mailloux (Professor of Navigation at the École d'Aéronautique de Versailles) covered 8,168 km (5.076 mi). Higher than expected fuel consumption was blamed on the fixed pitch Chauvière propeller, so this was replaced by a variable pitch Ratier. Whilst this was being done, a new record of 8,822 km (5,483 mi) was set on 1 March by Maurice Rossi and Lucien Bossoutrop in the Blériot 110. On 30 March the Bernard took off again, piloted this time by Jean Marmoz and Paillard, to set a new record of 8,960 km (5,569 mi) in a time of 52 h 44 min. They landed on 2 April with fuel still available, brought down by loss of coolant; during the last part of the flight, they pumped champagne, eau de Vittel and coffee into the radiator. The record was short lived, for on 10 June 1931 Doret and Le Brix flew the Dewoitine 33 a distance of 10,371 km (6,446 mi). After completing the transformation into the 81 GR in August, planning began for an attempt on the straight line record with a flight from Oran to South America, which would also win a one million franc prize. The attempt was blocked by the unwillingness of the French authorities to grant clearance, partly in response to the recent Dewoitine 33 crash. Instead, there was an attempt to regain the closed circuit record. On 29 December the 81 GR, carrying 8,500 L (1,870 Imp gal, 2,245 USgal) of fuel and piloted by Marmoz, attempted to take off. After a deliberately after a long run the tail lifted and the large propeller hit the ground, the undercarriage collapsed and the 81 GR slid on its belly, fortunately without catching fire. Marmoz and Mailloux escaped with a few bruises. After its repair the 81 GR made a second and final attempt to regain the record. Even during take-off from Istres on 18 October 1932, Marmoz noticed the aileron controls were slack, the ailerons themselves vibrated and there were large oscillations of the wings, with amplitude as much as 1 m. He dumped most of the fuel and returned, landing safely. It turned out that the wing oscillations were excited by a very stiff undercarriage suspension that transmitted ground forces into the wings, the motion of which damaged the aileron control runs. Almost a year later, the ban on long range flights lifted by a new administration, an attempt on the straight line record was made at last. By this time the record was held by Rossi and Codos in the Blériot 110 at 9,104 km (5,658 mi). L'Oiseau Canari II left Oran on 4 October 1933, crewed by Jean Assolant and René Lefèvre, hoping to reach Saigon. After 24 hours they realized that the engine was consuming 10 L of fuel per hour more than expected, an excess of about 0.6% . This put the record just out of reach: the FAI stipulation that the old record had to be beaten by 100 km (62 mi) left them an estimated 200 km (124 mi) short. They therefore landed in Karachi, having flown 6,600 km (4,100 mi) in 27 hours. An inaccurate rev counter may have been partly to blame for the over-consumption. The L'Oiseau Canari II was later re-engined with a 670 kW (900 hp) two row radial Gnome-Rhône 14Kfs engine, perhaps because Hispano-Suiza reclaimed their loaned engined. It was designated 84 GR but never flew. There was also a proposed bomber project, the unbuilt, Hispano powered 81 Bn3, which led to the Bernard 82 and its own variants.

Life and career  Poettering was born in Guatemala City but grew up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Hamburg, Germany. Poettering has worked for Red Hat since at least 2008. Since 2003, Poettering has worked on more than 40 projects, mostly written in C. He is the developer and maintainer of several free software projects which have been widely adopted by Linux distributions, including PulseAudio (2004), Avahi (2005), and systemd (2010).  Controversies  Poettering is known for having controversial technical and architectural positions regarding the Linux ecosystem. His style has brought accusations that he is working against long- standing Unix philosophy, which he addressed in his blog post The Biggest Myths. For instance, Poettering has advocated speeding up Linux development at the expense of breaking compatibility with POSIX and other Unix-like operating systems such as the BSDs. He took this position because of his experience in writing some other low-level components in the desktop stack. He invites other developers to do the same. Poettering recommends also reading The Linux Programming Interface but ignoring the POSIX-specific parts. In 2011 Poettering, one of the main developers of PulseAudio, praised the Windows and macOS audio stacks as \\"more advanced\\" and called OSS \\"a simplistic 90's style audio stack\\" without relevance for a modern desktop. Also in 2011, when asked why the Linux desktop hadn't been widely adopted by mainstream users, he answered that: \\"Linux is still too fragmented...[and] needs to be streamlined...\\". In 2014 Poettering published an essay criticising how software in Linux distros is commonly packaged, updated, and deployed; and laid out proposals that he, Kay Sievers, Harald Hoyer, Daniel Mack, Tom Gundersen and David Herrmann, had for how the architecture should be changed.Revisiting How We Put Together Linux Systems on 0pointer.net by Lennart Poettering \\"The classic Linux distribution scheme is frequently not what end users want, either. Many users are used to app markets like Android, Windows or iOS/Mac have. Markets are a platform that doesn't package, build or maintain software like distributions do, but simply allows users to quickly find and download the software they need, with the app vendor responsible for keeping the app updated, secured, and all that on the vendor's release cycle.\\" (01 September 2014) The controversy around systemd culminated in personal attacks and alleged death threats against Poettering. In October 2014 Poettering complained that the \\"Open Source community is full of assholes, and I probably more than most others am one of their most favourite targets.\\" Poettering went on to put some blame on Linus Torvalds and other kernel developers for being bad role models for encouraging an abusive discussion culture on technical disagreements. Lennart Poettering at 16th Fórum Internacional de Software Livre, on 10 July 2015 In 2017, Poettering received the Pwnie Award for Lamest Vendor Response.

Life  George Marischka was born into the world of film because his father was Hubert Marischka and Ernst Marischka was his uncle. In 1949 he worked for Gustav Ucicky as associate director. One year later he contributed to the screen play of Die Sünderin (The Sinner). Eventually in 1951 he was credited as director for the first time. Afterwards he directed three films starring the Austrian star O. W. Fischer who at that time was very popular in German-speaking countries. This included 1955's Hanussen. Due to his reputation to be an expert concerning Karl May, he got involved in Karl May movies in the 1960s. When he had written the screenplay for Legacy of the Incas he decided to direct and produce it himself. Since the film was less successful than other Karl May movies, he consequently then concentrated on his career as an actor. Georg Marischka appeared in many films including international productions like the feature films The Odessa File and The Boys from Brazil.

They were involved in the U.S. Civil War battles of Bull Run, the Peninsula, Manassas, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg in Virginia from 1862 to 1864. New Hampshire Army National Guardsmen in 1940 During World War II the New Hampshire Army National Guardsmen fought in the European and Pacific theaters. One of the elements of the 197th Field Artillery received the Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation dated October 17, 1944, to July 4, 1945, being part of the forces that liberated the Philippines from the Japanese imperial forces. The 195th Infantry, as an Infantry Combat Team, was allocated to the NH ARNG after the war. The regimental insignia was originally approved on 30 October 1953. It was redesignated for the 941st Armored Field Artillery Battalion, New Hampshire National Guard on 7 February 1956. The insignia was rescinded on 8 April 1963. It was reinstated and redesignated for the 195th Regiment, New Hampshire Army National Guard, with the description and symbolism revised on 20 June 1997.

Amongst other achievements in cave exploration, he set the record for the deepest cave dive in Great Britain and Ireland at a depth of . Biography =Career= Kozłowski came to Ireland from Poznań, in Poland, in 2006 and worked as a quantity surveyor. His projects included the Aviva Stadium and Heuston Square developments in Dublin. He would later play an important role in compiling maps for Galway County Council and the National Roads Authority for the design and development of the N18 road (Now the M18 motorway). =Introduction to cave diving= When he moved to Ireland, Kozłowski was a qualified diver, with 13 warm open water dives under his belt. Shortly after his arrival he became interested in underwater cave exploration, and began learning cave diving with the Welsh cave diving instructor Martyn Farr in 2007. He began diving in the Hell Complex, part of the Green Holes group of underwater sea caves off Doolin, County Clare and initially used the area as a training ground for his newly acquired skills. He soon began exploring and mapping undiscovered passage, and by July 2007 he had made his first significant breakthrough, making the first traverse between Hell's Kitchen and Robertson's Cave in the nearby Reef Complex. =Exploration= Kozłowski was responsible for many extensions to cave systems in both Ireland and Spain, the most notable being the extension to the Marble Arch Caves system. In 2009 and 2010 diving connections were made to nearby cave systems by Kozłowski, firstly to Prod's Pot – Cascades Rising, doubling the total length of the system from 4.5 to , and subsequently to newly established Monastir Sink – Upper Cradle system, extending the wider system further to . The discoveries make this the longest cave in Northern Ireland. In 2008 he set the record for the deepest cave dive in Great Britain and Ireland at a depth of in Pollatoomary, near Killavally, County Mayo, Ireland. Perhaps his most notable achievement was the exploration of over of underwater passage in the notoriously unforgiving cave passages of the Gort region, including the discovery and exploration of Pollindre, 1 km in length and the third deepest sump in Great Britain and Ireland at . In March 2011 Kozłowski received the Kolosy award for cave exploration at the annual Polish travelling and outdoor sports conference, held in Gdynia. Writing and public speaking Kozłowski was a passionate advocate of exploration and diving; his blog recounted in detail his underwater adventures. His latest discoveries filled the pages of the journal Irish Speleology and Descent magazine. He was also an engaging public speaker; his January 2011 talk at NUIG/GMIT Sub Aqua Club was well received. Death and legacy Kozłowski died during a cave dive in the Gort lowlands on 5 September 2011. His body was successfully recovered on 10 September 2011 after an extensive recovery effort over several days by a team including Rick Stanton and John Volanthen. The cave in which he died is called Pollonora 10, in the townland of Kiltartan, Gort, County Galway, Ireland, and his body was found at the then known limits of the cave, at a depth of and approximately from the entrance. On 15 September, Kozłowski was buried in the nearby cemetery after a service at St Attracta's church, attended by gardaí, divers and members of the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation, friends, family and members of the local community. In August 2012, in recognition of his contribution to Irish speleology, the Speleological Union of Ireland set up the Kozłowski Fund to support original cave exploration in Ireland. In 2013, a fundraising page was set up in order to pay for a headstone for Kozłowski 's grave in Kiltartan, and for a plaque to be erected at the entrance to Pollonora 10. The plaque and headstone were engraved by a Gort-based stonemason and on 6 September 2014, marking the third anniversary of Kozłowski's death, the gravestone and plaque were unveiled to a gathering of friends and family.

Since its opening in 1951, it was the busiest commuter rail line and busiest TCDD service in Turkey, until it was discontinued in 2013. Electrified in 1969, the line was the second electrified commuter rail service in Turkey, after the Istanbul suburban, operating across the Bosphorus. The route traversed the southern shore of Istanbul's Asian side, passing through important districts: Kadıköy, Maltepe, Kartal, Pendik and Tuzla. The line then crosses into the Kocaeli Province into Gebze, where it terminates. The State Railways has operated its regional service to Adapazarı and mainline service to Ankara on the line as well, making it one of the busiest rail lines in Turkey, in terms of passengers and number of trains. History A railway to Gebze was originally built by the Ottoman Empire in 1873, as part of the railway to İzmit. This line was at first built for the Sultan, but later served the heavy population along the northeastern shores of the Sea of Marmara. However, few trains ran on the line during the time when the government operated it. The Ottoman government soon sold the line to a private enterprise, the Anatolian Railway (CFOA). The CFOA started regular train service between İstanbul and İzmit (as well as Gebze) in the 1890s.CFOA History – trainsofturkey.com Service was suspended from 1914 to 1919 during the First World War. After the Republic of Turkey was formed in 1923, the CFOA continued to operate commuter service until 1927, when the Turkish State Railways acquired the CFOA. The newly formed State Railways (TCDD) continued the commuter service formerly provided by the CFOA. After World War II, new locomotives and railcars were delivered to Turkey and used on the line. In 1962, new E8000 EMUs were ordered as part of TCDD's plans to upgrade the line. In the following years, the tracks were doubled and electrified, and the stations were all renovated. Beginning in late 1968, these EMUs started test runs on the line. On 29 May 1969 increased commuter service with the new EMUs began operation.Ergin Tonuk – Haydarpaşa tecrübe seferleri In 1971, new E40000 electric locomotives started to operate on the line. In 1972, E14000 EMUs were introduced, and the E40000 were put on regional service between İstanbul and Adapazarı. The route however deteriorated for the next three decades and during the mid-2000s, the EMUs were in bad shape and the tracks were in need of repair. In 2003, the Marmaray project started construction of a tunnel underneath the Bosphorus, as well as the upgrade to this line. Plans were finalized, and the line was first partially closed between Gebze and Pendik, with the whole line closed as of 19 June 2013 for at least 2 years. The planned reopening in June 2015 was delayed until March 2019 when the line went back into service despite protests from the unions that final tests had not yet been completed.Gebze – Halkalı banliyö hattı ne zaman açılacak – www.sozcu.com.tr Gallery File:Haydarpaşa Terminus And Pier.jpgStarting point of the line: Haydarpaşa Terminus File:Haydarpaşa banliyösünde eski bir tren seti.JPGA westbound train at Kızıltoprak station.

The colony of South Australia had just gone through a financial crisis during which Stephen and his brother John Barton Hack lost their considerable fortunes. Unlike his brother, whose various business ventures never amounted to much, Stephen was able to attain a modest level of affluence. Wilton studied at J. L.

The Toronto Tornados played in the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons and started off the 1985–86 season in Toronto before declining attendance prompted Stepien to move the team to Pensacola mid-season. At the time, the CBA comprised fourteen teams. The newly relocated Tornados' first home game, on January 3, 1986 against the Florida Suncoast Stingers, drew 3,611 to the Pensacola Civic Center, and averaged 1,651 per game for the year. In fact, on January 25, 1986, the Tornados drew 8,417 in a win against the Detroit Spirits, at that time the second-largest crowd to ever attend a CBA contest. Guard Billy Goodwin was the only CBA player to finish in the Top-10 in both scoring and assists that season. Ronnie Williams, a power forward, averaged 23.3 points per game. Despite all this, the Tornados suffered through a 15-33 season. During the off-season, Stepien moved the team to Jacksonville, Florida and renamed them the Jets. It was a turbulent off-season in general in 1986, as the CBA shrunk to twelve teams. This franchise would move three more times before folding in 1996. 1986–1987 season The Bay State Bombardiers moved to Pensacola to become the second version of the Tornados. This version began in 1978 as the Harrisburg Hammerheads, then the Maine Lumberjacks, on to Bay State before arriving in Pensacola. The team was purchased and moved to Pensacola by the major investors, Pensacola businessman Roger MacDonald and trial attorney Bob Crongeyer as well as Eli Jacobsen of Columbus, Ohio. Other investors included Pensacolians Joe Mooney, Frank Adams, Vince Whibbs and McGuire Martin. With new Director of Basketball Operations Tim Sise and new head coach Gary Youmans, the Tornados showed signs of life led by Tommy Davis and former New York Knicks 7'-1\\" veteran center Marvin Webster who led the team in rebounds. The team finished with a 20-28 record and made the playoffs for the first time. Webster was signed by the NBA Milwaukee Bucks before the season ended when he was replaced by Center Jerome Henderson who led the Tornados in rebounding for the rest of the season. Henderson would later receive a 10-day call-up to the Atlanta Hawks. In the playoffs the Tornados were eliminated four games to one by the Rapid City Thrillers. 1987–1988 season Power forward Norris Coleman, 6'-8\\", 210 lbs., signed with the Tornados after playing one year with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. Coleman was selected in the second-round of the 1987 NBA draft (38th overall) by the Clippers after being named to the Big-8 All-Conference team while at Kansas State. Other key players were rookie guard Mark Wade, Tommy Davis, NBA veteran Freeman Williams, forward Bill Nelson and Jerome Henderson. By the end of the season, the Tornados were tearing up their opponents and would return the team to the playoffs with a 28-26 record. In the playoffs, Pensacola crushed the original Tornados franchise, the Mississippi Jets, now located in Biloxi, Mississippi, in a 4-1 run, but were swept by the Albany Patroons, coached by Phil Jackson, in four straight semifinal games. After the 1987–1988 season General Manager Tim Sise and head coach Gary Youmans left the Tornados to work with a new expansion team in Columbus, Ohio, that would become the Columbus Horizon. 1988–1989 season A slow start hurt the Tornados, but by the end of January new head coach Joe Mullaney, formerly of Providence College, pulled his club up from the Eastern Division cellar into fourth place in the standings. Newly acquired 6'5\\", 190 lb. guard Brook Steppe averaged 25.7 points per game and earned a 10-day call-up to the Portland Trail Blazers. Point guard Mark Wade, who helped pace the Tornados in the 1987–88 season, broke the CBA record for most assists in a season (626). Even though the Tornados earned another playoff berth after finishing 30-24, they were knocked out of the playoffs by the Tulsa Fast Breakers – but not before giving Tulsa at least one loss in the Breakers' eventual playoff championship run. Pensacola trial lawyer Bob Crongeyer and Eli Jacobson remained as the Tornados sole owners and Crongeyer was President of the team. 1989–1990 season In the 1989–1990 season, the Tornados enjoyed what was to become a team-record 32 games against 24 losses under head coach Joe Mullaney. Four players would receive NBA promotions: small forward Jim Farmer, guard and Pensacola native Clifford Lett, forward Bob McCann, and guard Mark Wade. Lett was named CBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 21 points a game. He was signed in March 1990 by the Chicago Bulls to a 10-day contract, and then to a second in April. Wade was a first-team CNA All-League selection. Tony Dawson, older brother of Dallas Mavericks forward Jerry Stackhouse, led the team with 25.9 points per game. After a strong first-round playoff series victory over the Grand Rapids Hoops two games to one, the Tornados lost another playoff run to the Albany Patroons three games to two in the best-of-five series. Tom and Jane McMillan of Brewton, Alabama, purchased the team from Bob Crongeyer and Eli Jacobsen midway during the 1989–90 season. 1990–1991 season The franchise played one more year in Pensacola, garnered a 27-29 record and barely missed the playoffs on the final day of the regular season. Still, the Tornados led all CBA franchises in NBA call-ups that season, as Tony Dawson, Jim Farmer and Clifford Lett spent time in both the NBA and CBA. Missouri guard Adam Dawe joined team. Mark Wade led the CBA in assists (10.8 per game) once again. In March, 1991, team officials were looking at Knoxville, Tennessee, for possible relocation, but instead moved the team to Birmingham, Alabama, after the 1990–91 season, becoming the Birmingham Bandits. The franchise would later relocate to Rochester, Minnesota, where they became the Rochester Renegade, and one more time after that before folding in 1995.

From 1859 to 1890 steamboat transportation between lower river ports in Missouri up to the head of navigation at Fort Benton, Montana Territory, was the common mode by which passengers and freight got to and from the mining camps and ranches of central and western Montana.History, Upper Missouri Breaks National Monument Occasionally the land form is called La Barge Rock, an alternative spelling of Captain LaBarge's name. Geology The pillar is fine grained alkalik igneous rocks, formed of dark minerals. Historically, the pillar was formed as an \\"intrusion\\" during the Paleogene to late Cretaceous geologic period (about 66 million years ago). At that time, the source rock material was heated to a fluid state deep in the earth and then it was injected by force upward into overlaying sedimentary \\"country rock\\" of white sandstone and shale. At the time of the intrusion both the hot molten rock and the recipient sedimentary rock were buried deep below the surface of the earth.Geology of the Missouri Breaks National Monument As the molten liquid igneous rock (often referred to as \\"magma\\") was forced upward and outward into the sedimentary rock, it displaced and cracked the surrounding rock structures. After intrusion the molten liquid rock cooled and hardened. Where the molten rock liquid filled in horizontally between rock layers, it formed sills; when it filled in vertical cracks it formed dikes; where the intrusion formed a blunt bullet shaped plug this was called a stock. The material forming LaBarge Rock was injected in the form of a stock. Over geologic time crustal movement brought these injected igneous rocks to the surface of the earth. The darker, denser igneous material of the injected rock is more resistant to erosion and weathering than the surrounding softer white sandstone and shale, so the harder igneous rock weathered out into distinctive land forms. The LaBarge Rock stock weathered out into the pillar shaped land form seen today. In this area of the Missouri Breaks, along the Missouri River there were other intrusive emplacements which have weathered out from the surrounding white sandstone/shale formations, forming promontory features of dikes and sills, and stock. Along the river these features include LaBarge Rock, as well as Dark Butte, Citadel Rock, Grand Natural Wall, Pilot Rock and Steamboat Rock. The background of white sandstone/shale cliffs run along this stretch of the Missouri River for miles. North of the river, some of the natural features formed from intrusive rock are Eagle Buttes, Birdtail Butte and Chimney Rock. Height The top of the pillar is at an elevation of 2647 feet.Topo Quest LaBarge RockMountain Zone, LaBarge Rock The top of the rock is at a height of 150 feet above the level of the river. History LaBarge Rock (dark pillar against white sandstone, extreme right of photo) as seen from Eagle Creek camping area, site of Lewis and Clark camp on May 31, 1805 In their outward bound leg of the voyage of exploration, Lewis and Clark camped opposite LaBarge Rock on May 31, 1805, at the mouth of Eagle CreekMissouri Breaks River Co. page, describing facts of float trips (No evaluation or endorsement of this supplier of services is intended)Spokane Canoe and Kayak Club, Floating the Upper Missouri, by Nancy Anderson This area, across the river from LaBarge Rock, is now a campground for boaters floating the Missouri, and is referred to as Eagle Creek campground or sometimes as LaBarge campground. Missouri River White Cliffs Boaters in the White Cliffs section of Missouri River in the Missouri Breaks (LaBarge Rock not pictured)LaBarge Rock is part of the White Cliffs (aka White Canyon or White Rocks) region of the Missouri, along with other natural features and cultural sites in this area. It is named for the extensive cliffs of white sandstone/shale that appear on both banks of the river for long stretches. This section of the river is within the remote and isolated Missouri Breaks. Because of the White Cliffs' arresting appearance which received recent exposure from Stephen Ambrose's book on the Lewis and Clark's Expedition, \\"Undaunted Courage\\",Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West, Stephen Ambrose, Copyright: Ambrose Tubbs, Inc, 1996, Published Touchstone, 1997. there have been growing numbers wishing to float this portion of the Missouri from Coal Banks Landing (BLM Mile 41) to Judith Landing (BLM Mile 88).Missouri Breaks River Co. page, describing facts of float trips. (No evaluation or endrosement of this supplier of services is intended) Art Karl Bodmer (1809–1893) was a Swiss painter who accompanied German explorer Prince Maximilian from 1832 through 1834 on his Missouri River expedition in the then remote regions of the American west. He recorded images of Indian tribes and noteworthy sites. In August 1833 he made pencil drawings and water colors of LaBarge Rock which later became incorporated into Tableau 41 and Tableau 34.Karl Bodmer's Illustrations to Prince Maximillian of Wied-Neuwied's Travels in the Interior of North America 1832-34 Published in Association with the Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, Nebraska, Tableau 41 Karl Bodmer's Illustrations to Prince Maximillian of Wied-Neuwied's Travels in the Interior of North America 1832-34 Published in Association with the Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, Nebraska, Tableau 34 Tableau 41 focuses on LaBarge Rock, and is entitled \\"View of the Stone Walls on the Upper Missouri\\". Click on the preceding reference to view a photo of this artwork. LaBarge Rock is directly across the river from the mouth of Eagle Creek. Thomas Hart Benton painted 'Lewis and Clark at Eagle Creek' in his unique style in 1967, but the angle of view of this painting is such that it does not depict LaBarge Rock, focusing instead on another view from Eagle Creek of the spectacle of the White Cliffs running along the river.Thomas Hart Benton 'Lewis and Clark at Eagle Creek' 1967, The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, Indianapolis, Indiana Click on the preceding footnote to see a photo of this Benton painting. LaBarge Rock would be just out of the left edge of the painting. LaBarge Rock is not easily accessible, as it exists along the Missouri River in the remote area of Montana known as the Missouri Breaks. Nevertheless, its appearance is so dramatic that it is often photographed by the people who float the river. An internet Google search of images for \\"LaBarge Rock\\" will reward the searcher with a variety of photographic views of the land form. Commentary Clay S. Jenkinson an American humanities Rhodes scholar, Danforth Scholar, and author had this impression on visiting LaBarge Rock. :\\"Yesterday morning, we floated past the exact spot where Maximilian’s colleague, the Swiss watercolorist Karl Bodmer, painted what one historian has called “the most spectacular vista of the voyage.” It’s the image of the Stone Gates, off in the distance upriver, with a romantic castellated white bluff in the right foreground and a brown columnar monolith called La Barge on the left bank in the middle distance. (You can Google it). I turned just enough in my canoe to take a handful of photographs without tipping over. :It was thrilling, beyond thrilling, to have gazed at that painting a hundred times over the years, to have written about it, and now to have camped literally IN the painting. And then, the morning after, to have turned around as we drifted down the Missouri River in canoes and to have seen precisely what Bodmer saw 177 years ago. The landscape is essentially unchanged. Think of that. That’s one reason they call Montana the last best place.\\"The Bismark Tribute, \\"Drifting Down the Missouri River with Karl Bodmer\\" July 31, 2010, by Clay Jenkinson, Theodore Roosevelt Center scholar at Dickinson State University, Distinguished Scholar of the Humanities at Bismarck State College More succinctly the author of \\"A Float Down the White Cliffs Section of the Missouri River, July, 2002\\" described the LaBarge Rock area: :\\"...outrageous...awesome...\\"A Float Down the White Cliffs Section of the Missouri River, July, 2002 Location The site of LaBarge Rock is not easy to visit. It is in the White Cliffs section of the Missouri River. Back from each side of the river are sharply eroded badlands, part of the Missouri Breaks, that are so rough that roads through the breaks down to the river (and thus to specific sites along the river) are primitive and thinly distributed across a large area. However, opposite the site of LaBarge Rock, there is a campground that exists for boaters floating the river (referred to as Eagle Creek Campground or sometimes LaBarge Campground) that can be reached from the north and east bank by primitive dirt road, but this road crosses private land and access over that private land may be restricted. The most common way to visit the White Cliffs area, including LaBarge Rock is to float this section of the Missouri River. The White Cliffs section of the river may be boated in one long day trip, from Coal Banks Landing (BLM mile-mark 41) to Judith Landing (BLM mile-mark 88) if a motorized boat is utilized,Missouri Breaks River Company, describing one of their offered guided river trips (No evaluation or endrosement of this supplier of services is intended) or during a more relaxed float-and-paddle river expedition lasting several days. This float trip has become increasingly popular in recent years. LaBarge Rock may be climbed even by those who do not have technical rock climbing skills by taking gullies at the river's edge that lead up and around the side of the pillar to side away from the river, at which place there is reportedly enough erosion of the pillar that the top may be gained with some acceptable difficulty in climbing.

His works include the first modern dictionary of Jurchen (1984), various books about the Manchu people, and editions of the poetry of his great-great-grandfather Aisin-Gioro Yihui (1799–1838) and his wife Gu Taiqing. Life Jin was born in Beijing, China in 1918. His father, Jin Guangping (1899–1966), was a sixth-generation descendant of the Qianlong Emperor's fifth son, Yongqi (Prince Rong). Both his father and his second daughter, Aisin-Gioro Ulhicun, are also renowned scholars of Manchu and Jurchen. His eldest daughter, Jin Shi 金適 (Aisin-Gioro Hualiyasun), who is a professor at China Agricultural University in Beijing, has also engaged in research into Jurchen. Jin Guangping entered Peking University to study Chinese Literature in 1939, but the following year went to Japan to study at Tokyo University, where he studied Jin dynasty history under Mikami Tsugio 三上次男 (1907–1987) and Mongolian and Qing Dynasty history under Wada Sei 和田清 (1890–1963). He graduated in 1944, and returned to China where he worked as a teacher at various Beijing middle schools for fourteen years. In 1958 he joined the staff of the newly founded Inner Mongolia University, where he remained for the next twenty-five years, eventually reaching the position of professor. His main area of research and teaching was Mongolian history, but he also carried out research into the Jurchen and Manchu languages. In 1983 he took up a post as director of the Liaoning Minorities Research Institute in Shenyang. During this period he founded and edited two journals, Manchu Studies 满族研究 and Reference Materials for Manchu Studies 满族研究参考资料. Jin retired in 1989, and lived in Beijing until his death of natural causes in 2004. Jurchen studies Jin and his father, Jin Guangping, collaborated on a study of the Jurchen language and script, which was first published in 1964, and a revised edition published in 1980. His major contribution to Jurchen studies was a Jurchen-Chinese dictionary that was published in 1984. This was the first modern dictionary of Jurchen, and remained the only dictionary of Jurchen until 2003 when an expanded Jurchen dictionary compiled by Jin and his daughter, Aisin-Gioro Ulhicun, was published in Japan.

Popularly known as zaptiehs (from Ottoman Turkish for \\"policeman\\", and the designation used for the force that the CMP replaced), this body numbered about 700 men, organised in both mounted and foot units. The force's personnel were predominantly drawn from the minority Turkish Cypriot population, although prior to 1914 about a third were Greek Cypriots. The eight most senior officer positions were normally filled by secondment from the British Army. While trained to undertake some police duties, the force had an essentially military character.David Anderson and David Killingray, Policing and Decolonisation, Politics, Nationalism and the Police 1917-65, Mounted zaptiehs, armed with carbines and sabres, were portrayed in contemporary illustrations patrolling rural roads in twos. A detachment of mounted zaptiehs participated in Queen Victoria's Jubilee celebrations of 1897, where their fezzes and blue and scarlet zouave-style jackets attracted much attention.Illustrated London News, June 26, 1897 By 1907 the zouave uniforms had been replaced by khaki drill for ordinary duties, although the fezzes were retained.

The monastery site is about 22 kilometres north-east of Metz, in the valley of the little River Canner, and was classed as a monument historique on 28 March 1905.  History  In 1134or possibly 1130 Heinrich von Spanheim, abbot of Morimond Abbey, founded Villers-Bettnach Abbey on land given for the purpose by Simon I, Duke of Lorraine; Heinrich himself was the first abbot, holding the position together with that at Morimond. The community flourished, and monks from Villers-Bettnach later settled a number of daughter houses: Viktring Abbey in Carinthia (1142);which in its turn was the mother house of Landstrass Abbey, now Kostanjevica in Slovenia Eusserthal Abbey in the Palatinate (1148); Wörschweiler Abbey in Wörschweiler, now a part of Homburg (1171); Zagreb Abbey (1257 or 1274; but note that Janauschek ascribes the foundation of Zagreb to Topusko Abbey, and others to Viktring Abbey); and Pontifroy Abbey in Metz (1323). Cambron Abbey in Belgium is occasionally claimed as a daughter house of Villers-Bettnach, but this seems doubtful. Among other properties Villers-Bettnach owned a grange with salt pans in Marsal and townhouses in Metz and Sierck-les-Bains. In 1552 the monastery was laid waste. Between 1724 and 1729 a new church was built. The French Revolution caused the dissolution of the monastery in 1790, and the abbey buildings and site were turned over to agricultural uses. Those buildings that survived were later acquired by the town of Boulay-Moselle (Bolchen), which built a convalescent home there. The site is now looked after by the Association des Amis des Sites de St-Hubert.  Buildings and site  The cloister was sited to the north of the church. The monumental gateway arch of the 17th century (the Portail Coislin) survives, as do numerous remains of the 13th century church, a vaulted hall church of six bays with a transept and a polygonal apse, and a Chapel of St. Catherine with biforia windows, which stands over a building of the 12th century. Another survival is the 17th century Peasants' Chapel (; ), which is now used as a parish church. The conventual buildings were somewhere to the left of the church.

The protesters later broke into a police station and stole weapons, resulting in police using tear gas in an attempt to protect themselves. The demonstrators eventually broke through the security wall and entered the offices of the embassy. Six members of the embassy staff, who had been in a \\"safe room\\", were evacuated from the site by Egyptian commandos, following the personal intervention of United States President Barack Obama. Following the attack, the Israeli deputy ambassador remained in Cairo; 85 staff members and their families returned to Israel. The Egyptian army declared a state of alert.  Background  On 15 May 2011, Egyptian protesters waved Palestinian flags in front of the Israeli embassy in Giza as they burned a makeshift Israeli flag. During 2011, relations between Israel and Egypt deteriorated after the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, reaching their lowest point since peace was established between the nations by the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. The Israeli-Egyptian border became a region of conflict and instability due to increased militant activity in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, and anti-Israeli sentiment was expressed in protests by masses of Egyptians in the streets of Giza. On 18 August 2011, a squad of militants crossed the border from the Sinai Peninsula into southern Israel, killing eight Israelis. The ensuing Israeli counter-terrorist operations in close proximity to the border resulted in the deaths of \\"at least three\\" Egyptian soldiers. The soldiers' deaths by Israeli fire ignited protests at the Israeli Embassy in Giza. During a demonstration on 20 August 2011, an Egyptian protester climbed 20 feet up the building's facade to remove the Israeli flag. The Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces considered recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv. Eventually, Israel publicly apologized for the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers. Egypt stated that Israel's apology was \\"insufficient.\\"  The attack  On 9 September 2011, hundreds of Egyptian protesters began gathering outside of the Israeli embassy. Around 6:30 p.m. local time, they began to assault a concrete security perimeter wall with hammers and a battering ram. Egyptian authorities had erected the wall following intense protests in August. = Building infiltration = At 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning, several thousand protesters breached the security wall. By 1:00 a.m. they had entered the lobby and proceeded through the rest of the building. The demonstrators ransacked the embassy, located on the 20th and 21st floors of the building, and threw items including documents, some marked \\"confidential\\", from the windows of the building to the crowded street below. The documents were quickly scanned and publicly commented on. Israel later revealed that the remaining Israeli security staff had been separated from the rioters only by the steel door of a safe room in which they had taken refuge. In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and various other senior Israeli officials watched the events unfold from a direct feed from the surveillance cameras installed in the embassy. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor estimated that about 3,000 protesters were involved in destroying the security wall. An Israeli diplomat condemned the attack as a \\"serious violation\\" of diplomatic behavior. Immediately after the protesters had infiltrated the embassy, United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta received a call from Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak asking for help. The United States assisted in assuring the protection of the Israeli embassy personnel. Prime Minister Netanyahu later emphasized that he \\"would like to thank the US President Barack Obama for his help\\" in securing the lives of the Israeli embassy staff. = Rescue of embassy staff and end of the riots= Six Israeli security staff who were on the premises hid inside a reinforced safe room. Egyptian commando forces entered the embassy building and rescued the six Israeli guards. All other embassy staff and their family members were escorted to Cairo International Airport. At 2:40 a.m., the Israeli ambassador and approximately 85 other Israeli diplomats and their family members arrived at the airport and were flown out of Egypt. Only the deputy Israeli ambassador remained in Egypt, staying at the United States embassy. A senior Egyptian security official stated that the Egyptian commandos had been sent to the embassy after Israeli Ambassador Itzhak Levanon spoke on the phone with an anonymous member of Egypt's ruling military council, and asked him to arrange the safe evacuation of the embassy staff. The demonstration and ransacking of the embassy building continued into the early morning hours as the protesters burned tires and set several police cars on fire. The Egyptian police eventually suppressed the riots and dispersed the thousands of rioters by using tear gas and firing warning shots into the air. Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Mossad director Efraim Halevy praised the actions of American president Obama in helping with the evacuation.  Aftermath  Following the attack on the embassy, the Egyptian army heightened the state of alert in the country and reinstated martial law, otherwise known as State of Emergency, on a temporary basis. On the morning of Saturday, 10 September, Egypt's ruling military council rejected resignation requests that had been submitted by Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf and several Egyptian ministers. Their request was made because of the failure to handle the disturbances. One day after the attacks on the embassy, a group of reporters were attacked by a crowd of people still lingering near the scene of the riots. A reporter and producer were knocked to the ground and trampled, but managed to get to a vehicle in which they retreated, with protesters throwing stones at them. They were able to flee the area without sustaining any major injuries. =Arrests= In August 2012, an Egyptian court convicted 76 Egyptians who were linked to the attack on the Israeli embassy. 75 of those convicted received suspended one-year sentences, and one Egyptian, Omar Afifi who had fled abroad, who was tried in absentia was given a five-year prison term. Eight charges were listed by the court, including \\"an assault against diplomatic missions\\" and \\"sabotage\\".  Official reactions  ;Involved parties * : Following the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Giza, Information Minister Osama Heikal stated that Egypt is still committed to all of the international treaties to which it is a signatory, and added that Egypt is also committed to the safety of all foreign diplomats residing in the country. In addition, Heikal stated that measures would be taken to ensure no further disturbances would occur. * : During a televised press conference conducted on the evening of 10 September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the need to maintain Israel's strategic relations with Egypt, which is crucial to the region's stability. In addition, he thanked the Egyptian commando unit for preventing a disaster. Netanyahu also stated that the peace agreement with Egypt will be maintained in spite of the violent protests. ; International * : Foreign Minister Sheik Khalid ibn Ahmad Al Khalifah condemned the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Giza. The minister said that \\"the failure to defend the embassy building is a blatant violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\\" * : Prime Minister Stephen Harper released a statement that said, \\"Our government strongly condemns the attack on the embassy of Israel in Egypt\\". * : Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle released a statement in which he condemned the attack on the Israeli embassy. In addition, the statement said that he expects \\"the Egyptian authorities to provide for the security of the embassy in accordance with international obligations. Any further escalation of the situation must be avoided.\\" * : Deputy head of the Majlis Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy Esmail Kowsari said that members of the Iranian parliament had expressed full support for the \\"ransacking\\" of the Israeli embassy in Cairo. * : Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the attacks on the Israeli embassy, stating that Egypt is responsible for protecting diplomatic property. \\"I strongly condemn the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. We have urged the Egyptian authorities to meet their responsibilities under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic property and personnel, including the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. They have reassured us that they take these very seriously.\\" * : In a statement to the press, the White House said that President Barack Obama expressed his great concern about the situation at the embassy and the security of the Israelis serving there.

She was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019.  Education  Glimcher graduated from the Winsor School, an all-girls private school in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1968. In 1972, she graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College and graduated cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1976. Work She joined the board of directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1997 and retired from the board in 2017. Her research laboratory received funding from Merck & Co for a project focused on developing new therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis in 2008. From 1991 to 2011, Glimcher was the Irene Heinz Given Professor of Immunology at the Harvard School of Public Health, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.official p. at Harvard Clinically, she is a specialist in osteoporosis. From 2012 to 2016, Glimcher served as the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medical College and the Cornell University Provost for Medical Affairs. In February 2016, Laurie Glimcher was named the next president and CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Glimcher was considered for the position for the Dean of Harvard Medical School but turned the position down in order to become the president of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. At Dana-Farber, Glimcher is collaborating on research which strives to find methods of combatting cancer from within the human immune system. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is an institution that is affiliated with Harvard, as it currently is one of its teaching hospitals. Glimcher, who was the first female dean of any medical school in New York state, became the first female to lead the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Research Glimcher's research has focused on the immune system; she is known for early work with T cell differentiation, her discovery that Schnurri-3 regulates osteoblasts which led to a collaboration with Merck & Co., and her discovery of the role played by XBP-1 in lipogenesis and the unfolded protein response. Glimcher's role helped discover Schnurri-3 (Shn3 for short) is a large zinc finger protein distantly related to Drosophila. Shn is a potent and essential regulator of adult bone formation. Her research has had implications for understanding asthma, HIV, inflammatory bowel disease, and osteoporosis, and around 2016, on cancer immunotherapy. Glimcher became interested in immunology during her first year of medical school at Harvard. There she took interest dysregulation in autoimmune diseases and, in her fourth year at Harvard, discovered the protein known as Nk1.1(see natural killer T cell), which soon became widely recognized across the field of immunology. For this discovery, Glimcher became the first woman to receive the Soma Weiss Award, an honor her father had received 26 years earlier. During this time, Glimcher worked with mentor Bill Paul, who strongly encouraged her to continue her research independently after completing medical school. During her second year of residency, Glimcher realized why she felt so drawn to this area of research. “What always fascinated me was not so much treating patients with disease, but figuring out why they had the disease,” says Glimcher. Glimcher currently heads her own lab for research in immunology. She has been interested in studying the ties between ER stress system in neurons and immune function and neuro-degeneration.

My Days With Errol Flynn: The Autobiography of Stuntman Buster Wiles, Roundtable Pub, 1988, / 0-915677-36-9, 1988 is an autobiography of Vernon “Buster” Wiles that focuses predominantly on the times he spent with actor Errol Flynn in Hollywood during the late 1930s and 1940s. The book, which was first published in 1988, was co-written by Wiles and professional writer William Donati. Both men were lifelong advocates of Flynn and his legacy, taking time to denounce the actor’s critics in person and in print. Wiles and Donati were especially critical of the controversial author and “celebrity biographer” Charles Higham, and My Days With Errol Flynn contains a section devoted to destroying Higham’s allegations against Flynn.“Charles Higham”, obituary, archives of The Daily Telegraph (London, England), May 7, 2012.  Synopsis  Buster Wiles was a stuntman and screen double during this period, working on a number of Flynn’s most popular films, such as The Charge Of The Light Brigade (1936). In his book Wiles recounts numerous escapades he had with Flynn during Hollywood’s “Golden Age”, and he provides behind-the-scenes insight into the productions he made with the legendary actor. One of those scenes is an iconic one in American film history and also involves Howard Hill, who by the late 1930s was widely regarded as “The World’s Greatest Archer”. Wiles in the book explains how the famous “splitting-the-arrow” scene in Flynn’s “swashbucker” The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) was accomplished.The splitting-the-arrow scene can be viewed in an extended excerpt from The Adventures of Robin Hood available on YouTube. “Scene from The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938 BluRay)” posted on YouTube by heckofjob, August 19, 2010.

My Wicked, Wicked Ways. Heinemann, 1960 Similarly, Wiles makes no mention of many of Flynn's other pals including his housemate David Niven, an omission that Niven reciprocates in his own extremely amusing books The Moon's a BalloonNiven, David.

Puttnam Press, 1975 The book also contains a number of unique pictures of Flynn's residence on Mulholland Drive shortly before its unfortunate demolition in the late 1980s.  Reviews  The book was positively reviewed and a paperback edition remains in print. It is popular with Flynn aficionados still and provides insight into the Star System for anyone interested in the Golden Age Of Hollywood.  Buster Wiles  Vernon \\"Buster\\" Wiles was born in Missouri, raised in Tennessee, and worked in Hollywood as a stuntman and double for some twenty years. Prior to this, Buster had a semi itinerant lifestyle and worked as a newsboy, boxer and a caddy prior to his success in Hollywood. He was a lifelong sports fan, especially enjoying football and boxing. Leaving the movie business in the late 1950s, Buster settled in Beaverton, Oregon, with his wife and two daughters. He became a jockeys' agent. He worked the horse-racing tracks of the West Coast of the United States every racing season. Having met when working on several of Flynn's vehicles, Buster and Errol Flynn became firm friends during the latter's time in Hollywood. Wiles was born in 1910 and died in 1990, shortly after his co-writer William Donati, who had died in July 1989.

Shafer, Katrina Law, and Jesse Corti. The film premiered March 19, 2005, at the Other Venice Film Festival and was released under the title Disturbance on DVD by MTI Home Video in October 2006. Plot Hud Masters (Paul Sloan) is released from prison to hunt down a viral-like alien race. He is taken to an agency, where he is partnered with Logan (Colleen Porch) to undergo such a mission. Together they fight their way through a horde of alien infestation in the city, until they reach the leader (Hayley Dumond). Meanwhile, Masters is desperately trying to keep himself from reverting to his violent ways.

The roles of \\"Leader\\" and \\"Coroner\\" were originally to be played by men, but were instead played by actresses Haley Dumond and Katrina Law. Critical response JoBlo felt that director Vallelonga created a project that was a \\"colorful, stylishly shot, tightly paced and overall vibrant effort\\", and that film editor David Risotto was to be commended for his work contributing to \\"the free flowing feel of the film.\\" The also praised the film score created by Harry Manfredini, referring to it as \\"exciting and pulse pounding.\\" Toward the acting, they felt that Paul Sloan was \\"magnetic and convincing in his somewhat dual roles\\", that Colleen Porch gave \\"impeccable delivery and hit emotional levels that went beyond what was on the page\\", that Hayley DuMond gave the proper \\"intensity, focus and menace\\" for her role. They also offered that the director in his own role of Frank Russo, gave \\"a grounded and stellar show\\". They also observed as a critique that Robert R. Shafer performance got on one's nerves, but that might have been the intent for his character. After their overall positive review, wherein they addressed storyline and pacing, and made note that the film's fight scenes could have been better choreographed, they concluded that the film \\"was a glossy, steamily sexy, clipped paced, competently acted and ingeniously written mish-mash of horror, action and Sci-Fi\\". Conversely, DVD Reviews wrote that Disturbance had the potential to be either a \\"small gem\\" or a \\"schlocky retread\\", and offered that while its \\"Arresting visuals and a better-than- average cast\\" helped to raise this film \\"above most of the trash that sits at the bottom of the bargain bin at the local video store\\", the film \\"too often becomes immersed in triteness to stand its own ground\\", and that despite the film's originalities, it was \\"pretty standard stuff\\" that offers too many genre clichés. In further criticism, they felt that the film's action was substandard, the fight choreography weak, and certain scenes were \\"ruined by pretentious visual manipulation\\". They offered that Disturbance \\"is a good- looking movie\\", but that its visual prowess could not hide the fact of the film's low budget. They conceded that use of color and shadow \\"are utilized strikingly\\" and \\"make for good eye candy, even if they are not overly endowed with thespian qualities\\", and offered that Paul Sloan has \\"a magnetic presence onscreen\\" and Hayley DuMond delivers \\"an impressive emotional scene toward the end,\\" and summarize that \\"As far as low-budget indies go, this could have been far worse.\\" They also felt that while director Vallelonga was \\"aiming for the spirit of old Roger Corman films,\\" he missed using \\"Corman's witty sense of dark humor\\", and that even with the film having successful moments, it \\"doesn't rise above its direct-to-video status.\\" They conclude \\"What is ultimately most disturbing about this film is how bland it turns out to be in spite of its visual splendor and appealing performers.\\" Film Critics United wrote that the film title Disturbance made more sense than the original title of Choker, as the original title seemed to have nothing to do with the film's plot. They addressed the uniqueness of the alien protagonists in that they \\"don’t seem to be all that ambitious in that they don’t have any particular designs on world domination or anything and just want the occasional body to inhabit and suck the life out of.\\" They also note that while Nick Vallelonga is \\"a better actor than film director\\", who has been acting and making movies for well over twenty years with marginal success\\", as a filmmaker he \\"refuses to quit.\\" They further note that Disturbance having small budget microscopic budget did not prevent the director's efforts to \\"bring a little extra to the table\\", and that while the \\"story is bit derivative\\", it is assisted by the work of actor Paul Sloan and the director's choice of supporting cast. It was concluded that this \\"wasn't an awful film and it even had a certain amount of charm\\". And though it was \\"a bit rough around the edges and often had trouble rising above its low budget roots\\", the creative efforts were obvious. On his review website PollyStaffle.com, filmmaker Chad Clinton Freeman wrote that for a low-budget film, Disturbance \\"isn’t a perfect film, but it’s pretty damn good.\\" He offered that the film works on a number of levels, in that the film has \\"great audio and visuals\\", a sense of \\"film noir\\", and a music score that is \\"perfect\\". He noted that the film did not have a clear cut hero and did not fit into any one specific genre or subgenre, but works as these were intentional choices made by director Vallelonga. He felt that was unique about the film was that while it had many possible main characters, it worked as an ensemble. He made special note of the director's \\"use of imagery and his subtle references to other films.\\" Release The film screened at various film festivals in 2005 before being picked up by MTI Home Video for release in 2006, when it was released on DVD in the United States under the title Disturbance and in the United Kingdom as B.E.I.N.G..

She practiced mainly in Toronto, living and working with her husband, painter and teacher Peter Haworth. She was a member of the Canadian Group of Painters with Yvonne McKague Housser, Isabel McLaughlin and members of the Group of Seven. Biography =Education and training= Haworth was born in Queenston, South Africa. She studied at the Royal College of Art in London, England under Professor William Rothenstein, Dora Billington, and Eric Gill, specializing in ceramics. She received her degree of A.R.C.A. from the University of London, England. She immigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1923. =Private life= Haworth lived a comfortable life in the fashionable upscale district of Rosedale in Toronto. Her and Peter's residence was a mecca for artists holding formal meetings and small exhibitions. =Career and official commissions= From 1913 - 1968 she worked as a painter in watercolour, oils, and later in acrylic. She also used standard clay for her pottery works. The majority of her works are signed \\"B. Cogill Haworth\\" or \\"Bobs Cogill Haworth\\". Haworth preferred landscape themes and waterscape themes but also ventured practice in non-objective paintings, some on a very large scale. Most of her paintings post-1950 were created on masonite and often signed on the front and verso; often with an artist's paper label. In 1936, Bobs Haworth was one of the founding members of the Canadian Guild of Potters along with Nunzia D'Angel and Robert Montgomery. Howarth was the first honorary president. Both Peter and Bobs Haworth made illustrations for Kingdom of the Saguenay (1936) by Marius Barbeau. The Haworths also collaborated on illustrating James Edward Le Rossignol's The Habitant Merchant (1939). =Exhibitions= Haworth was a regular and prolific exhibitor with such institutions as the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (RCA), Ontario Society of Artists (OSA), Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour (CSPWC), Canadian Group of Painters (CGP) among other formal and informal art groups and organizations. =Death and legacy= Haworth died peacefully at her home in Toronto. At her bequest, she left her entire art archives and remainder of her art works to Queen's University.

He incorrectly interpreted that phrase as the Sioux word for victory, or exultation and suggested it as a cheer for the University rugby team. A co-captain added the \\"mah\\" to make it rhyme with \\"rah\\" and created \\"Ski-U-Mah!\\" The slogan has been used to cheer on the Minnesota Golden Gophers athletics teams, and was written into the lyrics of University songs including the \\"Minnesota Rouser\\", \\"Go Gopher Victory\\", \\"Minnesota Fight\\" and \\"Minnesota March\\". Dakota–Lakota specialists state that the word \\"Ski-U\\" or \\"Ski-yoo\\" or \\"Ski-oo\\" are not Sioux victory cries or the Sioux word for winning. What Adams heard on Lake Pepin, \\"sky-yoo,\\" may have just been an interjection, similar to \\"woo hoo.\\" Other Dakota-Lakota words or phrases that have been suggested for what Adams heard include: * \\"Scheeh\\" or \\"scheen-shay\\" which means \\"Try Hard\\" * \\"Schkee ooh poh!\\" or \\"Scheee ooh!\\" meaning \\"Try hard, come on!\\" * \\"Oh-hee-yah\\" which means \\"To win\\" * \\"Oh-hee-un- yum\\" or \\"oh-hee-oohn-yum\\" which means \\"We won\\" The slogan has had other uses at the university through the years. In the mid-20th century, Ski-U-Mah was a University of Minnesota humor magazine. It is currently used on the football team's helmets and jerseys,http://www.uni-watch.com/2012/01/28/minnesota- gopher-jersey-collector-shawn-kennedy0128/ as the name of a meeting room at the McNamara Alumni Center, a campus tailgate lot/parking lot near TCF Bank Stadium, and as the title of a yearbook-style publication put out by the Minnesota Daily. Ski U Mah is said to refer to the name of a Prohibition-era speakeasy near the campus. Ski Yu Mah Lounge, where players and the local cultural elite gathered after games. The Gopher football team was at its most prominent during the Prohibition era and the use of the phrase in the school rouser is said to be a holdover in commemoration of that era.

Life Jin was a sixth generation descendant of the Qianlong Emperor's fifth son, Yongqi (Prince Rong). In 1911, shortly before the fall of the Qing dynasty, he inherited a ducal title, feng'en zhenguo gong (奉恩鎮國公), from the Prince Rong peerage. After the Republic of China was established, he changed his family name from \\"Aisin Gioro\\" to \\"Jin\\" (\\"Jin\\" means \\"gold\\" in Mandarin, just like \\"Aisin\\" in Manchu). His son, Jin Qizong, and granddaughter, Aisin-Gioro Ulhicun, are both renowned scholars of Manchu and Jurchen. Jin died in 1966, during the Cultural Revolution. Khitan and Jurchen studies Jin was a pioneer in the research on the Khitan large and small scripts and the Jurchen script. During the 1920s and 1930s a number of memorial inscriptions in unknown scripts had been discovered, but it was not clear what the relationship between these scripts was, and how the newly discovered scripts corresponded to the \\"large\\" and \\"small\\" Khitan and \\"large\\" and \\"small\\" Jurchen scripts that were mentioned in the histories of the Liao and Jin dynasties. In 1957 Jin determined that the memorial inscriptions for Emperor Xingzong of Liao and his consort, and of Emperor Daozong of Liao and his consort, were written in a phonetic script influenced by the Old Uyghur alphabet, whereas the memorial of Xiao Xiaozhong which had been discovered in 1951 was written in a logographic script based on Chinese characters. He identified the former script as the Large Khitan script and the latter script as the Small Khitan script, an identification that is now widely accepted. In 1962 Jin further identified the script used in the Sino-Jurchen Vocabulary of the Bureau of Interpreters (Nǚzhēn Yìyǔ 女真譯語) and on a number of Jin Dynasty monuments as the \\"large\\" Jurchen script. He also collaborated with his son, Jin Qizong, on a comprehensive study of the Jurchen script which was published in 1964.

The attack occurred on 2 September 2011 in Mogadishu, Somalia, while Noramfaizul was reporting for Bernama TV on a humanitarian mission organised by the Islamic charity Kelab Putera 1Malaysia. An AMISOM investigation later concluded that he was accidentally killed by one of its peacekeepers while travelling in a Malaysian convoy. Background Prior to joining Bernama TV, Noramfaizul had worked for the National Film of Malaysia, and later Metrovision as a camera operator. While at National Film, he was assigned an aerial photography task and declined to do the job when other camera operators volunteered. The plane ended up crashing and killed the pilot and two cameramen. He then left Filem Negara for Metrovision. Noramfaizul worked for Bernama as a camera operator since 2002. Bernama is the Malaysia's national news agency and is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He worked for Bernama TV when it began as a separate service in 2008. Following his death, Noramfaizul is survived by his wife and two sons.  Incident  In September 2011, Islamic charity Kelab Putera 1Malaysia, also known as Putera 1Malaysia Club, mobilised humanitarian efforts to assist people in the coastal Benadir region of Somalia impacted by the 2011 East Africa drought. Noramfaizul Mohd Nor, a journalist and camera operator with Bernama, Malaysia's national news agency, was assigned to report on these efforts. At the time of the incident, Noramfaizul was travelling with other journalists, back to their base at the airport. While stopped at the busy Kilometer Four intersection in the capital city of Mogadishu, Noramfaizul was fatally injured when he was shot by a high-caliber bullet, fired by an unknown sniper. Aji Saregar Mazlan, a camera operator for TV3, was sitting to the left of Noramfaizul in the vehicle and was injured in the same incident. The team had been scheduled to travel home on the following weekend. Investigation A senior African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) official told the press that \\"there was a shooting today involving AMISOM, in which a journalist was killed, but the details are not clear at present of how it happened.\\"Malaysian journalist killed in Somali capital The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia's Interior and National Security Minister, Abdisamad Maallin Mohamud, similarly indicated that \\"this (shooting) didn't come from the government ... didn't come from Al-Shabaab (Islamist group).\\" He also pledged to investigate the incident and submit a detailed report of the findings to the Malaysian authorities. Additionally, the Committee to Protect Journalists urged AMISOM to assure the safety of civilians working in Somalia. The AU indicated that it was in the process of investigating the incident in conjunction with the Somali government, and that \\"appropriate action will be taken against any soldiers found to have acted improperly.\\" AMISOM's investigation concluded that four of its peacekeepers from Burundi were implicated in the shooting. The internal board of enquiry proposed that the soldiers should be returned to their home country for military and judicial trial. At the committee's recommendation, the soldiers were also suspended. Impact Noramfaizul was the first Malaysian journalist to die in a conflict zone. He had previously covered other humanitarian missions to Gaza and Pakistan. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) listed Noramfaizul as the 35th journalist confirmed killed while reporting in Somalia since 1992, while it noted that two reporters operating during that period were still unconfirmed. According to the same source, the deadliest year for journalists working in the country was in 2009, when nine journalists were killed. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released a statement about Noramfaizul's death indicating that he had \\"join[ed] the long list of journalists killed in the course of their work in Somalia\\". The capital was at the time in the grips of an Islamist insurgency by the Al-Shabaab militant group. A spokesperson for the International Federation of Journalists also criticised employers for sending journalists to work under such potentially dangerous circumstances.Malaysian Cameraman’s Death Reinforces Need for Safety Protocols In response to controversy in Malaysia over Noramfaizul's death, the Human Resources Ministry of Malaysia announced it would work with media to develop guidelines for media personnel who work in high risk areas. Noramfaizul's death was cause for controversy in Malaysia because people questioned whether the Putera 1Malaysia Club had adequately warned the 55 people in the mission, which included volunteers, doctors, air force personnel and media workers, about the dangers and whether journalists were being adequately protected while reporting in such situations. Reactions =Press response= Datuk Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim, president of the Putera 1Malaysia Club, said, \\"His death will be recorded in the Bernama's annals as a selfless and heroic sacrifice of a true professional not only in the course of his duty but also in the genuine pursuit of humanitarian value.\\" Datuk Yong Soo Heong, editor- in-chief at Bernama, said, \\"This is a huge loss for Bernama because he was a committed person and never neglected his duty. He had always shown a high level of professionalism in his work.\\"\\"Noramfaizul a True Professional, Says Bernama chairman.\\" Bernama. =Passengers= Tan Su Lin, a journalist for Astro Awani was sitting in front of Noramfaizul on the front, right-hand corner of the four-wheel-drive vehicle. She remembered this about her colleague, \\"I always (emphasis from original) teased him and called him ketua darjah (class monitor) as he had a way of keeping everyone in line. I didn't expect it to end this way.\\" Also sitting in the front seat in the middle between the driver (left) and Tan (right) was TV journalist Khairulanuar Yahaya. He has so far said that he cannot believe his fellow worker at Bernama TV was killed. Melissa Ong, TV journalist from NTV7, sat in the same vehicle with Noramfaizul when he was shot. She was positioned in the back seat to the left of Aji (middle) and Noramfaizul (far right). Ong shared this about Noramfaizul, \\"Our last memory of him was the laughter we shared in the car before the short journey back to our hostel. I will always treasure that. I believe Abang Faizul would want us to continue our good work in Somalia and I would like to return to set up an IDP camp in his honour.\\" \\"Abang\\" is a respectful, affectionate term, which means \\"older brother.\\" =Public= Noramfaizul was given a hero's burial at Universiti Putra Malaysia's Muslim cemetery in Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia, which is outside of Kuala Lumpur. In Malaysia, a T-shirt was made as a memorial keepsake that read, \\"Noramfaizul anda wira kami,\\" which is translated, \\"Noramfaizul, you are our hero\\" with \\"Bernama TV\\" above the pocket area of the shirt. After incident Malacca Governor Tun Mohd Khalil Yaakob, during his 73rd birthday investiture ceremony, conferred on Normafaizul the posthumous Gallantry Star of Malacca (BGP). His spouse, Norazrina Jaafar, received the posthumous award on behalf of her late husband. She thanked the Government of Malacca, Malaysia, for recognising her husband as a \\"war hero\\". Noramfaizul Mohd Nor is the first recipient of the BGP award since it was created in 1978.

Wilkinson formerly played as a defender for the Gold Coast Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL), where he was one of the club's underage recruits, and played in Gold Coast's first season in 2011. Known as one of the best pound for pound athletes, he holds numerous records at the AFL combine, including the 20 metre sprint and repeat 30 metres sprint test. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals NFL team in February 2016 as a Cornerback. Early life Born in Sydney, Wilkinson is one of three children. He is of Nigerian descent through his father. At the age of four his family settled on the Gold Coast, Queensland and instantly began pursuing an interest in Athletics. Although excelling in athletics, Wilkinson also represented the Gold Coast in cricket, soccer and tennis. In 2008, he grew tired of the sports he had already tried and began playing Australian rules football for his school Palm Beach Currumbin High School, for the first time at 16 years of age. Although Palm Beach Currumbin High School was predominantly known for its rugby league program, Wilkinson elected to play Australian rules football. He studied Biomedical Science at Griffith University. Junior football Wilkinson signed up to play for the Broadbeach Australian Football Club's under 18 team in 2009 and was chosen to represent the Gold Coast Stingrays in state competition later that year. He began playing senior football for Broadbeach in 2010 and in just his fourth game earned a nomination for the AFLQ Rising Star Award. He was also named state captain of the under 18 Queensland Scorpions squad that competed in the 2010 AFL Under 18 National Championships. At the conclusion of the 2010 season, Wilkinson was drafted as a Queensland zone selection by his hometown Gold Coast Suns who were entering the professional Australian Football League in 2011. AFL career Wilkinson made his professional debut for the Gold Coast Suns in round 14 of the 2011 AFL season, against the Western Bulldogs. In his second game in the AFL he kicked his first goal while playing against Fremantle at Subiaco Oval. During his debut in 2011, Wilkinson was racially abused by Western Bulldogs player Justin Sherman.Suns rookie Joel Wilkinson shaken by Western Bulldog Justin Shermans racial slur – couriermail.com.au.

During Wilkinson's AFL career he traveled to Arizona on three separate occasions from 2011-13 for off-season training and was a standout in the high altitude drills. He was delisted by the Gold Coast Suns at the conclusion of the 2013 AFL season and was signed by the semi-professional Northern Blues for the 2014 VFL season in an attempt to be redrafted into the AFL. In May 2018, Wilkinson made a formal complaint against the AFL in the Australian Human Rights Commission, with Wilkinson alleging that he was subjected to discrimination, vilification and harassment on both racial, sexual and religious grounds by AFL staff, the Gold Coast Suns, club officials and teammates, as well as opposition players and spectators during his AFL career. In June 2020, Wilkinson revealed that he removed himself from the legal proceedings towards the end of 2019, as he was being pushed into settlement with a non-disclosure agreement; Wilkinson felt it was an unjust process and that he needed to protect the truth.

Plants Adiantum pedatum showing the extent of the two enlarged basal pinnae, and the extent of the basiscopic and acroscopic pinnules of one of those pinnae. Historically, certain of the maidenhair ferns, such as Adiantum pedatum, have been described as having a pedate leaf architecture, with a forked rachis which bears subdivided pinnae along the outer edge of its two outward- and backward- curving branches. However, a forking (dichotomizing) rachis is not characteristic of any other members of the Polypodiaceae. A more accurate description of such leaves was put forth by Margaret Slosson in 1906, and improved upon by Herb Wagner in the 1950s. Slosson and Wagner showed that, in fact, the central one of the apparent \\"pinnae\\" contains the rachis of the blade; the \\"pinnules\\" adorning it are the medial and terminal pinnae. The two basal pinnae not only form the \\"pinnae\\" flanking the first \\"pinna\\" (containing the rachis), but their basal basiscopic pinnules are enlarged into another set of apparent \\"pinnae\\". In a sufficiently large specimen, the basal basiscopic segments of these are also so enlarged into another set, and so forth. Within the genus, this architecture is shared by A. aleuticum, A. patens, A. pedatum, A. viridimontanum, and sometimes A. hispidulum.

History Big Bear Elementary School is the first and oldest school in the Bear Valley. The school was called Big Bear School and it served students from K-12th grades. Later in 1948, the growth of the population made Big Bear build its first high school, which is now Big Bear Middle School. As the years passed, the population kept rising dramatically due to the new ski resort [Snow Summit], which was created in 1954, and many new tourist attractions. As a result of this, Big Bear built a newer high school in the Sugarloaf community of Big Bear. The old Big Bear High School was changed to Big Bear Middle School. Big Bear Middle school was at first attended by 6-8 graders.

It is named after the Rhine and the Westphalian Hellweg. History  In 1988 the first regular interval regional rapid train service was established from Dortmund via Essen, Duisburg and Düsseldorf to Cologne. This operated hourly on the Cologne–Duisburg and Dortmund–Duisburg lines, which even then were the most important railway lines for passenger traffic in North Rhine-Westphalia. With the introduction of high-speed regional services in the early 1990s, this line was named the NRW-Express (originally numbered RSB 1; from 1995 it was redesignated as Stadt-Express line SE 1) and ran from Bielefeld via Hamm, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, Düsseldorf and Cologne to Aachen. With the extension of the service on the Hamm–Bielefeld and Cologne–Aachen lines, the service soon had insufficient capacity. Therefore, in May 1998 with the NRW- wide implementation of regional express lines, the NRW-Express (now RE 1) was supplemented by the Westfalen-Express (RE 6) from Bielefeld via Hamm, Dortmund, Essen and Duisburg to Düsseldorf so that on the northern section there were two Regional-Expresses per hour. =Timetable change in 2002= After the timetable change in December 2002, services on the central Ruhr axis between Hamm and Düsseldorf increased to five Regional-Express services in each two hour period. The NRW-Express was now shortened to run on the Hamm–Aachen route, the Westfalen-Express (RE 6) was established between Düsseldorf and Minden. The new Rhein-Hellweg-Express (RE 11) was introduced at two hourly intervals, running from Düsseldorf to Hamm and continuing on the line to Paderborn. =Timetable change in 2010= When the timetable change in December 2010 there was an exchange of sections between the NRW-Express, the Rhein-Hellweg Express and Rhein-Haard-Express (RE 2): *The section of the Rhein-Hellweg-Express from Hamm via Soest and Lippstadt to Paderborn was taken over by the NRW-Express; this section continues to be operated only every two hours. *The section of the Rhein-Hellweg Express between Duisburg and Düsseldorf (now operated hourly) was taken over by the Rhein-Haard-Express. In return, the Rhein-Hellweg Express runs (now also hourly) on the section between Duisburg and Mönchengladbach. The Duisburg–Mönchengladbach line is for the first time connected directly to the eastern Ruhr region by Regional- Express services. Overall, there were further bottlenecks due to the timetable change. In the central Ruhr area between Hamm and Duisburg, three regional express lines (RE 1, RE 6 and RE 11) were now running at approximately 20-minute intervals. The Hamm–Dortmund section was reinforced by RE 3, the Bochum–Essen section by RE 16 and the Essen–Duisburg section by RE 2. =Timetable change in 2016= In the course of the development of the Rhein- Ruhr-Express (RRX, an upgraded Regional-Express system) network, the Rhein- Hellweg-Express returned to its original route between Düsseldorf and Paderborn and was extended to Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe at the timetable change on 11 December 2016. The section between Hamm and Kassel, however is only operated generally at two-hour intervals and some trains even in the afternoon peak terminate in Paderborn. Due to some remaining IC/ICE services on the line, there are unsatisfactory gaps in the regional services of up to four hours in both directions, especially at lunch time. Departure times also differ significantly, so the timetable is difficult for customers to remember since there are no regular services. In the evenings, the RE 11 service from Düsseldorf ends in Dortmund. At the other end, some services only run from Kassel to Hamm, so passengers are forced to change trains regularly to reach the Ruhr area or Düsseldorf. Due to longer scheduled stays in Duisburg and Dortmund, the travel time of regional services between Paderborn and Düsseldorf has increased by up to ten minutes compared to the previous operation by RE 1. The use of the class 425 sets has significantly reduced the capacity of seating and standing places. The number of daily circuits serving the entire route has been reduced from eight to seven. The section of Eurobahn's daily Dortmund-Kassel-Sprinter service from Hamm was integrated in RE 11. The section of the RE 11 from Duisburg via Krefeld to Mönchengladbach that is no longer served by the RE 11 was replaced by the RE 42 (Niers-Haard- Express), which was upgraded from the RB 42 and extended from Münster via Essen, Mülheim, Duisburg and Krefeld to Mönchengladbach. Route The Rhein- Hellweg Express runs daily every hour (every two hours between Hamm and Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe) and uses five railway lines: *The Kassel–Warburg railway (built by the Frederick William Northern Railway of the Electorate of Hesse) throughout, which is also used by other regional and long-distance services, *The Hamm–Warburg railway (built by the Cologne-Minden-Thuringian Connection Railway Company until its bankruptcy and completed by the Royal Westphalian Railway Company) throughout, which is also used by other regional and long- distance services, *The Dortmund–Hamm railway (built by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company), which is also used by three other Regional-Express services and long-distance trains, *the Ruhr line from Dortmund to Duisburg (built by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company), using the long-distance tracks, which is also used by regional and long-distance trains, *The Cologne–Duisburg railway (built by the Cologne-Minden Railway Company) from Duisburg to Düsseldorf. The Rhein-Hellweg-Express uses the so-called local tracks or the S-Bahn tracks, as does the Rhein-Haard-Express (RE 2), the Rhein-Emscher- Express (RE 3), the Rhein-Weser-Express (RE 6), the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19) and, in some sections, the S-Bahn. Only the NRW-Express (RE 1) and the Rhein-Express (RE 5) use the long-distance tracks. Operations RE 11 services runs hourly from Monday to Sunday. Initially, when the service operated between Hamm and Paderborn on weekdays at two hourly intervals, trains were composed of class 110 and 111 locomotives, usually hauling five Silberling carriages. But it was soon noticed that the number of passengers required higher capacity, which meant that class 112 (sometimes class 111) locomotives are now used with four double-decker carriages. The carriages have air conditioning and are approved for a maximum speed of . The service has an average speed of . Since 21 February 2011, in addition to the double-decker trains, class 425 electric multiple units are used on the Rhein-Hellweg Express, these had previously been modernised for use on this service. Double- deck trains remain operating on the line until the completion of the conversion of the class 425 EMUs. Operator  Abellio Rail NRW took over operations on the line from 9 December 2018. This subsidiary of Nederlandse Spoorwegen won the contract for the operation of the NRW-Express as Lot 1 of the Rhein-Ruhr-Express. The line was formerly operated by DB Regio NRW under a special contract with the North Rhine-Westphalian public transport associations. DB Regio NRW had the contract to operate the line until the timetable change on 13 December 2015. The contract included provisions for services every two hours between Hamm and Paderborn; this section became part of the RE 1 at the timetable change in December 2010, committing operations on this line to run permanently with a sixth double-deck coach. As part of the so-called RRX interim contract, operations from December 2016 until the commissioning of RRX rolling stock were provided by DB Regio.

They were not entitled to any training, or able to be considered for any government job. As for single women, of which there were many during the era, they could request to be placed into employment under the authority of a guardian. On their wedding day, married women transitioned from living under the authority of their fathers to under that of their husbands During the reign of Magnus VI Lagabøter (1263–1280), the age of majority was set at twenty years for both sexes. Norwegian law changed later, during the reign of Christian V (1670–1699). His regime issued the Law in Norway (1687) which, following the Danish rules of that time, defined unmarried women as minor. However, in 1845, a first step towards women's emancipation was taken with the \\"Law on the vast majority for single women\\", for which the age of majority was recognized at age 25, without a requirement for submitting to a guardian after that age. In this first part of the century, women worked in the early textile mills (1840) and in the tobacco factories which were reserved for their employment. They also worked in the food industries and jobs requiring \\"little hands\\", but they did not work in heavy industry. The literature marketed to women of the time was still a reflection of society's value system: only the quest for a husband was to be found in these novels. Among the women writers published in Norway during the era were Hanna Winsnes, Marie Wexelsen and Anna Magdalene Thoresen. =1854 to 1879: Awakening consciousness= During this period, new laws were passed, and although they did not at once revolutionize the status of women, barriers were being crossed regularly and rapidly. Formal equality of women with men became almost complete in the space of just two generations. In 1854 the law on royal succession was passed. The rule of, who wanted women to be entitled to nothing beyond joint-ruler status, lapsed and equal inheritance for both sexes became the rule. But this did not happen without heated debate and resistance. In 1863, a new law is passed on the age of majority that succeeds that of 1845: women attained the age of majority at 25 years, as well as men. As for widows, divorced and separated, they become major \\"regardless of age\\". In 1869, the age of majority was reduced to 21, although not without some wondering whether it was defensible for women. The committee of law, believing that women matured more rapidly than men, stated that this age is very suitable for her. In 1866, a law was passed establishing free enterprise (except for married women) so that anyone could obtain a license in their city. Sami girls in Telemark County, Norway, in 1880. But it is mainly through literature that women expressed themselves. Camilla Collett is the first writer who went outside the bounds which had been established for women's literature up until that time, and whose most famous novel, The Daughters of the Prefect (1855), deals with the education of bourgeois women in the 19th century. The central theme of this novel is the conflict between the standard conventions of society and the feelings and needs of the individual. Also, Aasta Hansteen served as a passionate voice of the feminist cause, and whose colorful persona served as a model for the character of Lona Hessel in Henrik Ibsen's The Pillars of Society (1877).  The second wave of feminism (1879–1890)  Norwegian writer and feminist Camilla Collett. The writers who took up the case for women would claim Camilla Collett as their inspiration, and thus created the first wave of feminism in Norway. = The role of literature = In 1871, Georg Brandes initiated the movement of The Modern Breakthrough: he asked that literature serve progress and not reactionary views. It was then that Norway had the writers who became known as the \\"Big Four\\", namely Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Alexander Kielland and Jonas Lie. All would speak for the cause of women. Camilla Collett and Aasta Hansteen wrote to defend the cause of feminist theories that were an integral parity of a larger program for the authors of the Modern Breakthrough. For the latter, it will be to defend the oppressed people against the social expectations of the time, of which the wife was one: women who received a primary education whose sole purpose was marriage, women who were unable to continue to fully enjoy intellectual lives, who could not freely dispose of their own life and body. This is especially through two plays, The Pillars of Society (1877) and A Doll's House (1879), where Ibsen took up the cause of modern humanism and individualism. The latter play in particular had a significant influence on the feminist movement even outside Norway, as it was translated into several languages and performed widely across Europe and beyond. Bjørnson wrote a play in 1879 called, Leonarda, in which he defends the woman who \\"has a past.\\" But above all, his play A Glove (1883) had a great impact on the public in Norway. During 1880, Norway experienced a proliferation of debates, the first concern of women being that of double standards. = The debate on double standards = During the 19th century, Norway was a very poor country, which led to a rural exodus and high levels of emigration. In 1882, Norway had 30,000 departures from a population of 1.9 million inhabitants. However, the number of emigrants is higher than 27% of females in 1900; by that year, there were 165 men to every 100 women. The consequence was the disintegration of the family unit, resulting in the increase in births outside marriage and an overwhelming increase in prostitution. The explosion of prostitution and the proliferation of brothels cause strong reactions, which focused public attention on the problem of sexual morality. The Christians of Bergen are the first to lead the offense in 1879. In 1881 the Association Against Public Immorality was founded. During the debate on double standards (1879–1884), marriage was regarded as the basic unit of society, but one that should be reformed. For the authors of The Bohemia of Kristiania, it was more radical: marriage was not a foundation of society, and the debate should focus on a more political solution to women's inequality. While Arne Garborg considered marriage as a necessary evil, Hans Jaeger believed that marriage should be replaced with free love. Not sharing the same views expressed by the Bohemia of Kristiania, writer Amalie Skram became the most radical character during the period. If, like other writers, she denounced the difference in treatment between adulterous men and women, she then considered that the Don Juan was the male equivalent of a prostitute: the conventional view was that the Don Juan does not sell himself, he accumulates his conquests; for Skram, this is not a valid argument, because a woman has accumulated conquests, too, although her conquests will be seen as prostitution even when she is not selling. Literature enabled a real challenge by Ibsen and Bjørnson to the middle classes, with The Bohemia of Kristiania spreading through the popular consciousness. = Advances in everyday life = In 1884, the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights was created, the first formal women's rights organization in Norway. In 1885, the Association for Votes for Women was founded, but it dissolved in 1898. In 1890, the first women workers' union was established, then in 1896, that of the Norwegian Women's Health Organisation and in 1904 the National Council of Women. Two significant laws were passed in 1890. By the first law, married women gained majority status. The second law ended the authority of the husband over the wife. The man retained control of the home of the couple, but the woman could now freely dispose of the fruit of his work. From 1890 to 1960 Women wearing sporting outfits, ready to play football, from the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, 16 June 1928. =Voting= Unlike some countries where women gained the right to vote through one piece of legislation, there were several stages in Norway. The expanded suffrage in 1884 became \\"universal\\" in 1898. In 1886, the Norwegian Association for Votes for Women had demanded access to universal suffrage. However, in 1901, women who can establish a minimum income of their own and those who are married to a voter may participate in municipal elections and then in 1907 in national elections. It was in 1910 that universal suffrage is adopted for all municipal elections and in 1913 for national elections. The first woman to hold office at the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, is Anna Rogstad in 1911. She sat for the political right wing, along with the conservatives and the moderate leftists. However, women were rare in politics and in the Storting. = The return of the housewife = Urd, which published between 1897 and 1958. This issue is c. 1905. The economic situation in Norway remained fragile, with rising unemployment that mainly affected low-skilled occupations and women. The ideology of the housewife arrived at this time, with the support of the state church. There were women who were behind this movement and the creation of the Organization of Norwegian Housewives. This movement and its leaders were focussed on the middle class and the bourgeoisie: its influence is among the lowest in the country overall, and it had little effect on the working class. The original idea of this movement was that domestic work is not innate in women, but rather it is learned. It became \\"more professional\\" through schools of home economics, that trained women in the maintenance of the house. They were taught the basics of cooking and even managing the household money. This movement would even have an economic impact, with the \\"Buy Norwegian!\\" slogan. Its influence enabled it to hold conferences and events even during periods of restriction in the 1920s. During these same years, the work of married women was prohibited. However, there were gains as well, as the 1927 Law on Spouses awarded equal legal weight to the verbal testimony of the housewife in parity with men. = Birth control and population decline = Women were now expected to return to the home and family life. Norway at the time was experiencing a population decline that it was attempting to slow or even reverse. The issue of birth control, and the fierce opposition of conservatives, slowed the development of legislation on contraception and abortion, which for the time, were relatively liberal. Nonetheless, the law punished a woman who had an abortion with three years in prison, as well as six perpetrators of abortion. =Limited progress= It was in the 1920s that the principles of equal pay and the right to access all jobs in the government became established. =Literature= The writers of the time, Hulda Garborg, Nini Roll Anker and Sigrid Undset in particular, believed that if the feminist struggles of the 1880s were necessary, they were now outdated. =The post-war years= In 1946, allowances for mothers at home were created. In 1950, women who married foreigners could decide for themselves whether to keep Norwegian citizenship or not. That same year, the question of the right of each woman to freely assume control over her own body became a reality in the Norwegian National Council of Women.  The second wave of feminism (1960–1990)  = Issues of feminism in the second wave = The first wave of feminism was to change the position of women in marriage, and to end the subjection of married women; the next wave of feminism fought to obtain the same rights as men. The 1960s were marked by many protests, the appearance of new ideas, and the first feminist writers of the second wave. It was no longer enough to claim a female otherness, but rather to define feminine values and shape society according to these values. The aim of the second wave of feminism was therefore to alter the nature of the state, which at the time, was essentially male. In order to achieve their goal, the feminists needed to distinguish themselves from other protest movements of the 1960s. The women experienced with these movements acted to create their own because they had not been advanced: even the typical revolutionary movement was not devoid of machismo. As a result, feminists seized issues pushed by politics and took their cause (equal pay, abortion, and so on).  From the August 1970 meeting to organize the women's movement  The founding act of the new feminist movement was in August 1970, when the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights decided to organize a large meeting in Oslo with, as keynote speaker Jo Freeman. In the following months, many groups formed across Norway. This new organization of the women's movement attracted the attention of radio, newspapers and television. Many women's groups were formed at the base with different motivations: they discussed both housing problems and the place of women in the workplace. Female solidarity grew across borders and social origins: this was one of the major differences between the feminism of the first and the second wave. =Old and new movements = The new women's movement would be more radical and specific, but these movements would also join forces to carry forward new battles. In fact, the different movements rarely opposed each other: they simply represented a different sensibility. Two movements were created in 1972: Bread and Roses and The Women front, which was the most radical feminist movement. As for the civil rights movement for GLBT Norwegians, they would form various GLBT organizations during the 1970s. =Abortion= The first law to legalize abortion was passed in 1964. It allowed abortion in cases of danger to the mother, and the abortion decision was taken by two doctors. The new association of women made this issue one of its central themes. In June 1974, several organizations came together to form the action group for the free choice of women to abortion. In the autumn of 1974, a bill was introduced in Storting, but it is defeated by one vote. A new bill was introduced in January 1975, which would expand the conditions of abortion. The examination of the law divided the unity of the action group and it disbanded. In spring 1978, the law on free access to abortion was passed in Storting. = Literature wife (Kvinnelitteratur) = Bjørg Vik led the way in the 1960s, but during the 1970s, a literature developed in which women must be distinguished from literature in the traditional sense (with authors such as Eldrid Lunden, Liv Køltzow, Cecilie Løveid, and Tove Nilsen), a literature of witness to women's experiences. =Many reforms= Norway's first woman Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland. In 1971, Norway made marital rape illegal. From 1975, many reforms were implemented: , 1977 * Law on the work environment that allows, among other reforms, to extend pregnancy leave and greater access to parental leave. , 1978 * Abortion law * Law on Gender Equality (implemented in 1979). To ensure compliance, an ombudsman responsible for enforcing the law on gender equality is created along with a complaints committee for equality. Norway is the first country to adopt such means. Even if the sanctions were limited, the mediator had a genuine moral authority. = A single movement in Europe = The Norwegian women's movement had a feature that was not found in any other Western country: the \\"gentle\\" movement of Myke Menn. =Feminization of politics= Norwegian filmmaker Hanne Larsen. Norwegian women continue to make progress in traditionally male-dominated fields. In 1974, the Liberal party (Venstre) and then in the following year, the Radical Socialist Party (Sosialistisk Venstreparti, SV), inaugurated a new political strategy: 40% of candidates on the lists and the important posts are reserved for women. But it was not until 1983 for the Arbeiderpartiet (AP), 1989 for the Senterpartiet (SP) and 1993 for the Kristelig Folkeparti (KRF). In 1977, the municipalities decided to implement parity in local elections. Without a character of obligation to this decision, the parity was implemented in 1980 in over 300 counties out of 439. In Storting, female representation is experiencing a rapid evolution: * 1969: 9% of MPs are women * 1973: 16% of MPs are women * 1977: 24% of MPs are women The first woman to hold the post of prime minister in Norway was Gro Harlem Brundtland. After the 2013 national election, Erna Solberg of Høyre (H) became Norway's second female prime minister. =Feminism and work = In the 1970s, the struggle over equal pay dominated the decade. In the 1980s, there was a desire to better coordinate work and family life. In 1987, parental leave was extended considerably, but above all, fathers became equally entitled, and do not hesitate to use it. The Labour Code which dates from 1935 was revised regularly. * Review of 1981: Provided equal treatment between men and women in hiring and salary * Revision 1985: creation of a delegate for equality between men and women in business. =Norwegian Women's Lobby= International Women's Day march in Oslo, 8 March 2020 In 2014, eight of the nationwide women's rights organizations in Norway established the Norwegian Women's Lobby, modelled after similar organizations in other countries, to strengthen the organized feminist movement.Gratulerer, Norges kvinnelobby!, Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud, 29 January 2014Norsk kvinnebevegelse slår seg sammen i ny lobby, Kureren, 29 January 2014 = Parental leave = Parental leave is a benefit program that gives parents paid time off from work in a limited time period. In Norway, workers often have the right to leave during pregnancy, adoption, the children's illness or caretakers illness. Workers have had the opportunity to take a parental leave since the 1970s but legislation changed drastically in 1993. If the employee receives a salary from the employer during the time of leave, the time off is considered as a paid leave. If the employee does not receive a salary from their own or other employers, the time off from work is considered an unpaid leave. Parental leave includes maternity, paternity, adoption and pregnancy leave. Parents have a right to leave as long as they receive parental benefits from National Insurance via NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration). If parents or care-takers choose to receive 100% parental leave of what they are entitled to, that gives them paid leave for 49 weeks, referring to the July 1st 2013 legislation or if they choose to receive 80% parental leave of what they are entitled to, that gives them paid leave for 59 weeks. Parents can distribute these weeks between themselves as they wish with an exception of three weeks before birth and six weeks after birth that are reserved for the mother and 10 weeks fathers quota that is reserved for the father. The basis for the calculation of parental benefit is each of the parents wages based on the same rules that apply for sick leave.  Pregnancy leave  Pregnant workers have the right to maternity leave for up to 12 weeks during pregnancy. Parental leave can be distributed from this point. 3 weeks before the due date is reserved for the mother and is included in the maternity quota for parental leave. She has to take advantage of these 3 weeks or they will not count for later.  Birth Leave  The first 6 weeks after birth is also reserved for the mother. The father though has the right to take out 2 weeks of leave after birth. This is not a part of the set parental quota of 10 weeks, which is usually taken out later in the benefit period.  Fathers quota and mothers quota  The fathers quota has up until 2013 been 14 weeks and is reserved for the father/co-mother. From 2013 this law was changed so that the parental leave was parted into three parts with equally long sections (14 weeks) where one part is reserved for the mother and another for the father. 6 weeks of the mothers quota has to be taken out in association with birth. The fathers quota as of July 1, 2014 has been changed from 14 weeks to 10 weeks. This applies to all parents that have children after this date. The purpose of the fathers quota has been to contribute to a more equal distribution of care taking between mothers and fathers. As a political measure it is supposed to change the relationship between mother and father, between employer and employees of both sexes, and between father and child.  Care leave  The care leave is a 2 weeks period that the father/co- mother is entitled to in association with birth but it is not included in the birth leave. The father/co-mother is not entitled to get paid these 2 weeks, but it is normal for the employer to cover it. = Apology to \\"German Girls\\" = In 2018, Norway's then Prime Minister Erna Solberg gave an apology to the estimated 50,000 Norwegian women who had relations with Germans during World War II (as well as those suspected of having them), stating in part, \\"Young Norwegian girls and women who had relations with German soldiers or were suspected of having them, were victims of undignified treatment. Our conclusion is that Norwegian authorities violated the rule fundamental principle that no citizen can be punished without trial or sentenced without law. For many, this was just a teenage love, for some, the love of their lives with an enemy soldier or an innocent flirt that left its mark for the rest of their lives. Today, in the name of the government, I want to offer my apologies.\\" Norwegian women who had relations with German soldiers were nicknamed \\"German Girls\\", and some were detained, expelled from Norway, or had their civil rights removed.  Conclusion  In the 1990s, feminism experienced some stagnation in Norway after more than twenty years of reform. Despite all the advances with egalitarian measures, wages are not always equal. The number of battered women is difficult to decrease, and finally the maternity benefit remains low. Today, feminism is taking new forms. The associations and movements that grew out of the first and second wave of Norwegian feminism are adapting to these new structures, which are sometimes informal.
