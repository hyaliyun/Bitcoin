The skeleton is very similar to that of the modern Chinese crocodile lizard, Shinisaurus. Description Bahndwicivi is based on FMNH PR2260, a skeleton collected from the Thompson Ranch Locality of the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation. It was described in 2006 by Jack Conrad. The type species is B. ammoskius. The genus name means \\"handsome in the water\\" in Shoshoni, a reference both to the animal's possible semiaquatic lifestyle and to the Shoshone people who once lived in the area. The specific name is a combination of the Ancient Greek words for sandy (ammos) and shade (skia), referring to its habitat. FMNH PR2260 is more or less complete, primarily lacking some bones from the rear of the skull. The skeleton is well-articulated, with numerous rows of osteoderms remaining in place beneath the tail, but is somewhat flattened. The animal appears to have been an adult when it died. It differs from Shinisaurus in a few details. For example, FMNH PR2260 had a proportionally longer snout and an additional tooth in the upper jaw, and its postorbital and postfrontal bones were not fused. Paleoecology Bahndwivici is one of several lizards known from the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation. This rock unit represents part of Fossil Lake, the smallest and shortest-lived of three prehistoric lake systems that make up the Green River Formation. The lake sediments include a volcanic ash dating to 51.66 million years ago, during the Early Eocene. Fossils are abundant in the rocks of Fossil Lake, and illustrate a diverse assemblage of plants, bivalves, snails, crustaceans, insects, rays, bony fish, salamanders, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, birds, and mammals.

Using organelles (particularly the rough endoplasmic reticulum), dermal fibroblasts generate and maintain the connective tissue which unites separate cell layers. Furthermore, these dermal fibroblasts produce the protein molecules including laminin and fibronectin which comprise the extracellular matrix. By creating the extracellular matrix between the dermis and epidermis, fibroblasts allow the epithelial cells of the epidermis to affix the matrix, thereby allowing the epidermal cells to effectively join together to form the top layer of the skin.  Cell progenitors and analogs  Dermal fibroblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells within the body. Like corneal fibroblasts, dermal fibroblast proliferation can be stimulated by the presence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Fibroblasts do not appear to be fully differentiated or specialized. After examining the CD markers of the fibroblast cells, researchers at BioMed Central discovered that these cell lack \\"distinctive markers\\" confirming that these cells can be further differentiated. One example of further differentiation of dermal fibroblasts is that upon injury, dermal fibroblasts can give rise to myofibroblasts, fibroblast cells with smooth muscle characteristics. Dermal cells differentiate into myofibroblasts by altering their actin gene expression (which is silenced in dermal fibroblasts). When dermal fibroblasts express actin, the cells can slowly contract. This contraction plays a critical role in wound healing and fibrosis. By pulling tissues closed differentiated myofibroblasts, seal the skin after an injury (thereby, preventing infection but inducing scar formation. Myofibroblasts can also be derived from non- fibroblast sources. Based on evidence of Œ±-SMA expression from lung injuries, myofibroblasts can \\"arise de novo\\" directly from mesenchymal stem cells.  Cell function and characteristics  Unlike other fibroblast cell types, dermal fibroblasts are far less likely to change into other cell types. For example, when a dermal fibroblast and a corneal fibroblasts are placed in the same concentrations of fibroblast growth factor, dermal fibroblast will not differentiate or change. As noted by Dr. J. Lewis and Dr. A. Johnson authors of Microbiology of the Cell, \\"fibroblasts from the skin are different\\" and behave differently from other fibroblast cells to identical chemical stimuli. Furthermore, dermal fibroblasts are less likely to replicate in either in vivo and in vitro environments than are other fibroblast types. Dermal fibroblasts require far higher concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in order to undergo cell replication. Dermal fibroblasts are responsible for creating the ECM which organizes the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the epidermis into a unified tissue. Furthermore, dermal fibroblasts create long fibrous bands of connective tissue which anchor the skin to the fascia of the body. Therefore, without dermal fibroblasts, the largest and heaviest organ would not tightly adhere to body's frame.  Clinical Applications  Since dermal fibroblasts play a critical role in wound healing, researchers are attempting to generate mature dermal fibroblasts to repair second and third degree burns. When the body sustains a third degree burn, the skin's dermal layer is completely destroyed by heat (and the all fibroblast cells within the wound site perish. Without fibroblasts, the wound site cannot regenerate extracellular matrix and epidermis skin cells cannot proliferate over the wound site. Therefore, without dermal fibroblasts the skin cannot properly recover from injury. Yet, by differentiating mesenchymal stem cells from other regions of the body and injecting them into the wound site, scientists can restore dermal fibroblasts to burned regions of the body. By restoring fibroblasts to the burned regions, the body can restore the ECM within the wound site and recover from the injury. As noted \\"The injured dermis is also repaired by the recruitment and proliferation of fibroblasts producing extracellular matrix and keratinocyte growth promoting factors.\\" Similarly, FGF is being inserted into fibrin sealants to enhance the long term repair and sealing of tissue. FGF-1 has been experimentally shown to encourage the body‚Äôs own adhesive tissue to develop and effectively seal the wound (thereby stymieing infection and mitigating scar formation). Using FGF stimulate fibroblast activity is a more effective means of sealing tissue than current tissue sealants due to the robust nature of collagen which makes up connective tissue. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Alabama examined the adhesive properties of fibrin tissue adhesives. The tests found that fibrin adhesives even at its intended medical concentration (29 mg/mL at the wound site) had shear strength of only 17.6 kiloPascals. Furthermore, another study performed at the University of California determined that the modulus (the stress/strain) of fibrin adhesives was on average 53.56 kPA. To seal together tissues the human body uses collagen and elastin to obtain superior shear strength. Type I collagen which includes collagen strands bundled into strong fibrils has a unique tri-helical structure which increases the proteins structural integrity. In fact, a study performed by the Department of Medicine in University College London experimentally determined that pure type I collagen has a modulus of 5 GPa to 11.5 GPa. Therefore, pure type I collagen has nearly one million times greater structural integrity than fibrin. Collagen is therefore much harder to deform than fibrin, and collagen fibers create much stronger bonds between tissues than strands of fibrin polymer. = Stem Cells = By generating adhesive proteins like fibronectin, fibroblasts are used within research laboratories to help to culture cells which typically demonstrate low survival rates in vitro. For example, fibroblasts have been utilized to increase the survival rate for human stem cells which easily undergo cell apoptosis. As noted by researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, dermal cell \\"human keratinocyte [stem cells] could be propagated in vitro when culture on fibroblast feeder cells.\\" In addition to improving the culture and proliferation of stem cells, dermal fibroblasts can also become stem cells. Although dermal cells demonstrate less plasticity than other fibroblast cell types, researchers can still turn these cells into induced pluripotent cells (IPCs). As noted by researchers within the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, researchers obtained fibroblasts from a mouse with sickle cell anemia and, using a virus, \\"reprogrammed these cells into pluripotent [stem cells], corrected the genetic deficiency by homologous recombination, and redirected these pluripotent cells toward the hematopoietic lineages, and transplanted these engineered cells to a lethally irradiated mice.\\" The animals which received the fibroblast stem cell treatment exhibited increased activity levels, indicating recovery from the disorder.

Its ice class, 1A, fulfilled the minimum requirements of the traffic restrictions at that time and the ship was escorted to port. Finnish-Swedish ice class is an ice class assigned to a vessel operating in first-year ice in the Baltic Sea and calling Finnish or Swedish ports. Ships are divided into six ice classes based on requirements for hull structural design, engine output and performance in ice according to the regulations issued by the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) and the Swedish Maritime Administration.  Purpose  Cruiseferries sailing on regular routes between Finland, Sweden and Estonia are usually built to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super. Due to their high engine power, the cruiseferries do not normally require icebreaker assistance. During the winter months, Finnish and Swedish authorities may declare traffic restrictions in the Northern Baltic Sea in order to ensure that ships operating in the region are capable of navigating in ice-covered waters safely and efficiently. These restrictions, for example \\"ice class 1A, 2000 DWT\\", declare the minimum ice class and other requirements for ships that may be provided with icebreaker assistance. The Finnish fairway dues, a system of fees charged for the use of sea lanes to cover the costs of management and icebreaker assistance, also depend on the vessels' ice class. Since ships of lower ice classes generally require more assistance during the winter months, their fairway dues are considerably higher than those of ships of the highest ice classes.Aro, Ilmari: Icebreaking management on Finnish coast . Finnish Maritime Administration. For this reason the majority of ships regularly calling Finnish ports are built to the highest ice classes. In the beginning of 2008, 47% of the Finnish tonnage were of ice class 1A Super. Many international classification societies have incorporated the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules to their own rulebooks and offer ice class notations that are recognized by the Finnish and Swedish authorities. These ice classes are, in turn, used by countries such as Estonia and Latvia to assign traffic restrictions.Ice map. The Baltic Sea Portal. Since the ice class rules have been revised and amended several times over the years, a list of equivalent ice class notations is used to assign the correct official ice class for older vessels when they visit Finnish and Swedish ports.Finnish ice classes equivalent to class notations of recognized classification societies and documentation required for the determination of the ice classes of ships. Maritime Safety Regulation TRAFI/31299/03.04.01.00/2010, Finnish Transport Safety Agency, 23 November 2010. Although mainly used in the Baltic Sea, the Finnish-Swedish ice classes and the equivalent ice class notations from classification societies are sometimes used when discussing ships operating in other freezing seas of the world. While the Finnish-Swedish ice classes can be assigned to icebreakers for the purpose of collecting fairway fees, the rules are intended primarily for merchant ships operating under icebreaker escort. Because the engine output and the level of ice-strengthening in ships designed to operate independently in ice-infested waters, especially in the presence of multi-year ice, usually exceeds the requirements of the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules, the classification societies use different ice class notations, such as the IACS Polar Class, for icebreakers. The two highest Finnish-Swedish ice classes, 1A and 1A Super, are somewhat equivalent to the two lowest Polar Classes, PC 7 and PC 6, respectively.  Definition and requirements  Rautaruukki has the same ice class as the integrated tug and barge, 1A Super, but the unpropelled Kalla is downgraded to ice class 3. Ships of the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, are designed to operate in difficult ice conditions mainly without icebreaker assistance while ships of lower ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C are assumed to rely on icebreaker assistance. However, even ships of the highest ice class are assumed to require icebreaker assistance from time to time. In addition there are ice class 2 for self- propelled steel-hulled ships with no ice strengthening that are capable of operating independently in very light ice conditions and ice class 3 for vessels that do not belong to any other class such as unpropelled barges and ships built of wood. The Finnish-Swedish ice classes are usually spelled with Roman numerals, e.g. IA, in official context and legislation. Double acting ships capable of independent operation in ice, such as Mastera, could be eligible for the proposed new ice class 1A Super+. Ships must fulfill certain design requirements in order to obtain the ice class from the Finnish and Swedish authorities. The design requirement for ice class 1A Super is a minimum speed of 5 knots in a broken brash ice channel with a thickness of in the middle and a consolidated (refrozen) ice layer of . Ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C have lower design requirements corresponding to non-consolidated ice channels with a thickness of in the middle, respectively. While the ice class rules provide equations to calculate the minimum engine power based on the ship's main dimensions and hull shape, more exact calculations or ice model tests resulting in lower minimum engine power can also be approved, but in such case the ice class can be revoked if the experience of the ship's performance in practice motivates this. In addition, the strength of the ship's hull, propulsion system and steering gear must be adequate to allow safe operation in the presence of ice, and the rules provide tables and formulas to determine minimum scantlings and other design criteria for each ice class. The thickness of ice used as the basis of these calculations is sometimes mistaken for the minimum icebreaking capability requirement for the ice-classed vessel. = 1A Super+ = Since even ships of ice class 1A Super are assumed to rely on icebreaker assistance from time to time, a research was conducted recently about introducing a new ice class exceeding all existing ice classes, 1A Super+, for ships capable of independent operation in all ice conditions and therefore reducing the need of icebreaker assistance in some ports. These ships could also be granted \\"icebreaker status\\" and their higher operating costs could be partially covered by government subsidies from the same funds that are used to cover the cost of icebreaker assistance.Riska, Kaj: Definition of the new Ice Class IA Super +. Winter Navigation Research Board Report No 60. September 2009. the new ice class has not been implemented in the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules.  History  = Finnish ice class rules (1890‚Äì1971) = The first Finnish statutory regulation for ships navigating in ice was given on 27 March 1890. It was primarily intended to increase the safety and set a number of requirements for passenger ships operating regularly in winter conditions. These included double bottom in way of the engines and boilers, construction according to the rules of Lloyd's Register or Bureau Veritas, at least five transverse watertight bulkheads, and sufficient damage stability to survive the flooding of two compartments without sinking. The last requirement is interesting because it was not included in the latter ice class rules and did not become mandatory again for ships partaking in international traffic until 1960. The first Finnish ice class rules that included the fairway fees were published in 1920. According to the rules the ships were to pay \\"ice fees\\" according to their net register tonnage, classification and strengthening for navigation in ice during the winter season, which began on 1 December and ended on 16 April in the Gulf of Finland and in the Bothnian Sea, and from 1 November until 1 May in the northern parts of the Gulf of Bothnia. In 1923 a circular about the classification of ice-strengthened ships was sent to the largest classification societies. The ice strengthening of the hull was defined as a percentage that was added to the minimum requirements set by the classification societies, such as 45% increase in shell plating thickness. The Finnish ice class rules published in 1932 introduced the ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C for ships strengthened for navigation in ice, ice class 2 for ships classified for unrestricted service but not strengthened for navigation in ice and ice class 3 for other vessels. Ice class 2 was further divided to two subclasses, 2A and 2B, and vessels were eligible for the former if they had a radio. Detailed minimum requirements, again as an additional percentage of the open water requirement, were given for the stem, shell plating at the waterline, stiffeners, rudder and rudder bearings, and the propulsion machinery. In the lowest ice class, 1C, the requirements were limited to the bow of the vessel. The Finnish ice class rules of 1960 included only minor modifications to the existing rules. The subdivision of ice class 2 was abolished as radios had become more common. In the 1960s the expansion of the Finnish icebreaker fleet allowed navigation in more severe ice conditions, and the Finnish ice class rules published in 1965 introduced a new ice class, 1A Super, which was considerably stronger than the existing classes. Since ice class 1A was already exempted from the ice fees, the 50% reduction to lighthouse fees was given to ships of the new ice class. However, the additional requirements of the highest ice class were deemed excessive and only three such ships were built. = Finnish-Swedish ice class rules (1971‚Äì) = In 1970 a workgroup consisting of the Finnish Maritime Administration, W√§rtsil√§ Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new ice class rules in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, became known as the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and engine output of 1,500 hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice. However, the biggest change to the previous Finnish ice class rules was the way the structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, midship, aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area as a function of the ship's displacement and engine output. The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a minimum power requirement was given so that the ice- strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic. The Finnish-Swedish ice class rules of 1985 introduced changes to the hull dimensioning. The plastic deformation theory used in the previous rules was changed to elastic, and the load height was changed to more realistic. The minimum engine power requirements were changed in 2002 to correspond to the resistance of the ship in a brash ice channel, calculated as a function of ship size and hull geometry.Riska, K. and Juva, M: On the power requirements in the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. Winter Navigation Research Board report no. 53. 2002. The rules were revised also in 2002, 2008 and 2010. The current Finnish-Swedish ice class rules were issued in 2017 and are applicable to ships contracted for construction on or after 1 January 2019. However, the current ice class rules become applicable retroactively also to ships of ice classes 1A and 1A Super laid down before 1 September 2003 in the beginning of the year when 20 years has passed from the delivery of the vessel and ships failing to meet the requirements will have their ice classes downgraded.

Walchand selected Visakhapatnam as a suitable location for the construction of the yard and took possession of the land in November 1940. The foundation stone for the shipyard was laid by Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 21 June 1941, who was at that time the acting Congress President. The first ship to be constructed fully in India after independence was built at the Scindia Shipyard and named Jal Usha. It was launched in 1948 by Jawaharlal Nehru at a ceremony where the families of Seth Walchand Hirachnd, late Narottam Morarjee and Tulsidas Kilachand, the partners of Scindia Shipyard, were present along with other dignitaries and industrialists. Walchand died in 1953, and the Scindia Shipyard continued to operate successfully under the next of kin of the founders. However, in 1961 the shipyard was nationalised and renamed Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL). In 2010, HSL was transferred from the Ministry of Shipping to the Ministry of Defence. The yard played a critical role in the development of nuclear- powered, Arihant class submarine. Facilities The shipyard is relatively compact at . It is equipped with the plasma cutting machines, steel processing and welding facilities, material handling equipment, cranes, logistics and storage facilities. It also has testing and measuring facilities. It has a covered building dock for building vessels up to 80,000 DWT. There are three slipways and a fitting-out jetty. HSL has a dry dock, wet basin and repair delphin for ship and submarine repair and retrofitting. Vessels HSL had built over 192 vessels till now and repaired almost 2000 ships. It builds bulk carriers, offshore patrol vessels, survey ships, drill ships, offshore platforms and repair and support vessels. It also conducts major overhauls of Indian Navy submarines, and is being equipped to construct nuclear-powered submarines. However, the shipyard has a history of protracted refits. The submarines Vela, Vagli, and Sindhukirti each spent almost 10 years for a single refit at HSL. Where a Russian shipyard would deploy 200 workers in three shifts to complete the refit in two years, HSL deployed only 50 workers to work on Sindhukirti.

History Named after the jockey Scobie Breasley, Malone made his first appearance in Cleary's 1966 novel The High Commissioner.Murray Waldren, 'Jon Cleary: Character builder', Weekend Australian, 1998 Cleary says he got the idea from meeting an Australian policeman he knew walking out of Australia House in London one day. He was on six months leave but Cleary wondered what if he had come to arrest the Australian High Commissioner for murder. Although the original novel was a best seller and turned into a film, Cleary did not originally intend to create a series around Malone. However, he brought the character back later for Helga's Web (1970) as a means to explore the construction of the Sydney Opera House, then for Ransom (1973). There was a long gap before he started using the detective again, but once he did he wrote Malone novels regularly from 1987 onwards until the end of his writing career. Cleary and his wife used to travel two months every year to research his books. However, after Cleary's daughter died in 1987, his wife became ill and did not want to travel. As Cleary liked to research his books thoroughly this meant he had to write about Australia.Susan Geason, 'Jon Cleary: A Fortunate Life', The Sydney Morning Herald, December 06, 1992 p 111 > I wondered how if I were to write about Australia would I keep my overseas > readers. I'd written three Malone tales but was resisting publishers' urging > to write more because I didn't want to get trapped by it. Then I realised I > could use him by hanging it on crime, which immediately intrigued the > international market, and write about what it was like living in Sydney in > the late 80s and through the 90s.Murray Waldren, 'Jon Cleary: Character > Builder' The Weekend Australian 1998 \\"I'm trying to write something more than detective novels\\", said Cleary in 1989. \\"I am offended if my book is called a potboiler.\\"Tony Stephens, 'Steinbeck? Don't Make Me Laugh', Sydney Morning Herald, 4 November 1989 p 86 Cleary admits that sales of the last few Malone books declined and he decided to end the series before his publishers did.Jon Cleary Interviewed by Stephen Vagg: Oral History at National Film and Sound Archive He also felt he was running creatively dry. \\"When I found myself making notes on a serial killer, I knew that I'd got to the bottom of the barrel because that's the cliche in crime writing today\\", he said in 2004.Jason Steger, 'Cleary's Has His Fill of Crime' The Age, August 27, 2004 accessed 8 March 2012 Personality and Attributes Cleary once stated that, \\"There's more than a bit of me in Scobie. We both come from fighting Irish stock, we're both from Erskineville, the wrong side of the tracks, and both of us slugged our way up.\\" Malone was a Catholic family man with rigid principles who mostly worked in Sydney, although his adventures occasionally took him overseas. Malone was described in The High Commissioner as: > Tall, six feet. His face was too bony to be handsome, but [Inspector] Leeds > guessed women would find the eyes attractive: they were dark, almost Latin, > and they were friendly. The mouth, too, was friendly. Malone gave the > impression of being easy-going, but there was a competence about him that > had marked him for promotion from his first days in the force.Extract from > The High Commissioner Part 1 In the same novel it is mentioned that Scobie once played a game for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield as a bowler and was \\"belted... all over the field\\".Extract from The High Commissioner Part 2 Other characters Regular characters in the series included: *Malone's Dutch wife Lisa, who when he first met her was working as Sir James Quentin's secretary in The High Commissioner. She was based on Cleary's wife Joy. *Malone's partner Sergeant Russ Clements, who eventually became head of Homicide. *Commissioner John Leeds, Malone's superior. *His father Con and mother Brigid (based on Cleary's parents). *His children Claire, Tom and Maureen (based on Cleary's grandchildren). Style A noted feature of the books was starting them with a striking opening sentence. Adaptations There have been two feature film adaptations of Malone novels. Cleary was dissatisfied with both. He did not do the adaptation of Nobody Runs Forever (1968), which he thought \\"had no sense of humour at all\\" and lacked reality. He wrote a script for Helga's Web which was not used in the film that was eventually titled Scobie Malone (1975). \\"When I saw Scobie nibbling on the fourth nipple I thought \\"that's not my Scobie\\"\\", said Cleary. In 1997 Peter Yeldham adapted Dark Summer for a proposed telemovie but this was never made.Information on Dark Summer at National Film and Sound Archive Cleary thought Rachel Blake would have made the perfect Joy.

It was published in 1929 by Balai Pustaka. It tells the story of Midun, the son of a farmer, who experiences many trials before finally living happily with his new wife. It has been noted as one of Sati's most interesting works. Plot Kacak, the conceited nephew of a rich village leader in Padang, is jealous of Midun, the religious and popular son of a poor farmer; Kacak often attempts to goad Midun into fighting him. After Midun saves his wife from drowning, Kacak becomes enraged at the thought that Midun had touched his wife and attacks him. Midun fights back, quickly knocking Kacak out. As a result of his actions, Midun is forced to do tasks for the village leader under Kacak's supervision. Still enraged at Midun, Kacak hires an assassin to kill him. When the attempt fails, the assassin and Midun are arrested and sent to prison. While in prison, Midun is tortured until he earns a reputation for being a good fighter. He also meets Halimah, who lives with her stepfather, after returning her diamond necklace. After he is released from prison, Midun takes Halimah to find her father in Bogor. After living with them for two months, Midun attempts to go to Batavia to find work, together with Halimah. Along the way, he meets the Arab Indonesian Syekh Abdullah, who lends him money; after refusing to pay the high interest or let Abudullah marry Halimah, Midun is arrested. After his release, he saves a Dutch youth being attacked in Pasar Baru. For saving the boy, Midun is granted a job at the police station by the boy's father, the hoofdcommissaris (head commissioner). He also marries Halimah. Midun is later stationed in Padang upon request to the commissioner, after hearing that his father had died. Kacak is arrested for embezzlement, and Midun lives happily ever after. Themes Sengsara Membawa Nikmat focuses mainly on the story of Midun, taking a realistic view. Unlike the earlier novel Muda Teruna by Muhammad Kasim, part of the story takes place outside of Sumatra. C. W. Watson notes that Sengsara Membawa Nikmat, similar to Marah Roesli's novel Sitti Nurbaya, reflects Balai Pustaka's \\"antitraditional stance\\", which in his opinion required the support of progressive ideas and the condemnation of conservative traditionalism. He points to the two-page passage in the novel where Midun discusses the traditional witch doctors (dukun) with Halimah, indicating that women who go to the dukun for help saving their marriages actually end up destroying them with the extra costs; other acts condemned include the traditional love potions and possible vengeful actions of the dukun. This theme is later continued in Sati's novel Syair Rosina. Dutch critic of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw notes that the novel's theme is not exclusively Minangkabau, as it is about the conflict between an evil and a good youth, with the good eventually winning. Release Sengsara Membawa Nikmat was originally published by Balai Pustaka in 1929. It was adapted into a sinetron (Indonesian soap opera) in 1991. The adaptation was directed by Agus Wijoyono and starred W.D. Mochtar, Septian Dwi Cahyo, and Sandy Nayoan. Teeuw considers it Sati's most interesting work. He writes that it is capable of immersing the reader in the Minangkabau village life, with its everyday events and natural human reactions.

Friedersdorf wrote an article calling for the abolition of ICE, and protecting the right to protest on the Statue of Liberty. Friedersdorf has praised Peggy McIntosh's essay White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack saying he would encourage its study in college curriculums, but warned that \\"importing obscure academic concepts into mass conversations about identity makes them much less accessible and more alienating to the vast majority of America\\".

This substance is interesting due to its possible use to store hydrogen in a hydrogen economy. A recent review that accounts the state-of-the-art and future prospects and challenges of hydrogen storage as clathrate hydrates is reported by Veluswamy et al. (2014).https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.063 Another unusual characteristic is that multiple hydrogen molecules can occur at each cage site in the ice, one of only a very few guest molecule that forms clathrates with this property. The maximum ratio of hydrogen to water is 6 H2 to 17 H2O. It can be formed at 250K in a diamond anvil at a pressure of 300MPa (3000 Bars). It takes about 30 minutes to form, so this method is impractical for rapid manufacture. The percent of weight of hydrogen is 3.77%. The cage compartments are hexakaidecahedral and hold from two to four molecules of hydrogen. At temperatures above 160K the molecules rotate around inside the cage. Below 120K the molecules stop racing around the cage, and below 50K are locked into a fixed position. This was determined with deuterium in a neutron scattering experiment. Under higher pressures a 1:1 ratio clathrate can form. It crystallises in a cubic structure, where H2 and H2O are both arranged in a diamond lattice. It is stable above 2.3 GPa. Under even higher pressures (over 38 GPa) there is a prediction of the existence of a clathrate with a cubic structure and a 1:2 ratio: 2H2‚Ä¢H2O. More complex clathrates can occur with hydrogen, water and other molecules such as methane, and tetrahydrofuran. Since hydrogen and water ice are common constituents of the universe, it is very likely that under the right circumstances natural hydrogen clathrates will be formed. This could occur in icy moons for example. Hydrogen clathrate was likely to be formed in the high pressure nebulae that formed the gas giants, but not to have formed in comets.

Harbury (born 1951) is an American lawyer, author, and human rights activist. She has been instrumental in forcing the revelation of the complicity of the United States CIA in human rights abuses, particularly in Guatemala and other countries of Central America during the 1980s and 1990s. Initially she was trying to discover the fate of her husband Efra√≠n B√°maca Vel√°squez, a Mayan guerrilla leader who was \\"disappeared\\" in March 1992. The death of her husband at the hands of the army in 1993 was revealed, together with CIA complicity in Guatemala Army human rights abuses. As a result of her efforts, Congress forced the end to a CIA program. In 1998 President Bill Clinton ordered the declassification of decades of documents related to US activities in Guatemala and other Central American countries, and apologized for US contributions to human rights abuses there while on an official visit to Guatemala. Early life and education Harbury grew up in Connecticut, graduating from Cornell University and Harvard Law School. Afterward she worked at a small legal aid clinic on the Texas-Mexico border. Among her clients in the early 1980s were Guatemalan Mayans who emigrated to Texas to escape from the death squads that were conducting genocide against them during the long civil war of their home country. Ignorant of the true political situation, US immigration denied refugee status to many and forced them to return. Harbury went to Guatemala to see firsthand what was going on. Human rights activist In the 1980s, Harbury traveled to Guatemala, where she became more involved in helping the indigenous Mayans. In 1990, she met Efra√≠n B√°maca Vel√°squez in Guatemala, and married him in 1991. An indigenous Mayan, B√°maca was a commandante of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) during Guatemala's civil war, known by his nom de guerre of Commandante Everardo. This was a decades-long government and military repression and genocide, largely against Guatemala's indigenous populations. On March 12, 1992, local members of the Guatemalan army captured Efra√≠n B√°maca Vel√°squez, secretly detained and tortured him for more than a year. His torturers and murderers were paid CIA informants. As a U.S. citizen and lawyer, Harbury set out to find her husband's whereabouts, while working with Guatemalans in the US to protest against human rights abuses, and trying to force the government to find out about his fate. She took legal action despite receiving threats on her life for these efforts. She initiated two hunger strikes in Guatemala, one in front of the White House, and filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the CIA to gain access to their information. During this period, both the Guatemalan and United States governments claimed they had no knowledge of B√°maca's whereabouts. As a result of Harbury's actions, U.S. State Department official Richard Nuccio did internal research and became a whistleblower in 1996. He revealed that the CIA had known both where B√°maca was being held and that the army had killed him. Specifically, Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, a Guatemalan Colonel who studied at the School of the Americas and was a paid informant or \\"asset\\" of the CIA, had ordered the murder. Alpirez had also been involved in the murder of U.S. citizen and innkeeper Michael Devine. New York Times, March 24, 1995, \\"Long Road to Truth About Killings in Guatemala\\", by Time Weiner. Moreover, the intelligence agency had a close working relationship with the Central American military death squads who \\"disappeared\\" B√°maca and had been funneling money to them, despite a Congressional prohibition since 1990. President Clinton ordered an investigation by the Intelligence Oversight Board. During April 1996, the American nun Dianna Ortiz was fasting across from the White House, seeking the release of CIA papers related to her case of abduction and torture in Guatemala in 1989. This forced the long overdue release of the Intelligence Oversight Board Report. When the papers were released in May, there was no confirmation of her claim that an American had been involved in her case. However, the report did confirm the CIA practice of using known torturers and human rights abusers as paid informants or \\"assets\\", and the failure of the U.S. Department of State officials to properly share information as to human rights crimes with the victims and their families.,MAX OBUSZEWSKI, \\"Some CIA Mistakes...\\", Baltimore Chronicle and Sentinel, 7 June 1996, accessed 14 June 2013 1996 Intelligence Oversight Board Report on Guatemala. For his whistle blowing, Richard Nuccio was eventually stripped of his security clearance, ending his career with the State Department by 1997. Nuccio's revelations caused a scandal for the U.S. government. As a result, President Bill Clinton ordered declassification of United States secret archives on the B√°maca murder and other human rights crimes committed by the Guatemalan military. Documents dating to 1954 were declassified, revealing complex relationships for years between elements in the two countries. Clinton issued a public apology in 1998 in Guatemala for the United States' role in supporting the country's abusive regimes. Since that time, Harbury has made it her life's work to fight for human rights by documenting, exposing, and speaking publicly about human rights abuses. She has emphasized the abuses by the United States, both historical and contemporary.

Sitrick and Company then had 45 staff members, who were largely former journalists of the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and other media organizations. The two purchased firms had a combined revenue of $24.4 million, in 2008, according to Resources Connection. The purchase combined the two subsidiaries as Sitrick Brincko Group. LLC. Mike Sitrick continued as head of the Sitrick and Company subsidiary after its purchase by Deloitte. In 2010, two former employees filed suit in federal court regarding Sitrick's buyout of the Employee Share Ownership Plan's holdings in the company during 2008, shortly prior to the Resources Connection deal; the suit alleged that Sitrick paid an unreasonably low price for the ESOP's stake, causing losses to the former employees. Sitrick responded in court documents that an independent trustee, which had its own financial advisor and lawyers, had negotiated the price, and the case settled shortly after, with insurance companies providing settlement funds. Clientele Sitrick and Company is known for its handling of famous, or controversial, clients. In 2009, it was estimated to have had 1000 clients.

He is the creator of the fictional detective character Kiriti Roy. Some of his writings were made into films of Bengal and Bollywood.  Early life  Gupta came from a Kabiraj family of Itna village under Lohagara police station, in the district of Jessore, presently in the Narail district of Bangladesh. He was born to Satya Ranjan Gupta and Labangalata Devi on 6 June 1911, in Kolkata where his father used to work. He spent his childhood in Kolkata. Due to his father's transferable job, he had to attend several schools, including Gaibandha High School. In 1930 he passed Matriculation from Konnagar High School. After completing his I.Sc. from Krishnanagar College, he took admission to Carmichael Medical College. While a student at the college, his elder sister died of scorpion sting. Young Gupta vowed to earn higher degree in the medical sciences to serve the ill. A part of his family also stayed at Patna, Bihar.  Career  During the Second World War Gupta served as an army doctor and was posted to various places, including Chittagong, Burma and Egypt. After the war he completed post-graduate studies in the United Kingdom, specialising in dermatology. On his return he joined the Calcutta Medical College. In his career as a physician he was associated with several hospitals in India. After the Partition, his family permanently migrated to Kolkata in 1947. As a child Gupta always dreamed of becoming a writer. He once went to Shantiniketan to seek the blessings of Rabindranath Tagore and took his autograph. At the age of eighteen he composed his first novel, Rajkumar. After schooling, Gupta took admission in the Calcutta Medical College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta. During his stay in England he developed a keen interest in detective stories and met Agatha Christie. After coming back to India, he wrote his first detective novel, Kalo Bhramar (meaning The Black Hornet), which launched his detective character Kiriti Roy [‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶ü‡ßÄ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º]. In his literary career Gupta has composed over two hundred novels, plays, short stories and essays. The most popular among them are Ulka, Badshah, Lalubhulu, Uttarphalguni, Asti Bhagirathi Tire, Mayur Mahal, Devyani, Neeltara, Mayamriga, Komalgandhar and Nishipadma. Forty five of his novels have been made into Bengali and Hindi feature films in Tollywood and Bollywood respectively. He was also the editor of a children's magazine named Sabuj Sahitya.  Legacy  In 1988, S.M. Sultan founded the Shishuswarga-2 at the ancestral house of Gupta in Itna. It was officially inaugurated on 24 November 1993, by the Mohammad Ali Hossain, the then District Magistrate of Narail. However, the activities of the children's organisation ceased after the death of S.M.Sultan. In 2003, the archaeological department of Bangladesh notified the acquisition of Gupta's ancestral house, but has not made any repairs till date. At present the ancestral house of Nihar Ranjan Gupta lies in a dilapidated condition, infested by bats and illegal betting syndicates.

However, what distinguishes this thesaurus from all conventional thesauri is the inclusion of what the author calls rhetorically related words, or powernyms‚Äîas opposed to merely synonymous words. According to Heehler, these powernyms allow users to more readily transform rough drafts into more eloquent improvements. In \\"Rhetorical Form and Design,\\" Heehler serves up 17 lessons from such writers and speakers as T.S. Eliot, Margaret Atwood, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, Barack Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Cintra Wilson. Rhetorical and literary techniques covered include the objective correlative, rhetorical objectification, verb displacement, rhetorical agency, rhetorical tension, poetic articles, preposition exchange, creative number, and intuitive description.  Origins  According to Heehler, the idea for The Well-Spoken Thesaurus came to him while attending the Harvard Extension School, where he came to realize just how poorly spoken he truly was. And because there were no books available with which to solve his problem, he began to create a database of eloquent words. Whenever he would chance upon a well-spoken word or phrase at Harvard, he would pair that with what he would have said. After three years of doing this, of \\"collecting words like butterflies,\\" he decided that his \\"butterfly collection\\" could be of use to others.

Palazzo di San Clemente (also called Palazzo del Pretendente) is a residential palace in Florence, Italy. History Along the current Via Capponi there was a small building visible in the plan of the city from 1584, which was acquired and enlarged by Luigi di Toledo, brother of Grand Duchess Eleanor of Toledo. Late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari speaks about it in the Life of Jacopo Sansovino. In 1634 the Guadagni family bought it, entrusting architect Gherardo Silvani with the renovation of the palace and the garden (1644). The edifice was thus transformed into a suburban villa, of the type then known as a Casino. The family owned it until 1777, when they sold it to Bonnie Prince Charlie, who then used the alias of count of Albany; since the latter was the legitimist pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, Ireland and France, the palace is also called Palazzo del Pretendente. Later it went to Simone Velluti Zati, duke of San Clemente, hence the current name. Russian prince Nikolai Demidov was his guest here in 1882. The edifice is a seat of the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Florence.

It is owned by Lotus Communications. Its studios are located in southwest Bakersfield, while its transmitter is located northeast of the city. It is a Classic Hits station branded Q92.1 (pronounced Q ninety-two-one). History =Early Years= The station received its construction permit in 1985, and signed on as KIWI in 1987. In 1999, Lotus Communications acquired the station. The sale was consummated on August 24 of that year. For much of its existence before 2003, it played classical music. On January 21, 2003, the station changed its call sign to KPSL-FM. Over the years, the station would become a latin music station with the Concierto branding. On September 8, 2011, KPSL-FM swapped callsigns and formats with KVMX. With the format swap, it became a classic hits station branded as \\"The New 92-1 Max-FM\\".Bakersfield Frequency Swap Coming RadioInsight - August 16, 2011 On May 6, 2013, KVMX flipped to country, branded as \\"KiX 92.1\\".KVMX Bakersfield Goes Country RadioInsight - May 6, 2013 During this time, KVMX would carry syndicated programming from Premiere Networks, including a country countdown show. This format would last for slightly over 3 years. =Simulcast of KCHJ= On July 1, 2016, KVMX broke away from country programming and began simulcasting KCHJ 1010 AM, with its \\"El Gallito\\" branding and Ranchera format.

In the report, a launch date of July 15 was stated, with the planned on air branding Q92.1. On July 11, Lotus confirmed the rumors, and formally announced the format change to Rhythmic CHR, with the launch date later being pushed back to July 22, in order to allow more time to construct its social media and web pages. As part of the upcoming format change, the station's callsign became KQKZ on July 15. KQKZ officially flipped to the new format at 6:00am on July 22, with its present Q92.1 branding, patterned after KSEQ. KQKZ also used KSEQ's on air personalities in key dayparts, but is still expected to air Bakersfield advertisements, news, traffic and weather. =Return to Classic Hits= On August 5, 2020, during the midday program, KQKZ suffered an external glitch, that resulted in the station playing classic hits for approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. Normal programming was restored at 1:00pm that day. Media watchdogs had suggested possible plans for the station to drop the format after 13 months during the affected period; KQKZ had a mere 0.1 share in the June 2020 Nielsen Audio ratings. Shortly after normal programming resumed, the web link on KQKZ's social pages was changed to KSEQ's website. On September 2, 2020, the airstaff (voicetracking from KSEQ) bade farewell to its listeners via Instagram in advance of planned changes. At midnight on September 3rd, 2020, after playing \\"Blinding Lights\\" by The Weeknd, KQKZ flipped back to Classic Hits keeping the \\"Q92.1\\" branding, the glitch turned out to be the forthcoming change. The first song under the classic hits format was \\"Dance with Me\\" by Orleans. On that same day would KQKZ abandon all of its social media pages. The format change marked a return of the format to the San Joaquin valley area, as KQKZ previously broadcast the format as KVMX from 2011 to 2013.

He also made sorties into the then wilds of Arabia, Tasmania, Melbourne's Yarra Bank and various other outposts of the erstwhile British Empire. Webster, who almost exclusively referred to himself in the third person, cultivated a provocative oratorical style of delivering a wide-reaching and eclectic philosophy in a hybrid carny barking cockney/Australian accent. He was the most prominent and listened-to of all long term speakers at the Sydney Domain. Journalist John Edwards wrote in 1971 \\"The only (modern) force is the inimitable (sic) Webster who, lately returned from England, is responsible for most of the popularity of the (Sydney) Domain.\\"John Edwards: The National Times, Dec 27th 1971 p. 5 Nene King observed of a day spent at the Sydney Domain \\"Webster (no first name, no mister) commanded the largest audience as he waved a verbal flag for the British Empire - 'We Englishmen are God's gift to the whole world.'\\"Nene King: The Sydney Morning Herald, June 28, 1971 p. 8 Early life Webster was born in London in December 1913. His father battled alcoholism and his mother was in The Salvation Army. His grandparents were Irish. As a teenager, Webster was a Salvation Army soldier and worked in dispatch at the Army's Trade Headquarters. At the age of 18 Webster became disillusioned, left The Salvation Army and became an atheist.'An Interesting Life, Lived to the Full' in On Fire Magazine, 2008 Ideological development and worldview Webster, by his own confession, navigated the whole gamut of ideological spectra from the centre to the far left, then over to the extreme right and back to the middle again. A communist rabble rouser in the 1940s, he went on to subscribe to the anti-semitic views of the British fascists,http://europeanaction.com/id109.html until he was approached by Sir Oswald Mosley who told him - inter alia - in 1947 \\"we can use the Jews.\\" This prompted Webster to reassess his own ideas and he subsequently wrote a letter of apology to the Jewish Chronicle of the times expressing his regrets about his former views.Richard Mckenzie: Sunday Telegraph, July 20, 1969 p. 37 The deployment of the famous name of the prophet of Islam in one of Webster's monikers hails from a time wherein he, having received the honorary title of Sheikh from the Hazhar University of Cairo while married to a Jewish woman, embraced the Islamic religion in order to marry a Moslem one. This marriage to a Persian woman in 1963 was as brief as his previous marriage to the Jewish lady. He told journalist Linda Hornsey that he had been working for the Ministry of Information when he suggested on a television programme, amongst other things, that the Arabs should make peace with Israel: \\"After that I made a quick but quiet retreat from the Middle East\\".Linda Hornsey: The Weekender, May 25, 1974 p. 27 He told the same journalist that he had once been a \\"card- carrying member\\" of the Communist party, then a fascist, a mystical Moslem of Sufistic leaning before evolving into a \\"simple\\" humanist. He had come to see adherence to doctrinaire creeds as dangerous, and planned to set up an \\"ecological workshop on religion\\", where anyone willing could come to have their religion \\"tested\\".Linda Hornsey: \\"Now, get on your Marx\\" The Advocate, May 17, 1974 p. 3 Oratorical style and technique Webster was wont to claim that his purpose in orating was to inspire people to think for themselves. His method was one of deliberate provocation, conscious deployment of irony, \\"verbal cartooning\\" and a razor edged wit attested to by all commentators of the time. \\"I have never yet heard Webster bettered by a heckler, nor stuck for some kind of answer to a question.\\"The Society Spy, Daily Telegraph, April 23, 1968 p. 26 \\"It could be argued that the greatest demagogue in Australia today is a 53-year-old Cockney named Muhammed (sic) John Webster\\" wrote Sydney Morning Herald journalist Gavin Souter in 1966, \\"There is no one in the Australian Parliaments to match him, and in Sydney's Domain he has no real competition.\\"Gavin Souter: \\"Sydney's Muhammed is also the Greatest\\": The Sydney Morning Herald, July 21, 1966 p. 6 \\"Webster insults, abuses and ridicules his audience. The response, in laughter and applause, would be the envy of any television comic\\" observed Jim Oram.Jim Oram: \\"Meet the Sunday spruikers\\" PIX Magazine, August 31, 1968 p. 30 Personal life Though he was married twice he had a number of gay relationships. Passing and Legacy The late Reverend Ted Noffs, founder of the Wayside Chapel in Kings Cross, New South Wales claimed \\"Here at the Chapel, Webster has helped to make what we call the Family of Man a reality.\\" The Uniting Church of Australia's Reverend Bill Crews (clergyman), host of a free restaurant catering to the poor and indigent in Ashfield, New South Wales, made frequent visits to Webster's domicile in Webster's declining years. He remarked that \\"He (Webster) influenced so many people, taught us how to think in lots of ways...I think he thought he'd live forever\\" Webster died quietly at a secret retreat in Launceston, Tasmania shortly before his 96th birthday, leaving no immediate heirs.

Above Sydney airport there was cloud at about but no thunderstorm activity. Flight 325 was observed to enter cloud shortly after take off. Five other aircraft took off while this meteorological situation existed. Flight 325 was directed to take-off and continue heading east towards the Tasman Sea until reaching an altitude of , turn around and fly west to a radio navigation aid west of the airport and then turn south- west for Canberra. The crew were to ensure they passed over the airport no lower than . Five minutes after takeoff the crew advised they had reached . About 3¬Ω minutes later, Sydney air traffic control called Flight 325 with a routine request for information but received no reply. No further radio communication was received from Flight 325 so when it did not arrive at Canberra airport authorities knew it had suffered an accident. An air search was planned to commence at dawn.\\"Airliner Believed Down In Sea\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 1 December 1961, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013 Approximately 9 minutes after takeoff the outer section of the right wing had been torn away and the aircraft had crashed into Botany Bay. The rain, thunder and lightning associated with the thunderstorm over Botany Bay had been so intense that no-one saw the aircraft or observed anything crash into the water. Accident Investigator Frank Yeend wrote \\"The weather was so bad that this aircraft crashed in the middle of a major city without anybody having seen it or heard anything that would give cause to alarm.\\" Search and recovery When it became clear Flight 325 was not responding to radio calls and the aircraft could not be seen on the radar screen in the control tower the Alert Phase of search and rescue procedures was initiated. The Police, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy and Volunteer Coastal Patrol were notified. A message was broadcast on the radio frequency used by coastal shipping. The Department of Civil Aviation air-sea rescue launch based on Botany Bay made a circuit of the Bay's foreshores. When Flight 325 failed to arrive at its destination, search and rescue procedures were elevated to the Distress Phase. In the hours after loss of contact with Flight 325 no report was received of an aircraft accident so there was general foreboding that it had crashed into the Tasman Sea. At first light the next morning two Douglas DC-3 aircraft began searching the sea to the east of Sydney. A helicopter and several motor launches also began searching Botany Bay. Soon after sunrise the crew of the helicopter reported an item floating on Botany Bay.\\"Airliner Split Open In Crash\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 2 December 1961, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013 The crew of the air-sea rescue launch investigated the sighting and retrieved a piece of damaged upholstery. Airline staff confirmed the upholstery was from a Vickers Viscount pilot's seat. Searchers on the beach in the north-east of Botany Bay, near Bunnerong Power Station, found some cabin furnishings and human remains. At the south of the Bay the outer section of the right wing, still showing registration VH-TVC, was found protruding above the surface of shallow water near Kurnell. Later in the day Police and Navy divers investigated a large fuel slick in the centre of Botany Bay and discovered the scattered wreckage of VH-TVC in of water, north of the outer section of the right wing. The aircraft had crashed south- east of Sydney airport. The Royal Australian Navy sent a team of clearance divers and HMAS Kimbla, a boom defence vessel, to Botany Bay and brought the main wreckage of VH-TVC to the surface. After a week Kimbla was replaced by HMAS Walrus, a smaller workboat from which the Navy divers worked for many weeks, locating and recovering many smaller pieces of wreckage.\\"Vital Plane Parts Found\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 18 January 1962, p.3 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013 The right tailplane was missing from the main wreckage. Navy divers eventually found the missing parts of the tailplane close to where the outer section of the right wing was found, indicating the right tailplane was also torn from the aircraft prior to its impact with the water. Numerous small items, including many from the number 4 engine nacelle, were found on Kurnell peninsula, south of the outer section of the right wing. The wreckage trail was aligned approximately north-south with the main wreckage at the north in Botany Bay; and the smaller, lighter items at the south on Kurnell peninsula. The aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder so it was important that as much as possible of the wreckage should be recovered and examined.Developments in Flight Recorder Equipment and Analysis ‚Äì p.2 Retrieved 9 September 2011 The recovery effort continued for 3 months.La Perouse ‚Äì Blast From The Past. Retrieved 9 September 2011 The top section of the rudder was not found during the recovery of the wreckage. Twelve years after the accident the missing section was found in shallow water in Botany Bay, near Kurnell Beach. Investigation As pieces of wreckage from VH-TVC were progressively recovered from Botany Bay they were laid out in a hangar at Sydney airport to allow investigators to search for the cause of the accident. The right tailplane and the outer section of the right wing had received almost no damage on impact with the water but the main wreckage in Botany Bay showed extensive disintegration, suggesting a very high speed of impact. No evidence was found of any fault or mechanical failure that might have existed prior to the accident. It soon became clear that the spar in the right wing had broken and the outer section of the wing had been torn away by the airstream. The lower boom (or lower flange) in the wing spar had failed in upward bending at station 323 due to extreme overload. The wing had been overloaded while the aircraft was flying at very high speed, probably in excess of the maximum safe speed of indicated airspeed. As an immediate consequence of the aircraft's gyrations during failure of the right wing, the right tailplane had also been subjected to excessive forces and had separated from the fuselage. Engineers assisting the accident investigation calculated that for the wing spar to fail in the way it did in VH-TVC would require the aircraft to be flying faster than its maximum speed of and, while being subjected to a severe recovery manoeuvre by the crew, to encounter a very strong gust, possibly as much as . At the time of the accident investigation, gusts up to had been measured inside thunderstorms by suitably equipped research aircraft. Investigators were aware of the crash of Capital Airlines Flight 75, a Vickers Viscount that crashed in Maryland, USA in May 1959 after encountering extreme turbulence associated with thunderstorms. All the wreckage lay in a trail aligned north- south. By making assumptions about the likely terminal velocities of key pieces of wreckage, accident investigators were able to determine the approximate location, height and speed of the aircraft at the time it broke up. They believed the outer section of the right wing was torn away when the aircraft was south of its intended flight path, heading in a northerly direction, and at a height between . They believed this occurred at a time when the aircraft should have been at about , heading west and passing over a radio navigation aid nine miles away. It was necessary for the investigation to find a rational explanation as to why the aircraft was so far from where it should have been. Accident investigators studied a scientific report titled The Thunderstorm published in the USA in 1949. This report proposed that where two thunderstorms were separated, edge to edge, by less than there was a likelihood of severe turbulence in the clear air between the two. The accident investigators believed it was likely that Flight 325, while flying west between two mature thunderstorms, encountered strong turbulence that caused the crew to lose control and the aircraft to lose a significant amount of height and enter the thunderstorm to the south of the airport. While flying north, possibly in an attempt to escape the thunderstorm, the crew encountered continuing strong turbulence that caused control to be lost again. The aircraft accelerated to its maximum safe speed or faster and while the crew were struggling to regain control the aircraft was suddenly subjected to extreme turbulence that caused the right wing and the right tailplane to fail.  Board of Accident Inquiry  A Board of Accident Inquiry was appointed in 1962 to investigate all aspects of the accident to Flight 325. chairman of the board was Mr Justice Spicer of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Board first convened on 12 June 1962, sat for 24 days and closed on 27 July 1962.\\"Collapse of Wing In Storm Blamed\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 13 June 1962, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 26 December 2013 Investigation of the accident concluded: > The cause of the accident was the failure in flight of the starboard outer > wing in upward bending due to tensile overloading of the lower spar boom at > station 323, probably induced by a combination of manoeuvre and gust loading > when the speed of the aircraft was in excess of 260 knots.

Henry Aaron Stern, D.D. 1886 He was the youngest son of Aaron Stern, a Jew, and Hannah his wife, was born in the Duchy of Hessen-Kassel. He received his education at a school in Frankfurt, to which place his parents had removed when he was young. His father destined him for the medical profession, but, at his son's special request, sent him when seventeen years old to Hamburg to be trained for a commercial life. In 1839 Stern received the offer of a good appointment in London, but the firm failed, and he found himself unsuccessful in obtaining employment. While in London he was taken to the Palestine Place chapel, where, through the influence of Dr. McCaul, he became a Christian, and was baptised on 15 March 1840. He was then placed in the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution, where he learned the trade of a printer. In August 1842 he was admitted into the Hebrew College of the London Jews' Society, with the ultimate intention of becoming a missionary to the Jews. Stern was first sent by the London Jews Society to Jerusalem, where he was ordained as a deacon on 14 July 1844 by the first Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, Michael Solomon Alexander in St. James's Chapel at Jerusalem, then traveling onwards to Bagdad. In 1849 during a visit to England he was ordained an Anglican priest in the Chapel Royal at Whitehall on 23 December 1849 by the bishop of London. Stern returned to Bagdad in the following June, and stayed there for three more years before being transferred 1853-1859 to Istanbul. left The London Jews' Society then directed Stern to travel to Ethiopia to preach to the Beta Israel Jews, arriving on March 10, 1860.Don Seeman One People, One Blood: Ethiopian-Israelis and the Return to Judaism Page 47 2010 \\"Henry Aaron Stern arrived in Ethiopia on March 10, 1860.\\" On his return from Ethiopia he was founder of the Hebrew Christian Prayer Union of London, 1882, later included into Carl Schwartz' Hebrew Christian Alliance of Great Britain.

Stern was summoned to appear before the emperor at Gondar in October 1863 where Stern was beaten and imprisoned together with a Mr. Rosenthal, his LJS assistant. By the time they were transferred to prison at Amba Magdala, in November 1864 they were joined by the British consul, Charles Cameron, and other Europeans. Stern's situation was made more difficult by the fact that the emperor was made aware of uncomplimentary material in Stern's book - including having stated that the emperor's mother was a vendor of kosso - in Wanderings among the Falashas in Abyssinia: together with a description of the Country and its various Inhabitants 1862.

Location It is located just off the Kalumburu Road west of Kununurra and east of Derby in the Kimberley region. Description The station is approximately in size and runs about 7,000 head of cattle. History The traditional owners of the area are the Ngarinjin, Miwa and Wilawila peoples. The pastoral lease is currently owned by the Koeyers family who took up the lease in 1985. The Koeyers run about 8,000 head of cattle on the million acre, property. The area was initially taken up in 1882 by the Victorian Squatting Company and the Drysdale River was named by explorer Charles Burrowes in 1886. The company estimated the size of the run as being about 5 million acres, or . Burrowes had been sent by the company to survey it and compile a report, wrote a glowing account of the country and prophesizeda great future for it. Captain Joe Bradshaw took up the lease in 1891 as part of a large area extending along the Prince Regent River. While lost during an exploration of the area Bradshaw stumbled across the Indigenous Australian Gwion Rock paintings which are over 50,000 years old and are commonly referred to as the Bradshaws once rediscovered in 1998. He sent his steamer, the Red Gauntlet, ahend of him with Aeneas Gunn to construct stockyards while Bradshaw began to drove his herd overland from Queensland. Bradshaw was met at the border by a party of policemen who demanded a tax of 1 pound per head to bring them into Western Australia. He refused and took his stock down the Victoria River to establish another station, Bradshaw's Run now known as Bradshaw Station. The remoteness of the station was partially remedied by the surveying and construction of the Kalumburu Road from the Gibb River Road to Kalumburu in 1954. Dick Condon acquired the property in 1967 with the intention of making many improvements, he spent a large amount of money on the station including the construction of a new homestead. The homestead was to be situated close to the river until it was noticed the debris stuck in the treetops along the riverbanks. It was then built from the river, just far enough to avoid being inundated by the floods of 1986 and 1997. Condon sold the property off to an overseas company and it was left to fall into disrepair. The station is almost inaccessible by road during the wet season between December and May each year. During this time the area is dependent on the station's airstrip which was upgraded in 2002 following funding from the state government in 2001. In 2012 the leasee was Sunlight Holdings, Drysdale River is operating under the Crown Lease numbers CL515-1967 and CL539-1995 and has the Land Act numbers LA398/446 and LA398/844.

It is cell proliferation that does not occur by mitosis, the mechanism usually identified as essential for cell division in eukaryotes. The polyploid macronucleus found in ciliates divides amitotically. While normal mitosis results in a precise division of parental alleles, amitosis results in a random distribution of parental alleles. Ploidy levels of >1000 in some species means both parental alleles can be maintained over many generations, while species with fewer numbers of each chromosome will tend to become homozygous for one or the other parental allele through a process known as phenotypic or allelic assortment. It does not involve maximal condensation of chromatin into chromosomes, observable by light microscopy as they line up in pairs along the metaphase plate. It does not involve these paired structures being pulled in opposite directions by a mitotic spindle to form daughter cells. Rather, it effects nuclear proliferation without the involvement of chromosomes, unsettling for cell biologists who have come to rely on the mitotic figure as reassurance that chromatin is being equally distributed into daughter cells. The phenomenon of amitosis, even though it is an accepted as occurring in ciliates, continues to meet with skepticism about its role in mammalian cell proliferation, perhaps because it lacks the reassuring iconography of mitosis. Of course the relatively recent discovery of copy number variations (CNV's) in mammalian cells within an organ significantly challenges the age-old assumption that every cell in an organism must inherit an exact copy of the parental genome to be functional. Rather than CNV's resulting from mitosis gone awry, some of this variation may arise from amitosis, and may be both desirable and necessary. Furthermore, it is well to remember that ciliates possess a mechanism for adjusting copy numbers of individual genes during amitosis of the macronucleus. Despite the passage of more than a century since its description by Walther Flemming (more celebrated for describing mitosis) and others (Child, 1907) the process has not received much attention. Using \\"mitosis in mammalian cells\\" as a search term in the Medline data-base calls up more than 10,000 studies dealing with mitosis, whereas \\"amitosis in mammalian cells\\" retrieves the titles of fewer than 50 papers. Not surprisingly, this absence of data has led many scientists to conclude that amitosis does not exist, or is minimally important‚Äîif any means of proliferation can be deemed \\"minimally important\\" while the war on cancer is not yet won. Accordingly, and despite being very much out of fashion, a resurgence of interest in the role of amitosis in mammalian proliferation has been building over the past two to three decades. A review of the resulting literature not only affirms the involvement of amitosis in cell proliferation, it also explores the existence of more than one amitotic mechanism capable of producing \\"progeny nuclei\\" without the involvement of \\"mitotic chromosomes.\\" One form of amitosis involves fissioning, a nucleus splitting in two without the involvement of chromosomes, and has been reported in placental tissue as well as in cells grown from that tissue in rats, in human trophoblasts, and in mouse trophoblasts. Amitosis by fissioning has also been reported in mammalian liver cells and human adrenal cells. Chen and Wan not only reported amitosis in rat liver, but also presented a mechanism for a four-stage amitotic process whereby chromatin threads are reproduced and equally distributed to daughter cells as the nucleus splits in two. Additional examples of non-mitotic proliferation, and important insights into underlying mechanisms, have resulted from extensive work with polyploid cells. Such cells, long acknowledged to exist, were once believed simply to be anomalous. Accumulating research, including in the liver now suggests that cells containing multiple copies of the genome are importantly involved in a cell's ability to adapt to its environment. A couple of decades of research has shown that polyploid cells are frequently \\"reduced\\" to diploid cells by amitosis (Zybina et al.). For instance, naturally occurring polyploid placental cells have been shown capable of producing nuclei with diploid or near-diploid complements of DNA. Furthermore, Zybina and her colleagues have demonstrated that such nuclei, derived from polyploid placental cells, receive one or more than onr copies of a microscopically identifiable region of the chromatin, demonstrating that even without the reassuring iconography of identical chromosomes being distributed into \\"identical\\" daughter cells, this particular amitotic process results in representative transmission of chromatin. Studying rat polyploid trophoblasts, this research group has shown that the nuclear envelope of the giant nucleus is involved in this subdivision of a highly polyploid nucleus into low-ploidy nuclei. Polyploid cells are also at the heart of experiments to determine how some cells may survive chemotherapy. Erenpreisa and colleagues have shown that following treatment of cultured cells with mitosis-inhibiting chemicals (similar to what is used in some chemotherapy), a small population of induced polyploid cells survives. Eventually this population can give rise to \\"normal\\" diploid cells by formation of polyploid chromatin bouquets that return to an interphase state, and separate into several secondary nuclei. Intriguing phenomena including controlled autophagic degradation of some DNA as well as production of nuclear envelope-limited sheets accompanies the process. Since neither of these depolyploidizations involves mitotic chromosomes, they conform to the broad definition of amitosis. There are also multiple reports of amitosis occurring when nuclei bud out through the plasma membrane of a polyploid cell. Such a process has been shown to occur in amniotic cells transformed by a virus as well as in mouse embryo fibroblast lines exposed to carcinogens. A similar process called extrusion has been described for mink trophoblasts, a tissue in which fissioning is also observed. Asymmetric cell division has also been described in polyploid giant cancer cells and low eukaryotic cells and reported to occur by the amitotic processes of splitting, budding, or burst- like mechanisms. Similarly, two different kinds of amitosis have been described in monolayers of Ishikawa endometrial cells (Fleming, 2014) An example of amitosis particularly suited to the formation of multiple differentiated nuclei in a reasonably short period of time has been shown to occur during the differentiation of fluid-enclosing hemispheres called domes from adherent Ishikawa endometrial monolayer cells during an approximately 20-hour period. (Fleming 1995; Fleming, 1999) Aggregates of nuclei from monolayer syncytia become enveloped in mitochondrial membranes, forming structures (mitonucleons) that become elevated as a result of vacuole formation during the initial 6 hours of differentiation (Fleming 1998; Fleming, 2015a). Over the next 4 or 5 hours, chromatin from these aggregated nuclei becomes increasingly pycnotic, eventually undergoing karyolysis and karyorrhexis in the now-elevated predome structures (Fleming, 2015b). In other systems such changes accompany apoptosis but not in the differentiating Ishikawa cells, where the processes appear to accompany changes in DNA essential for the newly created differentiated dome cells. Finally, the chromatin filaments emerging from these processes form a mass from which dozens of dome nuclei are amitotically generated (Fleming, 2015c)over a period of approximately 3 hours with the apparent involvement of nuclear envelope- limited sheets. That all of this may be an iceberg tip is suggested by research from Walter Thilly's laboratory. Examination of fetal gut (5 to 7 weeks), colonic adenomas, and adenocarcinomas has revealed nuclei that look like hollow bells encased in tubular syncytia. These structures can divide symmetrically by an amitotic nuclear fission process, forming new \\"bells\\". Or they can fission asymmetrically resulting in one of seven other nuclear morphotypes, five of which appear to be specific to development since they are rarely observed in adult organisms. The research that is accumulating about amitosis suggests that such processes are, indeed, involved in the production of the breathtaking 37 trillion or so cells in humans, perhaps particularly during the fetal and embryonic phases of development when the majority of these cells are produced, perhaps within the complexity of implantation, perhaps when large numbers of cells are being differentiated, and perhaps in cancerous cells. A word of caution: some examples of cell division formerly thought to belong to this \\"non-mitotic\\" class, such as the division of some unicellular eukaryotes, may actually occur by the process of \\"closed mitosis\\" different from open or semi-closed mitotic processes, all involving mitotic chromosomes and classified by the fate of the nuclear envelope.

She is the longest tenured CEO in the history of YouTube. Wojcicki was involved in the founding of Google, and became Google's first marketing manager in 1999. She later led the company's online advertising business and was put in charge of Google's original video service. After observing the success of YouTube, Wojcicki proposed the acquisition of YouTube by Google in 2006, and has served as CEO of YouTube since 2014. Wojcicki has an estimated net worth of nearly $500 million. Early life and education Susan Diane Wojcicki was born on July 5, 1968 to Esther Wojcicki, an educator of Russian-Jewish descent, and Stanley Wojcicki, a Polish American physics professor at Stanford University. She has two sisters: Janet Wojcicki, (PhD, anthropologist and epidemiologist) and Anne Wojcicki, founder of 23andMe.I raised 2 successful CEOs and a doctor‚Äîhere‚Äôs one of the biggest mistakes I see parents making, Esther Wojcicki, Published Wed, May 8, 2019, cnbc.com. She grew up on the Stanford campus with George Dantzig as a neighbor. She attended Gunn High School in Palo Alto, California, and wrote for the school newspaper. Wojcicki's first business was selling \\"spice ropes\\" door-to-door at age 11. A humanities major in college, she took her first computer science class as a senior. Wojcicki studied history and literature at Harvard University and graduated with honors in 1990. She originally planned on getting a PhD in economics and pursuing a career in academia but changed her plans when she discovered an interest in technology. She also received her Master's of Science in economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993 and a Master of Business Administration from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1998. Career In September 1998, the same month that Google was incorporated, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up office in Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park. Before becoming Google's first marketing manager in 1999, Wojcicki worked in marketing at Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, California, and was a management consultant at Bain & Company and R.B. Webber & Company. At Google, she worked on the initial viral marketing programs, as well as the first Google Doodles. Wojcicki also worked on the development of Google Images and Google Books. In 2003, Wojcicki helped lead the development of AdSense. She served as its first product manager, and for her efforts, was awarded the Google Founders' Award. She became Google's senior vice president of Advertising & Commerce, and oversaw the company's advertising and analytic products, including AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics. YouTube, then a small start-up, was successfully competing with Google's Google Video service, overseen by Wojcicki. Her response was to propose the purchase of YouTube. She handled two of Google's largest acquisitions ‚Äî the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. =CEO of YouTube= In February 2014, Wojcicki became the CEO of YouTube. She was named one of Times 100 most influential people in 2015 and described in a later issue of Time as ‚Äúthe most powerful woman on the Internet.‚Äù While Wojcicki has been CEO of YouTube, it has reached 2 billion logged-in users a month and announced that users were collectively watching one billion hours a day. There are localized versions of YouTube in 100 countries around the world, available in 80 languages. Since taking on the role of CEO, YouTube's percentage of female employees has risen from 24 to nearly 30 percent. Wojcicki next to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw, Poland, 11 November 2018 Wojcicki has overseen the development and release of new YouTube applications and experiences designed to cater to users interested in family gaming, and music content. Under her leadership, the company has developed additional forms of monetization for YouTube creators, including channel memberships, merchandise, and Super Chat. She also oversaw the launch of YouTube's advertisement-free subscription service, YouTube Premium (formerly known as YouTube Red), and its over-the-top internet television service YouTube TV. Under Wojcicki, YouTube has tightened its policy on videos it regards as potentially violating its policies on hate speech and violent extremism. The more stringent policies came after The Times showed that \\"ads sponsored by the British government and several private sector companies had appeared ahead of YouTube videos supporting terrorist groups\\" and several large advertisers withdrew their ads from YouTube in response. The enforcement policies have been criticized as censorship. Some YouTubers argue that the demonetization system is way too strict, causing any remotely \\"edgy\\" content getting demonetized and in some cases even resulting in the creators channel being removed. During the controversy surrounding Logan Paul's YouTube video about a person that committed suicide, Wojcicki said that Paul did not violate YouTube's three strike policy and did not meet the criteria for being banned from the platform. Wojcicki has emphasized educational content as a priority for the company, and on July 20, 2018, announced YouTube Learning to invest in grants and promotion to support education-focused creator content. On October 22, 2018, Wojcicki criticized Article 13 of the European Union Copyright Directive that would give YouTube the sole responsibility for removing copyrighted content, saying it would pose a threat to content creators' ability to share their work. Boards In 2014, Wojcicki joined the board of Salesforce. She also serves on the board of Room to Read, an organization that focuses on literacy and gender equality in education, and is a board member of UCLA Anderson School of Management.

It debuted in 1974 under the direction of Garinei and Giovannini. An English version called Beyond the Rainbow, adapted by David Forrest with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, opened in November 1978 at the Adelphi Theatre in London's West End and ran for six months. Background Between 1973 and 1974, Sandro Giovannini and Pietro Garinei wrote with Iaia Fiastri a musical inspired by the novel After Me, the Deluge by David Forrest (the pseudonym of David Eliades and Robert Forrest-Webb). The total cost of the staging was about 250 million lire, due to the completion of the scenery in wood. The show received its title after a vote of the company, who preferred Aggiungi un Posto a Tavola (Add a seat at the table) to the alternatives. Actors who played in the first edition include Johnny Dorelli (Don Silvestro), Paolo Panelli (the mayor) and Bice Valori (Consolazione). Characters *Don Silvestro, priest *Clementina *San Crispino/Crisp√≠n, the Mayor *Tot√≥, the dummy *Consolazione/Consuelo/Consolation, prostitute *God Plot The play is divided in two acts. In the first act Don Silvestre receives a phone call from God announcing a second universal flood. He orders Don Silvestre to build an ark like Noah's and save the people of the village. When Don Silvestre announces this to the villagers and tells them God's will, the villager Mayor, Crisp√≠no, doesn't believe a word. The Mayor has a daughter named Clementina, who is secretly in love with the priest. After some little time God enables Don Silvestre to perform a miracle in order to convince everyone in town about the second universal flood and God's will. Good-time girl Consolazione arrives at the village‚Äîand with this things get complicated. Consolazione distracts every male in the village, thereby avoiding God's planned procreation one night before the flood, so God boosts the manhood of the village idiot, Toto, in order to distract Consolazione. When Toto announces he has fallen in love with Consolazione and wants to marry her and take her with him on the ark when it sails, the village women get angry and stop their men from working on the vessel. Don Silvestre intervenes and convinces the villagers to complete the ark. When it is finished and ready to sail several things happen that make the situation complicated. First the Vatican intervenes by sending a Cardinal to the village to try to lure the villagers away from Silvestro's control and the ark by treating them to a lavish meal. The first act finishes when people discover that the Mayor has gone missing. In the second act the Mayor, who has hidden himself in a statue, emerges to make a call to the authorities in order to stop Don Silvestre in his ‚Äúinsane idea‚Äù. The Mayor remains hidden until the wedding between Consolazione and Toto, but is discovered, captured and imprisoned. Clementina confesses to be in love with the priest who admits his own feelings for her. The ark is ready and Silvestre and Clementina are the only persons on board. The villagers are crowded below, unable to board because the boarding stairs had been taken away. Heavy rain starts falling and the flood quickly starts. God orders Silvestre to sail off with Clementina, but Silvestre refuses to leave all his people. In the darkness, God's orders get louder and louder over the thunder and lightning. But Silvestre still refuses to sail off. Instead, he decides to climb down a rope from the ark and join his villagers in death in the waters below. Because of Silvestre's willingness to sacrifice himself for his villagers, God relents and stops the flood and the impending end of all mankind. The sun comes out again. The final scene is of everyone celebrating with a big dinner that the flood is over. A brilliant rainbow hangs over them. God glides down a shaft of light from Heaven and celebrates with them.

The Conservative candidate was James Hutchison, who had been the MP for Glasgow Central from 1945 until the general election. Result of the previous general election Result of the by-election Outcome Reporting the result, The Glasgow Herald stated that the outcome of the election, an increased majority for the Conservatives, suggested that the Labour Party had lost ground in Scotland since the general election. Bargh felt that the intervention by the ILP had cost him victory, a view that Gibson, the ILP candidate did not share. The Conservative majority of 1,319 exceeded the number of votes (680) received by Gibson.

She felt under enormous pressure going into the Sydney Games due to being the 200m title holder from Atlanta. She said \\"I did feel a lot of pressure, but the greatest pressure I felt was the pressure I put on myself. I remember before my final in the 200m, I felt like I was going to be physically sick. I‚Äôd never felt like that before. My usual mindset was ‚Äòwhatever happens, happens.\\" In late 2001, Winters decided to take some time out from sport. She resumed training in late 2002, this time training with Fira Dvoskina in Sydney.

Preparation In the first step, beef, pork and mutton are seared. Then the vegetables are added, which are usually potatoes, diced carrots and parsley, cut cabbage and leek. Subsequently meat broth is poured over the mixture and everything is cooked together (some recipes also add diced onions and garlic). In Swabia, it is common to serve the marrow of the bones with which the broth was made together with the finished stew as a garnish. As the dish is very easy to prepare, Pichelsteiner is often prepared in large-scale catering kitchens. Its consistency is normally quite thick. Etymology The creation of this dish has been traced to Auguste Winkler (n√©e Kiesling). Originally from Kirchberg im Wald, she worked as an innkeeper in Grattersdorf, where she is also buried. The name is likely to have derived from the nearby B√ºchelstein mountain, where the annual B√ºchelsteiner Fest has been celebrated since 1839. As early as the 40th anniversary in 1879, the open-air-cooking festival was considered a tradition, and because the letter √º is pronounced like i in the local dialect, the dish's name developed. In Regen, a town in the Bavarian Forest, the citizens have met annually since 1874 on Kirchweih Monday to eat Pichelsteiner together, a tradition that is still alive today. They also claim the name's etymology. In their opinion, it derives from the pot in which the stew is cooked, which was called a pichel in the past, but this version is highly questioned by Bavarian researcher Max Peinkofer. The dish was first mentioned in a cookbook in 1894.

Playing career Genovese began his major league career on April 29, 1950, appearing as a pinch hitter for pitcher Ray Scarborough. He would walk against New York Yankees' pitcher Allie Reynolds in his first career plate appearance. In his next game, May 5, Genovese pinch hit for pitcher Mickey Harris and grounded out. He pinch ran for catcher Al Evans in his third and final game (May 6), scoring a run when Eddie Yost doubled him home two batters later. He played considerably longer in the minor leagues, beginning his career in 1940 and ending it in 1957, at the age of 35. He did not play from 1943 to 1945, as minor league baseball was interrupted due to World War II, a war in which he served.

Mantua, Italy ‚Äì 21 October 1483, Bologna, Italy ) was an Italian bishop and a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church during the reigns of Popes Pius II, Paul II and Sixtus IV.  Background  Born in Mantua on 15 March 1444, Francesco Gonzaga was the second son of Ludovico III Gonzaga, the second Marquis of Mantua, and his wife Barbara of Brandenburg. His mother was the daughter of John, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and the niece of Emperor Sigismund of the Holy Roman Empire. His first education was in the \\"Ca' Giocosa\\" under Iacopo da San Cassiano, Ognibene da Lonigo, and Bartolomeo Platina. After completing his studies at Padua, Francesco went to the University of Pisa. After he graduated, he was appointed by Pope Nicholas V to the offices of prothonotary apostolic in February 1454 and later of the Procurator of the Church for Mantua. Although he had chosen an ecclesiastical career, he led a mostly secular life. In 1477, when he had already been a Cardinal for eleven years, a certain BarbaraMantovani, Il castello di Castel d'Ario, no page given. bore him an illegitimate son, Francesco ( ‚Ä† 1511 ), nicknamed \\"il Cardinalino [ The Little Cardinal ]\\".

Two years later, on 18 July 1466, the Bishop of Mantua, Galeazzo Cavriani, died and Francesco was appointed a month later, on 20 August, to succeed him. His great grandfather's first cousin, Sagramoso Gonzaga ( 1360 ‚Äì 1405 ), had been the Bishop of Mantua for four years ( 1386 ‚Äì 1390 ). But Francesco's own title was the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Mantua. He would keep it until his death \\"Diocese of Mantova\\", Catholic Hierarchy, retrieved 21 January 2014. but he was never raised to the rank of Bishop. He would be succeeded by five consecutive members of his family. The first two were Apostolic Administrators but the third, Ercole Cardinal Gonzaga, Francesco's grandnephew, was the first to be Bishop. Francesco participated in the secret consistories of 7 January 1467 and 30 June 1470. During the consistory celebrated at the basilica of St. Mark on 18 February 1471, Pope Paul II appointed him the Papal legate a latere [ Latin, ‚Äúfrom the [ Pope's] side\\" ] to Bologna and at the same time Francesco was appointed Apostolic Commissioner for the Paternal States [ commissario apostolico per gli stati paterni ], with the authority to persuade their dioceses in favor of a crusade against the Turks, which was, however, not accomplished at that time. During his stay in Rome, where he had by then made his home, Francesco, with Marco Cardinal Barbo, welcomed the new Duke of Ferrara, Borso d'Este. He left Rome for Bologna on 5 July 1471 and arrived in Emilia on 21 July. = Under Pope Sixtus IV = Portrait of Francesco Cardinal Gonzaga from the Camera degli Sposi, a fresco by Andrea Mantegna. Francesco then returned to Rome on 4 August of that year to participate in the conclave of 1471 that elected Francesco della Rovere as Pope Sixtus IV. For his legation in Bologna, Gonzaga was confirmed by the new Pope and received commendam also the Abbey of San Gregorio at Mantua but he renounced it on 18 March 1472 for the commendam of San Tommaso Maggiore at Verona. On 2 May 1472, during his stay in Bologna, he received at his palace Johannes Cardinal Bessarion, who was passing on his way to France to negotiate peace between the King of France, Louis XI, and the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold. In the spring of 1472, Francesco was appointed as the Apostolic Administrator of the Metropolitan See of Lund in Sweden when Tuve Nielsen Juul, the Archbishop of Lund, died on 7 April. For a while, it appeared that Gonzaga was about to be promoted to the rank of Archbishop but Jens Brostrup, who had already been elected by the Cathedral Chapter of Lund, managed to buy him out. Nevertheless, Francesco kept his position until 1474. But he took the time to arrange and host a banquet in Bologna for the French ambassadors sent by King Louis XI to Pope Sixtus IV. In 1472 he obtained the commendam of the monastery of Sant'Andrea in Mantua before he returned to Rome on 24 November 1473. In April 1474 he was given the responsibility for welcoming to Rome, with proper honors, King Christian I of Denmark and Norway at the Papal Court. As the reward for the excellence of his services, the Cardinal of Mantua was granted in 1475 by the Pope the commendam of the deaconry of Sant'Agata dei Goti, a church on Via Mazzarino in Rome. Francesco fled from Rome on 10 June 1476 because of the outbreak of the plague at the Papal Court. A month later, on 18 July, the Bishop of Bologna, Filippo Calandrini, died. He was replaced eight days later, on 26 July, by the Cardinal of Mantua as the Apostolic Administrator \\"Diocese of Bologna\\", Catholic Hierarchy, retrieved 21 January 2014. The Diocese of Bologna did not become the Archdiocese of Bologna until 1582. but, in March 1477, he was still in Rome.

However, he was never made the Bishop of Bologna; that title went after his death to Giuliano Cardinal della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II. Francesco had already resigned his office of the Abbot of the Monastery of San Dionigi ( Saint Dionysius ) in Milan on 18 January 1478, seven months before he left for Bologna, and he also resigned the commendam of the Monastery of Santa Maria alla Gironda at Cremona on 18 June 1479. It was given to his brother, Lodovico. On 28 December 1480 the Cardinal returned to Rome from his mission and was re-appointed as the Papal legate a latere to Bologna on 15 December 1482. But, before he could return to Bologna, he decided to go to Ferrara to encourage its residents to fight against the Republic of Venice, earning a reputation as a great orator.

History Rosalie Cadron was born on a farm north of Montreal on January 27, 1794. Her mother was a mid-wife, a skill she passed on to her daughter. At age 17, she married 33-year-old Jean-Marie Jett√©, and eventually bore eleven children, many of whom died very young. Madame Jett√©, now widowed, began her work by giving refuge to a prostitute. In the early 1840s, Bishop Bourget asked Jett√© if she would provide a safe, discreet, and welcoming home for expectant unmarried women. Madame agreed and provided shelter, not only in her own home, but in the homes of her adult children. From 1840 to 1845 Rosalie took in twenty-five women.Durocher, Eric. \\"Midwife of Mercy\\", Columbia, January 1, 2015 Bourget asked if she would form a religious congregation.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 February 2016 After the first year of religious formation In 1846 Eight sisters spent a year in religious formation after which they took the traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, together with a fourth vow to serve poor, single mothers. They then began formal medical training. As Madame Jett√© (Mother Mary of the Nativity) declined the role of Superior, Sister St. Jean de Chantal held this office. The institution was approved by Pope Pius IX on June 7, 1867.Currier, Charles Warren. \\"Sisters of Mercy, of Montreal\\", History of Religious Orders, P. Murphy, 1898 The Misericordia Sisters endeavored to carry out their ministry discreetly, for the public was neither supportive of their cause nor charitable. The sisters were accused of \\"encouraging vice\\". According to Sulpician Father √âric Sylvestre, \\"\\"When food was scarce, Rosalie would fast so that the moms could eat. She was fond of saying that ‚ÄòSingle mothers are the treasure of the house.‚Äô\\" The sisters came to New York City in 1887, and the following year opened the New York Mothers' Home of the Sisters of Misericorde at 106 W.123rd St. They later purchased a large house at 531 E.86th St., partly with a loan from the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank. The order was particularly sensitive to the social stigma attached to a woman who had born an illegitimate child. The sisters perceived that, by precluding other employment, this often tended to force a woman into prostitution, and in some cases infanticide. The sisters also conducted Magdalen asylums. Those who desired to remain in the home were placed under a special sister and were known as \\"Daughters of St. Margaret\\". They followed a certain rule of life but contracted no religious obligations. If they desired to remain in the convent, after a period of probation, they were allowed to eventually make the vows of the Magdalen order. The congregation spread into Western Canada, establishing the Misericordia Hospital in Edmonton in 1900. The Sisters of Misericorde operated the hospital until the 1970s, when it became part of what is now Covenant Health, a Catholic health care provider operating 18 facilities across Alberta, in cooperation with Alberta Health Services. In Toronto in 1914, the Misericordia Sisters started the St. Mary's Infant Home on Bond Street for maternity and infant care of single women and their children. This later moved to Jarvis Street, where they also began St. Mary's Hospital.

It comprises a single tribe, Stifftieae, of ten genera. These plants are vines, shrubs or small trees with thin to leathery, hairless of felty haired leaves with leaf stalks and entire margins, set alternately or rarely oppositely along the branches. The flower heads are at the tip of the branches or rarely in the axils of the leaves, on their own or in open to tightly packed cymes. The involucre may be narrowly cylindrical to half globular, and consists of at least three whorls of overlapping and gradually changing bracts. The common base of the florets (or receptacle) does not carry a bract (or palea) subtending each floret. The florets are all bisexual and may have either a ligulate corolla, a disk corolla, or a bilabiate corolla (three lobes merged to a strap with teeth at the tip and two lobes free much further down), and the lobes may be strongly coiled. The corolla can be yellow, orange, red, white, pink or purple. Like in all asterids, the anthers are fused into a tube, though which the style grows, picking up the pollen that is discarded at the inside of the tube. The anthers have spurs at their base and appendages at their tip. The styles have hairless shafts and mostly hairless branches (sometimes with papillae at the outside). The one-seeded indehiscent fruits (called cypselas) are cylindrical and carry a pappus of many white, straw-colored or bright orange or pink bristles (which may be feather-like). figure 2 illustrates corolla types References External links *Tolweb Stifftioideae *Stevens, P.

History Young women from Baden, Germany joined together for the perpetual adoration of the Most Precious Blood in the Blessed Sacrament, under the guidance of Reverend Karl Rolfus. The group began as a contemplative community. One of their number made a pilgrimage to the Marian shrine in Einsiedeln, Switzerland and to the nearby St. Anne shrine in Steinerberg. As at that time, German religious communities were not allowed to accept new members, Magdalene Weber led twelve of them to Switzerland. The Sisters of the Most Precious Blood was founded in Steinerberg, Switzerland on September 8, 1845, as a contemplative community. However, as Swiss law prohibited all strictly contemplative orders, they developed an apostolic character, as well.Payne CPPS, Barbara. \\"Foundations in Steinerberg, Switzerland\\", Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of O‚ÄôFallon, Missouri In the spring of 1848, the community re-located to Ottmarsheim, France, in the French Alsace, where, as they were German, they were precluded from teaching and so became contemplative once more. In 1857 Rev. Herman Kessler, pastor of Gurtweil, Baden, who had long desired to establish a home for destitute children and a normal school for the training of religious teachers, asked for six members of the community of the Sisters of the Precious Blood from Ottmarsheim, Alsace. They responded and began their work with twelve poor children under the direction of Father Kessler. Under the auspices of Archbishop von Vicari of Freiburg, a novitiate and normal school were established; the latter was affiliated with the educational department of Karlsruhe. Other schools and academies were opened. At Gurtweil, the Sisters taught students to make Church vestments, the beginning of their Ecclesiastical Art ministry.M√ºller, Ulrich, Sister Aim√©e de Marie, and Sister Mary Victoria. \\"Congregations of the Precious Blood.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 July 2019 In 1860, the congregation split, the contemplative sisters in Ottmarsheim, and the more apostolic in Gurtweil. In 1869 Bishop Junker of Alton, Illinois, asked for sisters for his diocese. In 1870 a number of sisters sailed for Belle Prairie (named Piopolis in 1877) in the Diocese of Alton, arriving on March 2. Meantime Bishop Baltes succeeded Bishop Junker; he entrusted to them several parochial school and promised further assistance on condition that the community should establish itself permanently in his diocese subject to his authority. The Superior of the community returned to Germany to present the matter to the Motherhouse.The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 424 In September 1871, Mother Augusta Volk, superior of the mother-house at Gurtweil, and twelve more sisters arrived in Springfield. Mother Augusta was apprehensive of a premature separation from Gurtweil, and was also opposed to limiting the sisters' activity to one diocese only. She went to St. Louis where through the efforts of Father Muehlsiepen, Vicar- General of St. Louis, the Sisters of the Precious Blood were received into the Archdiocese of St. Louis (1872) and obtained charge of a number of schools in Missouri and Nebraska. In the autumn of 1872, another fourteen sisters from Gurtweil arrived at the novitiate established in Belle Prairie. To make room for them, twenty sisters relocated to St. Louis, where the Rev. F. Leygraff, pastor of St. Agatha's had provided a home for the sisters until a motherhouse could be built. In 1873 the Kulturkampf had reached its climax and the entire community was expelled from Germany; some went to Rome, others settled in Bosnia, Hungary. In September, Fr. Muehlsiepen met forty-nine sisters in New York and conducted them to St. Louis, where the new Motherhouse was completed by July, 1875. At that time, the congregation split once again. Mother Clementine Zerr, mistress of novices, with a few professed sisters and the entire novitiate had resolved to follow the dictates of Bishop Baltes and establish a separate community in Belle Prairie. =Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of O‚ÄôFallon, Missouri (CPPS)= The O'Fallon community re-organized with a new rule and constitution and was incorporated in 1878 under the laws of the State of Missouri with the legal title of St. Mary's Institute of O'Fallon, Missouri.

History Ruins of L√∂wenberg by Heinrich Kraneck, 1830 Mother Maria Anna Brunner was born October 1, 1764, in Reckenkien, near M√ºmliswil-Ramiswil in the canton of Solothurn, Switzerland. A widowed mother of six children, she was known for baking bread and delivering it to the needy, and caring for orphans. In 1832, her son Nicholas (Rev. Francis de Sales Brunner) bought L√∂wenberg Castle at Schluein, which had been abandoned for 30 years, in order to found a school for poor boys. The following year, both Maria Anna and Father Brunner spent a nine-month pilgrimage in Rome, where they were enrolled in the Archconfraternity of the Most Precious Blood.M√ºller, Ulrich. \\"Francis de Sales Brunner.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 31 July 2019 Upon their return to L√∂wenberg, two women who had been hired to work at the castle were inspired to join Maria Anna for nocturnal hours of adoration. Other women soon joined the original three, and in 1834 Maria Anna obtained permission from the Bishop of Chur to lead a communal life with her small group of women. The rule was founded on that of St. Benedict and approved by the bishop, the object of the community being the adoration of the Most Precious Blood and the education of youth, including the care of orphans and homeless or destitute girls.M√ºller, Ulrich, Sister Aim√©e de Marie, and Sister Mary Victoria. \\"Congregations of the Precious Blood.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12.

In 1838, Father Brunner made a second visit to Rome, where he entered the Congregation of the Most Precious Blood at Albano. After his novitiate, he returned and continued the work he had previously begun, but also began educating boys for the priesthood, so as to inaugurate a German province of the congregation. The sisters then became affiliated with the Missionaries of the Precious Blood. America Maria Stein Convent In 1844, three Sisters of the Precious Blood came to the United States to minister to German immigrants in Ohio. Ten foundations of Precious Blood sisters, brothers and priests were established in western Ohio and in Jay County, Indiana. Besides providing food and clothing for themselves and other missionaries, they opened schools and orphanages, and took care of the sick.\\"Our History\\", Sisters of the Precious Blood In 1846, a motherhouse was established at Maria Stein, Ohio, named after the Benedictine monastery Father Brunner had first joined. Brunner donated a painted depiction of the Miraculous Madonna of Mariastein to the convent. It is said that Brunner had it with him when crossing the English Channel in a sailing vessel and was miraculously saved from shipwreck in a bad storm. Today the former convent at Maria Stein continues as a center of prayer and community events and houses a museum as well as the Shrine of the Holy Relics. The Maria Stein Convent complex is on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1850, L√∂wenberg Castle was sold and the rest of the sisters emigrated to Ohio. From the beginning, the sisters balanced adoration of the Precious Blood with teaching, partly in convent schools and partly in parishes founded by the Missionaries of the Precious Blood. They also were in charge of two orphanages, one in Dayton, and one in Minster, Ohio.The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 426 In 1886, Archbishop William Henry Elder found it advisable to revise the rule drawn up by Father Brunner in order to adapt it to altered conditions, and this revision, besides extending the time of adoration through the day as well as the night, increased the teaching force of the community, who were thus enabled to take charge of a larger number of parochial schools. Also in 1886, the sisters separated from the society of priests and made a separate congregation with a superior general under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Cincinnati. In 1923, the congregation's motherhouse moved to Dayton, Ohio, where it remains.

The cane is held by the therapist and rolled over the muscle with the same strokes they would use with their hands. The muscle is then kneaded, which assists in the release of tension and easing of knots. Massage practitioners often use the whole arm from elbow to wrist, and the use of the bamboo cane replaces this technique. Effect This technique works in a very similar way to stone massage. Hands are used to work over the muscles and the cane is used to focus on knots. As the cane is used instead of the hand, various techniques and modalities can incorporate the use of bamboo canes.

It follows the life of Suzu Urano, a young bride with her new family living on the outskirts of Kure City during the Second World War. It was translated by JManga under the title To All the Corners of the World. After JManga closed, Futabasha published the manga digitally and made it available to read on BookWalker, a digital manga store, and app. It was later licensed by Seven Seas Entertainment for release in North America with the original title. It was adapted into a live-action television special in 2011. An anime theatrical film adaptation was released in 2016. A TV live action series was broadcast on TBS from July to September 2018.  Plot  The story follows Suzu, an innocent young Japanese woman who is a talented illustrator who lives in Hiroshima and Kure, Japan during World War II. When Suzu was 18, she worked for a small family business when an unknown young man suddenly proposed to her. The man, Sh≈´saku, lived in Kure as a navy civilian, remembered seeing Suzu ten years ago, with fantastic experiences. Suzu married him, moved to Kure, and joined Sh≈´saku's family. However, dark clouds of the war against the US were approaching and threatening the ordinary Japanese people. Kure, a large port city, is located within one hour by local train from Hiroshima. The port is facing Seto Inland Sea and widely known as the largest military base of Imperial Japanese Navy. As Japan was losing to the U.S., living conditions in Japan were getting worse and U.S. military forces were threatening ordinary Japanese people. In spite of the food shortage, Suzu made efforts to get over the hard conditions during the wartime and also to prepare to mitigate the bombing damage. In 1945, U.S. air raids started and heavily attacked warships and naval facilities and the city areas in Kure. Suzu was wondering if she will return to the hometown (Eba) in Hiroshima, not yet bombed, from the house of Kure. When Suzu was still in Kure, August 6, 1945, the atomic bombing horribly destroyed countless human beings and everything in Hiroshima. Like a lot of Japanese, Suzu could not avoid inevitable tragedy, brought by the war, and the war deprived Suzu of the precious persons, and also \\"an irreplaceable part of her body\\" which is her right hand, for her dominance and reliability towards it. When the war was over nine days after the atomic bombing, the family started the new lives at the time of newborn Japan. Suzu regained the motivation to get through, for her and others, with courage and affection, in one corner of the world.

Written in a lyrical, often magic realist style, it crosses a number of genres including comedy and fantasy without fitting easily into any. Its themes include loss, fidelity, mythology, perception and creativity. Plot summary Narrator Herman Orff is a London-based freelance writer of comics and an unsuccessful novelist. He is preoccupied by Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, an ex-girlfriend called Luise von Himmelbett, and characters from mythology including The Kraken. His own name is a reference to Hermes and Orpheus. Lacking inspiration to write his third novel, he responds to a leaflet put through his letterbox advertising a treatment for blocked artists. The procedure turns out to be the invention of an old friend who was once also Luise's lover. Following the treatment, Orff periodically hallucinates, finding that spherical found objects (a stone on the banks of the River Thames, a football, a cabbage) appear to him as the dismembered head of Orpheus. Through a series of surreal scenes, the head tells Orff its \\"story\\", namely how he started playing the lyre, met Eurydice and lost her. In Hoban's retelling, Eurydice was not bitten by a snake and did not descend to the Underworld, but rather Orpheus was unfaithful to her and she left him for Aristaeus. This reflects Orff's own experience of being unfaithful to Luise. The scenes retelling the Orpheus myth are interspersed with Orff's daily life as he finds a new girlfriend, is hospitalised after suffering an attack of angina, bumps repeatedly into a character referred to as \\"Gom Yawncher\\" who turns up in various guises throughout London, and travels to The Hague to see the Vermeer painting in the Mauritshuis. When he gets to The Hague he finds the painting is on loan to the US, and meets a man in the gallery who claims to be another of Luise's ex- lovers. On returning to his hotel he unexpectedly bumps into Luise herself, who he finds is happily married. On Orff's return to London, his new girlfriend breaks up with him. Orff turns down lucrative offers of work adapting the Orpheus myth into a tacky cartoon strip and a pretentious film, and instead develops his own original science fiction comic strip. The Orpheus hallucinations come to an end and the slim memoir of this strange story effectively becomes the third novel he has been trying to write. Interpretation The novel's title is on one level a reference to Orff's preference for sitting up late at night listening to female classical singers on shortwave radio. During one of Orff's \\"conversations\\" with The Kraken, it tells him that Medusa is the only woman, or female archetype, to whom he can be truly faithful. Reception Although never a big seller, the book was well received critically, with The Listener commenting: \\"in the course of this tour through the imaginative outback of Mr. Hoban's mind, we are treated to brilliant flashes of mordant humour, not to mention splendidly baroque evocations of present day London\\" while The New York Times remarked \\"There's a sense of wonder in these passages...a love of fantasy and myth-making, an interest in language and puns, and a concern with philosophic speculation and the pyrotechnics of storytelling.\\" The Russell Hoban resource website The Head of Orpheus (named after the character in the book) comments, \\"for those of us who read a book not to get to the end of it, but rather to savor its humor, wisdom, eloquence and insight, The Medusa Frequency is a priceless treasure. The sort of book that may take a little concentration to get through the first time, but after that never manages to sit on your bookshelf long enough to acquire a respectable film of dust before you pull it down to re-read passages at random, or look up a particular line or incident that's stuck in your mind.\\" Crossovers Most of Hoban's novels explore common themes and are set in the same area of west London. Characters from The Medusa Frequency made brief appearances in Hoban's later novels Fremder and Linger Awhile.

History It is noted as the birthplace of three influential Punjabis. Bhagat Singh Thind Bhagat Singh Thind with his battalion at Camp Lewis, Washington on 18 November 1918. Bhagat Singh Thind, PhD, (3 October 1892 ‚Äì 15 September 1967) was an Indian-American Sikh writer and lecturer on spirituality who initiated an important legal battle over the rights of Indians to obtain U.S. citizenship: United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind. United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204 (1923), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court unanimously decided that Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian Sikh man, was ineligible for naturalization. In 1923, Thind filed for United States citizenship under the Naturalization Act of 1906 which allowed white persons and persons of African descent to naturalize. He did not challenge the constitutionality of the racial restrictions. Instead, he attempted to have Indians classified as \\"white.\\" Thind argued that as a high-caste Indian he was \\"Aryan\\" and therefore \\"Caucasian\\". The Court found that \\"the Aryan theory, as a racial basis, seems to be discredited by most, if not all, modern writers on the subject of ethnology,\\" and noted that \\"the Caucasic division of the human family is 'in point of fact the most debatable field in the whole range of anthropological studies.'\\" Dr. Thind was also the first Sikh to serve in the U.S. Army (a few months before the end of World War I), and successfully fought for the right to wear the turban while in uniform. Jagat Singh Thind Jagat Singh Thind,http://www.bhagatsinghthind.com/Komagata_maru.php younger brother of Bhagat Singh Thind, was among the 376 passengers (340 Sikhs, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all British subjects) of the ship Komagata Maru. Arriving in Burrard Inlet, Vancouver, on 23 May 1914, they hoped to immigrate to a better life and educational system. However, due to the racist immigration policy of Canada at that time, they were denied entry and the ship was forced to leave on 23 July 1914. Returning to India, a number of passengers were killed in an incident with police. (See Komagata Maru incident.) On 23 May 1914, Dr. Bhagat Singh Thind's youngest brother, Jagat Singh Thind, was amongst the 376 passengers (340 Sikhs, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus) who arrived in Burrard Inlet, Vancouver from the Indian sub-continent in hopes for a better life and better educational system. However, due to the racist immigration policy of the Dominion of Canada, the ship was forced to leave on 23 July 1914. On the voyage back to India many on board endured hardships by the hands of the British. Thus inciting a riot, which resulted in many Indians being abused, jailed, or killed. This riot incident is known as \\"Budge Budge Riot\\". Fortunately Jagat eventually made his way back to his village Taragarh Talawa.

(1736), Historischen Beschreibung der weltber√ºhmten Vestung K√∂nigstein, Dresden, 1736. Dohna in 1690. Right: the castle ruins The tower of Dohna Castle on the Fleischerbrunnen well, completed in 1912, in the market square Dohna Castle (, ) on the once important medieval trade route from Saxony to Bohemia was the ancestral castle seat of the . Of the old, once imposing double castle only a few remnants of the walls remain. The ruins of the old castle are located on the hill of Schlossberg near the subsequent suburb of the town of the same name, Dohna, in the district of S√§chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge in Saxony, Germany.  History  Dohna Castle was probably founded around A.D. 950 by Emperor Otto I (936‚Äì973) on the Schlossberg hill on the site of a Sorbian hillfort fortification. This region around the Schlossberg had been a Sorbian settlement from prehistoric times. The name of the associated settlement was Donin, from which the castle received its name. The castle was the centre of the imperially immediate lordship of the burgraves of Dohna. They had the task of guarding the important trade route between Saxony and Bohemia, hold the conquered and subjugated Sorbs in serfdom and their Christianization by protecting emissaries of the Catholic Church. = Early history = Dohna Castle was first mentioned in records in 1040 in connection with the conflicts between King Henry III (1039‚Äì1056) and Duke Bretislaus of Bohemia. The Margravate of Meissen under Eckard II (1038‚Äì1046) held Dohna Castle presumably as an imperial fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Later, the castle fell under the lordship of burgraves from the Duchy of Bohemia. In 1076, the Duke, and later King, of Bohemia, Vratislaus II (1061‚Äì1092), was enfeoffed by Henry IV (1056‚Äì1106) with the Gau of Nisani. He ceded the Gau of Nisani with Dohna Castle to his son-in-law, Wiprecht of Groitzsch, who later became the Margrave of Meissen (1123‚Äì1124), as a dowry for his daughter. In 1112 Wiprecht of Groitzsch relinquished Nisani and Dohna Castle to Henry V (1106‚Äì1125). On recovering possession of the castle by Groitzsch in 1117, Bohemian supremacy was re-established. At the beginning of the 12th century Dohna Castle was destroyed, but then rebuilt by the Duke of Bohemia, Vladislaus I (1109‚Äì1125) around 1121. The following description of the dungeon is found in August Schumann's State Lexicon of Saxony (Staatslexikon von Sachsen):...and was, as with every strong castle at that time, according to custom of the day, sometimes used as a state prison. At the very least, it is known that the Bohemian king, Sobeslaus [Sobƒõslav], marched several Bohemian lords to the dungeon at Dohna during the 1126....Vgl.

See also , p. 43. The powerful castle of Dohna perched on a rocky spur, 155 m above sea level (NN) near the River M√ºglitz, was the centre point of the Burgraviate of Dohna. It was here that the was held, a magistrate's court (Sch√∂ffengericht) recorded since 1390 that operated until 1572, predominantly in the field of feudal and inheritance matters and gave legal direction over an area that extended far beyond the borders of Saxony. One can assume that during the rule of the Dohna hereditary burgraves, the castle was expanded in such a way that it finally appeared as imposing double castle, consisting of an inner and outer castle (Hinterburg and Vorderburg) and a large ward (Vorhof). During the excavations of 1904/06, the exposure of the transverse wall separating the two castles, proved this theory. The oval-shaped castle tower on the Fleischerbrunnen well in Dohna's market square, created in 1912 by the Dresden sculptor, Alexander H√∂fer, portrays the tower in the oldest town coat of arms of 1525. = Loss and ruin of the imperial castle = In the wake of the Dohna Feud (1385‚Äì1402), which began between Burgrave and the Meissen noble‚ÄîHans of K√∂rbitz, the burgraves lost their main seat of power and all the estates belonging to it to the House of Wettin. The present Saxony- Bohemian state border was established in 1406, when the neighbouring Bohemian Pirna Castle with its associated villages and the Bohemian fortress of K√∂nigstein, in which Burgrave Jesche was able to seek refuge, were also won for the Wettins.Karlheinz Blaschke: Geschichte Sachsens im Mittelalter, Unionverlag Berlin, 1990 From autumn 1401 onwards the castle was besieged and, after lengthy resistance, was taken by storm on 19 June 1402 in the presence of Margrave William I the One-Eyed (1349/79‚Äì1407). After its capture the castle was not completely slighted. The residential buildings were left standing and served as residences for the margravial officials who managed the caretaking of Dohna. After the V√∂gte had moved their seat somewhere around 1457 to Pirna, the castle gradually fell into decay. In addition, the townsfolk of Dohna in subsequent times, may have helped themselves to large amounts of stone from the castle for building material whenever it was needed. In a picture from 1690 by A. Nienborg and in a sketch by Goebel in 1793 extensive remains of the walls and tower can still be seen. M. Christian Bartsch, pastor in Dohna, wrote in 1735: ...on this castle hill you can still find the ruins of old walls, towers and vaults which have withstood the rain and weather for 330 years uncared for; but whose limestone and rock are so strong that you can only pull them down with difficulty, but which do not collapse by themselves. The Swedes when they stood here in 1709, tried to break into a vault in this castle hill, perhaps they thought they would find treasure, but had to give up soon thereafter due to the strength of the walls.....Vgl. Christian Bartsch. Historie der alten Burg und St√§dgens Dohna. Dresden/Leipzig 1735 digitalised version Today only a small remnant of the wall of the old castle may still be seen. Apart from that there is nothing else left of Dohna Castle. = Construction of castle hill after the decay of the castle ruins = Dohna castle round tower and former inn buildings (Burgsch√§nke) In 1803 Burgrave Henry Louis of Dohna bought the castle hill (Schlossberg) in order to rebuild the castle in the spirit of the growing Romanesque movement. The castle hill was therefore cleared of rubble and the work began on the construction of a round tower. But the Napoleonic Wars prevented his romantic plans from being fulfilled. Eventually the round tower was completed in its present shape in 1830. The \\"Privileged Shooting Association of Dohna\\" (Privilegierte Sch√ºtzengesellschaft zu Dohna) bought the Schlossberg in 1826 for 700 thalers and levelled the front part of the hill. From the rock material of the castle walls they built the shooting house (Schie√ühaus) in 1828, the shooting wall and the supporting wall of the access track. The buildings on the Schlossberg today consist mainly of the former shooting house, now a castle inn (Burgsch√§nke) used as a Handelsorganisation restaurant and dancing hall, and the round tower built in the style of the old castle and last used as a museum area, in which local minerals from the M√ºglitz valley e. g. amethysts and agates could be admired. In the castle inn (\\"Burg Dohna\\" restaurant) there has been a local history museum on the first floor since 1958, although it was founded in 1906. Today the local history museum is in the old chemist's in the market square. Here there are intera alia interesting exhibits of castle history e.g. discoveries from the Middle Ages, graphic works and documents.  Present use  The buildings of the Schlossberg, the round tower from 1830 and the former Burgsch√§nke, have been converted into a meeting centre since 2005 by the Christian-free church Eckstein-community. Supporter is the registered association Horizon Worldwide Eckstein (Horizonte Weltweit Eckstein). The castle site is a protected heritage site as is the Sorbian hillfort at the back of the spur that was called (Robsch, Robscher). This hillfort is still visible on a spur over the railway station yard. This site is mentioned because, even before the settlement of the castle hill (Schlossberg), a Sorbian gord (burgwall) had stood on the Robisch Hillfort.

Early life  Dutta was born to Mahesh Chandra Dutta in Kalikachchha, in the district of Tipperah. His father died when he was only nine months old. His mother struggled to bring him up and then had a live a life of penury. He graduated in law from the Ripon College in Calcutta in 1905. He began his practice in the civil court at Comilla and soon build up a lucrative practice.  Career  thumb200pxAn advertisement of the Comilla Banking Corporation in the Hindusthan Standard on 16 August 1945 In 1914, Dutta founded the Comilla Banking Corporation at the suggestion of community leader Akhil Chandra Dutta with support from Mahesh Chandra Bhattacharya (1848‚Äì1944). He started the bank with a declared capital of 4,000 rupees and raised another 2,500 rupees. In order to raise the capital he sold his own house for 1,500 rupees. Initially he drew a monthly remuneration of eight rupees from the bank. Dutta did an economic survey of eastern India, and began investments in the tea industry. Through the Comilla Banking Corporation he began to issue loans to prospective investors in the tea industry for buying tea plantations and related properties. After completing his studies, Dutta's eldest son Bata Krishna Dutta returned to Comilla and joined the Comilla Banking Corporation as a trainee. After a few weeks Dutta suggested that Bata Krishna himself could run a bank himself and young Bata Krishna took up the challenge. In 1930, Bata Krishna Dutta took charge of the defunct Comilla Rice and Oil Mills Limited and established the New Standard Bank of India with an initial paid-up capital of thirty thousand rupees. In 1946, at the suggestion of Chintaman Dwarakanath Deshmukh, the then Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the New Standard Bank of India merged with the Comilla Banking Corporation, transferring all its assets to the latter. In 1950, Narendra Chandra Dutta along with Jyotish Chandra Das completed the merger of Comilla Banking Corporation and Bengal Central Bank and founded the United Bank of India.

The Daughters had their origins in the \\"Seminary of Providence\\" founded in 1643, with the authorization of King Louis XIII, by a pious widow, Marie Polaillon (n√©e de Lumague). It was intended to provide a shelter to girls who were in situations of peril to their faith. This could be through either poverty or personal circumstances. The name of the house was selected as they looked to Divine Providence to supply their needs.McGahan, Florence. \\"Daughters of Providence.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 26 January 2016 Among the girls who were given shelter in the seminary, those who were capable of providing instruction to the other charges were organized to do that. Among this number were seven whom the foundress felt showed signs of having a religious calling. The Archbishop of Paris, Jean Fran√ßois Paul de Gondi, authorized them to form a religious community, under a Rule of Life drawn up by St. Vincent de Paul. Their formation was to be a novitiate lasting two years, after which the Daughters would profess annual vows of obedience, chastity, service and stability. In 1651 the Queen Regent, Anne of Austria, gave the community their first home, a former rest home in the Fauborg Saint- Michel (now Od√©on). After this, Archbishop Gondi established several similar communities around the city. Foundations were also made in Metz and Sedan. They remained under the authority of the Archbishop, who would appoint the Superior General of the congregation, while the local Superiors were elected triennially. In 1681 several houses of the congregation merged with the Sisters of the newly founded Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, founded by Father Nicholas Barr√©, O.M., dedicated to the education of the poor. The remaining houses soon merged with the Canonesses Regular of the Congregation of Notre Dame, founded by St. Peter Fourier, C.R.S.A., dedicated to a similar goal. At that point this congregation ceased to exist.

On its shore is the village Glatt, known for its watercastle. It ends in the territory of Horb am Neckar in the Neckar river.  Geography  = Source streams = The Glatt originates in the village Aach, a district of Dornstetten. Here, the left and northern upper reaches of the K√ºbelbach merge with the right Stockerbach coming from the northwest next to the Gr√ºntaler Stra√üe to form the Glatt. Both branches are between 8 and 9 km long. The main upper course of the Glatt is the K√ºbelbach. Its own upper course up to the Silberwiesen before the first settlement Dornstetten-Hallwangen is called Glattbach. The source of Glattbach/K√ºbelbach is located at about 717 m above Sea Level in the Stutzwald at the community border of Dornstetten to Freudenstadt and is called Glattbrunnen. Glattbach as well as K√ºgelbach altogether have only few important tributaries. The right upper course Stockerbach of the Glatt has its source on the other hand higher on about 753 m above sea level the Kratzenhartbrunnen, which is about 2 km west of the Glattbrunnen in the Reichenbacher Wald on Freudenstadt area. It is fed by a number of streams from the right, making its catchment area about one and a half times larger than that of its left partner. Still in Aach, only two hundred meters after its origin from the right and west-northwest, the Glatt takes the \\"Ettenbach\\", which is only about 5 km long. ({}) Its catchment area, however, exceeds that of the K√ºbelbach a little, which is why the K√ºbelbach, Stockerbach and Ettenbach are usually regarded as the three source branches that together make up the Glatt. = Course = After that, the Glatt flows in a south-eastern to southern direction and takes in some tributaries and flows into Glatten. On the section following its mouth the Glatt below Neuneck then runs through a very narrow and winding valley about 170 meters below the summit of the wooded Schellenberg 640 m above sea level. In Leinstetten, the largest Glatt tributary by far Heimbach, with its almost 25 km length, flows into the valley. About 2 km further down the valley, the river turns left where the small tributary Zitzmannsbrunnenbach meets the Glatt in Bettenhausen to the east-northeast course. On the following, almost 10 km long run, only a somewhat more important stream flows into the valley. Then the Glatt flows below the village Glatt from Sulz am Neckar and opposite the district Neckarhausen from Horb am Neckar from the left into the upper Neckar. = Catchment area = The 234 km¬≤ catchment area of the Glatt has roughly the contour of a triangle with a western base of about 31 km through the eastern Black Forest. This longest side extends from the northern tip east of Baiersbronn-Klosterreichenbach in the Reichenbacher Wald near the Kr√§henhartbrunnen, from which the right spring brook Stockerbach has its source, to the southern tip at Schramberg-Waldm√∂ssingen, which is close to the source of the largest tributary Heimbach. The catchment area is not even 17 km wide from this western side to the eastern tip at the estuary. On the northeast side, the Nagold borders on the longest part of the catchment area, only finally towards the mouth to that of a less important downstream Neckar tributary. Beyond the entire southeastern watershed no major tributary runs to the nearby upstream Neckar. In the south and southwest, behind a short stretch of the catchment area boundary, the Eschach, which is roughly equivalent to the Glatt, flows to the Neckar. On the largest part of the western watershed the Kinzig collects the water running to the other side. Only at the Sch√∂llkopf between Lossburg and Freudenstadt it is replaced there by the Murg (Northern Black Forest), which at first competes over its right tributary Forbach. Since the large Black Forest rivers Kinzig and Murg flow directly into the Rhine, the western watershed is also a large watershed between the Neckar and Rhine over almost its entire length. Largest elevation in the catchment area is the mentioned Sch√∂llkopf, which reaches a height of 843 m above sea level, and at whose eastern foot the second largest Glatt tributary Lauter has its source. *K√ºbelbach with upper course Glattbach (left source stream, in Aach), 8.5 km and 11.4 km¬≤ * Stockerbach (right source stream, in Aach), 8.3 km and 17.7 km¬≤Einzugsgebiet aufsummiert aus den Teileinzugsgebieten nach dem Layer Basiseinzugsgebiet (AWGN). * Ettenbach (right, in Aach), 5.7 km and 12.0 km¬≤Einzugsgebiet nach dem Layer Basiseinzugsgebiet (AWGN). * Schorngraben (from right), 0.9 km * Nottentalgraben (from left), 0.9 km * M√ºhlebach (from left, before Glatten), 2,2 km * B√ºrgenbach (from left, in Glatten), 3.3 km and 5.5 km¬≤ * Lauter (from right, in smooth), 10.2 km and 32.6 km¬≤ * Schlappbach (from left, near B√∂ffingen), 1,2 km * Riedhaldenb√§chle (from left, in ninepin), under 0.4 km * T√§lesbach (from left), 1.1 km * Lippbach (from right), 6.0 km and 6.6 km¬≤ * Heimbach (from the right, in Leinstetten), 24,5 km and 77,5 km * Zitzmannsbrunnenbach (from right, in Bettenhausen), 4.1 km and 9.9 km¬≤ * Nie√üler Bach (from left, near Reinau), 0.9 km * Tobelbach (maybe also Dobelbach) (from right, opposite Hopfau), 4.7 km and 13.4 km¬≤ * Wiesenb√§chle (from left, to Hopfau), 0.8 km * (stream from Talerbrunnen) (from left), 1.0 km * T√§lebach (from right, in Glatt), 0.9 km See also *List of rivers of Baden-W√ºrttemberg References Category:Rivers of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Category:Rivers of the Black Forest Category:Rivers of Germany ","title":"Glatt (Neckar)"},{"id":"33039964","text":"Glotter is a river of in the Breisgau region in the south of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany which is approximately 30 km long.

The Scorpions' Pass is a recognized heritage site in Israel. =History= The Roman Empire built the ascent in the late 1st century CE from the Wadi Zin to the highlands of the northern Negev desert during their control of the Middle East. Under British control, the ascent was slightly rebuilt to the north. During the Nabatean period, the route became a part of the Spice Route. =Modern use= The pass is known for its extreme danger due to poor physical condition. Below the pass there is an abyss, and the road has no guard rails. In addition, the road has extreme dropoffs of hundreds of metres. The Israeli Army Corps of Engineers paved it in 1950. It was again repaved in 2004. The National Roads Company of Israel is de facto responsible for the road.

Format During an episode, contestants compete through four rounds of competition until a final winner is chosen. The first round features 24 contestants (they were introduced from seasons 1-3, but from season 4 onwards, they were never shown), while only the top four (top three in seasons 4-6) will make it to the final round called the Wipeout Zone, where the winner earns the title of Wipeout Champion and a $50,000 grand prize. However, in Season 7, as explained by John Anderson, the contestant has only 1 attempt per obstacle, because the Zone is all about speed. =The Qualifier= In the first round of the competition, 24 contestants run a four/five-part obstacle course, one at a time. If the contestant fails to pass a particular obstacle, they must swim or crawl through mud or water to the next obstacle. The 12 shortest times advance to the next round. Although many of the obstacles vary between episodes, common obstacles have included the \\"Sucker Punch\\", a wall covered with mechanical boxing gloves above a mud pit (not seen in seasons 4-6), and the show's trademark obstacle, the \\"Big Balls\\", consisting of a set of four giant inflated red balls that a contestant must attempt to bounce across.

The last six contestants standing move on to the next round, and the last person standing wins a $1,000 bonus. *Scare-ousel (Love Machine on Summer Episode 16), (Spring Wipeout and some Summer Wipeout Episodes): A carnival-themed carousel that has two stages contestants have to transverse: a red track and a yellow track. They will start on the red track, grab a red dangler, and travel over three hurdles to the red spot platform. If they wipeout, they have to start back at the beginning. Once they land on the red spot, they can hitch a ride on the yellow dangler to the finish platform. But if they wipe out here, they can remain on the yellow track to try again, while avoiding the sweeper arms in their way. In episode 5 of Spring Wipeout (The Most Dramatic Rose Ceremony Ever), three blue danglers were added for increased difficulty. The first six contestants to make it through move on to the next round. *Total Carnage, (Summer Wipeout): The twelve contestants begin together on the starting platform elevated 10 feet above the water. The goal is simple: make it around to the finish platform by leaping from platform to platform while navigating over the whirling Crankshaft and between the Spinning Hoops without going under them. The first six contestants to make it to the other side move on to the next round. On the first episode, it was called The Illunisator where it is similar to the Sweeper and the Ski Lift, and the contestants stay on platforms and avoid the Spinning Hoops to make it to the next round. *Pain in the Ice, (Winter Wipeout season 5) First, all twelve contestants will drop through the Ice Hole and onto the Fishing Pole, then spin around to the platform. Then they must cross the Lumber Tumbler to the next platform. Then they must cross the Frosty Footbridge while being showered by the Arctic Waterfall. Finally, they must belly slide down the Snow Chute to the finish platform. The first six contestants to make it through move on to the next round. *Hangover (Summer Wipeout season 5): The twelve contestants begin together on the starting platform elevated 10 feet above the water. The idea is simple: grab a rotating handle and swing around to the finish platform while navigating through the Swizzle Sticks, over the Sweeper Arm, and through the Brawl Wall. The first six contestants to make it to the other side move on to the next round. *Scaregrounds: (Summer Wipeout season 5) The twelve contestants start together on a spinning platform, grab a rotating trapeze, and swing over the sweepers to the revolving planks before riding them to a second spinning platform. But they‚Äôll have to watch out for the Signwinder, because it‚Äôs spinning too. Then they must jump to the Spinning Slide and time their drop down onto the finish platform. The first six contestants to make it through move on to the next round. *Miami Pound Machine: (Summer Wipeout Season 6) The twelve contestants begin together on the starting platform elevated 10 feet above the water. They must jump onto one of the rotating platforms, make their way to the other side, and time their jump to the finish platform. They also have to avoid the rotating sweeper bars along the way. If they wipeout or go under one of the sweeper bars, they must head back and start all over. The first six contestants to make it across move on to the next round. *Octopushy: (Summer Wipeout Season 6) The twelve contestants begin together on the starting platform elevated 10 feet above the water. They must jump onto one of the rotating rings, make their way to the other side, and time their jump to the finish platform. They also have to avoid the rotating octopus' arms along the way. If they wipeout or go under one of the arms, they must head back and start all over. The first six contestants to make it across move on to the next round. * Space Race: (Summer Wipeout Season 7) First, slide through the Wormholes and land on the Flying Saucer, then drop through the hole onto the Crop Circles, and make the jump to the Launch Slide. If you wipeout, it‚Äôs back to the beginning. If you make it through the first part, then you won‚Äôt have to go back to the start. Finally, drop down the Launch Slide and into the Shifting Alien and jump out onto the finish platform. The first six contestants to make it through move on to the next round. *Classic Sweeper: (Summer Wipeout Season 7) The Sweeper returns this season.

Season 1 variations included the \\"Dizzy Dummy\\"; a cycle of competitive rounds where players are strapped to a spinning cylinder for a short period, before racing across one of two sets of obstacles. The winning player in each round advances to the final round, while the remaining contestants \\"spin again\\" and then alternate to the other set of obstacles; and a time-based challenge known as the \\"Dreadmill\\", which sees contestants run on a giant treadmill with the best 4 times advancing, either highest or lowest depending on the task, tasks include dodging a giant swinging wrecking ball and running to the end while lifting doors. * Episode One- Tippy Tables and Hopping Blocks (Dizzy Dummy) * Episode Two- Tennis Dreadmill With Doors * Episode Three- Pole Vault and Crazy Beams (Dizzy Dummy) * Episode Four- Dreadmill Flipper Flop * Episode Five- Slippery Snakes and Barrel Spill (Mexican Dizzy Dummy) * Episode Six- Dreadmill Wrecking Ball * Episode Eight- Teeter Totters and Floating Block Maze (Dizzy Dummy) * Episode Nine- Daunting Cookie Cutter (pilot episode) * Episode Ten- Roadwork Dreadmill With Goofy Goggles and Cones Superbowl Episode * Episode One- Field Goal Spinner, Teeter Totters, and Keg Run (Football Dizzy Dummy 2.0) Season 2 saw the return of the Dizzy Dummy but now the contestants need to squeeze through an obstacle at the top of a spinning disc before they could go on to the main obstacle. The \\"Slippery Course\\", is similarly formatted, but uses a water slide instead of spinning the contestants. The Dreadmill is replaced by \\"The Rocket\\" or \\"Bucking Bull\\" which has the contestants ride a mechanical bull dressed up to resemble a rocket. During this round, it was merely an endurance event. The top 4 times move onto the Wipeout Zone. * Episode One- Slick Slide, Branch in the Face, Bullseye Buoys, Slippery Wall With Ropes, and Spinner (Slippery Course) * Episode Two- Door Spinner, Tippy Tables with Walls, and Barrel Run (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Three- The Rocket With Planets and Meteor Showers * Episode Four- Bungee Web Spinner, Sack Launch, and Zig Zag Buoy Run (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Five- Bungee Web Spinner, Teeter Totters, and Crazy Beams (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Six- The Rocket With Planets and Astronaut Major John Henson * Episode Seven- Slick Slide, Branch in the Face, Bouncy Beam with Sweepers, Slippery Wall with Spinning Triangles, and Bumper Spinner (Slippery Course) * Episode Eight- Keyhole Spinner, Sweeper Buoy Run, and Rope Swing (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Nine- Bucking Bull * Episode Ten- Keyhole Spinner, Buoy Run, and Wall Squeeze (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Eleven- Bucking Bull With Red Capes * Episode Twelve- Bungee Web Spinner, Beam Walk Dodgeball, and Blue Ball Run (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Thirteen- Slick Slide, Branch in the Face, Mesh-Mash Run, Slippery Wall With Ropes and Spinning Triangles, and Bumper Spinner (Slippery Course) * Episode Fourteen- Bungee Web Spinner, Topple Towers, and Slippery Snakes (Dizzy Dummy 2.0) * Episode Sixteen- Slick Slide, Branch in the Face, Bucking Buoys, Slippery Wall with Spinning Pegs, and Bumper Spinner (Slippery Course) Season 3 uses the \\"Circular Challenge\\" a circular, individually run, time-based obstacle which circles around a central podium. This course always has a theme such as \\"One-Ring Circus\\" (Clowns throw circus objects at the player from the central podium), \\"Pirate's Revenge\\" (Pirates throwing cannonballs from the middle), \\"Construction Zone\\" (Construction workers throwing cones) \\"Wipeout Farm\\" (Farmers throwing haystacks and yolk) \\"Jungle Gym\\" (Safaris throwing snakes and bananas) or \\"Medieval Wipeout\\" (Knights hurling tomatoes and lettuce from the podium). The top 4 times advance to the Wipeout Zone. Another round called \\"Bruiseball\\" is used in some episodes which has the contestants have to cross 4 obstacles in the shape of a Baseball field. The round is played twice with the first 2 people to reach home-plate before the end of each inning move on to the Wipeout Zone. Also in Season 3 is a challenge which sees contestants run on a spinner previously featured in Season One's Wipeout Zone, while avoiding the sweeper arm. If a contestant is knocked into the water, goes under the sweeper arm, or is knocked behind the red barrel-shaped objects, they would be eliminated. Costumed characters, called \\"lifeguards\\", in the middle of the spinner throw items at the contestants based on the theme of the week. Variations of items thrown at the contestants include baggage and boxes on \\"Unclaimed Baggage\\" (known for housing John Henson), beach items and wet towels on \\"Beach Party\\", stuffed animals, pillows and feathers on \\"Sleepytime\\". There are four rounds, and the last person standing at the end of each round moves on to the Wipeout Zone. In addition, there is a ring hanging in the air and whoever grabs the ring wins $1,000. Season 4 (Winter Wipeout) The third round was called \\"The 7-Letter Word\\", which consists of seven platforms that spelled the word, WIPEOUT. The contestants will start at the \\"W\\" and the first one to the \\"T\\" wins. The letters \\"W\\" and \\"I\\" features sweeper arms, the \\"P\\" puddle to avoid, then bounce off the \\"E\\" diving board onto the spinning \\"O\\" and jump over the three hurdles on the \\"U\\" to get to the \\"T\\" platform. Contestants who have wiped out after reaching the \\"P\\", the \\"E\\", or the \\"U\\" may return to those points instead of starting the entire course over. However, only 3 heats, and each winner moves on. In episode 4 (Baby It's Blob Outside), The 7-Letter Word featured a person in a polar bear costume scaring contestants on the \\"P\\". :In episode 5 (Hockey Pucks and Bieber Fever) the \\"7-Letter Word\\" was replaced by another obstacle course called the \\"Winter Blunder Land (Theme: Wipeout Ice Arena)\\". For three rounds, contestants start out on the \\"Dizzy Dummy\\" a spinning contraption, then they move onto springboards that propel the contestants onto the \\"Spinning Slap Shot\\", a horizontal spinning platform trying to make it over the \\"Penalty Box\\", a vertically rotating platform. Then contestants weave their way through the \\"Crankshaft\\". After that, contestants try to avoid being checked by the \\"Knee Sweeper\\", a rotating set of connecting bars aimed at their knees, then jump to the ‚ÄúTurntable‚Äù and spin their way to the finish platform. While crossing the course, contestants will try to avoid giant hockey pucks being thrown at them by two hockey players (one of them being John Henson) and a female skater. The first contestant through before the end of each round moves on to the Winter Wipeout Zone. Season 4 (Spring Wipeout) The third round was called the \\"Not So-O.K. Corral\\". There are three rounds that start on this western-themed obstacle course. First the contestants take a spin in the classic \\"Dizzy Dummy\\". Then they bounce off the diving boards trying to land on the rotating platforms crossing over to the \\"Crankshaft\\". Next is the \\"Knee Sweeper\\", then the spinning platform and one final step to the finish platform. All this while avoiding faux horseshoes and moneybags being thrown at them when crossing the course. :In episode 2 (Ballsy Shows Off His Giblets) the background was a French cafe in which contestants were hit by pies. :In episode 3 (John Henson, Zombie Hunter) the background was a Roman coliseum called \\"Wipeout Colosseum\\", in which contestants were hit by tar (chocolate sauce), foam shields, and stuffed toy lions. :In episode 4 (The Wizard of Owws) the background was an Arabian Nights theme, complete with a desert sand, toy snakes, and an oasis. The contestants must run the course while avoiding Persian throw-pillows and plush cobras being thrown at them. :In episode 5 (The Most Dramatic Rose Ceremony) there was a new obstacle called \\"Super Tramp.\\" The six contestants start together on trampolines elevated 10 feet above the water. They must bounce over the rotating sweeper bar to avoid being knocked into the drink. If they go under the bar, they're out. There are three rounds, and the last person standing at end of each round moves on to the Spring Wipeout Zone. (The round was similar to the Season 3 spinner where contestants jump on trampolines avoiding a sweeper arm. The last one standing moves on to the Wipeout zone.) :In episode 6 (Dirty Laundry) \\"Super Tramp\\" was renamed \\"Clean Sweep\\", which follows the same rules and format, except the 6 trampolines were replaced by 6 regular platforms. :In episode 7 (Engaged Couples) using episodes 1-4 obstacle, the background was a Wedding chapel theme. The couples must run the course while avoiding pieces of cake and frosting thrown by a couple dressed in each other's clothes (groom in a gown, bride in a tuxedo), and John Henson dressed as the priest. Season 4 (Summer Wipeout) features the \\"Wipeout Play Set\\" where all six contestants start off with the ‚ÄúSafe and Durable Swing Along Swing Sets,‚Äù where they have to hurl themselves to the spinning platform. Then they have to go for a whirl on the \\"Sweeper Arms,\\" crossing from one to the other as they rotate at alarming speeds. And finally, they‚Äôll face ‚ÄúChutes and Splatters,‚Äù where they must slip down one of the slides and through the rotating windmill to the other side. And then it‚Äôs just a quick sprint to the finish spot to complete the course. There are three rounds, and the first person through before the end of each round moves on to the Wipeout Zone. :In episode 3 (Let's Make A Wipeout) the \\"Dive Bar\\" was featured. The six contestants start together on platforms elevated 10 feet above the water. They must jump over a giant snorkel as it rotates around and around to avoid being knocked into the water. If they go under the snorkel, they‚Äôre out.

The first complete boss-employee team through before the end of each round moves on to the Wipeout Zone. :In episode 9 of Summer Wipeout (‚ÄúBallsy Gets a Hard Hat‚Äù), the obstacle ‚ÄúDetour‚Äù is featured where the Wipeout crew are dressed in construction gear that took a detour to the ‚ÄúConstruction Zone‚Äù on a hazardous hydraulic speedway. There are 3 rounds: first, all six contestants will drive into the construction zone and make it past not one, but two ‚ÄúStreet Sweepers.‚Äù After that, they must cross the rapidly-rotating ‚ÄúSpinner Change.‚Äù And finally, it‚Äôs a trip across both ‚ÄúRocking Roadblocks‚Äù en route to the finish platform. The first contestant through before the end of each round moves on to the Wipeout Zone. :In Episode 10 of Summer Wipeout (Is That a Potato in Your Sack or Are You Just Happy to Wipeout?), the obstacle is called the \\"Super Sack.\\" The six contestants start together on platforms elevated 10 feet above the water while wearing potato sacks. They must hop over the sweeper bar as it rotates around and around to avoid being knocked into the drink. If they go under the bar, they‚Äôre out.

There are three rounds, and the first person through before the end of each round moves on to the Wipeout Zone. :In Episode 12 of Summer Wipeout (Ballsy's Playground), the obstacle \\"Detour\\" is featured again where the Wipeout crew are dressed as an old retirement couple that took a detour to \\"Ballsy National Forest\\" on their RV trip. It's exactly the same only the crew throws pillows and sleeping bags at the contestants as they make their way through the course. Season 4 (Summer Wipeout) continues with the Wipeout theme obstacles where each contestant starts off with a ride on the spinner where they have to get across an obstacle course filled with different types of rotating platforms on their way down to the finish platform, where winners of the 3 rounds move to the Wipeout Zone. :In Episode 16 of Summer Wipeout (Blind Date 2.0: This Could Get Ugly), the obstacle \\"Wipeout Disco\\" is featured. There are three rounds: Couples start off by \\"staying alive\\" by not going for a spin on the \\"Dizzy Dummy\\", and jumping off spring boards into the rotating \\"Brick House\\" platform.

Finally, time your drop down the spinning slide and through one of the four holes on the smack wheel to the finish platform. The first four contestants to make it through move on to the Wipeout Zone. =The Wipeout Zone= At night, and with a more serious tone than the previous rounds, the final four or three contestants play separately on a large obstacle course inside the studio called the Wipeout Zone, each attempting to finish the course in the fastest time, much like the first round. Though slight variations are used in each episode, contestants wear wetsuits and they begin by either sliding down a water ramp or being launched by a giant catapult or blob into the water and swim to the first obstacle. Obstacles have varied between episodes, but the course contains several obstacles that must be traversed in order to reach the finishing platform. The maximum time for any contestant in the Wipeout Zone is 20:00.00 in the first six seasons. In Season 4 (Winter, Spring, and Summer), the first contestant never reached the 20:00.00 mark. The player with the fastest time on the course is declared the \\"champion\\" of the episode and is awarded the show's grand prize of $50,000. However, in Season 7, as explained by John Anderson, the contestant has only 1 attempt per obstacle, because the Zone is all about speed. * Season 1: : 1. Killer Surf: A large water ramp at a 45¬∞ angle, which contestants slide down on an inner tube, a sled, an air mattress, or their backs and control their launch into the Wipeout Zone. In some episodes, it had water pouring down. In episode 2, it was covered in foam. In episodes 3 and 4, it was surrounded by fire/flames. In episode 8, it was shrouded in fog and had colored balls at the bottom. : 2. Barrel Run: A narrow ramp which contestants must run up, while jumping over oncoming barrels. : 3. Climbing Wall: A wall above a narrow ledge that contestants must cross using handles. In episodes 4 and 5, it was renamed the Rope Wall, because there were ropes instead of handles. In episodes 6, 8, and 10, it was renamed the Water Wall, because there was water pouring down on the contestants as they use the handles to get across. : 4. Spinner: A rotating slippery surface covered in padded barricades which contestants must jump on, and then onto a platform on the other side. In one episode, there was latex, making two entrances. : 5. Launch Pads: Four trampolines at different elevations that must be crossed to reach the finish platform. * Pilot Episode: : 1. Killer Surf: A large water ramp at a 45¬∞ angle, which contestants slide down on a sled and control their launch into the Wipeout Zone. : 2. Triple Threat: Three triangles that can rotate if not crossed quick enough. It's A.K.A Rotating Triangles. : 3. Spinner: A rotating slippery surface covered in padded barricades which contestants must jump on, and then onto a platform on the other side. : 4. Blast Off: A narrow plank which must be crossed. Icy, cold water cannons will be sprayed onto the contestants. * Season 2A: : 1. Aqua Launch: A bumpy ramp which contestants slide down on an inner tube, a sled, a kayak, or their backs and control their launch into the Wipeout Zone while contending with a torrent of water. : 2. Raging Rapids: A ramp with water flowing down, which the contestants must climb. Ten seconds into the obstacle, a onetime 1,000-gallon tidal wave gushes down for a few seconds. This tidal wave has varied during the series, being either water, mud, or drink. : 3. Climbing Wall: A wall above a narrow sloped ledge that contestants must cross using handles. : 4. Crazy Sweeper: Contestants run down a zigzag beam and across pedestals to the other side while being chased by two sweeper arms featuring large cubes and cylinders on them. In Wipeout Bowl 1, they had footballs and pon-poms on them. In episode 4, the obstacle had six hanging demolition balls. In episode 8, it had two distracting curtains of noodles. In episode 12, it had six brutal punching bags. : 5. Turntables: Three spinning platforms with varying obstacles on them that the contestants must jump on and off. When they stand up with two feet planted on the last turntable or the finish platform, the clock will stop. In Wipeout Bowl 1, they were the Tackle Dummy Turntables. In episodes 2 and 14, they were the Bumper Turntables. In episodes 4 and 10, they were the Wedge Turntables. In episode 5, they were the Torrential Turntables. In episode 8, they were the Foamy Turntables. In episode 12, they were the Dodgeball Turntables. * Season 2B: : 1. Catapult: A rocket launcher that launches contestants into the Wipeout Zone. : 2. Gears of Doom: Three large rotating gears that must be traversed. In episodes 6 and 16, the gears had teeth on them. In episode 9, the gears were covered with trampolines. : 3. Scary-Go- Round: A pair of bridges circling in opposite directions. Contestants must jump onto the rotating platform, climb one of the stairways to the top while avoiding the sweeper arm, and make it across the narrow arm to the other side. In episode 6, it had three teeth, while in episode 16, it had just one tooth. In episode 7, it had a curtain blocking the way. In episodes 9 and 11, it had only two stairways.

Versions are found in most countries of the former Ottoman Empire, with various different forms and recipes. History Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century Persia, modern day Iran, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. A recipe for a shortbread cookie similar to ghorayebah but without almonds, called in Arabic khushkanƒÅnaj gharib (exotic cookie), is given in the earliest known Arab cookbook, the 10th-century Kitab al-·π¨abƒ´·∏´. Kurabiye appears in the Ottoman cuisine in the 15th century. There is some debate about the origin of the words. Some give no other origin for the Turkish word kurabiye than Turkish, while others have given Arabic or Persian. Among others, linguist Sevan Ni≈üanyan has given an Arabic origin, in his 2009 book of Turkish etymology, from ƒ°urayb or ƒüar√Æb (exotic). However, as of 2019, Ni≈üanyan's online dictionary now gives the earliest known recorded use in Turkish as the late 17th century, with an origin from the Persian gulƒÅbiya, a cookie made with rose water, from gulƒÅb, related to flowers. He notes that the Syrian Arabic words ƒ°urƒÅbiye/ƒ°uraybiye likely derive from the Turkish. Regional variations =Iran= Iranian qurabiye from Tabriz In Tabriz, they are made of almond flour, sugar, egg white, vanilla, margarine and pistachio.

Kourabiedes are sometimes made with brandy, usually Metaxa, for flavouring, though vanilla, mastika or rose water are also popular. In some regions of Greece, Christmas kourabiedes are adorned with a single whole spice clove embedded in each biscuit.

History =Foundation= The Sisters of Providence came into being through the work of the Blessed Antonio Rosmini- Serbati, a native of the County of Tyrol, and the Abb√© Jean-Baptiste L√∂wenstein, a native of the region of Lorraine in France. Rosmini, who was ordained a Catholic priest in 1821, dedicated his life to submitting to the Divine Providence in undertaking any work he felt was presented which was a part of it. As part of this, he thought to form a religious community of men dedicated to this vision, which came to be called the Institute of Charity. He met L√∂wenbruck in June 1827, and was impressed by his desire to form a community of priests to evangelize the isolated communities of the mountains of that region. They set up a house in Domodossola, which they called Calvario (Calvary), from which L√∂wenbruck would travel through the Ossola valleys, preaching and teaching the people of the towns there. In the course of his missionary travels, L√∂wenbruck encountered a large population of Walsers living in the Valley of Formazza, who spoke Walser German, a markedly different dialect from their neighbors, as a consequence of which they were unable to communicate easily with the local clergy for their spiritual needs. Due to his background, the French priest was able to, for which he was warmly welcomed by the people of the region. He then spent several months in providing them with the sacraments of the Church and educating them in their Catholic faith. One thing which L√∂wenbruck found from his time among the people of that valley was a strong desire among many of its young women to offer themselves completely to the service of God. What they lacked was any means of education. In order to channel and direct this desire, he conceived of a plan to establish a religious institute to give them an outlet for their calling. He initially contacted some established religious institutes in that region. None would offer assistance in this project, however. Then he remembered that in his homeland of Lorraine he had known a flourishing group of Religious Sisters, called the Congregation of Divine Providence, founded by the Abb√© Jean-Martin Moye in 1762, who were dedicated to the poor, especially through the education of their children. Wishing to find a place for all these young women as soon as possible, Loewenbruck turned to these French Sisters. In 1830 L√∂wenbruck began corresponding with the Superior General of the congregation, the Abb√© E. Feys, the pastor of the town of Portieux, where their motherhouse was located, requesting that some members of that congregation go to the Tyrol to initiate the work he envisioned. Feys initially demurred, suggesting that L√∂wenbruck set up his own structure locally. This, however, was beyond his authority and which went against his tendency to act out of obedience rather than initiating a work. In November 1831, though, perhaps fearing another suppression of religious communities in France, Feys wrote to L√∂wenbruck to suggest that he send some Piedmontese girls to France to begin formation in the consecrated life from the established congregation. L√∂wenbruck responded enthusiastically, organizing a group of four girls to head to Portieux, who set out on 26 November. The journey lasted more than two weeks, as the women had to cross the Simplon Pass in the dead of winter, often walking barefoot for miles. Nevertheless, they arrived at the motherhouse and began training as postulants for the proposed community. After several months, Feys sent L√∂wenbruck glowing appraisals of these candidates. =First days= During 1832, while the Italian women were undergoing their formation in France, L√∂wenbruck set about securing a home for the new institute. In the course of the preaching tour, a local priest in Locarno, in Canton Ticino, suggested to him the availability of an abandoned hospital there, known as San Carlo, which he recommended that the local authorities transfer to him. Despite its wretched conditions, having no doors or windows, L√∂wensbruck accepted it and recruited another four women to start community life there. The four women arrived in Locarno in March 1832 by ferry in the middle of a driving rain, but soon set up a routine of life similar to that of the Brothers of Charity, arising at 4:30 A.M. for prayers, followed by long days of work preparing the house to form their own novitiate, and of study in the rudiments of their faith, given to them by a local priest. They survived on donations collected by L√∂wenbruck in the course of his preaching tours. These were never sufficient to provide an adequate living, however, and they suffered from hunger and cold for months. On that 3 July 13 new candidates joined them, soon followed by the four women returning from France. They were accompanied by two French Sisters, not four as L√∂wenbruck as expected. These women had not been able to receive a religious habit and begin a canonical novitiate during their stay in France out of concern of stirring up problems with the French government authorities. Thus, as soon as the group crossed the border, they did so, receiving habits and religious names. The Sisters then joined the community already organized at Locarno in Ticino, designed to be a novitiate as well as a school for the poor. The novitiate was formally opened on 31 July. L√∂wenbruck provided no funds, however, and though they opened a school, being but minimally educated they could get no salaries from the government as recognized teachers. Further complications was the isolation of the French Sisters, one of whom was still unable to speak Italian, and their consequent difficulty in preparing their Italian charges. Added to this was L√∂wenbruck's incompetence as a Director of the Sisters, making one mistake on his own after another, ignoring the advice of Rosmini. His mishandling of various matters even came to the attention of the local bishop. Rosmini tried to lead his disciple gently in taking these problems in hand, sending various priests to support him. Finally the French Sister Superior wrote to Rosmini to take action over the confusion of the house. By December 1832, even L√∂wenbruck acknowledged his inabilities and begged the founder of his own institute to assume responsibility. This bad management finally induced Rosmini to intervene. He adapted the Rule written by a foundress with whom he worked, St. Maddalena di Canossa, to suit it to its new conditions, and thenceforward had to assume entire responsibility for the Sisters of Providence. He secured training programs for all the Sisters involved in education, so that, by the end of 1833, all teaching Sisters of the Institute were recognized by the local government. Thus they were from the first a distinct but integral part of the Institute of Charity, the \\"Rosminiane\\", as the Italians soon began to call them. Way of life The Institute is mainly contemplative; but, when necessary, they undertake any charitable work suitable to women, especially the teaching of girls and young children, visiting the sick, and instructing in Christian doctrine. The central houses have smaller establishments emanating from and depending upon them. For each of these groups there is one Superior, elected by the professed Sisters for a term three years, and eligible for a second subsequent term. Aided by assistants, she appoints a procuratrix over each lesser establishment and assigns the grades and most of the offices. In a custom begun in 1837, all the Sisters return to their central house every summer for a retreat and to hold a chapter for the election of officers. The novitiate lasts three years; the usual three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, are then taken, at first for three years, then either renewed or made perpetual. Expansion Also by 1837, the Institute had expanded to establishing groups of Sisters in various cities throughout the region. Rosmini made the decision to move the motherhouse to Domodossola, occupying a former Ursuline monastery built around 1600. A novitiate and school for the education of teaching Sisters was then formed there. The Holy See, in its solemn approval of the Institute of Charity in 1839, gave an indirect recognition of the Sisters also, as adopted children of the Institute, at which time the first Sisters were allowed to make their religious profession on 3 November. From that time they have steadily increased. In October 1843, two Rosminian Sisters were sent to England, to help at a school established in Loughborough by Lady Mary Arundell, a convert to the Catholic Church, who had come to know the Fathers of Charity and its founder while traveling in Italy. Their first year was spent in prayer, the study of English and household duties. In this retired life they were joined by the first English postulants, who received their habits in 1844. That same year, on 25 March, they took charge of the first Catholic day school in England to be conducted by Religious Sisters. In 1845 the Sisters began an evening school for the instruction of working girls. The Sisters in England did well, and, for a time, formed a separate institute from Italy, but later merged back with the mother group in Italy. Houses were also opened in Ireland and Wales. The Sisters continued to grow in Italy as well. By the time of the death of the first Mother Superior, one of the young women to have gone to France, in 1879, the Institute numbered 500 living Sisters in 50 different communities around Europe. The Institute was established as a Congregation of Papal Right in 1946, at which time there were nearly 600 permanently professed Sisters, with another 200 candidates, in nearly 100 houses. In the mid-20th century, the Sisters began to establish communities outside of Europe. First was Tanzania (1955), followed by Venezuela (1966), Colombia (1989) and India (1991).

In the mid-19th century the parish was formed when the parish of Widcombe and Lyncombe was split in two, but it was abolished in the late 1960s. The village of Lyncombe existed since at least the Saxon period prior to becoming part of the City of Bath. Lyncombe takes its name from the Celtic word cwm meaning valley, with the Lyn being the name of the stream that runs through it. The present day district is approximately centred on the Western part of this valley, known as Lyncombe Vale, and extends down to the more urban area around the River Avon across from Bath Spa railway station. The northern area of the electoral ward is known as Bear Flat. The electoral ward was merged with Widcombe at the boundary changes effected at the elections held on 2 May 2019.Bath and North East Somerset Council District Council Elections History The Manor of Lyncombe was ecclesiastical property from the time of Osric, king of the Hwicce in the 7th century to the Norman Conquest. A charter of the City of Bath records that in 970 King Edgar \\"granted ten hides at Cliftune (i.e. Lyncombe), near Bath, Somerset, to St Peter's church, Bath, in return for 100 mancuses of gold and ten hides at Cumtune (possibly Chilcompton or Compton Dando, Somerset).\\" The Domesday Book showed that in 1066 S√¶weald Abbot of Bath, held 10 hides in Lyncombe. In 1086 this land was held by √Ülfsige, his successor. Following the death of William the Conqueror the Burgh of Bath, including Lyncombe Manor was sold by his son, William Rufus to John of Tours, Bishop of Wells who moved the bishopric to Bath. In 1302 the Priory of Bath obtained a licence for fairs on their manor of Lyncombe on the Feast of the Cross and on the feast of Saint Lawrence. Lyncombe was part of the hundred of Bath Forum. When Bath became popular as a spa town during the Georgian era, Lyncombe Vale was a famous beauty spot often visited by the well-to-do, and Jane Austen visited on one of her stays in the city. A mineral spring was discovered in Lyncombe Vale in 1737 by Mr Charles Milsom, a cooper (after whose son, Milsom Street in Bath was named). When attempting to fix a leaking fishpond he noticed a sulphurous odour, and saw water bubbling up from the ground. He then styled himself as a doctor and invited friends and neighbours to drink it. The following year a Dr Hillary wrote a treatise on the health- giving properties of the water, and the two men built a stone edifice over the spring to receive patients. However this weakened the ground and caused the spring to fail. Advertisement for King James's Palace Lyncombe House, adjacent to the spa, was often called \\"King James's palace\\", a name derived from a tradition that James II of England stayed there with his consort Mary of Modena after abdicating the throne. Although this cannot be corroborated, it is known that Mary made a long visit to Bath in 1687, and later the king joined her at a time when the city would not have afforded them the privacy they sought in the face of great public discontent. Lyncombe, less than a mile from the city, would have been a likely refuge. The house remained a popular destination until the 19th century. A 1792 advertisement in the local newspaper proclaims of \\"A Publick Night, [at] King James's Palace, Illuminations, and far more Brilliant Fireworks that ever were exhibited in the Gardens\\". During the industrial revolution the district of Lyncombe and Widcombe was noted for the manufacture of woollen cloth, with 565 males over the age of 20 being employed in the industry in 1831. The area closest to the river was considered the manufacturing part of Bath, whereas the valley of Lyncombe Vale to the south remained a more secluded area of natural beauty. In 1835 the Municipal Corporations Act extended the boundary of the city of Bath to include the entire parish of Lyncombe and Widcombe. Twenty years later in 1855, and following an increase in the population of the area, Widcombe and Lyncombe were split into two parishes, with the church of St Mark's to become the parish church of Lyncombe, and St Matthews the parish church of Widcombe: The boundaries of the new parish of Lyncombe were delineated thus by the Commissioners for Building New Churches: In 1972 due to a declined population and attendances the parish of Lyncombe was abolished and incorporated into a new parish of Saint Bartholomew based in nearby Oldfield Park: References External links *Lyncombe Neighbourhood Statistics *Lyncombe police beat Category:Areas of Bath, Somerset Category:Electoral wards in Bath and North East Somerset ","title":"Lyncombe, Bath"},{"id":"33040162","text":"Thomas L√∂ffler (born 1 May 1989) is an Austrian footballer.

It is south of the city of Lancaster and is on the east bank of the River Lune. is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is now owned by Lancaster Golf Club. History In the 13th century, the lordship of the Manor was held by the De Coucy family and from them passed to John de Coupland. The original hall dates from the late 14th century. It was probably completed in 1381, built by Edmund Lawrence. It then passed by marriage to the Butlers of Radcliffe and from them to the Gerards of Bromley. In 1698 the estate was acquired by James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton, on his second marriage to the Gerard heiress Elizabeth Gerard. He fought a famous duel in 1712 with Lord Mohun over the right of ownership of Gawthorpe Hall and was fatally stabbed by General Macartney, Mohun's second. His widow lived for another 32 years, spending most of her time at the Hall. In 1853, the hall was sold by the Dukes of Hamilton to Le Gendre Nicholas Starkie of the wealthy Starkie family of Huntroyde Hall and in 1856 was largely rebuilt to a design by William Le Gendre Starkie. The only part of the 14th century structure that still remains is the tower that now forms the southern wing of the hall. After Le Gendre Starkie's death Ashton passed to his younger son, John Piers Chamberlain Starkie who passed it in turn to his eldest son Edward Arthur Le Gendre Starkie. He sold it in 1884 to James Williamson, the linoleum manufacturer, who owned the hall until his death in 1930, but lived elsewhere. Williamson was High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1885 and on his elevation to the peerage took his title Baron Ashton of Ashton. After his death in 1931 the major portion of the estate was purchased by William Pye and his sons. Ashton Hall is now owned by Lancaster Golf Club and functions as the clubhouse, with the surrounding land having been turned into a golf course in 1932. The course was designed by renowned golf course architect James Braid. Architecture Ashton Hall is constructed of red and grey sandstone, with roofs of slate. Its plan is unusual, with towers set diagonally. The 19th-century building was built in the Gothic style of grey sandstone. The rectangular 14th-century tower is of red sandstone; it has angle-towers and a crenellated parapet. The grounds of the hall have a number of other buildings. There is a sandstone ashlar gatehouse which dates from around 1600. It was extended in the 19th century. The gatehouse has a segmented arch with Doric columns. An ice house of sandstone rubble and brick stands to the north-west of the hall. This probably dates from the 19th century. There is a building to the west of the hall that was formerly a stable block and has been converted into a house. Dating from the 17th century, it is a two-storey building of sandstone rubble. On 1 August 1952, Ashton Hall was designated a Grade I listed building. The Grade I designation‚Äîthe highest of the three grades‚Äîis for buildings \\"of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\". The gatehouse and the former stable block have received separate Grade II* designations. The ice house, an arched conduit mouth, a mounting block and the courtyard walls are listed at Grade II.

History Planning permission was granted by the local council to build a licensed theatre to replace the Theatre Royal of nearby Frank Street in 1901. The theatre was designed by Campbell and Horsley of Manchester and built by S. Robinson and Sons of Hyde. The completed theatre opened on 3 November 1902 with a Victorian French melodrama, Little Jim, with Shakespeare and other classic plays to follow. In 1914 a movable screen was added onto the stage to enable the theatre to operate as a part-time cinema. In the early 1970s, the popularity of live performances were on the decline and the decision was made to stop them altogether at the theatre. The main auditorium become a full-time cinema and a second cinema opened in 1972 taking up the majority of the original stage area. The last live performance held was a production of Annie Get Your Gun. In later years, the main auditorium was referred to as 'Royal 1' and the second cinema was referred to as 'Royal 2'. The theatre was also referred to as the 'Royal Cinema' although the 'Theatre Royal' signs remained on the building . In the early 1990s, the London-based owners discovered problems with fraud at the theatre and decided to close it down in August 1993 as they considered it a liability. The theatre was full for the last few days of business, with people still offering support to Hyde's last local cinema. The final film to be shown was Walt Disney's classic, The Jungle Book. The Theatre The main auditorium could seat up to 1400 people, it consisted of pit stalls with 300 seats, dress and rear circles with another 300 seats, then a gallery and amphi with 800 seats. The theatre also offered one of the largest stages in the area with a fly gallery offering fast scenery changes. Famous Faces During its peak, the Theatre Royal offered performances by many famous acts of the day including Laurel and Hardy, Enrico Caruso, Billy Connolly and Frank Randle. Julie Andrews also made an early appearance at the theatre along with her mother and stepfather. Theatre Royal Onward Supporters of The Theatre Royal, September 2011 In 1999, planning permission was in the process of being granted to demolish the theatre to make way for a housing development, however a group of volunteers joined together to save the Theatre Royal, named Theatre Royal Onward, the group campaigned for the theatre to be granted listed building status which it was in 2000. The theatre was put up for auction in 2005 however the society lost the bid to buy the theatre and it was sold to a local property developer, Aurora Hyde Limited. However the fight to return the theatre to its former glory continues, much like the campaign to save another local theatre, Stockport Plaza which was successful. The theatre has been open to the public on Heritage Open Days, however in 2011 this was not possible due to building work being carried out within the theatre itself by the present owners. The society instead organised a classic 1960s cinema queue to congregate outside in support of the theatre restoration. The campaign was very popular with many local residents joining and a local radio station arriving to interview people of their memories.

Web. .  History  Eleven songs believed to have been leaked tracks from the Tron: Legacy soundtrack by the electronic group Daft Punk. The style of these tracks consisted of a mix of Acid House and Funky-Disco characteristics seen in Daft Punk's previous albums: Homework and Discovery. The public believed the new songs as the confirmation of and return to the previous style that had made Daft Punk internationally famous. The news was covered and hinted as Daft Punk's work by a large number of reputable journals. On 26 December 2011, the group announced its dissolution on its Facebook page. However, on 21 May 2013, a post on its Facebook page stated that their fourth album would be released at the end of summer, and a new official page was linked in the post. The band has spoken against these claims, stating that they would not make music with the sound of the track released, and the song \\"Amnesia\\" has been removed from iTunes and YouTube. It has been implied that the administrator of the Facebook page fabricated the return of The Third Twin. Controversy While they were well received in Paris, The Third Twin was still unknown outside of nightclubs until they were mistakenly reported to be a side-project of Daft Punk. The rumor was that Daft Punk had created songs for the Tron: Legacy soundtrack that were rejected by the Disney Corporation and that the group was secretly releasing the songs under an assumed name to prevent legal repercussions. This was later refuted by Daft Punk, Disney and The Third Twin themselves, however the controversy surrounding the YouTube video release served as a method of introducing The Third Twin to the world, and created many continuing arguments between the fans of Daft Punk and The Third Twin. Neither The Third Twin nor Daft Punk have commented on these. In 2013 a new single titled \\"Amnesia\\" was released on iTunes and YouTube, but was later removed for violating terms of service. The Third Twin stated that they would not make music that sounded like Amnesia, and the sale of their music on iTunes contradicts their beliefs that music should be free. Identity Even though The Third Twin DJs consistently state that their identities are not important and may even draw attention away from the overall The Third Twin movement, there has been much speculation and undue importance placed on who The Third Twin is, rather than what they do. What is known is that the duo is based in Andorra, the duo has been a part of the French House scene since 2010. The Third Twin has also been falsely identified as musical groups such as Justice, Deadmau5, Skrillex and others. There have been numerous YouTube posts making these assertions, but it is currently unknown who continues to perpetuate these statements.  Image  The Third Twin has created an image for itself as being a minor branch of a philosophical-music project aimed at unifying human consciousness. They claim to have little knowledge of the parent-organization \\"The Third Twin Company,\\" other than they (and the duo) support Globalization, Environmentalism, social co-operation, and the existence of extra-terrestrials. This last aspect is the main element of the duo's public image: The Third Twin DJs reference the Arecibo Observatory and the Arecibo Message in their music and live, multimedia events. They have also styled their image as a band after the concept of extra-terrestrials, by saying that they, themselves, are alien entities here to evaluate humanity's development and readiness for the next stage of evolution.  Music and artistic projects  The Third Twin is the focus of a motion comic that was debuted at C2E2 in Chicago 2011. The Third Twin Project (TTTProject) The Third Twin has created a fanclub called \\"The Third Twin Project\\" or \\"TTTProject,\\" for short. The Project is YouTube based, and opened on February 24, 2011. The group has members from all over the globe.

Date ranges from 1453, when Mantegna married Nicolosia Bellini, daughter Jacapo Bellini painter and the sister of Giovanni and Gentile, both painters as their father, and 1460 when he left for Mantua. Bellini's Presentation at the Temple, explicitly inspired by Mantegna's, dates to around the latter year. Description The scene is set within a marble frame. The cushion on which the Child lies stands on it and partially juts out. The Virgin Mary, in the foreground, is holding the Child while a bearded priest is near her. At the center, in penumbra, is Joseph with an aureola. Also in the background, at the sides, two spectators without aureola have been identified as possibly Mantegna's self-portrait and a portrait of his wife.

Gutenberg's invention of movable type was rated by Time magazine as one of the most important developments of the millennium. Prior to his invention, ordinary people could not afford to own a book. With the efficiencies created by Gutenberg, printing costs dropped dramatically, and book ownership became common in Europe. People could now buy their own Bible, and interpret it themselves, rather than have to rely on their priest or minister. This led to people thinking for themselves as well, which led to the Protestant Reformation, the Enlightenment, and democracy.Gray, Paul, \\"15th Century: Johann Gutenberg (c. 1395-1468),\\" Time magazine, Dec. 31, 1999 (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993033,00.html), Retrieved 9-10-11.

The deaths resulted in a lawsuit against the Ramada and its owners. The drownings came at a time when many area hotels were being constructed without deep ends in their pools, or were renovating their pools to remove them, according to hospitality industry professionals. Background The victims, twin brothers George and Vincent Chin (16) and their brother Winston (13), were from Brooklyn, New York. They were traveling with their uncle Steven Yee, who had paid for the three boys, two of their siblings, and his own three children to join him in a tour group to Boston.. Also available at . Drownings The tour buses arrived at the Ramada Rolling Green Hotel in Andover just off Route 133 at around 9:30p.m. Yee took a shower, while the boys, who did not know how to swim, went to the pool. The pool had a sign posted stating that it closed at 10p.m.‚Äîit also stated that no one under 14 was allowed in the pool without adult supervision. No lifeguard was on duty, and Massachusetts law does not require one at hotel pools. Nor did the pool have a fence or a ladder in the deep end. Andover town law did not require fences around indoor pools; however, Ramada corporate standards did, the Chin family alleged that state law also required it. Their cousin began video-taping them as they played in the pool. The water was deep in the deep end. According to police, at one point Vincent and Winston began moving toward the deep end, until the water was above their heads; their siblings thought they were just playing, but when they did not emerge, their siblings began yelling for help and threw them a life preserver. George dived into the pool in a rescue attempt, while his cousin went into the hotel to try to find someone to help. A pool maintenance man would later testify that he saw them playing in the pool but did not mention this fact to co-workers or managers. At the time, the night manager and another employee were on the way to the pool to close it, but stopped to chat with the pool maintenance man, delaying their arrival. By the time they came to the pool, they found the boys already submerged. The night manager jumped into the pool and pulled them out. However, the employees lacked aquatic rescue skills and could not render further assistance. Vincent was taken to Lawrence General Hospital in the neighboring town of Lawrence, while Winston was taken to St. John's Hospital (now Saints Medical Center) in Lowell; both were declared dead on arrival. George was still alive when removed from the pool, and was taken by helicopter to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where he was pronounced dead at 6:18a.m. the following morning. The parents flew to Boston that day to identify the bodies and arrange their return to New York. Aftermath About 500 mourners attended the boys' funeral, which was held on 13 April at the Wah Wing Sang Buddhist funeral home. Mayor David Dinkins spoke briefly. The Brooklyn Chinatown branches of the Lions Club and Kiwanis, together with the Chinese-American Voters' Association, started a fund to provide aid to the family, as the father was then unemployed. Ramada Rolling Green and its owners offered the Chin family a $1.8 million settlement in January 1996, which they rejected. Instead, they filed a wrongful death and negligence suit. They hoped to spark changes in Massachusetts law to require lifeguards at hotel pools, in the way that law in New York City already did. Jury selection was completed on January 29. During deliberations, one member of the jury was dismissed for reading a newspaper article about the case. The remaining members of the jury failed to reach a verdict. On February 16, presiding judge Nancy Gertner declared a mistrial.

Legal practice is based upon the civil law system with the code of law influenced by other codified systems such as France, Germany and Japan as well as customary laws of Thailand.Baker & McKenzie, Bangkok Office, Doing Business in Thailand: Legal Brief 2001.  History of Legal Practice in Thailand  Timeline of the development of Thai Legal System The ancient origins of Thai Law was based on the Hindu code of Manu. During the Sukhothai period (1238‚Äì1350 AD),Patit P Mishra, The History of Thailand (ABC-CLIO,2010) at xiv. there was no system of Justice since the King was \\"the Fountain of Justice\\" who alone settled disputes between the people. During the Ayutthaya Period (1351‚Äì1767 AD),Chris Baker, Christopher J Baker, P Phaonpachit, A History of Thailand (Cambridge University Press, 2nd Ed, 2009) at xv. the first semblance of a legal system emerged. The law code was the Royal Stone InscriptionASEAN Law Association, \\"The Judicial System in Thailand: An Outlook for a New Century\\" at p60 (accessed 10 September 2011). which was formulated from a set of rules derived from the Kings‚Äô decisionsBunnag, Marut, Aakesson, Preben A. F., \\"The Legal System in Thailand\\" Revised 8/96 9a Mod. Legal Sys. Cyclopedia 9A.30.1 at 9A.30.8. These precedents became known as \\"The Rajasattham\\", which was a digest of royal decisions. in the Court of Law.Set up by King Borom Trailokanat at which cases were heard and administration of justice was carried out was set in the Grand Palace, close to the building in which the King daily presided over his Council. Although the law codeOne such law was the Law on Procedures on Admission of Plaints, which allowed for specified classes of people to be represented in court. allowed for people to be represented in court for civil and criminal matters, the lawyer's work was limited. He could not be involved in the examination of witnesses before the court and was mainly concerned with writing plaints and filing them before the court.Bunnag, Marut, Aakesson, Preben A. F., \\"The Legal System in Thailand\\" Revised 8/96 9a Mod. Legal Sys. Cyclopedia at 9A.30.32. When Thailand was invaded by Burma in 1767, collections of law were partially destroyed.ASEAN Law Association, \\"The Judicial System in Thailand: An Outlook for a New Century\\" at p. 62 (accessed 10 September 2011). King Rama I ordered to have all laws rectified and written into law books called \\"the Law of the three Great Seals\\" which remained in force for the next 103 years. Despite this development, the role of the lawyer remained static and constricted. This could be attributed to simple way of life of the society where majority did not resort to the law to settle their disputes. = Foreign influence = In 1827, Thailand, which had trade relations with Western countries, was forced by England to amend its rules and regulation.Most significantly, the 'Bowring treaty' which brought unequal judiciary was signed, where the English had no obligation to Thai law and judiciary. Adopting an open door policy, King Rama IV (reigned 1851‚Äì1868>Clark D Nehr, Modern Thai Politics: From Village to Nation. A Collection of Readings (Schenkman Publishing Company, 1976) at p8. tried to reform the Thai law and judiciary to make it acceptable to the Western countries. = Modernisation and Development of Legal Practice = In continuation of King Rama IV's efforts, his son, King Rama V (reigned 1868‚Äì1910) appointed Royal Commissioners to reform existing laws. These efforts revolutionized the law and modernized the judiciary. A new court system was set up between 1894‚Äì97.Bunnag, Marut, Aakesson, Preben A. F., \\"The Legal System in Thailand\\" Revised 8/96 9a Mod. Legal Sys. Cyclopedia 9A.30.13. The King no longer judged cases himself although decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeal were still made under his name.H R H Prince Chula Chakrabongse, \\"Lords of Life: A History of the Kings of Thailand, D.D. Books, Bangkok, Thailand (1960) at 241. In 1892, the Ministry of Justice was established and its Minister, Prince Raphi,The son of King Rama V who graduated from Oxford University. was appointed to unify the judiciary. He set up the first law school in Thailand.Which saw its very first class of nine lawyers in 1897. Moreover, he also reorganized the Thai court system under the Law on the Organization of 1908. = Bar Association in Thailand and Practising Lawyers‚Äô Act = In 1914, the Bar Association in Thailand was formed and was the first Thai lawyers‚Äô organization. Following this, the first Lawyers‚Äô Act was passed and it legitimized the legal profession and practice in Thailand. = Evolving Role of Legal Practice = As seen from above, the role of the legal practice has evolved tremendously over the years. In the early years, it could be said that the power of judiciary and lawmaking was solely vested with the King. Today, although the King is the Head of the Thai Nation, his legislative power is exercised with the consent of the National Assembly and the power of the judiciary is vested in the Courts. The lawyer's role has also been legitimized with the establishment of law schools and with the Lawyers‚Äô Act.Lawyers' Act B.E. 2528 (1985).  The legal education system  The various legal education paths available in Thailand. = Starting legal education = Legal education in Thailand is an undergraduate programme. To enter, it is compulsory to take the National University Entrance Examination conducted by the Ministry of University Affairs. Entry is determined by academic records from upper secondary school, test scores, interviews and physical examinations.Triamanuruck, Phongpala, Chaiyasuta, \\"Overview of Legal Systems in the Asia-Pacific Region: Thailand\\" at p5. (accessed on 8 September 2011). = Choosing a place for legal education = One can choose between Private universities, Public universities and Open universities.Iam Chaya-ngam, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, Thailand (accessed 10 September 2011). Open universities are typically for rural dwellers who are interested in legal studies but are unable to attend other universities. Education by open universities is often off-campus and on a correspondence basis. The Institute of Legal Education of Thai Bar AssociationThe Thai Bar website <> (accessed 10 September 2011). was set up in 1948 to increase legal knowledge among law practitioners.Charunun Sathitsuksomboon, \\"Thailand's Legal System: Requirements, Practice, and Ethical Conduct\\" (accessed 10 September 2011). = Different types of certification/qualifications = There is the 4-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) course;ASEAN Law Association, \\"The Judicial System in Thailand: An Outlook for a New Century\\" at p. 69 (accessed 10 September 2011). the 1-year Master of Laws (LL.M.) programme,A prior LL.B. is usually a requirement for admission. and the doctoral programme (Ph.D),An in-depth research paper is usually required. typically a 3-year course. = Curriculum = Lectures are conducted in Thai, and faculty members are graduates of foreign law schools. Students are required to choose an area of specialisation in their third year of study, either Business Law, Public Law, International Law, or Civil and Criminal Law. General criticism regarding Thai law schools include the excessive rote learning, memorisation of laws and the ineffective lecture-style of teaching which discourages discussion. Moreover, scant attention is given to subjects like international law and investment subjects because of a lack of qualified teachers on these topics in the country.Professor Samrieng Mekkriengkrai, \\"Legal Education Reform in Thailand\\" at pp1‚Äì2 (accessed 10 September 2011). = Recent reforms = The government's desire to promote foreign direct investment in Thailand has prompted a reform of local university curriculum to meet the changing international demands.The country is seeking to ready itself for a flow of foreign investment into Thailand under the scheme of free and fair trade promoted by the WTO, which Thailand has become a party to. The curriculum is also changing from a more traditional to a more student-centered one where law lecturers prepare their lesson plans with case studies, activities and effective evaluation. Since becoming an ASEAN member in 2008, the ASEAN Charter has positively impacted the Thai legal education. Many courses are now taught in English and there is a significant increase in partnership courses with overseas universities.Thanitcul, \\" ASEAN Charter and Legal education in Thailand\\" (20 August 2009) at p7 (accessed on 11 September 2011). It is now also a requirement to be competent in foreign language and IT for graduates to be able to transcend national boundaries in communication and conduct legal research at the international level.Professor Samrieng Mekkriengkrai, \\"Legal Education Reform in Thailand\\" at p. 3 (accessed 10 September 2011). = Necessary Requirements for Practice = As set out in the Lawyer's Act, lawyers have to fulfill a set of conditions to obtain a license.Lawyers' Act B.E. 2528 s 35 (1985).. (accessed 10 September 2011) In addition to the LL.B., law graduates are required to be Thai nationals, cannot be a government official, and must pass an exam for a lawyer license.Bunnag, Marut, Aakesson, Preben A. F., \\"The Legal System in Thailand\\" Revised 8/96 9a Mod. Legal Sys. Cyclopedia 9A.30.26. On passing the Lawyers Council examination, one can apply for permission to practice law.Tilleke & Gibbins, \\"Thailand Legal Basics\\" Tilleke & Gibbins International Ltd. at p5 (21 September 2009) <> (accessed 10 September 2011).  Division of Roles in the Profession  The legal profession in Thailand is divided among various types of professionals. The professionals involved are \\"First and Second class lawyers\\" (distinction has since been abolished), \\"Notaries\\" and \\"Foreign Practitioners\\". = First and Second Class Lawyers = Prior to 1985, practising lawyers in Thailand were divided into two classes.Lawyers' Act B.E. 2475 (1985). First-class lawyers were law graduates while second-class lawyers held a diploma in law and passed an examination held by the Bar Association. The main distinction was that first-class lawyers could practice throughout the country while second-class lawyers could only practice in ten provinces specified in their licenses. Since the Lawyers' Act passed in 1985,Lawyers' Act B.E. 2528 s 84 (1985). this distinction has been removed and those registered under the Act have the right of audience in all courts throughout the country. = Notaries = In Thailand, public documents,Hague Convention (1961) Abolishing the Requirements of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents (accessed 9 September 2011). such as birth and marriage certificates need to be verified, witnessed and certified by a notary, a public official who legalizes documents by his hand and official seal.Suwan Buacharern, \\"Notary Public in Thailand\\" . To become a notary, a Thai lawyer is required to complete a legal training course by the Lawyer's Council of Thailand.Lawyer's Council of Thailand website (accessed 9 September 2011). There have been reported instances of unlicensed notaries in Thailand, and the public has been advised to be cautious in dealing with notaries. = Foreign legal practitioners = Foreigners are not allowed to formally practice law.Lawyers Act B.E. 2528 s 35. (accessed 10 September 2011) Instead foreigners work as \\"consultants\\", mostly on transnational cases. Foreign practitioners provide a valuable service to their clients which the local lawyers cannot. Moreover, they impart valuable knowledge on foreign laws to their Thai colleagues.Suchint Chaimunkalanont, \\"Cross-Border Legal Services in ASEAN Under WTO: A Thai Perspective\\" (accessed 9 September 2011).  Appointment of Judges  = Requirements = The main criteria for law graduates intending to be judges are: At least 25 years of age, an L.L.B., a Barrister-at-Law degree from the Bar Institute, and two years‚Äô experience in the legal profession.Such as a court clerk, assistant court clerk, probation officer, official receiver, public prosecutor, practising lawyer, or other government legal officer. Judge trainees then undergo training courses and serve as judges‚Äô assistants for not less than one year. = Types of Judges = The various types of Thai Judges. There are four types of judges in the Thai system ‚Äì career judges, senior judges, associate judges and Datoh justices.Thai Courts of Justice website, \\"The Judiciary of Thailand\\" <> (accessed 10 September 2011). = Career judges = The process to becoming a career judge involves five stages. First Stage: Meet general qualifications for judge-trainee, such as: Thai nationality, 25 years of age and being a member of the Thai Bar Association. Second Stage: Fulfill one of three methods to become a judge-trainee: # Open Examination: For LL.B. holders with at least two years of legal experience. # Knowledge Test: For LL.B or other qualification holders without two years of legal experience but satisfying other criteria. # Special Selection: For academics and ranking government officials who possess excellent knowledge in the law. Third Stage: Undergo at least one year of training as a judge-trainee. Fourth Stage: Approval by the Judicial Service Commission and tendering application to the King. Fifth Stage: Receiving royal appointment by the King. The process of Judicial appointment. = Senior Judges = Unlike Commonwealth jurisdictions which value the experience and wisdom of older judges, Senior Judges in Thailand are viewed very differently. When judges reach 60 years old, they are restricted to duties in the lower Courts of First Instance, and cannot hold the position of Chief Justice. In addition, judges reaching 60 must be reappointed to office, and can only hold office till the age of 70. To be reappointed, judges must: # Be approved by the Judicial Service Commission; # Be tendered for Royal appointment; and # Pass a physical assessment at 65 years old. = Layman judges = Layman judges are not legally trained. They typically comprise people with experience or expertise in areas such as Family, Labor and Intellectual Property. Having laymen working with career judges helps provide more varied opinions in deciding cases. Layman judges are selected by the Judicial Service Commission and do not hold permanent positions . = Kadi = Kadis (Qadi) are experts in Islam. They work with career judges to decide family law cases in certain provinces.Rules of Appointing and Holding Senior Judge Position Act, B.E. 2542 (1999). A Kadi ensures that the court complies with Islamic principles. A Kadi is required to be above 30 years old, possess good command of Thai, and have knowledge in Islamic laws regarding family and succession. = Judicial Service Commission = The Judicial Service Commission plays a crucial role in the appointment of judges. It screens all potential candidates before their tender to the King, and holds power over the removal, promotions, salary increments and punishment of judges.ASEAN Law Association, \\"The Judicial System in Thailand: An Outlook for a New Century\\" at p. 54 (accessed 10 September 2011). The Judicial Service Commission consists of mainly members of the judiciary:The Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand 2007 s 221. the Supreme Court President, 12 members from all Court levels and 2 officers elected by the Senate.  Appointment of Public Prosecutors  The Constitution sets out the powers and duties of public prosecutors.The Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand 2007 s 225. = Requirements = The main criteria for Law graduates intending to be public prosecutors are: Thai nationality, an LL.B, and passing the Thai Bar Association examination.Regulation of Public Prosecutor Officers Act B.E. 2521 (1978). = Public Prosecutors Committee = The Public Prosecutors Committee has crucial role in the appointment of Public Prosecutors. It is charged with: # Appointing and removing the Prosecutor General upon approval of the Senate. # Approving the appointment, promotion, salary increments, transfers, removal and punishment of public prosecutors.ASEAN Law Association, \\"The Judicial System in Thailand: An Outlook for a New Century\\" at p. 55 (accessed 10 September 2011).  Role of the legal profession in Thailand  = Different role in a non-litigious environment = Thai lawyers have a very different role from their Western counterparts in dealing with civil wrongs and disputes. In Thailand, parties tend to avoid legal proceedings because of its confrontational nature. Instead, they rely on mutual understanding to reach a solution.Ted L. McDorman, \\"The Teaching of the Law of Thailand\\" 11 Dalhousie LJ 915 1987‚Äì1988 at 921. This non-litigious environment stems from the Thai culture, which accords great value to the importance of harmonious societal relationships, and places communal interests above individual interests. As such, dispute resolutions which avoid conflict and embody the spirit of tolerance are perceived as the more appropriate approach.Ted L. McDorman, \\"The Teaching of the Law of Thailand\\" 11 Dalhousie LJ 915 1987‚Äì1988 at 922. Hence, lawyers are drawn to roles in non-judicial approaches such as mediation and arbitration, which allows disputing parties more flexibility.The Nation website, \\"The Constitutional Tribunal disbands Thai Rak Thai\\" (30 May 2007) (accessed 9 September 2011). = Political involvement =  Judiciary  The Thai judiciary plays a key role in Thai politics. On 30 May 2007, the Constitutional Court of Thailand dissolved the Thai Tak Thai Party, the incumbent ruling party under former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, due to international law violations. In the wake of the 2011 elections, the Democrat legal team also initiated legal proceedings to challenge and dissolve the Puea Thai Party.Aman Kakar, \\"Thailand opposition lawyers challenge election\\" in Jurist (10 July 2011) ,http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/07/thailand- opposition-lawyers-challenge-election.php> (accessed 11 September 2011).  Lawyers  In light of the violence against \\"Red Shirt\\" anti-government protestors in April and May 2010, lawyers have demanded a full investigation into the deaths of more than 80 civilians. They have filed a notice to the International Criminal Court (ICC) alleging human rights violations.The Nation/Asia One Network website, \\"Lawyer files case with International Criminal over red shirts\\" (1 February 2011) (accessed 11 September 2011). The Human Rights Committee of the Lawyers Council of Thailand The Human Rights Committee of the Lawyers Council of Thailand regularly comments on the issues of human rights that plague Thailand and even propose strategies the government can follow. In June 2011, the committee released a report that assessed the conditions under which the government could send back Burmese refugees in accordance with the requirements of international law and existing treaties and agreements.Karen News website, \\"Repatriation raises many questions and no answers\\" (13 June 2006) (accessed 11 September 2011). In September 2011, the committee submitted a statement to the PM, the Secretary- General of the National Security Council, the Minister of Social Development and Human Security, the Minister of Defense, and Commissioner-General of the Royal Thai Police on certain strategies they can adopt to handle the problem of human trafficking of the Rohingya people.Prachatai website, \\"The Lawyers Council of Thailand urges the government to tackle Rohingya traffickign organizations\\" (9 February 2011) (accessed 11 September 2011). =Lawyers as Educators= The Thongbai Thongbao Foundation The Thongbai Thongbao Foundation was founded in 1990 by Thongbai Thongbao, who was a well-known human rights lawyer from Mahasarakham province, Thailand.Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center website, \\"Thailand: The Thongbai Thongpao Experience\\" (accessed 11 September 2011). They provide both legal aid and education to various sectors of the society, and they visit about 30 villages and districts annually. Their objective is to ensure that Thai people are aware of their rights and know how to take proper legal action. Aspects of the law that affect people in everyday situations, such as law on marriages, law on loans and mortgages, labour law and human rights law, are taught and discussed at their training sessions. The International Thai Foundation / COMMUNITY LEGAL CENTRE The International Thai Foundation was founded in 2012 with the Thai Ministry of Interior, Kor Tor 2266. It provides legal advice and representation to those whom are disadvantaged, poor, disabled, DFNs and vulnerable so they may access justice. It established a Community Legal Centre in Chiang Mai.  Social and economic concerns  = Social position of lawyers = Today, the legal profession is no longer exclusive to the upper classes.Funatsu, Kagoya, \\"The middle classes in Thailand: The Rise of the Urban Intellectual Elite and their Social Consciousness\\" )accessed 10 September 2011). Entry into the Thai law schools is based on a merit system and middle class students are generally not restricted by university fees. First, the rise of the middle class, or the , saw an increase in the number of Thai students in higher education, from 16.1% in 1990 to 44.6% in 2009. Second, the average Thai household in 2009 made 250,836 Baht annually,2009 Average Monthly Household Income: Whole Kingdom (Thailand), CEIC data. compared to typical law school fees of 23,570 Baht per academic year.The benchmark used is Thammasat University's Law Programme fees. This resulted in a 25 times increase in the number of lawyers in Thailand ‚Äì in 1960, there were about 2,000 lawyers for a population of 23 million; in 2008, there were about 54,000 lawyers in a population of 60 million.Frank Munger, \\"Globalization, Investing in Law, and the Careers of Lawyers for Social Cause: Taking on Rights in Thailand\\" 53 NYL Sch L Rev 745 at 747. =Economic significance of lawyers= The legal profession in Thailand is traditionally a Thai-dominated profession because foreigners are not allowed to formally practice law. This can be viewed as a form of control over the legal profession,Richard Abel, \\"Comparative Sociology of Legal Professions\\" 1985 Am B Found Res J 1 1985. suggesting the government's intention to preserve local dominance. However, Thailand's embrace of globalization has made transnational legal relations unavoidable. Thailand's rapid development caused a shortage of Thai lawyers possessing expertise in specialized areas of law. This has led to a unique situation in reality, where many foreign lawyers work in Thailand but under the guise of \\"business consultants\\".Suchint Chaimungkalanont, \\"Cross-Border Legal Services in Asean Under WTO: A Thai Perspective\\" at p. 84. Proposals have been made reform,Suchint Chaimungkalanont, \\"Cross-Border Legal Services in Asean Under WTO: A Thai Perspective\\" at p. 86. but it remains to be seen if the Thai government will relax requirements for foreign lawyers.

It is similar to Krapfen with the difference that it is not sweet. The name possibly derives from its elongated oval shape that resembles a shoe sole (the German word is \\"Schuh\\") but this theory is questionable, as the local dialect deforms diphthongs in another way. This name for the pastry appears in the books of Johann Andreas Schmeller, a Bavarian linguist. In poor times the pastry served as a side dish for sauerkraut and blood or liver sausage. In the area around Landshut, Schuxen are eaten from 24 April until Kermesse, the third Sunday in October.

Life  Frederick was the youngest son of Count George I of Hesse-Darmstadt (1547‚Äì1596) from his first marriage to Magdalene (1552‚Äì1587), daughter of Count VIII Bernhard of Lippe. Frederick did not have any rights to inherit, because in Hesse-Darmstadt primogeniture had been introduced properly. Nevertheless, Frederick received in 1622 an apanage consisting of the City and district of Homburg, as well as a one-off payment plus an annual sum. He was not considered a sovereign prince, but fell under the sovereignty of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1626, he introduced primogeniture in Hesse-Homburg. One of his sons was Frederick II of Hesse-Homburg, better known as The Prince of Homburg.

It operates as a secondary school, which takes children from the age of 11 through to the age of 16. The school is currently led by headteacher Paul Jennings. The school comprises two houses named after prominent figures in Kington's past: Banks and Garrick. The sixth form was one of the smallest in Herefordshire and was threatened with closure in 2006; however, it remained open until 2019 when it finally closed.  History  The school was founded on 29 September 1632 with funding from the estate of Lady Margaret Hawkins (widow of Sir John Hawkins) who had died in 1619. In her will, dated 23 April 1619, she left ¬£800 'for the purchasing of lands or tenements of a yearly value of forty pounds for and towards the perpetual maintenance of a learned and choice preaching divine, the Master, to keep a free school in Kington, in the County of Herefordshire, and of a learned and discreet Usher under him, for the instructing and teaching of youths and children in literature and good education.' Captain Anthony Lewis, servant to Lady Hawkins and acting executor of the will, purchased School Farm, Upper Hergest, in 1622 to produce the necessary forty pounds a year for running the school. He paid ¬£26 13s 4d for a piece of ground in Kington on which the school would be built. Lewis contracted John Abel of Sarnesfield to build it. John Abel, who was Carpenter to King Charles I, was to provide the materials and was paid ¬£240 for his work. The school is now housed in modern buildings erected in 1962 and 1973, with other buildings erected more recently, almost all of which have been refurbished between 1990 and 1995 to meet the challenges and demands of recent curriculum developments. The original 1600s building is now in use as a private residence. The school has a tradition on visiting the nearby parish church, St. Mary's, to give thanks for its foundation and all those who have served in it over three and a half centuries.

Pigot's father died when he was 36.Obituaries, Gentleman's magazine, accessed September 2011 In 1804, when she was 21, she met the sixteen-year-old Byron, who had moved into a house opposite hers in April of that year.Ivan Pregnolato, ‚ÄòElizabeth Bridgot Pigot, Byron's female friend ', The Nottingham Byron Web Archive: Byron and the Pigots, ed. Matthew Green (University of Nottingham, 2008): http://byron.nottingham.ac.uk/archive . They became friends and she used to accompany his singing on the piano. Pigot and Byron corresponded with each other until 1811. During this time Byron was at Trinity College, Cambridge, whereas Pigot appears to have received her education at home or at a nearby girls' school. Pigot used to copy out the poems that Byron sent her. Some of Byron's early encouragement with his poetry came from Pigot. In 1806 and 1807 Elizabeth and her brother John, who was also a friend of Byron's, helped to expedite the publication of three of Byron's poetic works through a publisher in Newark. A watercolour from Pigots hand sewn book which has a poem and illustrations about Byron and his dog In 1807 Pigot became engaged briefly to an Indian Army officer: this did not lead to marriage, but it did result in Byron writing a poem dedicated to Pigot. In the same year, Pigot created a short story in verse that featured Byron, called \\"The Wonderful History of Lord Byron and his Dog,\\" which she illustrated in her water colours with sketches of Byron and his dog. The work is thought to be a parody of Sarah Catherine Martin's Comic Adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog.i.e. S.C. Martin, The Comic Adventures of Old Mrs Hubbard and her Dog (John Harris, London 1806). There appears to be little evidence for a romantic connection between Pigot and Byron but she did keep locks of his hair. It was reported in the first issue of the Dictionary of National Biography that Pigot's engagement was broken off as a result of writing letters both to her fianc√© and to Byron, and then placing the letters in the wrong envelopes. However this story is not included in the latest version. Pigot also created a painting of Byron's eye which has led some to speculate that Pigot's feelings may not have been entirely platonic.Annette Peach, ‚ÄòPigot, Elizabeth Bridget (1783‚Äì1866)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 Sept 2011 She was upset when Byron's former mistress visited from Italy and failed to call upon her. Pigot documented Byron's life, and six years later the Contessa Guiccioli sent her a lock of her hair, which Pigot placed with a similar cutting from Byron. In 1828 she was \\"discovered\\" by the first of Byron's biographers, Thomas Moore. Pigot was able to supply him with a great deal of information. Pigot started a correspondence with John Murray (of the publishing family) who was involved with Byron's publishings and his biography. It was Moore and the publisher John Murray who burnt Byron's papers to prevent further scandal. She eventually received engravings from his son, also John Murray, in thanks for her assistance.

In 1916 he drew a celebrity comic based on vaudeville comedian Little Tich. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/akerbladh_alex.htmHe went on to draw for many titles from then until the late 1930s, including Comic Cuts, Firefly, Jester, Kinema Comic, Sports Fun, Butterfly, Larks, Merry and Bright, Jingles and Crackers, including painting covers for Crackers annuals. From the late 1930s to the early 1950s his work appeared primarily in Radio Fun, where he drew \\"Flanagan and Allen\\", \\"Bob Hope and Jerry Colonna\\", and \\"Arthur Askey and Anthea\\". His last known work was for TV Fun in 1953. A freelancer, he worked from home, and his pages are said to have arrived at the AP \\"in grubby condition, with no trouble taken to erase pencil marks or spilled ink\\".

The flooding had its beginnings in heavy rain in March 1900Western Australian Rainfall in March 1900 over a very broad area extending from North West Cape to the southeastern corner of the state. It was in the middle of April over the Easter long weekend, however, that flooding began in earnest, and at the end of the month the majority of the normally arid parts of the state were completely inundated: by Easter Monday, all houses in Roebourne were completely surrounded by water from the Harding River.The West Australian, April 16, 1900 During April and May, the rain was associated with what was described in the press of the time as \\"a gentle easterly flow\\"West Australian, 23 April 1900' page 5 but today is recognised to be a northwest cloudband. There were several of these cloudbands during the month, and the result was some astonishing rainfall totals, for instance Wiluna received and Cossack (near Port Hedland) as much as . The heaviest rainfall of all occurred in the Pilbara during the middle of the month,Daily rainfall for Cossack in 1900 and resulted in rivers such as the Gascoyne, Ashburton and Murchison overflowing their banks for extraordinarily sustained periods. (Unfortunately, there were no gauges at the time so we do not know what the exact heights were). So heavy indeed was the rainfall that the normally arid \\"North West\\" (as the region was known at the time) was completely boggy and the primitive horse-drawn carts could not traverse the country not only in April, but well into May, especially as another major rainband affected the State early that month, with Onslow recording as much as in a day on the third. The busy Easter mail services were most severely hit of all, with the mail vans from Perth bogged down at Peak Hill after crossing a Gascoyne River that was supposedly wide as the rain extended at the end of Easter to the Murchison River‚Äôs basin.West Australian, April 18, 1900; page 4 Wash-outs on the telegraph line with which the remote regions affected by the floods communicated with Perth were indeed not repaired until well into June, a month after flooding peaked in the Pilbara and Gascoyne and had spread eastward to the goldfields of Western Australia. In the interim, communication about the flooding was delayed almost uniformly by at least three or four days, aided by a severe famine and shortage of food for pack horses and salt lakes in the Goldfields such as Lake Carnegie and Lake Maitland filled for probably the only time in centuries - they were never seen with any water between the first European settlement of Western Australia and these floods were thus unprecedented for an extremely long period of time.

Yrpri.org. Retrieved 12 November 2011. Open Active Democracy The Citizens Foundation develops software called Open Active Democracy (OAD). The basic premise behind OAD is to bridge the gap between those who rule and those who are ruled, i.e. to allow the rulers to call out to the public for the priorities, arguments for and against those priorities as well as general opinions on the issues at hand. This also works in reverse; it gives its users the power to show the rulers what their priorities are. In order to do this, the system has the priorities as its core function. Any user can add a new priority where users can support or oppose them, add their points for and against them and also rate the points‚Äô usefulness. The outcome of this is a prioritised list of issues/ideas/proposals/priorities, both for each person and collectively. OAD was designed to aggregate the priorities with the widest support as well as the best points for and against those priorities. It uses crowdsourcing to achieve these objectives, allowing its users to submit their own priorities as well as supporting or opposing other users‚Äô priorities and marking points as useful or not. In order to encourage users to participate, a Social point system is used in which users get Social points when other users find their input useful and also if those the user invited accept the invitation. Those who accept your invitation automatically follow you and you them. Users can also manually decide to follow other users although this avenue has yet to be explored fully by the developers. Users can add comments to any priority, points and also to other users‚Äô personal spaces. The point system is engineered to prevent arguments which make users gather their thoughts in order to make their point come through. There is a strict length limit on points in order to enable other users to quickly scan through the best points although it is possible to add links to further information. Points for and against are in their own respective columns which has the effect of stifling the classic comment arguments of Yes/No/Yes/No so common in standard website comment areas. Those futile Yes/No arguments function more like a real-life heated argument whereas the point system in OAD steers the user towards convincing other users that their own point is valid and should influence the decision. This also has the effect of users watching their language and thinking carefully on how to best make their point come across in as few words as possible. Most of this is unconscious on the part of the users and has been proven to work very well. The system is mostly self-governing as users report abusive behaviour from other users but so far there has been little need for that as the design of the system discourages such behaviour, with very few cases of abusive behaviour having been reported.

Reception The film received poor reviews and unenthusiastic public reception. Australasian Picture Productions Scandal Dope was the only film from Australasian Picture Productions, which is not to be confused with Australasian Films. The company was registered on 1 February 1923 in Queensland by promoters Stephen Perry and Percy McMahon. Under the terms of the corporation, Perry and McMahon were to receive ¬£1,000 in part payment for their services, plus ¬£1,560 annually for seven years and 6,000 fully paid-up shares. By 30 June 1924 the company's profit and loss statement showed director's salaries of ¬£1,705, office salaries of ¬£154 and general expenses of ¬£230. In December of the year the company went into liquidation owing ¬£2,974. \\"The investigations satisfy me, that the company was a swindle\\", said Justice McNaughten in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. \\"An investigation is necessary...There was a gross fraud on the part of one of the promoters. All they did was to produce one abortive film. There is no doubt that this is a case for the most searching investigation.\\" The petition to wind up the company was made by James Duhig, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. Litigation concerning the company was still going on in 1928.

When he died in 1596, the Grubenhagen branch of the Welfs became extinct, whereafter the principality was occupied by Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. Life Philip II was one of the many children of his father Duke Philip I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his wife Catherine of Mansfeld (1501‚Äì1535). Philip II was the youngest of nine siblings, six of whom reached adulthood. After Duke Philip I's death in 1551, he was first succeeded in government by his eldest son Ernest III. After Ernest's death in 1567, his brother Wolfgang succeeded. When he too died without male descendants in 1595, Philip II succeeded. Merian, 1654 Duke Philip II was married to his cousin Clara of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (1532‚Äì1595), designated Abbess of Gandersheim, who had renounced her ecclesiastical office after the abbey had been occupied by Schmalkaldic troops in the course of the Protestant Reformation and plundered afterwards. The couple took residence at the secularised monastery of Katlenburg, which Philip II had rebuilt in a Renaissance style. In 1595 Duke Philipp II moved his residence from Katlenburg to Herzberg Castle. He reigned less than one year. When he died without a male heir in 1596, the Grubenhagen side-line of the Welfs died out and the Principality of Grubenhagen was annexed by his cousin Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. However, the L√ºneburg branch of the Welf dynasty objected to the annexation and took the matter to the Reichskammergericht.

Founded in 2010, it is one of two Jewish congregations in York County, South Carolina, and one of eleven synagogues in the Charlotte metropolitan area. History The history of Jews in York County dates back to as early as the 1860s, when Arnold Friedheim, a German Jewish immigrant settled in Rock Hill, SC. After the Civil War, he was joined by his brothers Julius and August. Together they opened A. Friedheim and Brothers, which would eventually become Rock Hill's largest department store. Jewish families, however, did not immigrate in significant numbers until the early 1900s, mostly Eastern European Jews from Poland and Russia who were merchants. The first Jewish congregation created in York County was Beth Shalom Congregation, begun in 1922 by eight Jewish families in Rock Hill. Meeting in homes and eventually a storefront, by 1933 the congregation constructed its first building on Main Street in Rock Hill. The congregation never had a full-time rabbi, but itinerant rabbis and cantors who would lead High Holy Days services. Cantor George Ackerman served the congregation for many years until it closed in 1953 due to lack of membership. Its Torah scrolls and Judaica were subsequently donated to Beth Israel synagogue in Whiteville, NC. For the next fifty years, no formal Jewish congregation existed in York County. The few Jewish families that resided in the area attended services either in nearby Charlotte or Gastonia, both in North Carolina. However, as Charlotte became a financial center with Bank of America establishing its national headquarters in the city, and with the influx of retired northeastern Jews, the Jewish population of Charlotte and the surrounding areas (including York County) began to prosper and grow. In the spring of 2010, two men, rabbinical student Jonathan Cohen and Jonathan Shaw, discussed the idea of creating a Jewish congregation in York County. Initially, conceived as a minyan, the rapid response and number of Jewish families necessitated establishing a formal congregation. Shaw was elected the first President and Cohen assumed the role of spiritual leader. On June 4, 2010, more than 170 people gathered for the first service of the new \\"Temple Kol Ami.\\" Meeting in various locations, the synagogue eventually found a home at St. Phillipe Neri Catholic Church in Fort Mill. Meeting there until June 2011, the synagogue has since relocated to the Historic Sanctuary of Unity Presbyterian Church also in Fort Mill. Today Today, the congregation has more than 70 member families with a part-time rabbi and a Religious School. Shabbat services are held every first and third Shabbat. In September 2011, a Torah scroll was donated to the congregation by Temple Beth Israel (Niagara Falls, New York) after it announced it was disbanding in 2012.

Reston virus causes Ebola virus disease in non-human primates; unlike the other five ebolaviruses, it is not known to cause disease in humans, but has caused asymptomatic infections. Reston virus was first described in 1990 as a new \\"strain\\" of Ebola virus (EBOV). It is the single member of the species Reston ebolavirus, which is included into the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. Reston virus is named after Reston, Virginia, US, where the virus was first discovered. RESTV was discovered in crab-eating macaques from Hazleton Laboratories (now Covance) in 1989. This attracted significant media attention due to the proximity of Reston to the Washington, DC, metro area and the lethality of a closely related Ebola virus. Despite its status as a level-4 organism, Reston virus is non-pathogenic to humans, though hazardous to monkeys; the perception of its lethality was compounded by the monkey's coinfection with Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Despite ongoing research, the determinants for lack of human pathogenicity are yet to be discovered. Nomenclature Reston virus was first introduced as a new \\"strain\\" of Ebola virus in 1990. In 2000, it received the designation Reston Ebola virus and in 2002, the name was changed to Reston ebolavirus. Previous abbreviations for the virus were EBOV-R (for Ebola virus Reston) and most recently REBOV (for Reston Ebola virus or Reston ebolavirus). The virus received its current designation in 2010, when it was renamed Reston virus (RESTV). A virus of the species Reston ebolavirus is a Reston virus (RESTV) if it has the properties of Reston ebolaviruses and if its genome diverges from that of the prototype Reston virus. For example, there exists Reston virus variant Pennsylvania (RESTV/Pen), differing by less than 10% at the nucleotide level. History =Discovery= While investigating an outbreak of Simian hemorrhagic fever (SHFV) in November 1989, an electron microscopist from USAMRIID named Thomas W. Geisbert discovered filoviruses similar in appearance to Ebola virus in tissue samples taken from a crab-eating macaque imported from the Philippines to Hazleton Laboratories in Reston, Virginia. The filovirus was further isolated by Dr. Peter Jahrling, and over the period of three months over a third of the monkeys died‚Äîat a rate of two or three a day. Blood samples were taken from 178 animal handlers during the incident. Of them, six eventually seroconverted, testing positive using ELISA. They remained, however, asymptomatic. In January 1990, an animal handler at Hazelton cut himself while performing a necropsy on the liver of an infected Cynomolgus. Under the direction of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the animal handler was placed under surveillance for the duration of the incubation period. When the animal handler failed to become ill, it was concluded that the virus had a low pathogenicity in humans. =Investigation= Crab-eating macaques, imported from the Philippines, were found to be carrying the filovirus. Following the discovery of a filovirus in crab-eating macaques, an investigation tracing the infection was conducted by the CDC. The monkeys were imported from the Philippines, which had no previous record of SHFV or ebolavirus infections. It was suspected that the monkeys contracted both diseases while in transit aboard KLM airlines before reaching Reston. Shipments were tracked to New York City, Texas, and Mexico City, none of which produced cases of infection. By January 1990, Hazelton Laboratories recovered from its previous losses and began importing monkeys again from the same establishment in Manila that had provided the original animals. The imported monkeys became infected and were euthanized. In early February the CDC received reports of the disease in Alice, Texas. In March the Division of Quarantine at the CDC secured a temporary ban on the importation of monkeys into the United States from anywhere in the world. Following the announcement of the filovirus disease outbreak in Reston, Virginia, a serosurvey was conducted to assess the prevalence of the infection. Of the several hundred serums received by the CDC, approximately ten percent showed some reaction to ebolavirus antigen‚Äîthough usually at low levels. Counterintuitively, the majority of the monkeys found positive were from Indonesia. In May 1990, an investigation led by Susan Fisher-Hoch, Steve Ostroff, and Jerry Jennings was sent to Indonesia. During the investigation, it was hypothesized that there could be a cross infection since monkeys suspected of illness were typically placed in gang cages containing up to twenty to thirty other monkeys suspected of illness. Upon arrival they were told that most of the monkeys were imported from the island of Sumatra. The investigation team found no trace of the virus in either case. Following the investigation in Indonesia, an experiment was conducted in the level-4 lab at the CDC campus in DeKalb County, Georgia with thirty-two monkeys: sixteen green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and sixteen crab-eating macaques. Half of the sixteen green monkeys and crab-eating macaques were infected with Reston virus and the other half with Ebola virus. Ebola virus infection was lethal to nearly all monkeys. However, most of the monkeys infected with Reston virus recovered in a month. The surviving monkeys were kept for two years to detect any trace of the virus - none was found. However, the monkeys continued to possess a high level of antibody. =Post- Reston= Following the test at the CDC campus in DeKalb County, two of the monkeys who had survived Reston virus infection were infected with a very large dose of the Ebola virus in an effort to produce an Ebola vaccine. One of the two monkeys remained resistant; the second died.

The CDC and the World Health Organization are investigating. On 23 January 2009, Philippine health officials announced that a hog farm worker had been infected with the virus. Although the man was asymptomatic and the source of the infection is uncertain, this could represent the first case of pig-to-human transmission of Reston virus - a fact that could cause concern, as pigs may be able to transmit more deadly diseases to humans. The situation was investigated. Eventually six workers were found to test sero-positive for antibodies to Reston ebolavirus. None developed any noticeable symptoms of illness. * 2015 Manila, Philippines -- On 6 September the department of health reported an outbreak of the Reston Ebola virus in a research breeding facility under primates.

It was formerly conspecific with the common emerald dove.  Description  This is a common species in rainforest and similar dense wet woodlands, farms, gardens, mangroves and coastal heaths. It builds a scant stick nest in a tree up to five metres and lays two cream-coloured eggs. Breeding tends to occur in Australia spring or early summer in southeastern Australia and late in the dry season in northern Australia. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It often flies low between the patches of dense forest it prefers, but when disturbed will frequently walk away rather than fly. They are particularly good weavers when flying through forests. When flying they expose a buff underwing and a chestnut colour of their flight feathers. The Pacific emerald dove is a stocky, medium-sized pigeon, typically in length. The back and wings are bright emerald green. The flight feathers and tail are blackish, and broad black and white bars show on the lower back in flight. The head and underparts are dark vinous pink fading to greyish on the lower belly. The eyes are dark brown, the bill bright red and legs and feet rufous. Male at Kuranda Birdworld at Atherton Tableland, Queensland, Australia The male has a white patch on the edge of the shoulders and a grey crown, which the female lacks. Females will tend to have a browner complexion with a grey mark on the shoulder. Immature birds resemble females but have brown scallops on their body and wing plumage. Pacific emerald doves usually occur singly, pairs or in small groups. They are quite terrestrial, often searching for fallen fruit on the ground and spending little time in trees except when roosting. They eat seeds and fruits of a wide variety of plants and are generally tame and approachable. The call is a low soft moaning cooing consisting of about six to seven coos starting quietly and rising. They also call a nasal \\"hoo-hoo-hoon\\". Males perform a bobbing dance during courtship.  Subspecies  The Pacific emerald dove has four sub-species: * C. l. timorensis Bonaparte, 1856 \\\\- eastern Lesser Sundas * C. l. longirostris Gould, 1848 \\\\- northern Australia * C. l. rogersi Mathews, 1912 \\\\- eastern Australia, Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, New Guinea * C. l. sandwichensis Ramsay, 1878 \\\\- Santa Cruz and Banks Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia A former subspecies, C. l. chrysochlora, has been discontinued and forms re-allocated to C. l. rogersi and C. l. timorensis.'''

It was the first of three films (to date) on this story, and is considered a lost film. Plot John Lee returns home to Babbacombe after a number of years service in the navy. He becomes engaged to his childhood sweetheart Kate Merton but his rival, Fred Masterville, tries to frame him by depositing twenty pounds in his bed. However he is stopped when Lee's friend Dicky Dood sees this and takes the money for his own use. Masterville breaks into Miss Cleveden's house with an accomplice, Jim Wells, intending to commit robbery. He is spotted by Miss Cleveden and kills her, putting the bloodstained knife in Lee's room. Wells accidentally sets fire to the room. Lee is arrested, tried, found guilty and sentenced to death. Three times he is taken to the scaffold but three times it fails. Lee is given a life sentence. Masterville presses his claim but Kate remains true. Twenty two years later Masterville and Wells are caught attempting to rob Kate's house. Wells turns in Masterville, Lee is released and marries his old sweetheart. Film Cast *Mr Barrington as John Lee *Edna Phillips as his sweetheart *Bobby Scott *Bob Henry *Fred Cope Production The film was based on a popular four-act play, which was adapted from Lee's true life story. Rights for perform the play in Australia were obtained by Philip Lytton. At one stage Lytton wanted to bring Lee to Australia on a lecture tour but Lee was too ill. Reception After the film was completed, producer Phillip Lytton was unenthusiastic about the film's commercial prospects and passed it on to an employee, Arthur W. Sterry, in 1917.Robert Sterry, 'Arthur Sterry' Sterry Worldwide Sterry and his partner, Frederick Haldane, distributed the film themselves throughout Australia, New Zealand and England, often giving a lecture to accompany screenings. It was estimated the film earned ¬£50,000 before 1921 when Sterry and Haldane remade the movie. This means it could arguably be one of the most profitable Australian movies of all time.

It dates from the 1720s is listed as Grade II* and is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. There was a watermill on the site at the time of the Domesday Book and it is the last surviving of over 30 mills which were once on this stretch of the Avon.Saltford Brassmill Project, website accessed 21 September 2011 Local brass making was initiated in Bristol around 1700 by the family of Abraham Darby who later moved upstream because of the better water supply at Saltford and Keynsham. The brass was made from Cornish ores refined at Crew's Hole and then transported via the river. These were mixed with calamine from the Mendip Hills to make calamine brass. This changed as processes improved and local copper smelting was replaced by supplies from Swansea. By the 1850s zinc metal was used instead of calamine, using a process introduced by William Champion, who lived nearby. The Annealing furnace The site includes a battery mill which was used for hollowing out brass sheet to make pans, bowls and vats, some of which are on display. There is also a complete annealing furnace, one of four originally installed, which were used to heat the brass to reduce the likelihood of it cracking while it was being worked. The furnace is claimed to be one of the best remaining examples of this technology. There are also the remains of the water wheels initially used to power the machinery, one of which is still in working order. The battery mills were supplemented by rolling mills between 1760 and 1830, as this produced more even sheets of metal than the original battery techniques. However battery ware was still produced at the site until 1908, the last mill in Britain to do so. The mill ceased production in 1924. In 1995 it was restored and is now supported by a group of volunteers in conjunction with English Heritage and the owners Bath and North East Somerset Council.

He was a student of Alfred Giard at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and a classmate of Maurice Caullery. From 1892 he worked at the Pasteur Institute, initially as an associate demonstrator. He was an assistant of Louis Pasteur, and in the meantime, performed studies on cellular immunity, physiology and comparative pathology in the laboratory of Ilya Ilyich Metchnikov (1845‚Äì1916). He founded the Pasteur Institute Bulletin with Gabriel Bertrand (1867‚Äì1962), Alexandre Besredka (1870‚Äì1940), Am√©d√©e Borrel (1867‚Äì1936), Camille Delezenne (1868‚Äì1932) and Auguste-Charles Marie (1864‚Äì1935). As a member of the French Commission on sleeping sickness, he worked for the organisation of the mission in French Equatorial Africa. He also worked for the creation of the Soci√©t√© de pathologie exotique, for which he became secretary, then president. In 1903, together with Alphonse Laveran (1845‚Äì1922), he showed that the parasite responsible for the visceral leishmaniasis (or \\"Kala-azar\\", a fever in India), first described by William Boog Leishman (1865‚Äì1926), is a new protozoa, different from Trypanosoma, the agent of the sleeping sickness, and from Plasmodium, the agent of paludism (malaria). He temporarily named it Piroplasma donovani and Sir Ronald Ross (1857‚Äì1932) proposed the genus name Leishmania for it.

In particular, Amisi appears to have protected and profited from the operations of Colonel Samy Matumo, the former commander of the 85th Brigade that occupied the Bisie mine for several years. The report, written for the U.N. by the specialist Group of Experts on the DRC, said that Amisi oversaw a network providing arms and ammunition to criminal groups and rebels who roam the hills and forests of Congo's resource- rich but troubled east. According to the report, ammunition bought in neighboring Congo Brazzaville, is smuggled through the Congolese capital Kinshasa to the east by a close network of Amisi's associates, including members of his family. On 22 November 2012, Amisi was suspended from his position in the Forces Terrestres by president Joseph Kabila due to his alleged role in the arms sales to rebel groups in the eastern part of the country, which may have implicated the rebel group M23. Sanctions announced by the United States on 28 September 2016 because units under his command \\"reportedly have engaged in violent repression of political demonstrations‚Äù, including January 2015 protests in which at least 42 people died, barred U.S. citizens from financial transactions with him.

From 1973 to 1983, Andujar represented District 12 in Fort Worth, the seat of Tarrant County in North Texas. In 1972 she was the first Republican elected from Tarrant County to the state legislature since the Reconstruction era. Background The rise of the Republican Party since the late 20th century was the result of two forces: the civil rights movement having gained passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to enforce constitutional rights of minority voters and resulted in black voters registering to vote in considerable number, and the shift of white conservative voters into the Republican Party after decades of affiliation with the Democratic Party. At the turn of the century, the white Democrat-dominated legislature had disenfranchised most African Americans and Latinos.\\"Nixon v. Condon. Disfranchisement of the Negro in Texas\\", The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 41, No. 8, June 1932, p. 1212, accessed March 21, 2008Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting, accessed April 11, 2008 This disenfranchisement of major supporters weakened the Republican Party for decades; and the Democratic Party dominated. Since the late 20th century, the Republican Party has revived in Texas. It has a majority of white conservative members. Early years Elizabeth Richards was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital. Her parents were Katharine L. (Beetem) and Karl E.

He became District Attorney in 1932 with service until 1937, when he was elected as Dauphin County's first Orphan's Court judge. He served as judge of this court until 1961.Dauphin County District Attorney's Office, Pennsylvania, accessed 5 May 2016 (According to information supplied by Andujar's family to the Texas State Cemetery, her father had served as the state's chief justice.)) Elizabeth Richards attended local schools and received a bachelor's degree from Wilson College, a Presbyterian women's institution in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, just north of the Maryland state line. Marriage and family In 1935, Richards married John Jos√© Andujar (January 26, 1912 ‚Äì 2003), a young physician. Born in Chicago to an American mother and Spanish father, he had lived for years with his family in Puerto Rico. His mother, Lily Esther Kurzenknabe, was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to German-American parents. His father, Manuel Andujar y Agrelo, was born in Galicia, Spain. (One record of John's birth lists him as Canadian;\\"John Andujar\\", Cook County, Illinois, Birth Certificates Index, 1871-1922, at Ancestry.com, accessed 5 May 2016 perhaps his father had first gained citizenship there.) John Andujar was a United States citizen by virtue of birth and his mother's nationality. John was the third of four children. His father was a minister.

In 1969 he received the Gold-Headed Cane Award from the Tarrant County Medical Society.\\"Gold-Headed Cane History\\", Tarrant County Medical Society website, 2015; accessed 5 May 2016 Civic life Betty Andujar became active in the auxiliaries of the Texas state and Tarrant County medical associations. She later served on the boards of the Medical College of Pennsylvania and the Texas Rape Prevention and Control Project. She was active in the Association for the Prevention of Blindness and the American Cancer Society. Political career When Andujar decided to get more involved in politics, she joined the Republican Party. It was rebuilding in Texas after having been hollowed out in the first half of the 20th century following state disenfranchisement of minorities; newly enfranchised freedmen had been strong supporters of the party across the South before they were excluded from politics by state barriers to voter registration. African Americans, who comprised the majority of the Republican Party in Texas in the 19th century, and many Hispanics were disenfranchised by laws passed by the white-Democratic dominated state legislature at the turn of the 20th century, which required payment of poll taxes and established white primaries that excluded minorities. Andujar was elected in 1972 as the first Republican to represent Tarrant County in the state legislature since Reconstruction. Andujar's election was a sign of the changing demographics of the Republican Party as it was appealing to white conservatives in Texas and across the South in the middle to late 20th century. Andujar was a delegate to both the 1972 and 1976 Republican National Conventions in Miami Beach, and Kansas City, Missouri, respectively. In the latter, she was part of the 100-member delegation from Texas, all of whom were committed to the challenge for the nomination waged by Governor Ronald W. Reagan to sitting U.S. President Gerald R. Ford Jr. It was unsuccessful, but Reagan later gained the Republican nomination and presidency. Andujar was an early Reagan backer, in contrast to U.S. Senator John G. Tower, who led the Ford forces in the state. The Texas campaign for Reagan in the primary was led by co-chairmen Ernest Angelo of Midland, Ray Barnhart of Pasadena, and Barbara Staff of Dallas.Billy Hathorn, \\"Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96-0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976,\\" West Texas Historical Association Yearbook, Vol. 86 (2010), pp. 77-89 In 1976, Andujar was elected as a Texas Republican national committeewoman, serving as a member of the Republican National Convention through 1982. In 1977, during the 65th legislative session, Andujar was among four senators chosen to serve as the President Pro Tempore, the first Republican so honored by the chamber. The designation made her \\"acting governor\\" whenever both Governor Dolph Briscoe and Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby were out of state. In the 1979 session, Texas Monthly magazine ranked Andujar as among the \\"Ten Worst Legislators.\\" Although a conservative, Andujar in 1973 introduced a bill to remove prison terms for conviction of the possession of marijuana, claiming that it should be treated as a substance comparable to alcohol and regulated. The bill did not pass but she was ahead of her time: in the 21st century, this has become an increasingly popular view among law enforcement, physicians, and many citizens. Some states have legalized marijuana use for medical use, while others have also legalized it for recreational use regulated as if it were alcohol. Andujar worked in the legislature to have the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine incorporated into the University of North Texas Health Science Center. She introduced legislation requiring county coroners to be qualified pathologists. In keeping with her civic work on treatment for blindness, she sponsored bills to allow physicians in Texas to remove corneas from deceased persons to transplant to new patients for sight restoration. She also supported bills to assist women in the collection of child support. Because of health issues, Andujar did not run for re-election in 1982. That year her husband Dr. John (Andy) Andujar ran for her seat in the State Senate. Texas Democrats swept all statewide offices that year, and John Andujar was defeated by Hugh Parmer, well known as the former mayor of Fort Worth. He held the seat until 1991. Legacy and honors Grave at Texas State Cemetery *Andujar was listed in Who's Who in American Politics. *In 1972 she was among those receiving the title \\"Female Newsmaker of the Year\\". *Andujar was the first layperson to receive the Citation of Merit Award from the Texas Society of Pathologists for her legislation requiring that county coroners be qualified pathologists. *In 1988, the Andujars established the first permanent chair of pathology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Death Betty Andujar died on June 8, 1997 and was survived by her husband. As a state senator, she was interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. The widower later married Mary Parker.

CHILD opposes religious exemptions from child health and safety laws. These exemptions have been used as a defense in criminal cases when parents have withheld lifesaving medical care on religious grounds. These exemptions also have discouraged reporting and investigation of religion-based medical neglect of children and spawned many outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths. CHILD publicizes the ideological abuse and neglect of children, lobbies for equal protection laws for children, and files lawsuits and amicus curiae briefs in related cases. CHILD was founded in 1983 by Rita and Douglas Swan after the death of their son, Matthew. When Matthew developed a high fever in 1977, several Christian Science practitioners, who claimed they were healing Matthew, persuaded the Swans not to seek medical treatment for him. After he had been ill for 12 days, the Swans did take Matthew to the hospital, but his illness had progressed too far and he died of meningitis. According to the National Association of Counsel for Children, which gave an award to Rita Swan for her efforts, \\"Due in large part to CHILD's efforts, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Dakota, Hawaii, and Oregon have removed laws which provided exemptions from prosecution to parents who fail to provide medical care for their sick children based on religion\\". History Rita and Douglas Swan founded CHILD as a legacy to their son, Matthew. In 1977 he became ill with bacterial meningitis. The Swans, Christian Scientists at the time, were persuaded by Christian Scientist practitioners ‚Äì the religion's name for its spiritual healers ‚Äì not to seek medical treatment for their son. When one of the practitioners said Matthew might have a broken bone, which Christian Scientists are allowed to go to a doctor for, the Swans took their baby to a hospital after he had been ill for 12 days, but his illness had progressed too far, and he died.Fraser, 1999, pp. 278‚Äì291. Motivated by this tragedy, CHILD works to eliminate religious exemptions in child health and safety laws. Parents belonging to various religions, in particular Christian Science, have used these exemptions as legal defenses in criminal cases for failing to provide medical care for children who then died. Following the death of their son, the Swans left the Christian Science Church, and in 1983, Rita Swan founded the nonprofit organization, Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty (CHILD), and has worked \\"relentlessly\\" to publicize cases of religion-related child abuse and neglect. In 1998, Rita Swan and Seth Asser published a benchmark study in Pediatrics that analyzed 140 child deaths in which medical treatment was withheld. This study showed that 90% of these children would have survived with routine medical care. In 1996 Congress added to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act a provision that nothing in the act can \\"be construed as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide any medical service or treatment that is against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian\\".Title 42-The Public Health And Welfare, Chapter 67-Child Abuse Prevention And Treatment And Adoption Reform, Subchapter I-General Program, Sec. 5106i-Rule Of Construction CHILD has opposed this provision on several fronts. CHILD's work has led to the repeal of some or all religious exemptions to child neglect laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Dakota, Hawaii, Oregon, Minnesota, Ohio, and Rhode Island. In 2009, CHILD lobbied successfully to remove provisions from the federal Affordable Care Act that would have provided government funding and mandated insurance coverage for faith healing that did not also include medical care.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Mission and activities CHILD'S mission is to end child abuse and religious-based medical neglect, cultural practices, or pseudoscience through public education, research, and a limited amount of lobbying to support laws that protect children against maltreatment. The organization also files lawsuits and amicus curiae briefs in related court cases. CHILD supports: *Laws requiring medical care of children, including preventive and diagnostic measures, without exception for religious belief *Reporting of child abuse and child neglect without religious exemption *Licensing of child care facility, including those run by churches *Ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child =Legal actions= The Swans filed a wrongful death suit against the Christian Science Church in 1980, but it was dismissed on First Amendment grounds, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear their case on appeal.

He was named after his maternal grandfather, and was to first Wolrad in the House of Waldeck. He succeeded his father as the reigning Count of Waldeck-Waldeck in 1442 ‚Äì whether this was before or after his father's death is still unclear. The House Waldeck had been split since 1397 into the senior Waldeck-Landau line and the junior Waldeck-Waldeck line.  Life  Before he took office in Waldeck, Wolrad was appointed by Archbishop Conrad III of Mainz as magistrate and bailiff of the towns and castles of Am√∂neburg, Battenberg, Neustadt, Rosenthal, Hausen in Kn√ºllwald, Fritzlar, Jesberg, Hofgeismar, Naumburg, Wetter and Rhoden near Diemelstadt, plus the associated villages and bailiwicks, in Electoral Mainz. In 1438, Count John II of Ziegenhain succeeded him on this post. John II was in turn succeeded in 1439 by Landgrave Louis I of Hesse. Wolrad died in 1475 and was succeeded by his son Philip I. When Philip I died later that year, his younger brother Philip II became regent for Philip I's minor son Henry VIII. In 1486, Henry VIII and Philip II decided to split the county: Henry VIII received Waldeck-Wildungen, the southern part, and Philip II received the northern part, Waldeck-Eisenberg.  Marriage and issue  In March 1440 Wolrad married Barbara of Wertheim, a daughter of Count Michael I of Wertheim and Sophie von Henneberg. Wolrad and Barbara joined the Kalands Brethren in Korbach. They had three children: * Philip I (1445‚Äì1475), Count of Waldeck-Waldeck * Philip II (born: 3 March 1453; died: 26 October 1524), canon, acted from 1475 as the regent of his nephew, Henry VIII of Waldeck-Waldeck; became Count of Waldeck-Eisenberg in 1486 * Elizabeth (born: c. 1455; died: 15 March 1513), married on 15 October 1471 Duke Albert II of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (1419‚Äì1485) lived and after his death on the Old Castle at Osterode am Harz.

The body was built around a simple tube-based structure, probably inspired by recent developments in airplane construction; there was no separate chassis. The vehicles were produced on a production line at a small factory belonging to Kellner, a coachbuilder previously known for supplying bespoke bodies for chassis of France's luxury car makers. Dauphin versions were made with a petrol engine or an electric engine, with the motor for the petrol version being a two-stroke unit of 100 cc or 175 cc supplied by Zurcher. Petrol for civilian use was becoming unobtainable, and a 2 hp 48-volt electric power unit was substituted. The electric-powered cars were steered from the rear seat, whereas the petrol-engined ones were steered from the front.  Sources and further reading  * G.N. Georgano: Autos.

The uniqueness of the place is Lord Maha Ganapathi is out in the open field without a 'Garbha gudi' and temple structure. It is surrounded by greenery and open round the clock for offering prayers. About 35 km from Kukke Subramanya Temple is 'Southadka Shree Mahaganapathi Kshetra' in the interior of Kokkada. This is about 16 KM from Dharmasthala. The temple is decorated with lot of Bells mainly, offered by worshippers who have special wishes. One can find lot of monkeys inside the temple. The Mahapuja is performed every year in the month of January. The temple also serves food to all the devotees in the form of prasadam. The temple is 6 KM from Patrame on the banks of Netravati River. Belthangady‚Äôs hidden gem, it‚Äôs a unique temple with vast expanses of lush greenery. Sitting cozily in the lap of nature amidst such a tranquil atmosphere is Lord Ganapati. Welcome to Southadka, the abode of Lord Ganapati. Popularly known as Maha Ganapati Kshetra, Southadka in Belthangandy taluk of Dakshina Kannada district is hailed as one of the many siddhi kshetras of the district. Surprisingly, not many from outside the district are aware of the existence of this temple which is located just 20 km away from the pilgrim town of Dharmasthala. Away from the hustle and bustle of the main road, this temple with no formal structure surrounding it, offers a unique experience. A spacious goshala (cow shed), a row of pretty shops vending pooja materials, a small temple office where seva tickets and prasada can be bought and a modest temple kitchen that dishes up tasty naivedya prasada is all that Southadka houses. The idol of Lord Ganesha, installed majestically under the bowers of an ancient tree, is spectacular, to say the least. A shining arch is all that surrounds the beautiful idol in black stone and, of course, huge brass lamps. Right in front of the Lord's idol are rows of brass bells tied to wooden beams for devotees to sound them during the pooja. These bells in various shapes and sizes are a great attraction among children. The Name In Tulu language, SOWTHE means 'cucumber' and ADKA means 'field'. Cowherds in this place were growing cucumber and they offered the same to Lord Ganapathi of this place during their worship. Hence, this place gets the name as Southadka. History According to the sthala purana of Southadka, a Ganapati temple revered by a royal family was once destroyed by enemies. Not to let the enemies destroy the beautiful idol of Ganapati that was at the temple, cow herds of the place carried it along with them and installed it in a place where cucumber was grown in plenty. Since southe means cucumber and adka means meadow in Tulu, the place soon gained popularity as Southadka. The farmers of the place reaped huge harvests of cucumber, offered it to Lord Ganapati and even wished to build a temple there. But, according to a popular belief, Ganapati graced their dreams and asked them not to build a temple for him at Southadka as that would mean restrictions on devotees visiting the place to seek his blessings. The Lord expressed his wish to remain in open air with no formal structure surrounding him so that devotees could access him round-the- clock. Lord Ganapati‚Äôs wish was the farmers‚Äô command and to this day the Lord sits majestically in the lush green surroundings of Southadka, blessing his devotees 24/7. According to temple authorities, of the many sevas offered at the temple, the most popular one is the avalakki panchakajjaya seva (a delicious mixture of beaten rice, jaggery, til (sesame), coconut, honey and banana) performed on a regular basis. The laddu prasada too shouldn‚Äôt be given a miss. One word of caution though: whoever performs the avalakki panchakajjaya seva has to share a fair amount of Lord‚Äôs prasada with the many cows around.

The UK business was acquired by Metro Bank in September 2020. The company is known for having introduced into peer- to-peer lending the concept of a \\"provision fund\\" ‚Äì an internal fund which aims to help lenders manage the risk of borrower default, and is generated by borrowers' payment of a \\"credit rate\\" fee based on their credit profile. Launched in October 2010, by September 2020 the company had matched more than ¬£4bn in loans and had over 750,000 investors and borrowers. RateSetter claims that none of its individual investors have ever lost money.  History  RateSetter's holding company, Retail Money Market Ltd, was incorporated in October 2009 by Rhydian Lewis, an investment banker from Lazard, and Peter Behrens, a lawyer turned banker formerly of Royal Bank of Scotland. The private limited company was funded from the start by angel investors. In July 2014, it was announced that the British Business Bank would begin lending through RateSetter to support individuals, sole traders or partnerships borrowing for business purposes. In December 2015, RateSetter moved from Southwark to new offices in Bishopsgate, London. In June 2017, RateSetter raised ¬£13m from existing shareholders, including Woodford Investment Management and Artemis, bringing the total amount raised to ¬£41.5m. The following month, Paul Manduca became chairman of RateSetter; he is also chairman of Prudential plc. RateSetter's lending had an average gross yield of 8% in 2019‚Äì20. = Sale to Metro Bank = Metro Bank plc, a London-based retail and commercial bank, announced in August 2020 that it had agreed to acquire Retail Money Market Ltd for a price of up to ¬£12 million, with ¬£2.5 million paid upfront and the remainder to be paid over the next three years; the latter component is conditional on meeting certain performance criteria. The announced purchase price marked a sharp decrease in the company's value, which was ¬£200m during its last round of funding in 2017. Metro Bank acquired 100% of RateSetter shares but its stake in RateSetter Australia, valued at ¬£13.7 million, was excluded from the transaction and remains with RateSetter shareholders. The purchase was subject to regulatory and RateSetter shareholder approval, and completed on 14 September 2020. Metro Bank said it intends to continue the RateSetter brand and its operations, with new unsecured personal lending funded by the bank's deposits, not through peer-to- peer.  In Australia  RateSetter Australia commenced operations in November 2014. The Australian business, based in Sydney, is managed and majority-owned locally, and was the first peer-to-peer lending platform in the country open to retail customers. In December 2017, it was announced that over AU$200m had been lent via the platform. By mid-2020, lending had grown to AU$800m and the company was preparing for a stock exchange flotation. In 2019, 14% of the company was owned by Retail Money Market Ltd; this holding was not included in the 2020 acquisition of the UK business by Metro Bank. In August 2020, RateSetter Australia was renamed Plenti ahead of an IPO which took place in September 2020.  Products  Borrowers can apply for a loan for between 6 and 60 months. The company has strict lending criteria, accepting (in 2011) between 12 and 15 per cent of borrower applications.

Released 13 October 2009 by AAO Music, it features rerecordings of songs from Talbot's previous album, Connie Talbot's Christmas Album, as well as new tracks. The album was released after Talbot was named child ambassador for the Toys for Tots Campaign, and some of the proceeds from the album were given to the organisation. The album was marketed with a tour of the United States, a cross-marketing campaign with Boscov's, and a television special produced by WVIA, a DVD of which was later released for sale. Reviews of the album were mixed; while Talbot was called \\"sweet\\" and her range was praised, other reviewers considered the album to be \\"cloying\\" and \\"little more than a novelty act\\". Production In September 2009, it was announced that Talbot had been named child ambassador of the Marine Corps Toys for Tots Campaign, a charitable programme which purchases toys for underprivileged American children. It was announced that, in addition to promoting the drive on adverts and on television, Talbot's forthcoming album, Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic, would be dedicated to the campaign. Further, a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the album were to be donated to the charity. Talbot said that upon being declared ambassador, she was \\"I'm sad and happy‚Äîsad because I'm learning there are so many children who are not as lucky as I am, and I'm happy that I'm able to help them.\\" Vice-president of the Toys for Tots Foundation Bill Grein said: > The Marine Toys for Tots Foundation is extremely proud and excited to have > Connie as our youngest ambassador ever ... She is the perfect person to > inform the public of the millions of less fortunate children who may be > overlooked this Christmas holiday season, unless people step up to donate a > toy or make a cash contribution. Her angelic looks and voice will remind > everyone of the innocence of children ... And they all deserve to experience > the magic of the holiday season! I hope she sells lots of CDs and raises a > lot of money and awareness for our children. The track listing of Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic was compiled by people including Talbot's family and friends, and AAO Music manager Peter Kuys; of the tracks, Talbot said that her favourite was \\"When a Child Is Born\\". Some of the songs had previously appeared on Connie Talbot's Christmas Album, and Talbot's official site describes Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic as \\"re- launched\\". However, Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic also featured three new songs, and the album's vocals were completely rerecorded. Release and promotion Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic was released on 13 October 2009,\\"Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic overview. Allmusic. Accessed 10 September 2011. by the Albany-based record label AAO Music. The release was promoted by a United States tour and a television special. The special, entitled Holiday Magic, was taped from 24‚Äì27 September, and produced by WVIA. Holiday Magic featured performances of all of the songs from Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic, and was available to all PBS stations to be shown in November and December. On the special, Talbot performed with a choir from Scranton High School. A 17-track DVD of the performance, featuring all of the songs from Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic, and two additional songs, \\"What a Wonderful World\\" and \\"Over the Rainbow\\", was produced. In addition, the DVD featured an interview with Talbot and behind the scenes footage. Appearances in the United States included performances at the Colonie Center. In addition, Talbot participated in a cross-marketing campaign with Boscov's; she received signage and merchandising at Boscov's stores, and wore Boscov's clothes. Albert Boscov, of Boscov's, said \\"We're thrilled that Connie‚Äîsuch a talented youngster‚Äîis joining us to bring a little holiday magic to everyone this holiday season.\\" Kuys, of AAO Music, said \\"We have had a long relationship with Boscov's over the last decade. This campaign was personally picked by Mr. Boscov, and we feel that both parties can be perfect for each other while adding great value to Connie's Toys for Tots campaign.\\" Reception Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic received mixed reviews. Sunny Tse, reviewing the album for the South China Morning Post, said that the album was \\"just right for the kids\\", but added that Talbot's \\"stunning rendition of 'Ave Maria' ... will blow your mind\\". Jonathan Takiff, writing for The Philadelphia Daily News, said that \\"[l]istening to her trill through 'Silent Night,' the calypso-flavored 'Mary's Boy Child' and 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' might inspire your kids.\\" He gave the album a B-. David Burger, writing for The Salt Lake Tribune, gave the album a B, and praised Talbot's range, saying that there were \\"sweet, playful and jazzy arrangements\\". Reviewers also praised the link with the Toys for Tots Foundation, which Tse considered \\"one more reason why you should grab a copy.\\" While Tse described Talbot's voice as \\"sweet\\" and \\"beautiful\\", and Takiff called her \\"a freak of nature, with a grown-up singing voice in the body of a (just-turned) 9-year-old\\", other reviewers were more critical. Jon Bream, of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, called the album \\"more cloying than cute\\", and David Yonke, writing for The Blade, described Talbot's performance as \\"little more than a novelty act because of the overly sappy backdrop\\". Yonke did praise Talbot for her \\"impressive vocal skills\\", but considered her \\"earnestness [as] wasted on arrangements that sound as if they were ripped from a 1930s Shirley Temple songbook\\". Wayne Bledsoe, writing for ScrippsNews, said that Talbot \\"has a great voice for a kid\\", but added that \\"this album wore me out.

Its name means \\"All Saints' braid\\" in English and it consists of flour, eggs, yeast, shortening or butter, raisins, milk, salt, and decorating sugar or poppy seeds. Some regional variations also include rum or lemon juice. The word Strietzel is derived from Middle High German strutzel, str√ºtzel, in turn from Old High German struzzil. Its further origin is unclear.Seebold, Elmar. 1999. Kluge Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache, 23rd edition. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 802. History The first known mention of Striezel in the form of Heiligenstriezel comes from a Nachrichtenbuech (lit. news book) from Saxen in Upper Austria. The early versions of this bread were unbraided and made with a simple dough of wheat with eggs, fat and honey. In later years more complicated braided loaves became customary. In 1840, Der √ñsterreichische Zuschauer described a custom among Viennese to exchange the braided loaves on All Saint's Day. In 1929, the mastery of different types of braiding were added to the Bakers Master Examination Regulations in Upper Austria. Traditions An unglazed Christmas Strietzel with raisins and flaked almonds, sprinkled with icing sugar In Austria and Bavaria it is given to godchildren by their godfathers for All Saints' Day. This tradition has its origin in the ancient funeral cults in which mourning was expressed by a woman's cutting off her braided hair. In the 19th century, it was common to give this rich kind of cake to the poor due to a depiction by the Austrian vernacular writer Peter Rosegger. Especially for children in rural areas, the present meant a compensation for poor food and hungry times throughout the year. Also common (especially in Linz) was the superstition that the luck of the forthcoming year depends on the success of the pastry. If the yeast did not work and the dough did not rise, disaster or death were supposed to follow. Another practice of young men was to mock single women because of their singleness by giving them Striezels made of straw.Fielhauer, Helmut. 1966. \\"Allerheiligenstriezel aus Stroh.\\" Volkskundliche Beitr√§ge 1: 21‚Äì34, p. 21. In Dresden, the cake is now generally called Dresdner [Christ]stollen, Stollen being an unplaited German cake with a similar recipe. However, its name in the city used to be Dresdner Striezel, and from 1434 gave its name to the Dresdner Striezelmarkt (Dresden Striezel Market). A cake of that name is still (2014) baked in Dresden as a Christmas speciality.

The people were also known as the Maligundidj (in in the Wotjobaluk language) which means the people belonging to the mali (mallee) eucalypt bushland which covers much of their territory. Before European settlement in the nineteenth century, the Wergaia peoples occupied the area that included Lake Hindmarsh, Lake Albacutya, Pine Plains Lake, Lake Werringrin, Lake Coorong, Warracknabeal, Beulah, Hopetoun, Dimboola, Ouyen, Yanac, Hattah Lakes and the Wimmera River. Language The Wergaia language was a dialect of Wemba-Wemba, a member of the Kulinic branch of Pama‚ÄìNyungan. Ecology Thomas Mitchell, exploring the territory over which the Wergaia dwelt, wrote in 1836: > Every day we passed over land which for natural fertility and beauty could > scarcely be surpassed; over streams of unfailing abundance and plains > covered with the richest pasturage. Stately trees and majestic mountains > adorned the ever-varying scenery of this region, the most southern of all > Australia and the best. It was he added, a \\"blank sheet\\" for future development. For the natives, it was rich in kumpung, the bulrush whose rhizomes formed the staple of their diet, as well as in lahoor, the yellow water lily, the dandelion yam and trefoil. Rivers were trawled for freshwater mussels and crayfish. Bushland was carefully kept in order by selected firing. George Augustus Robinson, appointed by the Port Phillip Protectorate to be the first Protector of Aborigines noted fine-built thatched huts, raised on stone walls along the waterways, elaborate fishgarths, one, south around Mount Duwil, extending over hectares to form a network interconnecting swamps, floodways and watercourses. Around February and March, a Festival of Laap attracted many tribes to congregate in order to socialize, settle disputes and enjoy a sweet potion, called laap. Laap was harvested over a period of 6 to eight weeks, any area could yield up to 40-50 pounds of the substance a day. It was confected from the sugary excretions of a species of psylla (Psylla eucalypti Dobson) deposited on the leaves of the walkerie mallee gumtree. History and culture The Aboriginal people of this area go back at least 1,600 generations. There is evidence of occupation in Gariwerd going back to 30‚Äì20,000 years ago, predating the end of the last ice age. As the earlier warm, rainy era of the Holocene changed, a slight increase in aridity led to a tenfold increase in habitation, according to the archaeological record dated to around 4000 years BP. =Society= The Maligundidj people were divided into 20 clans each with their particular territory. The first question they would ask an outsider was:ngaia yauarin? (What is your flesh?) meaning what was your place within the system of moieties and totemic skin relations that governed Aboriginal identity. They were a matrilineal society divided into two moieties: gabadj (var.gamutch) (southern black cockatoo) and grugidj (var.krokitch) (white cockatoo), with the moiety to which one belonged called a mir. Intermarriage occurred often with the Jardwadjali and Dja Dja Wurrung clans, and meetings and ceremonies were attended with the Dadidadi, Wadiwadi, and Ladjiladji peoples to their north. =Mythological and empirical thinking= According to information given by the Wudjubalug clan, the dreamtime creator, Bunjil the eaglehawk man, was assisted in fashioning the world by the BramBram Ngul brothers, dwellers in the Naracoorte caves, who moulded men from a tree. One clan of the Wergaia, the Boorong near Lake Tyrrell, had accomplished star-gazers with a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy. When William Edward Stanbridge took up grazing lands in their territory in the mid 19th century, he learned of it from them. Stanbridge described part of their system in a lecture delivered before the Philosophical Institute of Victoria in September 1857. Stanbridge's exposition showed that the Wergaia connected the rising and setting of particular stars with seasonal events and dreamtime mythology. A reanalysis of Stanbridge's material has recently led to the hypothesis that some time after 1837, the Wergaia had registered the massive flaring or 'great eruption' of Œ∑ Carinae, which they identified as Collowgullouric War ‚Äî a female crow and wife of War ‚Äî the crow, Canopus, and had incorporated the event into their ethnoastronomical system. A few examples illustrate the intimate correlation they established between the movements of celestial bodies and the cycles of natural phenomena in their native habitat. The northern rise of Marpeankuurk (Arcturus) signalled that it was time to harvest the larvae of the wood ant, a species of carpenter ant. When Neilloan (Vega) set just after duskfall, it indicated that malleefowl eggs were ready to be collected. The setting of Coonartoorung (the Beehive Cluster) in the constellation of Cancer marked the onset of autumn. One dreamtime story of the Wudjubalug people tells of how Gnowee, the sun, was created by Pupperimbul, one of the Nurrumbunguttia before these ancient spirits disappeared from the heavens before man himself was created, and the earth was in sheer darkness. Pupperimbul hurled an emu egg into the firmament, whereupon it burst and shed light over the sky. The celestial pattern of the near stars reflected kinship patterns: Gnowee's sister was Chargee Gnowee (Venus), the wife of Ginabongbearp (Jupiter). =European contact and history= It is likely that first contact with Europeans was through smallpox epidemics which arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 and rapidly spread through the trading networks of Indigenous Australians and killed many people in two waves before the 1830s. It killed large numbers of people, and disfigured many more with pock-marked faces, and tribal elders said it came down the Murray River sent by malevolent sorcerers to the north. One Wudjubalug account called the disease thinba micka. The explorer Edward John Eyre was possibly the first European (called by the Wergaia ngamadjidj) seen by the Maligundidj when he followed the Wimmera River to Lake Hindmarsh in 1838. His reports of the well-watered mallee country provided encouragement for the subsequent rush of settlers with their cattle and sheep eager to establish pastoral stations. Strong resistance to this influx meant that Europeans could not travel unarmed in Wergaia territory during the first decade of settlement. Horatio Cockburn Ellerman, an early settler who came to run the Antwerp station in 1846, had participated in several raids on Aboriginal camps, and was notoriously hard on the Indigenous people early in his career. He had, according to the testimony of William Taylor, had taken part in a punitive raid in the southern Wimmera. His ruthlessness drew the enmity particularly of the Wudjubalug, who were rumoured to be intent on killing him. Ellerman obtained a warrant in 1844, and, enlisting the assistance of Border Police, tracked down the suspect, shooting him together with another Wudjubalug. He was widely believed to have been involved in the murder of an Aboriginal woman at Banji bunag in 1846, where he had fired at random at a Gur-balug group of Aboriginal people at their camp site on the Wimmera River. Ellerman took her orphaned child in. Ellerman lost track of the boy while he consigned his wool to Melbourne in 1850, and Willie, who was picked up and befriended by schoolboys, was adopted by the Reverend Lloyd Chase and later taken to Britain to be educated as a missionary to his people. While in England, he found the climate and solitude unbearable and, contracting, a lung disease died on 10 March 1852. Just before his death he asked to be baptised in the Christian faith, and was given the baptismal name William Wimmera. A sixteen-page account of his life, A Short memoir of William Wimmera, an Australian Boy, was published which focused on his religious redemption. Dick-a-Dick Dick-a-Dick was a Wudjubalug tracker responsible for finding the three Duff children lost in the Australian bush for 9 days in 1864 which garnered national and even international attention. Dick-a-Dick was one of the Wudjubalug and Jardwadjali men who formed the basis for the Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868. In 1981 or early 1982 the Aboriginal community met in Horsham and applied for registration as the Goolum Goolum Aboriginal Cooperative. According to Clark, Goolum goolum is a Wergaia word meaning 'stranger, especially a dangerous stranger, wild blackfellow. =Ebenezer Mission= Two Moravian missionaries, Friedrich Hagenauer and F.W. Spieseke, who had been active at lake Boga for several years, established the Ebenezer Mission in 1859 in Wergaia country at a site called Banji bunag (variously spelled Bungo budnutt/Punyo Bunnutt), close to where Willie's mother was killed, and a traditional meeting place and corroboree ground. The site was chosen with the assistance of Ellerman. In 1902 the State Government of Victoria decided to close the Ebenezer Mission due to low numbers. The mission closed in 1904, and most of the land reverted to the Victorian Lands Department as crown land, and was opened up for selection. In the following twenty years many Wergaia people were forcibly moved to Lake Tyers Mission in Gippsland under police escort, along with closure of all rations to Ebenezer Mission and seizure of children. Native Title recognition The Indigenous peoples of the Wimmera won native title recognition on 13 December 2005 after a ten-year legal process. It was the first successful native title claim in south-eastern Australia and in Victoria, determined by Justice Ron Merkel involving Wudjubalug, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagalk people. In his reasons for judgement Justice Merkel made special mention of Wudjubalug elder Uncle Jack Kennedy and explained the significance of his orders: > The orders I propose to make are of special significance as they constitute > the first recognition and protection of native title resulting in the > ongoing enjoyment of native title in the State of Victoria and, it would > appear, on the South-Eastern seaboard of Australia. These are areas in which > the Aboriginal peoples suffered severe and extensive dispossession, > degradation and devastation as a consequence of the establishment of British > sovereignty over their lands and waters during the 19th century.

Made from sheep milk, Cherni Vit cheese owes the green colour of its crust and its characteristic taste to the formation of mold. This occurs naturally due to the specific conditions in the region and the technology of production. Produced for centuries, Cherni Vit cheese was nearly extinct in the 2000s until it was rediscovered and popularised by Slow Food representatives. History Cherni Vit cheese has been continuously produced in Cherni Vit, a village at the northern foot of the Balkan Mountains, for several centuries. However, in the past the mold was considered poisonous by the locals, who would often throw mouldy batches of cheese away, considering it an undesired side effect of cheese production. Although it was very popular in the village in the mid-20th century, in the 1970s green cheese quickly began to disappear due to the replacement of the wooden casks required for the molding with plastic cans. By the early 21st century, Cherni Vit green cheese had ceased production and all but disappeared. In 2007, the mayor of Cherni Vit, Tsvetan Dimitrov, was contacted by Italian representatives of the Slow Food movement who enquired about traditional dishes from the village which were in danger of disappearing. Eventually, Dimitrov discovered a single matchbox-sized piece of green cheese that was preserved in the cellar of an elderly couple who lived in the highlands above the village. The Italians were impressed with the green cheese and it was presented at the international festival in Bra to a great reception. According to Slow Food representatives, Cherni Vit cheese is the only traditional mold cheese in the Balkans. As of 2009, Cherni Vit green cheese is not commercially available in Bulgaria or commercially exported from the country. This is due to administrative hindrances which prohibit farms from the direct sale of dairy products unless they are approved by the veterinary services. Description The Cherni Vit cheese variety is made from sheep milk using a basic technology. The specific natural and weather conditions of the Balkan Mountains near the village of Cherni Vit are very important for its production. It is a very soft cheese with a dense, hot taste and a specific, rich aroma. The cheese is silvery white on the inside and covered by a naturally formed green mold crust. Essentially, Cherni Vit cheese is a variety of white brine cheese (sirene) modified by the growth of mold. Cherni Vit green cheese grows in wooden casks, which allow part of the brine to evaporate through the wood, contributing to the formation of a mold crust. Other factors that contribute to the taste of the cheese are the air humidity, the low winter temperatures in Cherni Vit and the significant amplitude between day and night temperature. The cheese also has a protein content that is different from that of cheeses from other Bulgarian regions. Milk from the Karakachan Sheep and the aboriginal Teteven Sheep breeds is used for the preparation of the cheese. The process of producing Cherni Vit cheese begins in the summer (after Saint George's Day), when sheep are taken by shepherds to high mountain pastures. When the sheep are brought back in September or October, the cheese, already placed in wooden casks, is stored in humid cellars in the village, at a temperature of . Mold develops on the surface of the cheese only after the casks are opened.

Based on the operational amplifier (op-amp), it performs the mathematical operation of integration with respect to time; that is, its output voltage is proportional to the input voltage integrated over time. Applications The integrator circuit is mostly used in analog computers, analog-to-digital converters and wave-shaping circuits. A common wave-shaping use is as a charge amplifier and they are usually constructed using an operational amplifier though they can use high gain discrete transistor configurations.  Design  The input current is offset by a negative feedback current flowing in the capacitor, which is generated by an increase in output voltage of the amplifier. The output voltage is therefore dependent on the value of input current it has to offset and the inverse of the value of the feedback capacitor. The greater the capacitor value, the less output voltage has to be generated to produce a particular feedback current flow. The input impedance of the circuit is almost zero because of the Miller effect. Hence all the stray capacitances (the cable capacitance, the amplifier input capacitance, etc.) are virtually grounded and they have no influence on the output signal.Transducers with Charge Output =Ideal circuit= Integrator circuit The circuit operates by passing a current that charges or discharges the capacitor CF during the time under consideration, which strives to retain the virtual ground condition at the input by off-setting the effect of the input current. Referring to the above diagram, if the op-amp is assumed to be ideal, nodes v1 and v2 are held equal (missing label v1 at the + input), and so v2 is a virtual ground. The input voltage passes a current \\\\frac{v_{in}}{R_1} through the resistor producing a compensating current flow through the series capacitor to maintain the virtual ground. This charges or discharges the capacitor over time. Because the resistor and capacitor are connected to a virtual ground, the input current does not vary with capacitor charge and a linear integration of output is achieved. The circuit can be analyzed by applying Kirchhoff's current law at the node v2, keeping ideal op-amp behaviour in mind. :i_{\\\\text{1}} = I_{\\\\text{B}} + i_{\\\\text{F}} I_{\\\\text{B}} = 0 in an ideal op-amp, so: :i_{\\\\text{1}} = i_{\\\\text{F}} Furthermore, the capacitor has a voltage-current relationship governed by the equation: :I_{\\\\text{C}} = C \\\\frac{dV_{\\\\text{c}}}{dt} Substituting the appropriate variables: :\\\\frac{v_{\\\\text{in}} - v_{\\\\text{2}}}{R_{\\\\text{1}}} = C_{\\\\text{F}}\\\\frac{d(v_{\\\\text{2}} - v_{\\\\text{o}})}{dt} v_2 = v_1 = 0 in an ideal op-amp, resulting in: :\\\\frac{v_{\\\\text{in}}}{R_{\\\\text{1}}} = -C_{\\\\text{F}}\\\\frac{dv_{\\\\text{o}}}{dt} Integrating both sides with respect to time: : \\\\int_0^t\\\\frac{v_{\\\\text{in}}}{R_{\\\\text{1}}} \\\\ dt\\\\ = - \\\\int_0^t C_{\\\\text{F}} \\\\frac{dv_{\\\\text{o}}}{dt} \\\\, dt If the initial value of vo is assumed to be 0 V, this results in a DC error of: :v_{\\\\text{o}} = -\\\\frac{1}{R_{\\\\text{1}}C_{\\\\text{F}}}\\\\int_0^t v_{\\\\text{in}}\\\\, dt =Practical circuit= Practical integrator The ideal circuit is not a practical integrator design for a number of reasons. Practical op-amps have a finite open-loop gain, an input offset voltage and input bias currents (I_B). This can cause several issues for the ideal design; most importantly, if v_{\\\\text{in}} = 0, both the output offset voltage and the input bias current I_B can cause current to pass through the capacitor, causing the output voltage to drift over time until the op-amp saturates. Similarly, if v_{\\\\text{in}} were a signal centered about zero volts (i.e. without a DC component), no drift would be expected in an ideal circuit, but may occur in a real circuit. To negate the effect of the input bias current, it is necessary to set: R_{\\\\text{om}}=R_1  R_F  R_L. The error voltage then becomes: :V_\\\\text{E} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{F}}{R_1} + 1 \\\\right) V_{IOS} The input bias current thus causes the same voltage drops at both the positive and negative terminals. Also, in a DC steady state, the capacitor acts as an open circuit. The DC gain of the ideal circuit is therefore infinite (or in practice, the open-loop gain of a non-ideal op-amp). To counter this, a large resistor R_F is inserted in parallel with the feedback capacitor, as shown in the figure above. This limits the DC gain of the circuit to a finite value, and hence changes the output drift into a finite, preferably small, DC error. Referring to the above diagram: :V_\\\\text{E} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{F}}{R_1} + 1 \\\\right) \\\\left( V_{IOS} + I_{BI} \\\\left( R_\\\\text{F} \\\\parallel R_1 \\\\right) \\\\right) where V_{IOS} is the input offset voltage and I_{BI} is the input bias current on the inverting terminal. R_F \\\\parallel R_1 indicates two resistance values in parallel. Frequency response Frequency response of ideal and practical integrator. The frequency responses of the practical and ideal integrator are shown in the above figure. For both circuits, the crossover frequency f_\\\\text{b}, at which the gain is 0 dB, is given by: :f_{\\\\text{b}}=\\\\frac{1}{{2\\\\pi}{R_{\\\\text{1}}}{ C_{\\\\text{F}}}} The 3 dB cutoff frequency f_\\\\text{a} of the practical circuit is given by: :f_{\\\\text{a}}=\\\\frac{1}{{2\\\\pi}{R_{\\\\text{F}}}{ C_{\\\\text{F}}}} The practical integrator circuit is equivalent to an active first-order low-pass filter. The gain is relatively constant up to the cutoff frequency and decreases by 20 dB per decade beyond it. The integration operation occurs for frequencies in the range \\\\left[ f_\\\\text{a}, f_\\\\text{b} \\\\right], provided that f_\\\\text{a} << f_\\\\text{b} (i.e., f_\\\\text{a}*10 < f_\\\\text{b}). This condition can be achieved by appropriate choice of R_\\\\text{F}C_\\\\text{F} and R_1 C_\\\\text{F} time constants.

I have seen some of the former of an hundred marks > value; it was broad as any ordinary pewter plate, the whole curiously > engraven with various animals etc. There was a lesser buckle which was wore > in the middle of the larger, and above two ounces weight; it had in the > centre a large piece of crystal, or some finer stone, and this was set all > around with several finer stones of a lesser size. The plaid being pleated > all round, was tied with a belt below the breast; the belt was of leather, > and several pieces of silver intermixed with the leather like a chain. The > lower end of the belt has a piece of plate about eight inches long, and > three in breadth, curiously engraven; the end of which was adorned with fine > stones, or pieces of red coral.

Engraving by James Basire, 1745 One early (early 19th century) dictionary definition of \\"earasaid\\" describes it, in the past tense, as full-length and worn without underclothing. Martin Martin describes it a full-length and worn over a sleeved top. Later descriptions (notably Burt) use the word \\"plaid\\" to describe, at first, wraps that cover the whole body, and then garments that cover only from head to waist.

Eyelash permanent wave, or more commonly called an eyelash perm, and may also refer to permanent relaxer that straightens the hair is a cosmetics procedure performed only by licensed Cosmetologists to flip up eyelashes using hair perming technology. Context Lashes are treated with a perm solution which is then followed by the neutralizer and sometimes depending on which system you use will have a nourishing oil as the last step to recondition and strengthen the lashes. Each being left on for about ten to fifteen minutes. Traditionally when lash perming was introduced a soft like sponge in the shape of a rod would be placed at the base of the lashes where the lashes would take on its new shape. Although, in recent years people have now started using a silicone pad that is placed on your eyelid. There is small, medium, or large silicone pads depending on the natural length of your lashes or how curly you would like them to be. This new form or perming lashes compared to the original sponge rod creates more of a natural shape and curve to the lashes. The original way of perming lashes which is still done oftentimes gives less of a natural curve or shape to the lash. Another way to perm lashes is done by using a plastic instrument that looks a lot like a lash curler. This plastic instrument is then placed at the base of your lashes and then the instrument pinches them up wards the way a lash curler works. It rests on your eye for support and the rest of the procedure is performed the same way you would with rods or silicone pads. Once your lashes have been applied (by a special glue that does not harm the lashes) to the perm rod or silicone pad the perming solution is applied to the upturned lash, and then it is left to set for ten to fifteen minutes, followed by the neutralizer which is also left on for ten to fifteen minutes. In certain systems there will be a nourishing oil as the last step, this nourishing oil also helps to break up the glue that was used to place the lashes on the silicone pad making it easier for the removal of the silicone pad. Once the silicone pad has been removed the eyelids and lashes are cleansed of any residue left over. The over all procedure takes about 30‚Äì45 minutes to perform. The results may lasts for two to three months. The chemical reaction breaks and reforms the bonds of the hair. This reaction, softening the lash's inner structure between the protein chains of the hair. The hair swells, stretches and softens, then is molded around the shape of the perm rod or silicone pad to form a curl. The procedure is performed in a salon or spa by a trained, licensed and certified individual. Every state requires individuals performing the procedure to have a valid Cosmetology license. History Historically, to achieve an upturned look, lash curlers and mascara were used. The first eyelash curler was invented by the Kurlash company. An early alternative method for curling hair that was suitable for use on people was invented in 1905 by German hairdresser Charles Nessler. Eyelash perming developed as a widely available solution sometime after 2000. Considerations Due to the chemicals involved, like any procedure, there is some risk. Side effects of the procedure have been known to include stinging around the eyes. There is also the possibility that they may damage the eyelashes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while approving of hair treatment, has not yet approved the procedure for use around the eyes.

Kloiber. It grew to become the largest dry cleaning company in the city and one of the largest in central Connecticut before it was sold in 1974. History =Before the company's founding= Rudolph J. Kloiber was born in what is now Gussing, Austria, in 1884. He immigrated to the United States in 1897 at the age of 13 and settled in Troy, New York, with his uncle and his uncle's family.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated July 5, 1997, entitled ‚ÄúNew Britain Dry Cleaning one of city‚Äôs oldest businesses\\" In 1906, he became a citizen of the United States Certificate of Citizenship, United States of America, dated July 6, 1906 and moved to New York City to find work. In 1907, he met and married Margaret Rau, an immigrant from Gundersheim, Germany. It was in New York City that he learned the dry cleaning and dye works trade. In 1911, Rudolph moved his wife and two children to New Britain, Connecticut. (Rudolph and Margaret eventually had four children: Lydia was born in 1908; Edgar in 1911; Dorothy in 1914; Woodrow in 1917. Edgar and Woodrow joined the company when they were in their 20s. Dorothy died in childhood accident. Lydia later married Sydney Steinberg and was not involved with the business.)Kloiber Family History =Company history= In 1912, at the age of 28, Rudolph, with the help and support of his wife, Margaret, introduced dry cleaning services to New Britain, Connecticut, when he opened a two-person dry cleaning store on 156 Arch Street. He named his store New Britain Cleaners (later known as the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation and NB Cleaners). New Britain Cleaners remained the sole dry cleaner in the city for many years. After an early struggle for survival, success and recognition gradually came to the company.History of the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation from Inception to 1947 In 1914, Albert F. Eichstaedt, an early church acquaintance of Rudolph and Margaret, became interested in this business venture. A decision to join forces was made and on July 29, 1914, the business was incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut. A Certificate of Incorporation was issued in the name of New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation with authorized capital stock of 1,000 shares at $25.00 per share or $25,000 ($562,347 in 2011 dollars according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô online CPI calculator). Forty-eight (48) shares of capital stock were issued to commence business, or $1,200 ($26,992 in 2011 dollars). Subscribers to the capital stock were: Rudolph J. Kloiber, 28 shares; Margaret R. Kloiber, 12 shares; and Albert F. Eichstaedt, 8 shares. The Officers and Directors of the new corporation were Rudolph J. Kloiber, President and Director; Margaret R. Kloiber, Vice- President and Director, and Albert F. Eichstaedt, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. In 1916 (January 6), the Directors, recognizing the need for expansion, voted to purchase land and build a two-story building at 265 Cherry Street in New Britain. The land was purchased from Albert Eichstaedt for $250 ($5,159 in 2011 dollars) in exchange for 10 shares of corporate stock. To finance the cost of the new building and equipment, two area banks loaned the corporation a total of $4,600 ($94,928 in 2011 dollars), and 112 additional shares of stock were sold to the Directors at $25 per share for a total of $2,800 ($57,782 in 2011 dollars). In 1916, the company's gross income was $7,000 ($144,456 in 2011 dollars).State of Connecticut Taxation of Miscellaneous Corporations, year ending 1916 After the plant on 265 Cherry Street was completed in 1917, growth and expansion of the business became more rapid. In 1918, a sales route was established, a branch store was opened at 72 West Main Street, and a building addition and new equipment were added to the Cherry Street plant. In 1920 (March 6) at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Treasurer reported assets of $14,014, sales of $27,110, and profits of $3,636 ($157,614, $303,791, and $40,893 respectively, in 2011 dollars). At the meeting, the Directors voted to purchase the corner property on Ellis and Cherry Streets (which was adjacent to the plant on 265 Cherry Street) in the event the plant needed to expand. Purchase price was $7,000 ($78,728 in 2011 dollars). Note: Investing in real estate was always an integral part of the growth in value of the company. In 1921, the Directors again indicated their desire to invest in real estate by purchasing the land and buildings at 96 West Main Street for $29,000 ($364,426 in 2011 dollars) from S. Waskowtiz. Financing was through the use of corporate earnings, additional capital shares sold to Directors, and a bank mortgage. After the purchase, the branch store on 72 West Main Street was moved to the 96 West Main Street property. In 1922 (January), the corporation built and leased a garage and warehouse building at 96 West Main Street to the Connecticut Light and Power Company for $2,100 per year ($28,117 in 2011 dollars). In 1924 (February 6), at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a major decision in the history of the Corporation was made, that being to sell the properties on Cherry and Ellis Streets and to build a new, modern dry cleaning plant at 411-415 West Main Street. The property at 411-415 West Main Street was purchased from S. Waskowitz for $17,000 ($223,623 in 2011 dollars) and a building was constructed for $33,232 ($437,144 in 2011 dollars) to house the business and to provide a six-room apartment for the Kloiber family. Additional funds were spent for major steam, plumbing, and electrical installations. In 1925 (January), the new, 16,000 square foot plant at 411-415 West Main Street was occupied. The plant included administrative offices, route delivery racks, and room for the dry cleaning, spotting, finishing, and dyeing departments. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in February, the property at 383 West Main Street, formerly purchased as a possible site for the new plant, was voted to be sold and the realized profit applied toward the new plant. Later in the year, the corporation sold the building and property on 265 Cherry Street to the Crown Ice Cream Company. In 1926 (January 30), at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a new venture in real estate investment was discussed by the Directors. A resolution to build a salesroom and garage for the Lash Motor Sales Company on property already acquired by the Corporation near main plant was approved. The building was estimated to cost $13,960 ($177,409 in 2011 dollars) with rental income of $3,000 ($ 38,125 in 2011 dollars) per year. 1926 marked the temporary end of a rapid growth and expansion period of the dry cleaning business which began in 1916. While records show that from 1926 to 1930 dollar volume profitability increased substantially, the Directors concerned themselves with consolidating their business gains. In 1933, Edgar, 22, (Rudolph's oldest son) joined the company.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated October 20, 1982, entitled \\"Laundry-dry cleaning firm: One Owner, two names\\" During the early depression years, management struggled to keep the business solvent. Wages and salaries were cut to the bone. Dry cleaning prices were slashed. To meet new cut-rate competition, the plant was streamlined in an effort to reduce costs and increase efficiency. By 1936, the future looked brighter and the Directors voted to build an addition onto the rear of the plant for a new rug cleaning department. A new blanket brushing machine, drying tumbler, and curtain dryer were also purchased at this time. In 1936 (April), Albert Eichstaedt, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director retired from the business. His stock interest of 672 shares was purchased by the corporation for $18,500 ($299,379 in 2011 dollars) and his shares were retired as treasury stock. Edgar R. Kloiber, was elected as Secretary and Assistant Treasurer. In 1940, Woodrow, 23, (Rudolph's youngest son) joined the company. From 1937 to 1942, the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation underwent a complete change in methods of advertising, selling, and production. Branch stores were opened at 388 Main Street and 45 Main Street in New Britain, and 1037 Main Street in Newington, Connecticut. Route service was increased to three routes. New services were introduced including cold fur storage, hat blocking, and fur and leather cleaning. Sales increased from $58,645 in 1937 to $100,473 in 1942 ($916,079 to $1,386,521 in 2011 dollars). During the war years, growth in the dry cleaning industry was restricted so the corporation invested in real estate. In 1943, the corporation purchased a business block at 60 West Main Street from a local New Britain bank, for $47,500 ($617,607 in 2011 dollars). In 1945, the corporation purchased the buildings and land at 94 West Main Street from Mrs. Neal Caldwell for $30,000 ($374,898 in 2011 dollars). In 1946 (May), the Directors voted to remodel the building at 60 West Main Street at a cost of $28,679.11 ($330,821 in 2011 dollars). The building was named the ‚ÄúKloiber Building‚Äù providing three business stores on the ground floor and modern offices on the second floor. In 1946, the company had 5 stores (one at the main plant, three others in New Britain, and one in Newington).Advertisement in the New Britain Herald dated November 4, 1946. The Treasurer's report for that year showed sales of $195,003 ($2,249,424 in 2011 dollars) and rental income from investment properties of $14,710.00 ($169,684 in 2011 dollars). In 1947, Rudolph, founder, President, and Director of the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation died at the age of 63, a millionaire (in 2011 dollars).Obituary in the New Britain Herald, dated September 3, 1947, entitled ‚ÄúWorker for Blind, R. J. Kloiber Dies‚Äù At a special meeting of the Board of Directors, Edgar R. Kloiber, 36, was elected President and Treasurer, and Woodrow G. Kloiber, 30, was elected Assistant Treasurer and Secretary. Margaret, cofounder, remained Vice-President and Director of the Corporation until her death in 1969.Obituary in the New Britain Herald, dated June 9, 1969, entitled ‚ÄúProminent Woman Dies in 94th Year‚Äù In 1951, the company expanded its operations to include laundering shirts. The new shirt laundry department started with two women doing 1,000 shirts a week. By 1954, the operation expanded fivefold to 5,000 shirts per week.Article in the National Cleaner and Dyer Magazine, dated July 1954, entitled ‚ÄúShould You Buy New Equipment Now?‚Äù By 1953, total sales had soared to $300,000 ($2,538,449 in 2011 dollars). In 1954, the company's estimated share of the total cleaning volume in the New Britain area was 70%. Cash and carry trade (as opposed to route men picking up and delivering clothing) accounted for approximately 75% of the company's volume. Also in 1954, a major decision faced management. The issue was whether to buy new, more efficient, dry cleaning equipment that would increase productivity and provide better service to their customers or wait, because (1) management knew their dry cleaning equipment was fairly new and had been kept in excellent condition, (2) the country was in the midst of a recession, (3) business, in general, was leveling off throughout the nation due to the recession, and (4) economists warned companies to proceed with caution. However, Edgar and Woodrow Kloiber were inclined to be optimistic about the future of their company for, in spite of two world wars, a Great Depression, and the current recession, the business had grown steadily, year in and year out, since 1912 when it was founded. They felt that much of the growth was attributed to the company's policy of giving the public better and better service. The new system of dry cleaning appeared to offer a superior way of processing garments and improving service. After weighing the pros and cons, they decided to spend more than $40,000 ($335,943 in 2011 dollars) for the new dry cleaning equipment. The new equipment replaced a number of smaller dry cleaning units, freed up more production space, and released employees for other work in the plant. Two dry cleaners could now do the work of three and spotting work decreased by 70%. The net result was that production costs decreased, production capacity doubled, and the processing time was cut in half. In 1955, there were 65 employees, 5 route delivery drivers, and 9 stores (seven in New Britain, including one at the main plant and one in the downtown Kloiber Building; one in Newington; and one in West Hartford, Connecticut).A 1955 Corporation printed flyer In 1962, to better serve the public, the company opened New Britain's first combination coin-operated dry cleaning and laundry store‚ÄîNB Clean-O-Mat‚Äîat 987 West Main Street.55th Anniversary Sale advertisement, dated January 1967 In 1967, there were 60 employees and 11 stores (eight in New Britain, including the store at the main plant, and one each in Newington, Plainville, Connecticut, and Wethersfield, Connecticut). The company grew to become one of the largest dry cleaning companies in central Connecticut because of its policy of offering the finest cleaning at the lowest possible prices in keeping with quality service. There were special departments for dry cleaning clothes, furs, rugs, blankets, and draperies; and for laundering shirts. Mothproofing and waterproofing clothes were also offered. There was also a specially constructed large refrigerated cold storage vault for furs and other clothing that needed to be stored at cold temperatures for long periods of time. In 1969, Margaret Kloiber, co-founder, Vice-President, and Director of the Corporation, died at the age of 93. At a special meeting of the Board of Directors, Woodrow Kloiber became Vice- President, Assistant Treasurer, and Secretary. In 1969, as a result of being displaced by the new multilane route 72 highway that bisected New Britain, the main plant moved for the last time to a new facility at 544 West Main Street.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated August 3, 1974, entitled ‚ÄúPurchase unites cleaning firms‚Äù In 1974, a major merger occurred when Edgar Kloiber and Woodrow Kloiber were ready to retire. They sold the business to Williard Moneymaker and John Moneymaker, owners of Howards Cleaners Inc. The objectives of the purchase were to maintain a high volume of work, increase the efficiency of both companies, and stabilize prices. Both firms retained their individual names for marketing purposes and the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation's main plant serviced both companies because of its modern equipment, including a completely conveyorized and computerized dry cleaning system.Article in the Hartford Courant, dated July 30, 1974, entitled ‚ÄúCleaners Firm To Move Store to New Address‚Äù =Working conditions= Working conditions in a dry cleaning and laundry plant during the summer months were brutally hot, temperatures often rising to 100 degrees or more. Salt tablets were the norm of the day. Modern air conditioning, even if available, was not appropriate in the plant. Rudolph, and later his sons, did all they could to make working conditions bearable on the shop floor by opening windows, using fans, and scheduling work breaks because they cared about their employees and recognized the value of happy, experienced, and loyal employees. They rewarded their employees with regular pay raises and bonuses. They encouraged suggestions to improve the operations of individual departments within the business. They held holiday season parties and outings for their employees on a regular basis and honored longtime employees at appropriate times. Many articles appeared in the New Britain Herald over the years mentioning surprise bonuses, parties, testimonials, and outings for the employees in appreciation of their work. For example, the New Britain Herald reported that employees of the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation were surprised when they received along with their regular pay in July, a bonus from the earnings made during April, May, and June that amounted to eight percent for the employees who had worked during those three months and four percent to employees who had worked less than three months.Article in the New Britain Herald, undated, entitled \\"Kloiber Gives Bonus To Force of Employees\\" Holiday season parties were the traditional time to announce end-of-year bonuses. For example, in 1945, the New Britain Herald reported that following a Christmas dinner, Rudolph Kloiber presented bonuses to the employees based on the time they worked for the company. Employees working five or more years received a bonus of 15% of their quarterly wages; those working one to four years, received 10%; and those working six months to one year received 5% of their quarterly wages.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated December 18, 1945, entitled ‚ÄúDry Cleaning Company Entertains Employees‚Äù On December 13, 1948, the New Britain Herald reported that during the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation's annual Christmas party, a bonus was given to all employees by Woodrow Kloiber on the following basis: A full week's pay was given to employees who had been with the company for one or more years, and a half week's pay to employees who were hired during the previous six months. A donation of $62 ($578 in 2011 dollars) was given to a former employee who was ill.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated December 13, 1948, entitled ‚ÄúLocal Firm Sponsors Party for Employees‚Äù Testimonials and gifts for employees reaching service milestones or at retirement were the norm. Watches were given to employees reaching 25 years of service. In an article that appeared in the New Britain Herald on December 20, 1967, it was reported that Mr. Frank Merkle, retiring after 50 years of service, was presented with a color television from the company and a purse of money from the employees at the company's annual Christmas party. A picture accompanying the article shows Mr. Merkle with five other longtime employees totaling 193 years of service with the company.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated December 20, 1967, entitled ‚ÄúMerkle Retires After 50 Years At Cleaning Firm‚Äù Another way of keeping in touch with employees was a monthly newsletter which was published by the company and distributed to all workers. Called the Spotfinder, this small publication included news of anniversaries, retirements, illnesses, expressions of sympathy to those who had lost family members, etc., all interspersed with jokes and news of past employees. The November 1, 1944, issue emphasized workers' rights as citizens. The issue stated ‚ÄúThe Spotfinder has no political affiliations and has no intentions to talk politics. It is, however, the duty of self and country of all who are eligible to vote to cast their ballot on November 7th, and may the best man win. On our local state ticket, we have, as most of us know, one of our own fellow workers who is running for State Representative on the Democratic ticket. She is none other than Sophie Liss of the silk finishing department and the Spotfinder takes pleasure to congratulate her on her rapid strides in politics and wishes her luck in this campaign.‚Äù =Involvement in the community= The New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation served many organizations in the community as well as their retail customers. Among the company's services was cleaning the New Britain High School football uniforms and cleaning the Normal School's curtains and blankets. Workers would go to the Normal School, remove all the draperies and rehang them when done. Besides managing the company, Rudolph Kloiber was personally active in community affairs. He was a deacon and member of the People's Church on Court Street, a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and a member of the Lions Club International, New Britain chapter. Rudolph was also well known for helping the blind and was a member of the Lions Club's Blind Committee for many years. In 1946, during his chairmanship of the committee, he donated, free of charge, the use of a building that he owned at 92 West Main Street for the blind who lived in New Britain and surrounding towns. Rudolph, and members of the Lions Club, renovated the building to include rooms for recreation, education, and social gatherings. A ground floor retail store was incorporated into the renovation for the sale of articles made by the blind.Article in the New Britain Herald, dated November 1946, entitled ‚ÄúCenter for Blind Near Completion‚ÄùPicture in the New Britain Herald, dated November 12, 1946, entitled ‚ÄúLions Redecorate Recreation Center for Blind‚Äù At the state level, Rudolph was a member of the Connecticut Cleaners and Dyers State Advisory Committee to work with the State Consumer Committee in handling dry cleaning and dyeing consumer problems in the state. The advisory committee, which was composed of representatives of retail dry cleaners, chain store cleaners, and wholesale cleaners, was the authoritative source through which information from the State Consumer Committee was distributed to the cleaning and dyeing industry. The committee also made suggestions regarding which policies or methods should be adopted by the State Consumer Committee.Article in the New Britain Herald, undated, entitled ‚ÄúKloiber Appointed to State Committee‚Äù =End of an era= In what started as a two-person dry cleaning business in 1912 grew to become a strong and successful business presence in New Britain. The New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation became the largest dry cleaning company in New Britain and one of the largest in central Connecticut before it was sold in 1974, 62 years after it was founded. Success was achieved through difficult times (World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II) and prosperous times (two postwar recoveries) because of Rudolph Kloiber's, and later Edgar Kloiber's and Woodrow Kloiber's, willingness to take calculated risks and caring for their employees as evidenced in this history. Lastly, all the men who ran the New Britain Dry Cleaning Corporation have died. Rudolph died in 1947 as was previously stated; Woodrow died in 1992; and Edgar died in 2006.

Throughout the 19th century, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20th century Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and general equality for women in society; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, feminist circles arose among the intelligentsia, though the term continues to carry negative connotations among contemporary Russians. In the 21st century some Russian feminists, such as the punk-rock band Pussy Riot, have again aligned themselves with anti-government movements, as in the 2012 demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin, which led to a lawyer representing the Russian Orthodox Church calling feminism a \\"mortal sin\\".  Origins  = 18th century = Russian feminism originated in the 18th century, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and the prominent role of women as a symbol for democracy and freedom in the French Revolution. Notable Russian intellectual figures of the following, 19th century, such as Alexander Pushkin and Alexander Herzen wrote positively about the increased power and independence of women in their society and supported the growing concern for gender equality. In his influential novel What is to be Done?, the writer Nikolai Chernyshevski embodied the new feminist ideas in the novel's heroine, Vera Pavlovna, who dreams of a future utopian society with perfect equality among the sexes. Portrait of Princess Natalia Sheremeteva, first female Russian autobiographer and one of the Decembrist women In aristocratic Russian society, the greater freedoms allowed to women led to the rise of the powerful, socially-connected woman, including such iconic figures as Catherine the Great, Maria Naryshkina, and Countess Maria Razumovskaya. Women also began to compete with men in the literary sphere, with Russian women authors, poets, and memoirists increasing in popularity. = 19th century = The loosening of restrictions on women's education and personal freedom that were enacted by Peter the Great in the 18th century created a new class of educated women, such as Princess Natalia Sheremeteva, whose 1767 Notes was the first autobiography by a woman in Russia. In the 19th century, Sheremeteva was one of the \\"Decembrist women,\\" the female relatives of the Decembrists. The male Decembrists were a group of aristocratic revolutionaries who in 1825 were convicted of plotting to overthrow Emperor Nicholas I, and many of whom were sentenced to serve in labor camps in Siberia. Though the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Decembrist men shared the same liberal democratic political views as their male relatives, they were not charged with treason because they were women; however, 11 of them, including Sheremeteva and Princess Mariya Volkonskaya, still chose to accompany their husbands, brothers, and sons to the labor camps. Though they were portrayed as heroes in popular culture, the Decembrist women insisted that they were simply doing their duty to their family. While in Siberia, some of them cared not only for their own relatives, but also for the other prisoners. They also set up important institutions like libraries and clinics, as well as arranging lectures and concerts. Anna Filosofova, co- founder of the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society In the historical writing of the time, the humble devotion of the Decembrist women was contrasted with the intrigues and hedonism of female aristocrats of the 18th century, like Catherine the Great, whose excesses were seen as the danger of too-sudden liberation for women. Although they did not explicitly espouse a feminist agenda, the Decembrist women were used as an example by later generations of Russian feminists, whose concern for gender equality was also tied to revolutionary political agendas. In the late 19th century, other aristocratic women began to turn away from refined society life and focused on feminist reform. Among them was Anna Pavlovna Filosofova, a woman from an aristocratic Moscow family married to a high-ranking bureaucrat, who devoted her energy to various societies and projects to benefit the poor and underprivileged in Russian society, including women. Together with Maria Trubnikova, Nadezhda Stasova and Evgenia Konradi, she lobbied the Emperor to create and fund higher education courses for women. She was also a founding member of the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society and responsible for helping to organize the All-Women's Congress of 1908. At the end of the century, some of the most widely read Russian literary figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.  The Revolution and Soviet era  = Pre-Revolution = At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the focus of Russian feminism shifted from the aristocracy to the peasants and working class. Imbued with socialist ideology, young women began to organize all-women unions among female factory workers, who tended to be ignored or marginalized by male socialists. Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was the most important feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote. the iconic Soviet statue that symbolized union of a male worker and a kolkhoz woman, which represented the ideal of equality under Communism. = Feminism in Soviet society = Vladimir Lenin, who led the Bolsheviks to power in the October Revolution, recognized the importance of women's equality in the Soviet Union (USSR) they established. \\"To effect [woman's] emancipation and make her the equal of man,\\" he wrote in 1919, two years after the Revolution, following the Marxist theories that underlaid Soviet communism, \\"it is necessary to be socialized and for women to participate in common productive labor. Then woman will be the equal of man.\\" In practice, Russian women saw massive gains in their rights under Communism. Women's suffrage was granted. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. In 1922, marital rape was made illegal in the Soviet Union.The first criminal law code in Soviet Russia differed from Tsarist law on rape: \\"although the Tsarist law explicitly excluded marital rape, the Soviet law code of 1922 did not.\\" Marital rape was explicitly included in the 1960 code. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women. Though the prevailing Soviet ideology stressed total gender equality, and many Soviet women held jobs and advanced degrees, they did not participate in core political roles and institutions. Above the middle levels, political and economic leaders were overwhelmingly male. While propaganda claimed, accurately, that more women sat in the Supreme Soviet than in most democratic countries' legislative bodies combined, only two women, Yekaterina Furtseva and (in its last year of existence) Galina Semyonova, were ever members of the party's Politburo, arguably the most important component of country's government. By the 1970s, while women's liberation was a mainstream term in American public discourse, no comparable movement existed in the Soviet Union, despite gender-based income inequality and a rate of additional work in the household greater than that experienced by American women. There were also double standards in social norms and expectations. \\"A man can fool around with other women, drink, even be lackadaisical toward his job, and this is generally forgiven,\\" wrote Hedrick Smith, former Russian correspondent for The New York Times, but \\"if a woman does the same things, she is criticized for taking a light-hearted approach toward her marriage and her work.\\" In an open letter to the country's leadership shortly before he was expelled from it in 1974, the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn talked about an alleged heavy burden placed on women to do the menial work in Soviet society: \\"How can one fail to feel shame and compassion at the sight of our women carrying heavy barrows of stones for paving the street?\\" Smith wrote that many women he talked to complained that their emancipation had in fact been exploitation, since economic circumstances effectively compelled them to work while they retained their domestic responsibilities at home, and they were often tired; and that in contrast to Western women, Soviet women regularly saw their idea of liberation as working less and having more opportunity to stay at home. He recounted a popular joke: Sexist attitudes still prevailed across Soviet society. Men in the leadership often did not take women or their ideas seriously, and excluded them from many discussions. Domestic violence and sexual harassment continued to exist, although to a much lesser extent than in the West. Yet, sociological studies at the time found that Soviet women tended not to see their inequality as a problem.  Glasnost and post-Soviet Russia  In the mid-1980s Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, allowing greater freedom of speech and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women‚Äôs political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures.Racioppi and O‚ÄôSullivan, Women‚Äôs Activism, 3. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse.Rebecca Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations: Gender, Discrimination and Grassroots Women‚Äôs Organizations, 1991‚Äì96 (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), 123. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations. During glasnost and after the fall of the Soviet Union, feminist circles began to emerge among intelligentsia women in major cultural centers like Moscow and St. Petersburg. In the 1990s, Russian women were hesitant to use the term \\"feminist\\" to describe themselves, because they believed it to have negative connotations throughout Russian history, and especially after the Revolution, when it was equated with the \\"proletariat\\" woman who only cares for her career, not her family. Russian women‚Äôs activism in the 1990s was not explicitly feminist; women attempted to improve their financial and social conditions through any practical means. From this struggle emerged female communities which empowered many women to assert themselves in their pursuit of work, equitable treatment and political voice. Political and economic transformation in post-Soviet Russia caused deep economic decline in the 1990s and particular financial struggles for women. Although many held jobs, women were also expected to be homemakers. Soviet working women often received extensive employment benefits, such as long child-care leaves, which pushed women into the role of housewife. In the 1990s domestic work grew increasingly demanding as acquiring goods became more time- consuming in the restructured economy. Women‚Äôs benefits also made them less attractive employees, and during privatization many companies fired women. While 90% of women were in the labor market in the 1980s, by 1991 women made up 70‚Äì80% of unemployed Russians. Those jobs available to women in the 1990s were often in low-wage sectors, and many job descriptions specified that only young, attractive women need apply. Employed women often received significantly less pay than men doing the same work.Linda Racioppi and Katherine O‚ÄôSullivan, Women‚Äôs Activism in Contemporary Russia. (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1997), 47‚Äì50. 21st century Members of Pussy Riot, a feminist Russian punk rock band. In 2003, 43 percent of local administrators in St. Petersburg were women. In 2012, the feminist punk rock band Pussy Riot performed publicity stunts to show their opposition to Vladimir Putin, and have faced criticism from the Russian Orthodox Church and the Putin administration. Three members of the group were arrested in March 2012 after performing a \\"punk-prayer\\" against Putin in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. During their trial for hooliganism, they talked about being feminists and stated that this was not incompatible with Russian Orthodoxy. However, Larisa Pavlova, the lawyer representing the Church, insisted this view \\"does not correspond with reality\\" and called feminism a \\"mortal sin.\\" See also * Gender roles in post-communist Central and Eastern Europe  Notes   References   * Clements, Barbara Evans.

Multidisciplinary professional services networks are organizations formed by law, accounting and other professional services firms to offer clients new multidisciplinary approaches solving increasingly complex issues. They are a type of professional services network which operates to provide services to their members. They operate in the same way as accounting firm networks and associations and law firm networks. They do not practice a profession such as law or accounting but provide services to members so they can serve clients needs. Their aim is to provide members involved in doing business internationally with access to experienced, tried and tested, reliable, and responsive professional advisers who know their local jurisdiction intimately as well as the intricacies of cross border business. There are 10 multidisciplinary networks. The largest are: Alliott Group, MSI Global Alliance, Morison International, Geneva Group, International Practice Group, WSG - World Services Group and Russell Bedford International. These networks have more than 100 member firms in as many as 90 countries in hundreds of offices. The members employ thousands of professionals.  History  Multidisciplinary networks are not new but found in a number of professions. They became important during the end of the 1990s when the accounting firms began to expand to the legal profession. The history is well documented.Mijares, A H, The SEC‚Äôs ban on Legal serves by Audit firms: Amendments to Rule 2.01 of Regulations S-X under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 36 U.S. F. L. Rev 209‚Äì236 (2001). The American Bar Association Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice refers to five multidisciplinary models.American Bar Association Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter‚Äôs notes, July 2000 They are the cooperative, command and control, ancillary practice, network and multidisciplinary partnership models. = Big Six accounting firms ‚Äì multidisciplinary practices = The multidisciplinary issues first arose in the 1940s but was dealt with by the American Bar Association prohibiting lawyers working for accounting firms to represent clients before the IRS.ABA Information Op. 269 (1944) The foundation of multidisciplinary practice began when the Big 4 accounting firms reached their natural growth limits. Accounting, auditing and tax services could generate only a finite amount of revenue for the Big 6. The Big 4‚Äôs concept was simple: use the extensive list of clients to market non-traditional accounting services such as legal, recruitment, risk management, technology consulting, etc. The objective was to bring these non-traditional services ‚Äúin-house‚Äù using the time-tested network model. Having reached their natural limit on growth the Big 4 branched out to become multidisciplinary in legal, technology, and employment services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. The expansion could easily be financed using revenue from the traditional services. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other professions which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm but the fundamental premise was the sharing of revenue between lawyers and accountants. The accounting firms were initially very successful in creating these alternative businesses. Soon a number of Big 6 firms had multi-billion dollar technology consulting businesses. Other services were more difficult to bring in-house. Some, like legal services, demanded a different approach because of ethical considerations. The key factor among such different approaches is an internal control system within a firm. = Reaction of the legal profession= The initial to expand to legal services focus was on the United States which represented the largest potential market for these services. In Europe and South America the bar rules were not as developed as in the United States, and therefore did not restrict the sharing of revenues. The basis for this expansion was the law firm network that established under the umbrella of the Big Six.These networks had names like the E&Y; Legal Network, Andersen Legal Network and Landwell. Only Landwell remains with 6 member firms. Countries in the Landwell network The issues were sharing profits with accountants and other professionals and the possible conflicts of interest. When the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from law firms and bar associations.Jacobs, ‚ÄúAccounting Firms Covert Forbidden Fruit: Piece of the U.S. Legal Market, Wall Street Journal,‚Äù p.B1 (May 31, 2000), Poe, ‚ÄúMultidisciplinary Practice,‚Äù Defense Counsel J. 245 (Apr. 2000), Cannon, ‚ÄúThe Big Six Moves In‚Äù 50 Int‚Äôl Fin.

Lawyers saw that the accounting profession would subsume the legal profession with its vast resources.In 2011, the UK House of Lords completed an inquiry into the financial crisis, and called for an Office of Fair Trading investigation into the dominance of the Big Four. Adam Jones, Auditors criticized for role in financial crisis, Financial Times, 30 March 2011 Commissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. The American Bar Association established committees and taskforces to address the issue, but the problem spread outside of the United States, first to Europe but then to other countries where lawyers were not protected from this new foreign competition.McGarry, S. Multidisciplinary Practices and Partnerships, American Lawyer Media Publishing, 2002 Government agencies were enlisted. For more than five (5) years the debate escalated. This movement ended abruptly with the fall of Arthur Andersen as a result of its association with Enron. Sarbanes Oxley followed, which effectively ended this trend of multisdisciplinary networks established by the Big 5. = Enron and Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley = There was, however, a fatal flaw in the multidisciplinary network concepts of the Big 6. The raison d‚Äôetre of the Big 6 was to audit public companies. Each service which is provided to an audited client contained an inherent conflict of interest. This conflict was illustrated by the perfect storm created by Enron. The additional services that Arthur Anderson was offering created a conflict in their role as the auditor. Multidisciplinary networks by the accounting firms were DOA. The final nail in the coffin was Sarbanes Oxley which meant that the accounting firms had to divest their consulting practices.Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002).  Multidisciplinary networks today  The multidisciplinary network model was not dead but transformed to account for the issues. If the member firms were themselves independent, there was no prohibition on having a multidisciplinary network. This was recognized by the ABA. Today there are at least eleven networks. The largest are in the legal and accounting professions. A few of the legal and accounting networks include investment banking. The primary networks are focused on tax, employment, intellectual property, insurance and immigration.

It drew some of its members from among the functionaries of the former pro-Axis Albanian occupation regime, but since the insurrection became general, embracing almost the entire Kosovar Albanian population, numerous Kosovar Albanian Partisans were quickly drawn to participate in it. Indeed, NDSH represents a unique example of a near-unanimous popular insurrection in Europe, neglected by historians who do not know Albanian sources. It was a genuine collective rebellion encompassing Kosovo and western Macedonia. Between 1945 and 1947, the NDSH organized three underground congresses. A debate took place in the movement, with one trend favoring relocation of the leaders to Greece and their opponents insisting that the fight continue within Kosovo. In the parlance of later revolutionary movements elsewhere in Europe, these could be described as ‚Äòinternal‚Äô and ‚Äòexternal‚Äô factions. The main ‚Äòinternal‚Äô leader, Ajet Gurguri, remained on the scene in Kosovo but was arrested and executed. He was followed in death by Gjon Serreqi, a Catholic patriot, who had been sent to a prison camp by the German SS in 1944. Serreqi had directed the clandestine ND while serving as a teacher in the Sami Frash√´ri high school in the historic center of Pristina, whose students organized an LNDSh Student Youth Committee. On 11 March 1945, the Albanian women of ƒêakovica went into the streets to protest against the drafting of their menfolk to serve the Yugoslavs in the repression of NDSH. Many of the women protesters were arrested and received lengthy prison sentences. But one Albanian woman stood out from the others: Marie Shllaku (1922‚Äì46), a Catholic schoolteacher born in Shkod√´r in northern Albania. Shllaku was seriously wounded during fighting. Sheltered by a peasant family, she was discovered and arrested. The Yugoslav police ignored her injuries, beating and otherwise torturing her. She was carried into the courtroom in Prizren, where she was tried. In her last words in court, Shllaku declared, \\"one day your sons and daughters will be ashamed of your treachery and inhumanity against us and against the whole Albanian people\\". During the period when she awaited death, she was heard in her prison cell nightly singing folk songs from Shkod√´r, as if preparing for her wedding. She was 24 when she was executed late in 1946. Many more LNDSh supporters were imprisoned and killed before the insurrection was completely defeated. Fighting in Kosovo had not ended until 1947; several tens of thousands of Albanians perished in the uprising.

Hardwick's MD, FRCPC, FCAP career focused on the field of paediatric pathology. Hardwick was involved with the University of British Columbia (UBC) for more than sixty years as both a student and professor, and is a Professor Emeritus. His research included the first description of histopathologic implications of differential survival of Wilms' Tumors to pathogenesis of L-methionine toxicity and administrative/management research.http://www.cahs- acss.ca/david-f-hardwick-2/ The University of British Columbia In 2001, UBC awarded Hardwick an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree in recognition of his commitment to the principles of academic freedom. In his acceptance speechhttp://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/speeches/hardwick.html he spoke of \\" ...the opportunity to chase one's own rainbow's end...\\", noting that such opportunity does not exist widely outside the university environment, and exhorting new graduates to do what they can to preserve academic freedom. Hardwick attributed his achievements to his ability to build connections with multiple institutional entities, and to strengthen connections among different generations of medical practitioners. He spoke publicly of the importance of collegial activity in an article \\"Our Academy as an Exciting Academic Forum\\":THE ACADEMY‚ÄîThe Newsletter of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology Volume l No. 2 Fall 2000 As Associate Dean, Research and Planning, in the UBC Faculty of Medicine from 1990 to 1996, Hardwick helped build government relationships that advanced the academic and scientific missions of UBC and its teaching hospitals.

He received his education, including his medical education, at The University of British Columbia graduating in 1957. Hardwick pursued post graduate training in Montreal, PQ; Charlotte, NC; Vancouver, BC, and Los Angeles, CA, first in P√¶diatrics and then in Pathology, Medical Biochemistry and Developmental Physiology. He began his teaching, research and administrative career at The University of British Columbia in 1963 in the Department of Pathology. Researcher Hardwick's research training in Physiology and Pathology led to numerous publications including an early conclusion that the histological appearance of Wilms' tumours affected clinical outcome‚Äîat that time a new observation‚Äîand in 1971 to an elucidation of the pathogenesis of Methionine toxicity. His work in the area of p√¶diatric pathology includes a study of metabolic diseases of childhood. His research into methods for screening inborn errors of metabolism has led to the investigation and reporting, with co-workers, of numerous cases. In the field of pathophysiology his research focused on the effect of vasomotion or lack of vasomotion on tissue pathology and viability in normal tissues and in tumours. Hardwick's ongoing interest in governance led to his research on inter- dependent relationships in inter-institutional systems, and in the area of clinical pathology his research into physician behaviour has led to practical hypotheses of laboratory test ordering patterns with testable interventions. Later studies have focused on economic effects of clinical laboratory testing. His second book, Directing the Clinical Laboratory, is a summation of 27 years' experience in this aspect of his research. Educator Hardwick received the Certificate of Excellence Master Teaching Award in 1974, and the University Teaching Excellence Award and Prize in 1994. Students' fondness for him is illustrated by the number of nominations he has received for teaching awards determined by the student body, which has elected him as Faculty Advisor to the Medical Advisory Undergraduate Society for 23 consecutive two- year terms.http://www.alumni.ubc.ca/awards/2007/recipients/hardwick.php In 1994, the Committee for Accreditation of Canadian Medical Schools (CACMS) review of the UBC Faculty of Medicine congratulated the Department of Pathology for the design of the undergraduate pathology course that Hardwick directed, and noted that it was the students' \\"recognized best course in the School of Medicine\\" and one that \\"all other Departments should emulate\\". Administrator and innovator Since the 1960s, Hardwick has been a major influence in the Faculty's decision-making. He was Head of Pathology for 14 years from 1976, attracting and producing many talented educators, researchers, and practitioners during his tenure. He then became Associate Dean of Research and Planning and on retiring was invited to stay on as Special Advisor on Planning. He has been heavily involved in the expansion of the undergraduate medical program since 2003; a provincial government supported initiative to address the shortage of medical practitioners, especially prevalent in rural areas.http://www.alumni.ubc.ca/awards/2007/recipients/hardwick.php Hardwick has been quick to grasp the potential of information technology, and served on UBC's E-Strategy Committee, examining how new technologies can best be employed in learning and research. He implemented training changes early on at UBC, creating a University administration system to switch from hospital to university administrated Residency Programs (1971), followed by the creation of an administrative structure to support the combined Women's and Children's Hospital as Chief of Medical Staff (1982). He conceptualized, and Fred Silva of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) worked to implement the Knowledge Hub for Pathology.http://www.uscap.org This is an interactive repository of current knowledge that provides knowledge to pathologists worldwide (76 million hits in 2010), free, until its \\"best before\\" date at which time it is replaced by more up-to-date information. International career Hardwick taught, lectured and presented at conferences around the globe. In recognition of his international work he was awarded the Gold Medal of the International Academy of Pathology (IAP) in 2003. Awarded only every second year, this honour recognizes individuals who have contributed international service to the Academy and to the field of pathology in the areas of education, research and service. He was responsible for hospital campus facility creation and AV/IT provision for UBC's distributed Medical School expansion throughout BC, and was the International Secretary for the International Academy of Pathology (IAP), the world's largest and oldest pathology society. Hardwick served as IAP President in 1994 at the Hong Kong Congress and remained engaged as a Vice-President, North America to enhance international education. He was instrumental in putting the Inter-congress Education Committee in place and began to re-structure the IAP. In 2005, he was asked by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) to work with them and others to determine a strategy for preserving the AFIP in an era of drastic budget cuts. Ultimately, the medical function was transferred to \\"Joint Services\\", and the museum repository, unique in the world, was maintained. Current activities Professor Hardwick worked with the BC Government Ministries of Health Services and Education Advancement to create new academic facilities at hospitals and clinics throughout British Columbia. This process began in early 2002 in response to the BC Government's decision to more than double the enrolment of undergraduate students, from 128 per year to 288 per year, and postgraduate residency trainees by a small number. In addition to overseeing the planning and implementation of approximately $50,000,000 of structural facilities, Hardwick advised on creation of the advanced video conference, lecture and seminar facilities for the program. These facilities (structural and AV/IT) are also used extensively for interdisciplinary education at all the sites, with special implementation at partner university campuses (University of Victoria, University of Northern British Columbia, University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus (UBCO)) and at the major clinical academic campuses of the Vancouver Fraser Program, Island Medical Program, Northern Medical Program, and Southern Medical Program. He served as the Secretary to the International Academy of Pathology, and is working to monitor and support web information, divisional programs worldwide and to advise the international office with special emphasis on biennial congresses in underserved countries: S√£o Paulo in 2010, Cape Town in 2012, Bangkok in 2014, Jordan in 2016 and Glasgow 2020. He is Chair of the US Canadian IAP Division Long-term Planning Initiative. Professor Hardwick is also co-founder of a series of books on classical liberalism. British Columbia Children's Hospital The first British Columbia Children's Hospital owes its existence in part to his efforts. As Chair of the Medical Advisory Committee of the original Children's Hospital Hardwick brought various medical and lay community groups together in achieving the new Children's Hospital. After the Children's Hospital amalgamated with Women's Hospital, forming the new Children's and Women's Hospital, Hardwick served on the Board of Directors from 1998 to 2001. The UBC David F. Hardwick Pathology Learning Centre (DHPLC) in the Diamond Health Care Centre, which houses the pathology medical museum specimens, is an example of educational resource for learning about the causes and mechanisms of human disease, and for studying clinicopathologic correlations.

He was appointed Governor of the Banque de France during the liberation of France at the end of World War II, replacing Yves Br√©art de Boisanger, Inspector of Finance in Vichy France. As the Secretary General of Finance in the Provisional Government of the French Republic from August 29 to September 4, 1944, he had to decide what to do about the gold that the Nazi Party requisitioned from the National Bank of Belgium following the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne in 1940, which they later sold to the Swiss National Bank. The 220 tons of gold were repaid to the National Bank of Belgium at the end of 1944 from the Banque de France‚Äôs own reserves. Monick negotiated recovery for the Banque de France of 90 tons of gold and 250 million Swiss francs.  Biography  As a result of his participation in World War I, Monick was awarded the Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre with five palms and two stars. After World War I, he was a financial at the French embassy in Washington, where he became great friends with French Ambassador Paul Claudel, and met Franklin D. Roosevelt. Later appointed as a financial attach√© to London, he met Winston Churchill. During World War II, Emmanuel Monick was the Secretary General of the French protectorate of Morocco. He helped prepare for Operation Torch, which landed U.S. troops in North Africa, along with Consul General Robert Murphy and J. Rives Childs. His position meant that he was able to smuggle people out of the country, and save the lives of several Jews by helping them to reach the United States. was his chief of staff during this period, and Robert Marjolin his senior political advisor. The Vichy government realized that he did not support its agenda of collaboration and recalled him to France, with an order sent by cable from Otto Abetz and requested by Joachim von Ribbentrop. Once back in France, he went underground, hiding in Ain and then in Paris, and going by his resistance alias of . He participated in many resistance activities, with in particular, and attended the August 25, 1944 meeting of the Provisory Council of the Republic at the which set up the government that would succeed Mar√©chal P√©tain. Monick helped liberate the Ministry of Finance at the request of Alexandre Parodi. He became the Secretary General of Finance in the government that took power from Vichy. Citing policy differences with the government, he left his post as Governor of the Bank of France in 1949, which caused some concern in the markets. Monick became President of the Bank of Paris and the Netherlands (which later became BNP Paribas), and later Honorary President of the same bank. When Charles de Gaulle began to question the future of French institutions, he asked Emmanuel Molnick to arrange a secret meeting with the Count of Paris. It took place on July 13, 1954 at Monick's home in Saint-L√©ger-en-Yvelines. In an interview with Point de Vue's Image du Monde on the Count's 80th birthday, the Countess of Paris said that this was the first time the two met. The count gives his account of the meeting in Dialogue sur la France, Fayard, 1994. During the summer of 1956, Monick also arranged several discreet meetings between de Gaulle and foreign heads of state such as Mohammed V of Morocco, or political figures such as the French President .

The house is named for the woman who lived there and saved Indian Field from development in the 1970s, but who had her house taken from her by Suffolk County as a result.The Hilda Lindley House, 1960s Location and overview of the Hilda Lindley House Set in the middle of more than 1,000 acres of rolling hills, moors, ponds, wetlands, and grasslands called Indian Field, the Hilda Lindley House sits at the eastern tip of Long Island, between Shagwong Point and Montauk Point, and overlooks Block Island Sound and parts of the Connecticut and Rhode Island coast. The house was built in 1944 by the U.S. Army as a fire control station. It was constructed as part of a national fire-control system along the coasts of the United States to spot enemy ships and aircraft. Made of reinforced concrete but designed to look like a simple cottage, it is named for Hilda Lindley, who, with her husband, Francis Vinton Lindley, bought the house in 1950 after it was made surplus by the Army. In the 1970s, after Indian Field was threatened by developers who proposed to build a large housing development, Hilda Lindley organized resistance and saved the land. Forming Montauk's first environmental group, she started a movement that went on to preserve much of Montauk as open space, despite heavy development pressure from the suburbs and New York City, little more than 100 miles away. Indian Fields Montauk Big Reed Nature Trail In 1970, Hilda Lindley founded an environmental group called the Concerned Citizens of Montauk (CCOM) to save Indian Field's unique natural and cultural history after developers proposed to build up to 1,800 houses on its 1,000 windswept, pristine acres. After a long and bitter political fight, Lindley and the CCOM succeeded in convincing the Suffolk County Legislature to buy much of Indian Field for parkland. County officials insisted on taking Lindley's house and land via eminent domain, however. Many saw the county's move to take Lindley's house as an act of political revenge, because she had angered powerful business and political interests by saving the land from development.Porco 2005, p. 33. After several years of legal and political negotiation, Lindley and Suffolk County agreed to a lease, by which she and her family were to stay in the house for 35 years. Hida Lindley died of breast cancer in December 1980, but her three children and their families continued to live in the house. In 2010, the Suffolk County Parks Commissioner, Joseph D. Montuori, ordered the family that had saved Indian Field to leave it. Early history of Indian Field Indian Field was the last home of the Montaukett, or Montauk, Indians, whose lands in Montauk were gradually taken over by the European settlers, mostly English, who began arriving on the South Fork of Long Island in the late 1640s. An initial purchase of much of the Montauketts‚Äô land was made in 1648 by Thomas Stanton, sent to negotiate with the Indians by Governors Eaton of New Haven and Hopkins of Connecticut, though scholars believe that the Indians did not share the English settlers‚Äô concept of private property and thought they were merely selling the right to hunt there.Strong 2001, p. 15. Despite some Indian resistance, often feeble due to a Montaukett population weakened by disease and their new-found dependence on an exotic and different way of living established by the European settlers, the English colonists kept expanding their use and purchase of the Montauketts‚Äô lands to the east. In 1702, the Trustees of the Town of East Hampton made an agreement with the Montauketts for their land in Montauk, with the promise of principal and yearly payments and that the Indians could ‚Äúplant and improve‚Äù Indian Field, the fertile area east of Great Pond (now called Lake Montauk) and northwest of Oyster Pond.Strong 2001, p. 131. Montauketts continued to live, hunt, fish, and gather in Indian Field into the late 19th century, and some of the remains of their houses and root cellars there have been the subjects of archaeological digs. It is estimated that somewhere between 12 and 30 Montauketts were living in Indian Field in 1879, the year that Arthur Benson, a Brooklyn businessman and the developer of Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section, bought most of Montauk at auction from the East Hampton Town Trustees for $151,000. Benson, who liked to hunt and fish in Montauk, soon began building houses designed by the noted architect Stanford White for rich friends to enjoy near the ocean.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/travel/history-at-the-tip-of-long- island.html?pagewanted=3 Though he originally denied any commercial plans for Montauk, Benson, in association with another wealthy businessman named Austin Corbin, hoped to extend the Long Island Railroad east to Montauk and to turn the little fishing hamlet into a major hub for transatlantic shipping. The concept was that freight and passengers could be transferred from ships arriving at Montauk to the Long Island Railroad for transportation to New York City, thus cutting a day off the transatlantic trip between European ports and New York. The plan never came to fruition due to economic and political circumstances, however. The East Hampton Town Trustees sold Benson the land, including Indian Field, ‚Äúsubject to the rights and privileges of the Montauk Tribe of Indians.‚Äù Attempting to clear title, Benson hired Nathaniel Dominy VII, East Hampton's assessor, to convince the few Montauketts remaining in Indian Field to move to East Hampton. The Montauketts were mostly illiterate and were made false promises that they could return to Montauk whenever they pleased. They signed an agreement, in exchange for a small amount of money and having their modest dwellings in Indian Field moved to Freetown, in East Hampton.Strong 2001, pp. 110-111. The change troubled other Montauketts living elsewhere. They had not been approached by Dominy, on the theory that they had relinquished any claim to the land by moving away. After meeting as a group, the Montauketts began a series of legal and political efforts to regain Indian Field. These continued through 1924, but were unsuccessful.Strong 2001, pp. 109-140. Construction as a fire control station by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers The Hilda Lindley House was built as a fire control station and completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the spring of 1944. It was one of 10 fire control stations built in Montauk and hundreds erected along the US coastline throughout World War II. The primary purpose of the fire-control system was to look for enemy shipping. If a ship or aircraft were sighted, it was the duty of the soldiers manning the fire-control station to determine coordinates of its position and direction, and relay them to the nearest battery to fire at and destroy the invader.McGovern 2006, pp. 55-56. Some fire control stations, like the Hilda Lindley House and five others built in Montauk during World War II, were disguised to look like cottages, while others were constructed as simple, reinforced dugouts or as towers. One, on Gardiner's Island, northwest of Montauk, was even built to look like a windmill in an attempt to fool German mariners. Fire control stations were manned by members of the Army's Coast Artillery Corps.The Coast Defense Study Group, Like the other fire control stations in Montauk, the Hilda Lindley House was meant to safeguard an important shipping approach to New York and southern New England, including Narragansett Bay. These Army lookouts, containing observation instruments and constructed mainly of reinforced concrete, were built to serve as eyes for the batteries of big guns located at Camp Hero, just west of the Montauk Lighthouse. The fire control stations built during World War II were some of the last of a long line of U.S. coastal defense lookouts dating to the turn of the century, after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the public's mounting fears of invasion gave rise to increased fortification of America's coasts. Technological improvements in fire control that began in the early 20th century made fire-control stations important for improving the accuracy of batteries' guns and seacoast defense through World War II. After World War II, coastal defense strategy shifted to preventing air and missile attacks. With the development and improvement of radar, radar stations assumed the task of spotting potential threats. Other changes in modern warfare, including the invention of cruise missiles and atomic bombs, also made the fire-control system obsolete.McGovern 2006, pp. 12-13; 30-21. The Hilda Lindley House was built by the Army at a cost of about $22,000. The two-story structure, standing on a hill about 87 feet above mean low tide and approximately a half-mile back from the beach, contained two instrument rooms on the ground floor and another instrument room on the second floor, where soldiers used azimuth telescopes to look for enemy shipping on Block Island Sound. The soldiers looked through the fire control station's characteristic mullioned observation slots ‚Äî long, narrow windows with vertical supports. The ground floor also contained a kitchen, mess hall with an 8-by-4-foot mess table, latrine complete with urinals, duckwalk, and showers and barracks equipped with six double-decker bunk beds and a drinking fountain for the soldiers stationed there. Five space heaters, fed with coal, provided heat, and a 5-kilowatt gasoline generator in the basement supplied electric power. A coal-fired hot water heater supplied hot water for the troops. Soldiers climbed to the second floor via iron rungs.War Department, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army (1944) Report of Completed Works, Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound, Shagwong Point, L.I., New York. Fire Control Station; Battalion #216 at Camp Hero, pp. 1-9 The Lindley family As World War II wound to a close, the Army troops withdrew from the Hilda Lindley House. Fire control stations had become obsolete, and the Hilda Lindley House was eventually transferred to the ownership of the Montauk Beach Company, a legacy of Carl Fisher, the real estate speculator and developer who had tried and failed in the 1920s to make Montauk the Miami Beach of the North. His plans had been ruined by hurricanes in Florida and the economic fallout of the Great Depression, leaving him bankrupt and Montauk largely the bucolic backwater and fishing village it had been for many years. Hilda and Francis Lindley offered $5,000 for the house and two acres in 1950, closing on the property in January 1951. The house was in bad shape, and was littered with beer bottles and other trash from vandals and squatters who had broken into it during the five years it stood empty. After purchasing the house, the Lindleys cleaned up the place, adding a couple of bedrooms and a bathroom in unfinished attic space on the second floor and replacing the iron rungs from the first floor to the second with a staircase. The house remained close to its original and distinctive Army design, however, retaining the narrow slot windows, or mullioned observation slots, that had been installed in its three instrument rooms for spotting enemy activity. Today, iron rungs still lead up an interior wall to a crow's nest, once disguised as a fake brick chimney on the roof. The remote house, accessible only by a mile-long dirt road, depended on a generator for intermittent electricity, mainly to run a pump that brought up water from an artesian well designed and built by the Army. The Lindleys used kerosene lamps and candles for light, and propane gas to fuel a stove, refrigerator, and hot water heater. Indoor heating came from several Army space heaters and pot-belly stoves, and later from a fireplace and wood-burning stove. The fight to save Indian Field and the Hilda Lindley House Hilda and Francis Lindley divorced in 1956, but Hilda Lindley continued to occupy the house seasonally, working in New York City to support her three children, Diana, John, and Daniel. The family maintained the house in good repair, and Hilda Lindley added a bigger kitchen and deck to the house in the late 1960s.Hilda Lindley near Shagwong Point, Montauk, New York, 1970 In 1970, Eugene Haas Jr., chairman of the East Hampton Town Zoning Board of Appeals, proposed a plan to build up to 1,800 houses in Indian Field, or nearly two houses per acre. Among other things, he also proposed to cut a new harbor entrance through Little Reed Pond, which connects to the freshwater Big Reed Pond, to join the saltwater Lake Montauk, a busy sport and commercial fishing port, to Block Island Sound near Shagwong Point. The channel would have changed the salinity and biology of Big Reed Pond, later designated a National Natural Landmark after Indian Field was saved from development by Lindley and the CCOM.Porco 2005, p. 21. Using newspaper advertisements, public meetings, and personal appeals, Hilda Lindley rallied friends and neighbors as upset about the development project as she was and formed the CCOM, which was to become the hamlet's leading environmental organization. The group began petitioning officials, from the federal government down through the state and local levels, to buy the land to preserve its open space, natural and cultural history, and, not least on a crowded island, the clean groundwater in the aquifer the undeveloped land helped protect. The U.S. government and the State of New York turned down Lindley and the CCOM, refusing to purchase Indian Field. But in 1971, Suffolk County Executive John V.N. Klein approved a county purchase of Indian Field for parkland. Montauk-County-Park-Nature-trail2017 The acquisition did not take place immediately, however. It was complicated by political maneuvering and by allegations of profiteering on the part of landowners on the perimeter of the proposed parkland, and by inflated appraisals of some private holdings slated for public purchase. It was not until November 1973 that the legislature and County Executive Klein approved final purchase of some 900 acres of parkland in Indian Field. The place was named Indian Field County Park. Later the name was changed to Montauk County Park and later still to Theodore Roosevelt County Park. Although Hilda Lindley successfully spearheaded the effort to save Indian Field, she was ordered by Suffolk County to give up her house, under the threat of eminent domain. The demand that Lindley vacate the Hilda Lindley House was made by the Suffolk County Legislature, under the leadership of R. Thomas Strong, an East Hampton Republican and head of the legislature's parks committee, despite the opposition of County Executive (also a Republican) Klein and his suggestion that the Lindley House might be left out of the county acquisition. The county had no policy in place for eminent domain in such takings, and the parks committee, led by Strong, made her the first victim of a new policy, which was to seize land unconditionally. In fact, the taking of Lindley's house was viewed by many as a political act of revenge, because her successful effort to save Indian Field had challenged the local power structure and deprived developers and developer-friendly politicians of a chance to make a large amount of money developing Indian Field.Porco 2005, p. 32. Hilda Lindley continued to fight her eviction from her house, using lawyers and the press to wage a war of words and negotiating with Suffolk County representatives. She received support from, among others, Charles A. Lindbergh, the celebrated aviator, and William F. Buckley, the conservative columnist, who wrote an essay for Long Island's biggest newspaper, Newsday, from a libertarian standpoint berating the county for its behavior.Porco 2005, p. 37. Negotiations dragged on, with agreements seemingly close and then falling apart. One of Lindley's lawyers, Hal Lary, pushed for a 99-year lease, saying such a term was typical in similar situations in other parkland purchases in other places. At other times, talks appeared ready to collapse completely, with the county threatening to evict Lindley summarily from her house. Finally, in February 1976, an agreement was reached, in which Lindley and her family retained the right to stay in their house for 35 years, at the end of which it was to be handed over to county government without compensation.Porco 2005, p. 35. Hilda Lindley, who had remarried and taken the name of Hilda Lindley-Waller, died of breast cancer in December 1980. Her family continued to live in the house in Indian Field, maintaining it and occasionally aiding lost hikers, bikers, and horse riders who sometimes became disoriented in the county park's dense underbrush, swampy thickets, and winding trails. In August 2010, Joseph Montuori, Suffolk County Parks Commissioner under Steve Levy, a Republican, wrote a letter to the Lindleys ordering them to leave the house by February 2011. Suffolk County employees subsequently changed the lock on the gate leading to the house, preventing the Lindley family access to the Hilda Lindley House. Recent developments The East Hampton Press, calling the Lindleys ‚Äúgood stewards,‚Äù proposed in an editorial in September 2010 that Suffolk County negotiate a lease with the Lindleys for 10 more years of their residency in the Hilda Lindley House. Later, Suffolk County Legislator Jay Schneiderman of Montauk proposed that the house be officially named the Hilda Lindley House, and the Suffolk County Legislature passed his bill in December 2010. In February 2011, the Montauk Citizens Advisory Committee unanimously passed a resolution asking the county to keep the Lindleys in the Hilda Lindley House.Hilda Lindley House, October 2015 The Suffolk County parks department, however, under the leadership of Greg Dawson, a Republican appointed by County Executive Bellone, a Democrat who had succeeded County Executive Levy, continued to let the house deteriorate. In February 2014, County Legislator Schneiderman introduced legislation in the Suffolk legislature ordering the county parks department ‚Äúto develop a plan for the care and use‚Äù of the Hilda Lindley House. The legislature passed the bill, and County Executive Bellone signed it into law. As of February 2015, however, the Lindley family's offer to renew the lease, maintain the house in a caretaker capacity, or reach some other agreement with Suffolk County to ensure preservation of this historic structure had not been accepted. The house remained alone and uncared for, paint peeling off its walls and weeds growing in its yard. Vandalism and break-ins had occurred, and windows had been broken, but Suffolk County officials and employees had done little or nothing to repair the damage, protect the house, or come up with a plan for saving it, despite pleas from the Lindleys and the Montauk community. Parks Commissioner Dawson told the East Hampton Star he didn't know when his department would come up with a plan for the house. =See Also= Poggatacut (sachem)  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography   External links  * Coast Defense Study Group fire control page * Coast Defense Study Group Coast Artillery Corps units page * YouTube video of a fire control station in action * Bygone Long Island Web site featuring the Hilda Lindley House * Information on Camp Hero and World War II defenses at Montauk, New York Category:Houses in Suffolk County, New York Category:Military facilities in New York (state) Category:Parks in Suffolk County, New York Category:East Hampton (town), New York Category:Environment of New York (state) Category:History of women in New York (state) ","title":"Hilda Lindley House"},{"id":"33043071","text":"The Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803 (43 Geo 3 c 139) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Vietnam is known as the world's largest cashew nut exporter with 24.5 percent share of the global cashew market. It was reported that Vietnam earned US$232 million from exporting 45,000 tons of cashew nuts in the first four months of 2010.  Problems and Impacts Under the authority of the police force and local officials, drug users are usually detained for two years. ‚ÄúPost-rehabilitation management‚Äù would take place for additional two or three years after the completion of the two years of detention. This practice is carried out in the absence of judicial oversight. From the interview conducted by the HRW, it was observed that from the 34 interviewees, who were recently detained in 14 of 16 centers, administered by the Ho Chi Minh City authorities, none received legal consultation from a lawyer, or has appeared in court before or during their detention. In short, there was a miscarriage of justice and an abuse of human rights. Based on statistics, there were close to 40,000 people with the majority being young men. They were detained at the country's 123 drug rehabilitation centers and made to carry out ‚Äúlabour therapy‚Äù, which involves sewing garments, making bricks or processing cashews. Those who refused to obey the orders of the officers will be beaten with batons, given electric shocks, locked in isolation, deprived of food and water, and obliged to work even longer hours. In return for their labor, these detainees are only paid merely a few dollars a month; some were even made to pay for their food and lodging, demonstrating an exploitation of labour. Besides having to work under such harsh conditions, the processing of cashew nuts also poses threats to the detainees‚Äô health. This is because the cashew oil is caustic and burns the skin; dust from the skin also causes cough and other health conditions. This labour therapy serves little or almost zero therapeutic effects to the detainees.  Current Efforts  The Vietnam Cashew Association was established in the 1990s, with the objectives to oversee and regulate the cashew nuts industry. With their mission targeted to develop a sustainable cashew industry as well as to promote socioeconomic development for the country. However, little efforts are being put in to oversee and regulate the supply chain line of the cashew manufacturers. As the detainees are not aware of the rights they deserve, it puts them at a disadvantage in the current situation. To monitor and protect the rights of these detainees, cashew importers are called on to ensure their supply chains are not tainted with forced labour and abuse. Cashew importers need to closely scrutinize the source of supply of the cashew nut products.

It extends posteriorly from the roof of the fourth ventricle to dorsal neuroepithelial cells. The rhombic lip can be divided into eight structural units based on rhombomeres 1-8 (r1-r8), which can be recognized at early stages of hindbrain development. Producing granule cells and five brainstem nuclei, the rhombic lip plays an important role in developing a complex cerebellar neural system. Rhombic lips History Through studies of human embryos performed in the late 1890s, Swiss anatomist Wilhelm His identified a portion of hindbrain neuroepithelium that was distinct from the rest of the hindbrain neuroepithelium in its morphology, sustained chromosomal division into late stages of embryogenesis, and deployment of streams of neurons through the hindbrain periphery. His named this zone \\"rautenlippe,\\" or rhombic lip, because it seemed to emanate from the rhomboid-shaped opening of the fourth ventricle, much like the shape of a mouth. His proposed that the rhombic lip held the precerebellar precursors that would migrate ventrally to populate the pontine and olivary nuclei, but the methodologies available at the time limited the amount of evidence he could gather. The first real evidence that precerebellar neurons had a dorsal origin was obtained in the 1990s through the use of chick-quail chimeras, a technique in which portions of quail hindbrain neuroepithelium are grafted into chick embryos in ovo. Tracking the ventral migration of the quail daughter cells confirmed His' theory. Development =Origin of cerebellar territory= ::The cerebellum, or \\"little brain,\\" is a portion of the brain attached to the brainstem at the pons. Among other functions, it is important for balance, coordinating movement, and maintaining muscle tone. The outer layer of the cerebellum, the cortex, is made up of three layers containing two classes of neurons. One of these classes has been identified as granule cells, which are produced by the rhombic lip. :: Genes FGF8 and EN1 play an important role in patterning the midbrain and hindbrain regions. In particular, studies have shown that different dosages of FGF8 appear to specify the tectum or cerebellum: regions exposed to strong dosages of FGF8 acquire cerebellar characteristics while regions exposed to weak dosages become the tectum. =Cellular contribution of the rhombic lip= :: Neural specification in the cerebellum begins as a symmetric bulge in the fourth ventricle. Around embryonic days nine to eleven, cells arise from two areas: the rhombic lip and the ventricular zone. The rhombic lip produces glutamatergic granule neurons (which evolve from r1) and the five brainstem nuclei (thought to evolve from r6-r8). One brainstem nuceleus, the inferior olivary nucleus, projects climbing fibers to innervate Purkinje cells. The other four nuclei (the external cuneate nucleus, the lateral reticular nucleus, the pontine nucleus, and the thalamic reticular nucleus) project mossy fibers to innervate granule neurons. Meanwhile, cells in the ventricular zone evolve into GABAergic Purkinje cells (another type of cerebellar neuron) and deep cerebellar nuclei. =Rhombic lip development= ::Located between the fourth ventricle and the roofplate, the rhombic lip extends from r1-r8 and can be divided into upper, or cerebellar, and lower, or hindbrain, portions as the brainstem bends during later development. Expression of Math1, a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix structure, governs the germinal epithelium of the rhombic lip and is expressed in midbrain and hindbrain regions as early as embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). Math 1-null mice have been shown to lack several rhombic lip derivatives, including the granule neurons of the cerebellum and the pontine nucleus of the precerebellar system. The rhombic lip is organized according to a temporal fate map in which Math1-expressing precursors that first emigrate from the germinative layer (prior to E12.5) become deep nuclear neurons, while those exiting later (E13) become granule cells. Chick-quail chimera experiments have shown that r1 is the most likely source of granule cell precursors. Inside the rhombic lip, granule cell precursors divide and develop a unipolar morphology, with a single process that projects toward their destination. ::As development continues, the granule precursor cells that originated in the RL generate the external granule layer (EGL). This movement takes place between E15 and P15 (Embryonic stage 15 and Postnatal stage 15). The EGL is a secondary germinative epithelium that encompasses the entire cerebellum. This period is an important developmental stage of the cerebellum. The expansion of the EGL precursor cells creates a large population of neurons that outnumber Purkinje cells 250:1 in the adult cerebellar cortex. The granule neurons in EGL express genes that play a specific and crucial role in cell proliferation. These genes are called Math1, RU49/Zipro1 and Zic1. As previously mentioned, Math1 is expressed early in the development of the RL. Knock-out experiments involving RU49/Zipro1 lead to very little change in brain structure, but over-expression of these genes leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of granule cells and in the proliferation of the outer EGL. This result suggests that the RU49/Zipro1 gene plays a sufficient role in cell proliferation. ::Around P15, granule cell proliferation requires interaction with Purkinje cells, a type of cerebellar neuron characterized by a large and branching dendritic arbor. These cells release sonic hedgehog (Shh); which is a protein that controls the further proliferation of granule cell precursors. This means that around stage P15 the proliferation of granule cell precursors is controlled by genes that it transcribes (RU49/Zipro1) as well as the products of connecting cells (Shh). ::Once the EGL is fully formed, granule cell precursors migrate inward, forming a layer called the inner granule layer. Just prior to migration, the cells go through a series of electrophysiological changes. It is believed that NMDA receptors are activated to prepare the cell for further migration. The activation of these NMDA receptors causes the depolarization of the cells. In order to balance out this depolarization, the channel GIRK2 is activated. It is involved in hyperpolarizing the cell after the NMDA receptors depolarize the cell. While these changes are happening, the cells are also guided to this new layer by radial glial cells. Once they are in the IGL they stop dividing and no longer express the Math1 gene. :: The final stage of granule cell maturation occurs in the IGL. The granule cells express a different set of mature receptors at this stage including, GC5 and GABA receptors. New cells also make contact with the granule cells. Mossy fibers, which are mostly found in the precerebellar nuclei, make contact with granule cells in the IGL. Granule neurons also extend out to make contacts with Golgi cells.

Cockbain was a right handed batsman who bowled slow left arm orthodox. He was born in Bootle, Lancashire. Cockbain made his first-class d√©but for Lancashire against Leicestershire towards the end of the 1979 County Championship. In his second match the following season against eventual champions Middlesex at Lord's Cricket Ground, he batted admirably against a quality bowling attack to help Lancashire secure a draw, scoring 69 in the process. Sadly, Cockbain did not fulfill this initial promise, making only 45 further first-class appearances for Lancashire, the last of which came against Glamorgan in the 1983 County Championship. In his 46 first-class matches, he scored 1,456 runs at an average of 21.10, with a high score of 98. This score, which was one of seven first-class fifties he made, came against Warwickshire in 1982. He made his List A debut against Middlesex in the 1980 John Player League. Cockbain would go on to make 26 further appearances in that format for the county, the last of which came against Hampshire in the 1983 John Player Special League. In his 27 List A matches for the county, he scored 313 runs at an average of 16.47, with a high score of 53not out. He left Lancashire at the end of the 1983 season. He joined Cheshire for the 1984 season, making his d√©but against Cumberland in the MCCA Knockout Trophy. He played Minor counties cricket for Cheshire from 1984 to 2001, making 146 Minor Counties Championship appearances and 47 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances. He made his first List A appearance for Cheshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy against Yorkshire. Cockbain made sixteen further List A appearances for the county, the last of which came against Cornwall in the 2nd round of the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy which was played in 2001. He captained Cheshire from 1991 to 2001. In his seventeen List A matches for Cheshire, he scored 296 runs at an average of 17.41, with a high score of 65. While playing for Cheshire, he also made List A appearances for the Minor Counties, making his d√©but for the team in the 1993 Benson & Hedges Cup against Durham. He made thirteen further List A appearances for the Minor Counties, the last of which came against Yorkshire in the 1997 Benson & Hedges Cup. In his fourteen appearances for the team, he scored 278 runs at an average of 25.27, with a high score of 65 not out. For over thirty years, Cockbain played his club cricket at Bootle CC in the Liverpool Competition before retiring at the end of the 2008 at the age of 50. It was during the winter of 2012-2013 that a friend suggested to him that he came out of retirement and join his club Formby, where Cockbain now lives, with a view to captaining the side in 2014 and, with his vast experience, hopefully take them from the First Division into the ECB Premier League for 2015, the year of the club's 150th anniversary. On the last day of the 2014 season, Formby were proclaimed champions, winning the division by twenty points and thus fulfilling the club's dream for 2015. Cockbain's son, also called Ian, plays county cricket for Gloucestershire. Cockbain was also a useful semi-professional footballer, making a handful of appearances for South Liverpool in the Northern Premier League in 1982-83, having been a regular scorer for the reserves.

Its development began in 2008. The multi-use area will host the BBC drama village, with plans to link this to a new digital centre. The work will cover a large brownfield area. Background The venture was formed in 2005 between urban regeneration firm igloo and the Welsh Government. The venture is responsible for developing 38 acres of land on the south side of Roath Basin in Cardiff Bay as an environmentally sustainable mixed use development including commercial, retail and residential space. The developer advertises Porth Teigr as one of the most significant waterfront developments in the UK and will transform the last major derelict site in the inner harbour area to create more than 1 million sq. ft. of commercial development space and over 1,000 new homes.igloo Porth Teigr, Cardiff The development was granted permission to go ahead in 2008, to become the centre point for creative industries in Wales. It was officially named Porth Teigr in November 2010, in homage to the famous Cardiff docklands area of Tiger Bay. Developments It is anticipated that the redeveloped site will ultimately provide opportunities for some 4,000 jobs. The redevelopment was anticipated to include some 200,000 sq.ft of leisure and retail space as well as a range of housing, including affordable units claimed to be amongst the first in the UK designed to give flexibility of spaces to enable adaptation for lifestyle changes. Two dry docks will be flooded to help give the site more than 1.6 miles of waterfront, much with views across Cardiff Bay. =BBC production studios= BBC Roath Lock studios The centrepiece of the development is the new 170,000 sq foot drama production studio complex for the BBC at Roath Lock. Extensive infrastructure and public realm works including a new bridge linking the site to the remainder of the inner harbour were completed enabling access to the new BBC Roath Lock Studios. The studios were officially opened on 12 March 2012 and will be the home to several productions, including Doctor Who, Casualty, Pobol y Cwm and Upstairs Downstairs. Casualty started filming on site in September 2011. =Digital Media Centre= Plans were approved for the new Digital Media Centre (DMC) at Porth Teigr in April 2011, with a design reflecting the dock area's history using brick and timber. It was due to commence on site in November 2011 and be ready for occupation towards the end of 2012. The 40,000 sq ft building was to provide opportunities for small, high growth businesses and freelancers. The Digital Media Centre aimed to support the Creative Industries sector in Wales with the capacity to accommodate 400 people. =Doctor Who Centre= Doctor Who Experience during construction A 3000 sq metre building was constructed in Porth Teigr as the long-term home of the Doctor Who Experience when it relocated from London's Olympia to Cardiff in 2012. BBC Worldwide had announced in September 2010 that it intended to relocate the attraction in Cardiff during 2012, the city of its filming and production, following consolidation of its previous Doctor Who exhibitions, including the closure of the former Doctor Who Exhibition in Cardiff's Red Dragon Centre in March 2011.BBC Press Office Doctor's TARDIS expected to land at Porth Teigr The Doctor Who Experience closed in September 2017 after its 5-year lease had expired. =Housing= The developers intended Porth Teigr to be a mixed development, hoping to avoid creating an area that was desolate at certain times of day.

She worked as a character actor in over 200 Hindi films for five decades, and is best remembered for playing stock characters such as aunts (Chachi or Mausi). She is best known for her role of \\"mausi\\" in the blockbuster Sholay (1975), Dil Se Mile Dil (1978), Baton Baton Mein (1979), Rajesh Khanna films such as Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Aanchal, Mehbooba, Amar Prem and Rajshri Productions hits such as Geet Gaata Chal (1975), Nadiya Ke Paar (1982) and Abodh (1984). Retrieved 10 September 2011. Retrieved 10 September 2011. Her career's best performance was in Naani Maa in 1981, for which she received Best Actress award at the age of 73. Personal life Leela Mishra was married to Ram Prasad Mishra, who was a character artist, then working in silent films. She got married at the very young age of 12. By the time she was 17, she had two daughters. She hailed from Jais, Raebareli, and she and her husband were from zamindar (landowners) families. Career Leela Mishra was discovered by a man called Mama Shinde, who was working for Dadasaheb Phalke's Nasik Cinetone. He persuaded her husband to make her work in films. During those days there was a severe scarcity of women actors in films; this was evident in the paychecks that the Mishras received when they went to Nasik for the shooting. While Ram Prasad Mishra was hired on a salary of Rs. 150 per month, Leela Mishra was offered Rs. 500 per month. However, as they fared poorly in front of the camera, their contracts were cancelled. The next opportunity that came their way was an offer to work in the movie Bhikarin, which was being produced by a company owned by the Maharaja of Kolhapur. However, Leela Mishra lost out on this opportunity too, as the role required her to put her arms round the actor (who was not her husband) while delivering a dialogue, which she point-blank refused to do. She faced a similar problem while working in another film titled Honhaar. She was cast opposite Shahu Modak as a heroine, and was supposed to hug and embrace him, which she again refused steadfastly. Since the company was legally in a weak position, they couldn't turn her out of the film, which proved to be a blessing in disguise for her. She was offered Modak's mother's role in the film and it clicked instantly. This opened the doors for her to play mother roles at the young age of 18. Notable works Early on in her career she acted in notable films such as the musical hit Anmol Ghadi (1946), Raj Kapoor's Awaara (1951) and Nargis-Balraj Sahni starrer Lajwanti (1958), which was nominated for the Palme d'Or for Best Film at 1959 Cannes Film Festival. She acted in the first Bhojpuri film, Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo (1962), which also starred Kumkum, Helen and Nazir Hussain. Her roles varied from mothers, benign or evil aunts, to comic roles.

It is a redundant Anglican parish church in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The earliest parts of the church date from the 12th century, but only fragments of this remain, namely the chancel arch, and a portion of a Norman door in the north wall. Most of the church was rebuilt between 1847 and 1851, the architect being the \\"priest-architect\\" Fr William Grey. The church was declared redundant on 1 February 2010, and was vested in the Friends of Friendless Churches in the following year. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in flint and limestone with limestone dressings. The roof is tiled. Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel, and a south porch that rises into a tower. The tower is in two stages with angle buttresses and a pyramidal tiled roof. In the upper stage are two-light bell openings, and at the summit is a crenellated parapet with gargoyles. The nave has doors on the north and south sides, the north door containing the Norman fragments. Along the sides of the nave are two- and three-light square-headed windows. In the chancel are two re-set lancet windows dating from the late 12th or early 13th century, and a three-light east window. =Interior= Inside the church, the wall of the nave is rendered and colour-washed; it has a 19th-century wagon roof. The interior of the chancel has stencil and freehand decoration executed in 1876 by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. This is in memory of Revd Fulwar William Fowle, rector of the church for over 60 years. The chancel is floored with encaustic tiles. It contains a sedilia and a piscina. The stained glass in the east window is also by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and depicts the Crucifixion. The font dates from the 19th century, and is in the style of the 12th century. It has a pyramidal pierced cover dating from the 17th century. The pulpit is in oak, and dates from the 19th century. There are two pews dating from the 16th-17th century, and later pews designed to match them. In the porch is an oak churchwardens' coffer from the 16th-17th century with three locks, and a stool dating from the 17th century. External features In the churchyard are two structures that have also been listed at Grade II. One of these is a pair of limestone coffin tombs dating from the 18th century. One of these is inscribed with the date 1728; the date on the other is illegible. The other consists of two chest tombs dating from the early 19th century. Austen connection A forerunner of Revd Fulwar William Fowle was Revd Thomas Fowle, vicar between 1793 and 1797, who was engaged to Cassandra Austen, sister of Jane, but who died before he could marry her. Fowle died of yellow fever in the West Indies trying to raise sufficient funds for their marriage.
