When viewing the socket from the front, the assignment is: PE = centre N = top left R (L1) = bottom left S (L2) = top right T (L3) = bottom right 16 A Perilex socket 16 A Perilex plugPerilex is the tradename for an approved indoor three-phase electric power connector system used in Germany (West Germany), the Netherlands and Sweden. It has mostly been superseded by the IEC 60309 system used throughout Europe. There are two variants, a more common 16-ampere version and a rarely used, 25-ampere version. The connectors are equipped with protective earth (PE), a neutral conductor (N) and three phase conductors (L1, L2, L3; formerly: R, S, T). As the German industrial norm VDE 0100 prescribed the phase sequence for all types of three-phase connectors in a way incompatible with the original Perilex pinout, the R and T connectors may have been swapped. The PE connector is protruding and will therefore mate first. In order to distinguish the variants, the 16-ampere version has a horizontal PE connector, whereas it is vertical in the 25-ampere variant. In Germany, Perilex connectors have been standardised by DIN. The 16-ampere version is DIN 49445 (socket) and DIN 49446 (plug) and the 25-ampere version is DIN 49447 (socket) and DIN 49448 (plug). It did replace an earlier flat 4-pin connector (3 phases and neutral) that was standardized in DIN 49450 / DIN 49451.Bild metallener Stecker nach DIN 49450 / DIN 49451 Usage of the Perilex connectors is usually confined to small businesses (e.g. bakeries, restaurants), medical facilities (hospitals, laboratories) and homes, where it has the advantage of a smaller form factor and better cleanability. However, at construction sites and industrial facilities, the IEC connectors are preferred due to their better robustness and due to being approved for medium-term outdoor use. Furthermore, it is unwise to connect three-phase electrical motors to Perilex sockets due to the afore-mentioned ambiguity regarding the phase sequence. Since 1 January 1975, the use of the Perilex system has been outlawed in Germany for new industrial installations but continues to be legal in homes, hospitals and small businesses. However, even there, it is being superseded by the IEC 60309 system used throughout Europe. A similar (but not physically identical) plug exists in Switzerland as SEV 1011 type 15 (round pins) and type 25 (rectangular pins). In France, instead of Perilex, NF C 61-315 was used. NF C 61-315 provides single & multiple phases for rating up to 32 Amperes. Several plug & socket profiles exist to match the phases number and the various rating. But NF C 61-315 is being replaced by IEC 60309 for outdoor use or direct attach for home use (mainly oven's plug).

Other than traditional analogue public address systems Varizone has next to the analogue 70/100 volt speaker system solution also a fully digital solution that transmits the audio digitally to the speaker, where it is amplified by small, distributed programmable amplifier modules. This allows to combine voice evacuation system features with digital public address, intercom, and background music functionality by adjusting the volume for each speaker individually depending on the application.  Technology  A completely digital bus structure distributes uncompressed digital audio data without any audible latency from one or many play-out stations to an unlimited number of locally amplified loudspeakers using either CAT5 or J-Y(ST)Y wires. The same bus supplies all active bus components with electrical power (e.g. powered amplifier modules (I-PAM), push button modules and noise sensing modules) and makes the need for additional external power supplies redundant.  Digital audio buses  The VARIZONE network uses a digital speaker system (DSS) bus format to transmit data and power at 48 volts over the same wires from a central play-out station to the loudspeakers. The DSS bus combines central network structures with a bus architecture, saving on cabling and wiring time and eliminating the need for additional hubs and routers even for the largest networks. A DSS bus can effectively run unlimited distances. The bus format is guaranteed to transmit 8 channels of audio with 16-bit resolution at 48 kHz up to 200 m (660 ft) without the need to refresh data in addition to bi-directional control and surveillance data. The OCTO-BUS architecture transmits audio as well as bi-directional control data between a central control station and remotely located converter modules and control modules. The OCTO-BUS can be configured with either 8 channels per direction with 16-bit resolution per audio channel at 48 kHz of sampling rate or for 4 channels with 24 bit resolution per audio channel at 48 kHz. In applications where studio quality is required 24 bit resolution is recommended, whereas in all other PA applications the 16-bit resolution still offers CD-quality audio.  Programmable amplifier modules  On the digital bus line, programmable amplifier modules are distributed to provide amplification for connected loudspeakers. The modules are digital Class-D amplifiers with extremely low heat dissipation. Their rugged design allows above-ceiling mounting in close proximity to loudspeaker locations. The programmable amplifier modules receive the necessary power to drive loudspeakers from the same cable that transmits the audio data and do not require any additional local power supply.

A member of the Cambodian royal family, he disappeared during the political purges carried out by the Communist Party of Cambodia (the Khmer Rouge) after it came to power. Education and early political career Phurissara was a descendant of Norodom of Cambodia, and a cousin of King Norodom Sihanouk. He studied law at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. In 1954, he became Secretary-General of the Democratic Party, which until that point had been the dominant force in Cambodian internal politics. Phurissara and a group of Paris-educated radicals steered the party increasingly to the left. The American embassy reported that he considered American military assistance to the fledgling Cambodia state as \\"unnatural\\" and was increasingly accepting \\"basic pro-Communist ideas\\".Clymer, K. J. The United States and Cambodia, 1870-1969, Routledge, 2004, p.49 The Democrats, however, were to lose the 1955 elections to Sihanouk's Sangkum movement; the party later dissolved itself, allegedly under pressure from the Sangkum security apparatus. Phurissara went on to join the Sangkum and serve as the Cambodian Foreign Minister during the later 1960s, in a period when Sihanouk was strengthening ties with China and other communist nations. The GRUNK After Sihanouk was deposed by his Prime Minister, General Lon Nol, in the Cambodian coup of 1970, he set up a government-in-exile, the GRUNK, incorporating his former communist opponents, the Khmer Rouge. Phurissara was to 'defect' to the communist 'liberated zone', and joined the GRUNK, later being appointed Minister of Justice from 1973, though he was to complain that the communists did not allow him any genuine power. In early 1976, after the Khmer Rouge victory in the civil war, Sihanouk returned as Head of State, but was shortly to tender his resignation to the communists. They dispatched Phurissara, along with Ieng Sary, to persuade him to change his mind, but Sihanouk refused:Dommen, A. The Indochinese Experience of the French and the Americans, IUP, p.967 the Khmer Rouge cadres Khieu Samphan and Saloth Sar, the latter now using the name Pol Pot, took over leadership as Head of State and Prime Minister. Phurissara was to continue in his role with the GRUNK for some months, but was soon removed in a purge of former Sihanoukists and more liberal Khmer Rouge cadres. He was initially sent to the Boeng Trabek re- education camp near Phnom Penh, but later disappeared and is assumed to have been executed. According to family members physically present at the time, sometime in April 1978 (exact date can not be ascertained) a Khmer Rouge military truck arrived at the location where Prince Phurissara had been assigned to live. The Khmer Rouge took Prince Phurissara and his wife into the truck and drove away. They were never seen again. It is widely believed they were taken to the area (Odom) where other royal family members were believed executed (murdered). Sihanouk was later to express a fear that Phurissara, who he supposed to have been brutally tortured and killed, along with other members of his family, had been targeted specifically due to Sihanouk's refusal to continue as Head of State.

The regiment traces their origins to 1797, when they were raised as the 2nd Battalion, 5th (Travancore) Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. The regiments first saw action during the Mysore wars being involved on the Third Anglo-Mysore War and the Battle of Seedaseer and the Battle of Seringapatam in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. They were then used in the punitive expedition in the Beni Boo Ali campaign in 1821, against the pirates in Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The regiment was involved in the Siege of Kahun next during the First Afghan War. The annexation of the Punjab was next during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Their next action was in China in the Second Opium War. They returned to Afghanistan again to participate in the Second Afghan War, their last conflict in the 19th century was the annexation of Burma in the Second Burmese War. In World War I the regiment was attached to the 6th (Poona) Division in the Mesopotamian campaign. After a string of earlier successes, the 6th Division was delivered a setback at the Battle of Ctesiphon and forced to withdrew back to Kut. The Siege of Kut began and after a lengthy siege surrendered in April 1916.See Gardner, Nikolas. 2004 'Sepoys and the Siege of Kut-Al-Amara, December 1915-April 1916', War in History (journal) 11(3), pp. 307-326 After World War I the Indian government reformed the army moving from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 In 1922, the 110th Mahratta Light Infantry became the 3rd Battalion 5th Mahratta Light Infantry.

Planning gains seek to capture some of the uplift in land value which is generated by the granting of planning permission, and can be used to ensure that commercially-viable development is not socially or environmentally unsustainable. They are used to fund the provision of public goods, including affordable housing, community infrastructure (such as libraries or parks), or environmental safeguards. In England and Wales, such arrangements are negotiated between the developer and the local planning authority (LPA), and take place under the terms of Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In Scotland the equivalent is a Section 75 planning obligation (Section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997). The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) In addition to negotiations which take place under Section 106, in 2010 the UK Government introduced a new standard method for securing generalised contributions from developers in England and Wales, known as the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Government announced the proposals in October 2008 and legislated for CIL in the 2008 Planning Act. CIL came into force in England and Wales on 6 April 2010. On 2010 the UK Coalition Government proposed a number of reforms to CIL. The reforms included a number of selected changes to the primary legislation implementing CIL (the Planning Act 2008) through the vehicle of the Localism Bill, introduced into the UK Parliament in December 2010. The key changes proposed relate to a requirement to be placed on CIL charging authorities to pass money to other bodies (the stated policy intention being to pass money to neighbourhood groups), a clarification of the purposes to which monies raised may be put, and a reduction in the powers of the independent person appointed by the charging authority to advise on whether the proposed charges are appropriate. The Bill received Royal Assent as the Localism Act in November 2011. A number of the smaller changes proposed by the new Government were implemented in a set of amending Regulations brought into force in April 2011. Consultation on the detail of the more significant proposals followed once the Localism Act had been passed and a further set of amending Regulations completed the changes. Newark and Sherwood District Council, which was the first in England to publish a preliminary draft charging schedule, in November 2010. Others followed, and in late 2011 LB Southwark prepared a CIL known as the Elephant and Castle Section 106 Tariff https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1936/Elephant-and-Castle- Section-106-viability-report-2011.pdf. On 1 January 2012 the London Borough of Redbridge became the first local authority to bring CIL into legal force in its area. The most significant use of the policy is the ability of the Mayor of London to charge CIL across the whole of London. The Mayor's CIL is specifically intended to assist in the funding of the Crossrail project. Reception The Community Infrastructure Levy is not universally popular. For example, Richard Benyon MP for Newbury has expressed concern that it will raise less money for West Berkshire Council than the existing regime. The Association for Consultancy and Engineering produced an analysis of Community Infrastructure Levy in October 2018 which found that ¬£443 million of CIL is currently unspent by councils in England and Wales. Their report called for CIL to be replaced with a property sales levy in the medium to long term.

New locally decodable codes and private information retrieval schemes, Technical Report ECCC TR06-127, 2006. This property could be useful, say, in a context where information is being transmitted over a noisy channel, and only a small subset of the data is required at a particular time and there is no need to decode the entire message at once. Note that locally decodable codes are not a subset of locally testable codes, though there is some overlap between the two. Codewords are generated from the original message using an algorithm that introduces a certain amount of redundancy into the codeword; thus, the codeword is always longer than the original message. This redundancy is distributed across the codeword and allows the original message to be recovered with good probability even in the presence of errors. The more redundant the codeword, the more resilient it is against errors, and the fewer queries required to recover a bit of the original message.  Overview  More formally, a (q, \\\\delta, \\\\epsilon)-locally decodable code encodes an n-bit message x to an N-bit codeword C(x) such that any bit x_i of the message can be recovered with probability 1 - \\\\epsilon by using a randomized decoding algorithm that queries only q bits of the codeword C(x), even if up to \\\\delta N locations of the codeword have been corrupted. Furthermore, a perfectly smooth local decoder is a decoder such that, in addition to always generating the correct output given access to an uncorrupted codeword, for every j \\\\in [q] and i \\\\in [n] the j^{th} query to recover the i^{th} bit is uniform over [N]. (The notation [y] denotes the set {1,\\\\ldots, y}). Informally, this means that the set of queries required to decode any given bit are uniformly distributed over the codeword. Local list decoders are another interesting subset of local decoders. List decoding is useful when a codeword is corrupted in more than \\\\delta/2 places, where \\\\delta is the minimum Hamming distance between two codewords. In this case, it is no longer possible to identify exactly which original message has been encoded, since there could be multiple codewords within \\\\delta distance of the corrupted codeword. However, given a radius \\\\epsilon, it is possible to identify the set of messages that encode to codewords that are within \\\\epsilon of the corrupted codeword. An upper bound on the size of the set of messages can be determined by \\\\delta and \\\\epsilon. Locally decodable codes can also be concatenated, where a message is encoded first using one scheme, and the resulting codeword is encoded again using a different scheme. (Note that, in this context, concatenation is the term used by scholars to refer to what is usually called composition; see ). This might be useful if, for example, the first code has some desirable properties with respect to rate, but it has some undesirable property, such as producing a codeword over a non-binary alphabet. The second code can then transform the result of the first encoding over a non-binary alphabet to a binary alphabet. The final encoding is still locally decodable, and requires additional steps to decode both layers of encoding.  Length of codeword and query complexity  The rate of a code refers to the ratio between its message length and codeword length: \\\\frac{x}{C(x)}, and the number of queries required to recover 1 bit of the message is called the query complexity of a code. The rate of a code is inversely related to the query complexity, but the exact shape of this tradeoff is a major open problem. It is known that there are no LDCs that query the codeword in only one position, and that the optimal codeword size for query complexity 2 is exponential in the size of the original message. However, there are no known tight lower bounds for codes with query complexity greater than 2. Approaching the tradeoff from the side of codeword length, the only known codes with codeword length proportional to message length have query complexity k^\\\\epsilon for \\\\epsilon > 0 There are also codes in between, that have codewords polynomial in the size of the original message and polylogarithmic query complexity.  Applications  Locally decodable codes have applications to data transmission and storage, complexity theory, data structures, derandomization, theory of fault tolerant computation, and private information retrieval schemes.  Data transmission and storage  Locally decodable codes are especially useful for data transmission over noisy channels. The Hadamard code (a special case of Reed Muller codes) was used in 1971 by Mariner 9 to transmit pictures of Mars back to Earth. It was chosen over a 5-repeat code (where each bit is repeated 5 times) because, for roughly the same number of bits transmitted per pixel, it had a higher capacity for error correction. (The Hadamard code falls under the general umbrella of forward error correction, and just happens to be locally decodable; the actual algorithm used to decode the transmission from Mars was a generic error-correction scheme.) LDCs are also useful for data storage, where the medium may become partially corrupted over time, or the reading device is subject to errors. In both cases, an LDC will allow for the recovery of information despite errors, provided that there are relatively few. In addition, LDCs do not require that the entire original message be decoded; a user can decode a specific portion of the original message without needing to decode the entire thing.  Complexity theory  One of the applications of locally decodable codes in complexity theory is hardness amplification. Using LDCs with polynomial codeword length and polylogarithmic query complexity, one can take a function L: {0,1}^n \\\\rightarrow {0,1} that is hard to solve on worst case inputs and design a function L': {0,1}^N \\\\rightarrow {0,1} that is hard to compute on average case inputs. Consider L limited to only length t inputs. Then we can see L as a binary string of length 2^t, where each bit is L(x) for each x \\\\in { 0, 1}^t. We can use a polynomial length locally decodable code C with polylogarithmic query complexity that tolerates some constant fraction of errors to encode the string that represents L to create a new string of length 2^{O(t)} = 2^{t'}. We think of this new string as defining a new problem L' on length t' inputs. If L' is easy to solve on average, that is, we can solve L' correctly on a large fraction 1 - \\\\epsilon of inputs, then by the properties of the LDC used to encode it, we can use L' to probabilistically compute L on all inputs. Thus, a solution to L' for most inputs would allow us to solve L on all inputs, contradicting our assumption that L is hard on worst case inputs.  Private information retrieval schemes  A private information retrieval scheme allows a user to retrieve an item from a server in possession of a database without revealing which item is retrieved. One common way of ensuring privacy is to have k separate, non-communicating servers, each with a copy of the database. Given an appropriate scheme, the user can make queries to each server that individually do not reveal which bit the user is looking for, but which together provide enough information that the user can determine the particular bit of interest in the database. One can easily see that locally decodable codes have applications in this setting. A general procedure to produce a k-server private information scheme from a perfectly smooth k-query locally decodable code is as follows: Let C be a perfectly smooth LDC that encodes n-bit messages to N-bit codewords. As a preprocessing step, each of the k servers S_1,\\\\ldots ,S_k encodes the n-bit database x with the code C, so each server now stores the N-bit codeword C(x). A user interested in obtaining the i^{th} bit of x randomly generates a set of k queries q_1,\\\\ldots q_k such that x_i can be computed from C(x)_{q_1}, \\\\ldots C(x)_{q_k} using the local decoding algorithm A for C. The user sends each query to a different server, and each server responds with the bit requested. The user then uses A to compute x_i from the responses. Because the decoding algorithm is perfectly smooth, each query q_j is uniformly distributed over the codeword; thus, no individual server can gain any information about the user's intentions, so the protocol is private as long as the servers do not communicate.  Examples = The Hadamard code  The Hadamard (or Walsh-Hadamard) code is an example of a simple locally decodable code that maps a string of length k to a codeword of length 2^k. The codeword for a string x \\\\in {0, 1}^k is constructed as follows: for every a_j\\\\in{0, 1}^k, the j^{th} bit of the codeword is equal to x \\\\odot a_j, where x \\\\odot y = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^{k} x_{i}y_i (mod 2). It is easy to see that every codeword has a Hamming distance of \\\\frac{n}{2} from every other codeword. The local decoding algorithm has query complexity 2, and the entire original message can be decoded with good probability if the codeword is corrupted in less than \\\\frac{1}{4} of its bits. For \\\\rho < \\\\frac{1}{4}, if the codeword is corrupted in a \\\\rho fraction of places, a local decoding algorithm can recover the i^{th} bit of the original message with probability 1 - 2\\\\rho. Proof: Given a codeword H and an index i, the algorithm to recover the i^{th} bit of the original message x works as follows: Let e^j refer to the vector in {0, 1}^k that has 1 in the j^{th} position and 0s elsewhere. For y \\\\in {0, 1}^k, f(y) denotes the single bit in H that corresponds to x \\\\odot y. The algorithm chooses a random vector y \\\\in {0, 1}^k and the vector y' = y \\\\oplus e^i (where \\\\oplus denotes bitwise XOR). The algorithm outputs f(y) \\\\oplus f(y') (mod 2). Correctness: By linearity, (x \\\\odot y) \\\\oplus (x \\\\odot y') = (x \\\\odot y) \\\\oplus (x \\\\odot (y \\\\oplus e^i)) = (x \\\\odot y) \\\\oplus (x \\\\odot y) \\\\oplus (x \\\\odot e^i) = x \\\\odot e^i But (x \\\\odot e^i) = x_i, so we just need to show that f(y) = x \\\\odot y and f(y') = x \\\\odot y' with good probability. Since y and y' are uniformly distributed (even though they are dependent), the union bound implies that f(y) = x \\\\odot y and f(y') = x \\\\odot y' with probability at least 1 - 2\\\\rho. Note: to amplify the probability of success, one can repeat the procedure with different random vectors and take the majority answer.  The Reed‚ÄìMuller code  The main idea behind local decoding of Reed-Muller codes is polynomial interpolation. The key concept behind a Reed-Muller code is a multivariate polynomial of degree d on l variables. The message is treated as the evaluation of a polynomial at a set of predefined points. To encode these values, a polynomial is extrapolated from them, and the codeword is the evaluation of that polynomial on all possible points. At a high level, to decode a point of this polynomial, the decoding algorithm chooses a set S of points on a line that passes through the point of interest x. It then queries the codeword for the evaluation of the polynomial on points in S and interpolates that polynomial. Then it is simple to evaluate the polynomial at the point that will yield x. This roundabout way of evaluating x is useful because (a) the algorithm can be repeated using different lines through the same point to improve the probability of correctness, and (b) the queries are uniformly distributed over the codeword. More formally, let \\\\mathbb{F} be a finite field, and let l, d be numbers with d < \\\\mathbb{F}. The Reed-Muller code with parameters \\\\mathbb{F}, l, d is the function RM : \\\\mathbb{F}^{\\\\binom{l+d}{d}} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{F}^{\\\\mathbb{F}^l} that maps every l-variable polynomial P over \\\\mathbb{F} of total degree d to the values of P on all the inputs in \\\\mathbb{F}^l. That is, the input is a polynomial of the form P(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_l) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i_1+\\\\ldots+i_l\\\\le d}c_{i_1,\\\\ldots,i_l}x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\\\\cdots x_l^{i_l} specified by the interpolation of the \\\\binom{l+d}{d} values of the predefined points and the output is the sequence {P(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_l)} for every x_1, \\\\ldots, x_l \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}. To recover the value of a degree d polynomial at a point w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^n, the local decoder shoots a random affine line through w. Then it picks d + 1 points on that line, which it uses to interpolate the polynomial and then evaluate it at the point where the result is w. To do so, the algorithm picks a vector v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^n uniformly at random and considers the line L = {w + \\\\lambda v \\\\mid \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}} through w. The algorithm picks an arbitrary subset S of \\\\mathbb{F}, where S = d+1, and queries coordinates of the codeword that correspond to points w+\\\\lambda v for all \\\\lambda \\\\in S and obtains values {e_{\\\\lambda}}. Then it uses polynomial interpolation to recover the unique univariate polynomial h with degree less than or equal to d such that h(\\\\lambda) = e_{\\\\lambda} for all \\\\lambda \\\\in S. Then, to get the value of w, it just evaluates h(0). To recover a single value of the original message, one chooses w to be one of the points that defines the polynomial. Each individual query is distributed uniformly at random over the codeword. Thus, if the codeword is corrupted in at most a \\\\delta fraction of locations, by the union bound, the probability that the algorithm samples only uncorrupted coordinates (and thus correctly recovers the bit) is at least 1 - (d+1)\\\\delta.

This is typically applicable for: * devolution by death * succession * inheritance * bankruptcy * marriage When a previous owner of shares dies and his shares are inherited by his personal representatives or heirs, this is called transmission of shares. Shares may be inherited only by production of probate of a will of the deceased owner or letters of administration of his estate granted by the High Court (section 148 of Companies and Allied Matters Act under Nigerian law). The beneficiaries of the shares by transmission must have their names entered in the register of members of the company or elect a nominee to hold the shares on their behalf. In this case the nominee‚Äôs name shall be entered in the Register of members of the company to become a member of the company (section 155 (3) of CAMA).  Transfers on transmission of shares  Transmission of shares occurs when the shares of a deceased share holder are inherited or bequeathed to an heir or personal representative of the deceased shareholder. Where shares are held by two or more persons jointly then upon death of one or more of them, the surviving person shall be entitled to all the shares and they may be transferred to his name. Where the shareholder held the shares as a sole owner, then his shares may be transferred only to the person named in his will or if he died without a will, then to the person who obtains letters of administration from the High Court in respect of the shares or the deceased‚Äôs property (section 148 of CAMA). The above are in Law recognized as the personal representatives of the deceased share holder and are entitled to have his shares transferred to them or their nominee (section 155 of CAMA).  Protection of Beneficiaries under a will  Sometimes a deceased member may name some persons as the administrators of his estate who are to ensure the deceased‚Äôs properties are distributed and/or managed as stated in the will. These persons therefore inherit the deceased persons shares on behalf and for the benefit of those who are named in the will as the beneficiaries inherit. The administrators therefore only have an equitable right in the shares but not the beneficial rights. This right becomes a legal right only when the shares are transferred to those entitled under the will. It is the duty of the executors of the will who in this case are the personal representatives of the deceased to ensure that they nominate those entitled to the shares under the will as those to whom the shares should be transferred to (section 155 (3) of CAMA). Any person claiming to have an interest in any shares or the dividends or interest on those shares may protect his interest by swearing to an affidavit indicating the nature of his interest and serving the company with the affidavit. The company shall then enter on the register of members the fact that such notice has been served on the company. The company shall therefore not register any transfer of shares of the deceased in respect of which it had received the affidavit of interest. Any company which receives this notice of interest and in default proceeds to register any transfer in favor of any other person shall be personally liable to the person who lodged the notice of interest for any loss he suffers thereby (section 156 of CAMA) The Company shall give notice of at least 42 days to any other person seeking a transfer to him, of the shares complained of, for the matter to be resolved otherwise, the proposed transfer will not be effected (section 156 (2) of CAMA). Ownership: on registration of the transmission of shares, the person entitled to transmission of shares becomes the shareholder of the company and is entitled to all rights and subject to all liabilities as such shareholder. Method: while transfer of shares is brought about by delivery of a proper instrument of transfer (viz, transfer deed) duly stamped and executed, transmission of shares is done by forwarding the necessary documents (such as a notarised copy of death certificate) to the company. Legal process In the case of death, the surviving shareholders have to submit a request letter supported by an attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased shareholder and the relevant share certificates. The company‚Äôs registrar and share transfer agent on receipt of the said documents will delete the name of deceased shareholder from its records and return the share certificates to the applicant/registered holder with necessary endorsement.

Life The son of John Moses, merchant tailor, he was born in the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark, about 1623. On 28 March 1632, at age nine, he was admitted to Christ's Hospital, and proceeded in 1639 as an exhibitioner to Pembroke Hall, now Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1644 and M.A. in 1647. Early in 1655 he was elected Master of Pembroke by the unanimous vote of the fellows. Benjamin Laney had been ejected from the mastership in March 1644, and the post had been successively held by the intruded Richard Vines and Sydrach Simpson. Moses was intruded as fellow at the same time as Vines, and acted as college treasurer for him.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66645 Oliver Cromwell demurred to the appointment of Moses as Master, having wanted another in the post, but on representations made of the services of Moses to the college he withdrew his previous choice. Moses was a good administrator, securing for his college the possession of the benefactions of Sir Robert Hitcham, and rebuilding much of the fabric. He outwitted Cromwell by proceeding to the election to a vacant post, in advance of the anticipated arrival of Cromwell's nomination. Among the fellows of his period in office were William Sampson and Nathaniel Coga, and Nehemiah Grew was admitted. At the Restoration, Laney was reinstated. Moses was not in orders, and made a choice of the law over medicine as profession. He became counsel to the East India Company, and was favourably noticed by the king and Heneage Finch. He was made serjeant-at-law on 11 June 1688, died a rich bachelor in the same year, and left benefactions to his college. Views According to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, Moses was a religious puritan, influenced when young by the Institutions of William Bucanus, which he read at Christ's Hospital in the English version by Robert Hill. He was disinclined to enter the ministry of the Church of England, was averse to presbyterianism and in favour of a moderate episcopacy. A short Latin poem by him is included in Academiae Cantabrigiensis Œ£œéœÉœÑœÅŒ±, Cambridge, 1660, a congratulatory collection on the restoration of Charles II.

Tenerife Auditorium and Torres de Santa Cruz seen from the sea. As early as 1970, there was agreement that the creation of an auditorium for the islands should proceed. The location in the El Ramonal was approved in 1977. In 1978 design proposals were solicited for consideration. The project agreed to appoint the architect Antonio Fern√°ndez Alba. Later, in 1985, the location of the auditorium was moved to El Chapatal.La construcci√≥n del Auditorio de Tenerife, a√±o a a√±o y paso a paso In 1987, the final design of Antonio Fern√°ndez Alba, with collaboration of Vicente Saavedra and Javier D√≠az Llanos was unveiled. However, soon after there was a conceptual shift about the type of building and the government abandoned the project. In 1989, the government entered into discussions with the architect Santiago Calatrava Valls, who became the project architect. In 1991, Calatrava publicly presented his design. At that time, the building was to be located at the end of Avenida Tres de Mayo. In 1992 the government created the Commission for Supervision and Control for the construction of the auditorium. In 1996, the Commission changed to a seaside location, the Castle of St John the Baptist. Groundbreaking and construction finally began in 1997, twenty years after the initial approval. In 1997, they started the earthmoving at the final location. During 2001, the 17 larger metal panels which form the jacket were installed. In 2002, the concrete and the white exterior trencad√≠s plaster work were completed. The complicated construction required specialized tools. Much of the surface is covered with white trencad√≠s, with colorful trencad√≠s as decorative elements in the retaining walls of the plaza the building stands on. The original construction budget was 30 million Euros, but 33 years later, the total spend amounted to 72 million Euros. Inauguration The Tenerife Auditorium was officially opened by the Prince of Asturias Felipe de Borb√≥n (son of the King of Spain) on September 26, 2003, accompanied by his mother Queen Sofia. The inaugural concert was Fanfarria Real by Krzysztof Penderecki and was covered by media from around the world, including newspapers such as The New York Times, Financial Times, The Independent, the Paris Le Monde, and Italy's Corriere della Sera, as well as international magazines such as Elle Decoration, Architecture Today and Marie Claire Maison.From New York to Sydney (in Spanish) Bill Clinton's visit The auditorium was visited by former President of the United States Bill Clinton, who visited Tenerife in July 2005 to attend a conference on the role of the island as part of the Tenerife Atlantic Logistics Platform.Bill Clinton's Visit (in Spanish) This was the first visit by a former U.S. president to the Canary Islands.  Name change  On January 28, 2011 the Cabildo de Tenerife approved the proposal to rename the building \\"Auditorio de Tenerife Ad√°n Mart√≠n\\" in memory of President of the Canary Islands, Ad√°n Mart√≠n Menis, who was the driving force behind the construction of the auditorium in his stage as President of the Cabildo Insular de Tenerife (1987-1999). However, many citizens and media were against the name change.\\"A traici√≥n y con alevos√≠a\\". Una pena Concierto de abono n√∫mero 6 de la Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Tenerife Despite the name change of the auditorium, most of the population continues to call the building just \\"Auditorio de Tenerife\\". The building A different view The Auditorio de Tenerife is situated in a central area of the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, near The Avenue of the Constitution, the Parque Mar√≠timo C√©sar Manrique and the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The auditorium is located near the Tenerife Tram station. Near the auditorium stand the two Torres de Santa Cruz, which are the tallest buildings in the Canary Islands, and the tallest residential building in Spain until 2010. The auditorium and the towers are the most recognizable and most photographed structures in the city. The building stands on a plot of of which the auditorium occupies , divided into two chambers. The main hall or Symphony, crowned by a dome, has 1,616 seats in an amphitheater. Its stage is wide, with a depth of . Organ pipes emerge from both sides of the pit, designed by the world famous virtuoso Jean Guillou and erected by Albert Blancafort (who has also been involved in the construction of organs at the Cathedral of Alcala de Henares and the Auditorio Alfredo Kraus on Gran Canaria). The auditorium differs from traditional designs because it attempts to surround the listener with sound sources. The chamber hall, with 422 seats, reproduces the symphony hall amphitheater on a smaller scale. In the lobby, accessible from two sides of the building, are the press room, a shop and cafe. The building also has a dozen individual dressing rooms, as well as rooms for hairdressing, makeup, costumes, etc. The exterior has two terraces overlooking the sea. The building is famous for its great \\"arc\\", which marked a first in the history of architecture.The arched roof varies in thickness from 15-20cm. It is the only large arch supported by only two points, while the tip appears to be suspended, defying gravity. The silhouette of the auditorium as seen from the sea evokes the Sydney Opera House in Australia. The term \\"The Sydney of the Atlantic\\" has come to refer to the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.El nuevo perfil de Santa Cruz de Tenerife con el Auditorio External spaces *Trade Winds Plaza: *Atlantic Terrace: *City Terrace: Interior spaces *Symphony Hall *Chamber Hall *Hall *Galleries Port and Castle Lighting Auditorio de Tenerife by night The building is normally lit in bright white at night, but more colorful lighting is used on special occasions. For example, on New Year 2007‚Äì2008 the auditorium was lit in white and yellow, and a clock was projected onto one wing of the building to mark the hours. In 2008, it was illuminated in green to celebrate 30 years of Transportes interurbanos de Tenerife, S.A. (TITSA). On World Diabetes Day, the auditorium is illuminated in blue, and special lighting is also employed during the annual Cadena Dial Awards. The auditorium also participates in \\"Earth Hour,\\" a campaign against climate change in which large buildings \\"go dark\\" for an hour to draw awareness to the cause. Also when held in the auditorium a national or international convention, are placed on the masts located next to the building, look national flags of the participating countries (e.g. on the occasion of World Port Strategy Forum), also placed banners with logo of the companies sponsoring these forums. Uses=Cultural programming The auditorium hosts various musical performances, such as Tenerife Danza, Atlantic Jazz, World Music and Great Performers in addition to hosting the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Tenerife, the Tenerife Opera Festival and, together with the Teatro P√©rez Gald√≥s in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the sessions for the Canary Islands Music Festival (Festival de M√∫sica de Canarias). Events Auditorium facilities are designed to accommodate conferences, product launches and conventions. The auditorium building and its environment are also promoted as a location for filming commercials. The area around the auditorium, are also used in the Armed Forces Day during the month of May, where the best pieces of artillery are exposed at the foot of the building like a \\"great outdoor military museum\\" it were. During the celebration of the Canary Islands Day (May 30), the Tenerife Auditorium hosts the Canary Awards and Gold Medals of the region. This act has the presence of President of the Canary Islands and the maximum regional authorities, and local island. In September 2014, within the Starmus International Festival, the auditorium was visited by Stephen Hawking, who was considered the most famous scientist in the world.Stephen Hawking arriba al Puerto de Santa Cruz Tenerife para participar en el Festival Internacional Starmus Gala de los Premios de la Cadena Dial The official Cadena Dial Awards have been held in the Auditorium of Tenerife since 2006 to 2013. The gala event brings together various national and international Latin singers including Laura Pausini, Chayanne, Amaral, Amaia Montero, Eros Ramazzotti, Beatriz Luengo, Camila, Estopa, Luis Fonsi, Tiziano Ferro, Manolo Garcia, Melocos, Melendi, La Oreja de Van Gogh, Pitingo, Rosario and Sergio Dalma.

Criticism Aerial view of the Auditorio de Tenerife The building has been criticized for several reasons, including the location, various structural problems, budget increases, and an alleged breach of safety rules. Despite this criticism, the building is now considered an emblem of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and a distinctive symbol of the city and the island. It is also a significant tourist attraction.

She was author of half a dozen books but remembered today for forming the Argonauts Club, which in a second incarnation (but largely following her vision) was to have a significant influence on postwar Australian culture. Biography She was born as Madoline Murdoch, the third daughter of John Andrew Murdoch, a Law Clerk, from North Carlton, Victoria, and his wife Rebecca Murphy. The family moved to Woodburn, New South Wales, where Nina grew up, attending first a school where her mother taught, then Sydney Girls' High School; it was here that her interest in writing began. She began her working life teaching with her mother, then at Sydney Boys' Preparatory School. She then secured a position with the Sydney Sun as one of its first women reporters, and became the first woman to cover Senate debates. She married fellow reporter (and ex-teacher) James Duncan McKay Brown on 19 December 1917. They moved to Victoria, both working on Melbourne's Sun News-Pictorial, Nina often under the byline 'Manin'. In 1927 she travelled unaccompanied through England and Europe, gathering material for the first of her travel books Seventh Heaven. On her return, she joined the Melbourne Herald, but was retrenched because of the Depression. She gave travel talks on radio 3LO, and when that station was acquired for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) in 1932, ran the Children's Corner. It was then she came up with the idea of the Argonauts' Club. It was a bold concept: publishing original contributions from children who would remain anonymous under assigned Ship names and numbers; treating children as creative individuals in contrast to the pandering to trivial enthusiasms which was general then as now. She wrote its pledge, inscribed on every membership certificate: \\"I vow to stand faithfully by all that is brave and beautiful; to seek adventure, and having discovered aught of wonder or delight, of merriment or loveliness, to share it freely with my comrades\\". James Brown secured a job with News Ltd in Adelaide in 1933. Nina followed in 1934 and with her departure, the Argonauts' Club folded. It was however revived in 1941 and ran successfully till 1972. She returned to Melbourne around 1943 where she devoted herself to the care of her mother, by now blind, (and lived to 105) and her asthmatic husband who died in 1957. A 1920 portrait of Nina Murdoch, by Sir John Longstaff, hangs in the reading room of the National Library, Canberra. He was to become, in 1948, the subject of her only biography. She died at an Anglican nursing home in Camberwell. Societies Murdoch was a member of the Lyceum Club, the Incorporated Society of Authors, Playwrights and Composers (London) and the Fellowship of Australian Writers. Publications Murdoch was a prolific writer of poetry; between 1913 and 1922 The Bulletin published some 80 of her poems, including several as 'Manin', and was the recipient of many of their prizes. *Songs of the Open Air (book of verse); William Brooks, 1915 *More Songs in the Open Air; Robertson and Mullens, 1922 *The Miss Emily trilogy: :Miss Emily in Black Lace; Halstead Press, Sydney 1930 :Portrait of Miss Emily Halstead Press, Sydney 1931 :Exit Miss Emily Halstead Press, Sydney 1937 *She travelled alone in Spain (ill.

She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, between April 1876 and October 1881. She was armed with a main battery of six guns mounted in a central-battery. The ship had a limited career, and did not see action. In 1897, she was reduced to a guard ship in Pola, and in 1912 she was renamed Mars. She served as a training ship after 1917, and after the end of World War I, she was surrendered as a war prize to Italy, which sold her for scrapping in 1920. Design Tegetthoff was a central battery ship designed by Chief Engineer Josef von Romako. The ship's namesake, Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, victor of the Battle of Lissa, had proposed building four new ironclads. These were to be completed by 1878, but poor economic conditions in the early 1870s forced the Austro-Hungarian government to cut back the naval budget. Admiral Friedrich von P√∂ck, who succeeded Tegetthoff as the head of naval administration, had attempted to secure funding for two new ships, to be named Tegetthoff and Erzherzog Karl from 1871. P√∂ck finally succeeded in convincing parliament to allocate funds for the first ship in 1875.Sondhaus, pp. 37‚Äì39 He continued to try to convince the parliament to build a sister ship for Tegetthoff until 1880, without success.Sondhaus, p. 54 Austro- Hungarian industry was incapable of supporting the construction of the ship, and significant components had to be ordered from foreign manufacturers, including guns from Germany and armor plating from Britain.Sondhaus, p. 47 General characteristics Tegetthoff in drydock Tegetthoff was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of and she displaced . Tegetthoff was the first ship in the Austrian Navy to be built with an all- steel hull, which allowed for a considerable savings in weight.Sullivan, p. 690 The ship's crew numbered 525 officers and men, though after her reconstruction in the mid-1890s, this number was increased to between 568 and 575. The main armored belt and the casemate for the main battery guns were protected with thick armor plate, and the end bulkheads of the armored citadel were thick. The conning tower had sides that were thick. As built, the ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, vertical compound steam engine that was rated at . This gave Tegetthoff a top speed of on trials. After her reconstruction in the early 1890s, her propulsion system was replaced with a pair of 3-cylinder triple expansion engines built by the German firm Schichau- Werke. These were rated at , for a top speed of on trials. After the refit, she was equipped with eight Scotch marine boilers. She was initially fitted with a sailing rig, though this was removed during the modernization, and two heavy fighting masts were installed in its place. Armament Tegetthoff was initially equipped with a main battery of six L/18 breech-loading guns manufactured by Krupp.\\"L/18\\" refers to the length (L√§nge) of the gun in terms of calibers; in this case, the gun was 18 calibers long. These guns were mounted in a central battery amidships, and were intended to be used during pursuit and ramming attempts. The ammunition magazine was located directly below the main battery. The ship also carried six L/24 breech-loaders, two L/15 breech-loaders, and four quick-firing (QF) guns. After her modernization, the main battery was replaced with L/35 C/86 guns from Krupp.\\"C/86\\" refers to the year the gun was designed (Construktionsjahr). The secondary guns now consisted of five L/35 QF guns, two L/18 guns, nine 47 mm L/44 QF guns, six 47 mm L/33 machine guns, and a pair of machine guns. Tegetthoff was also equipped with two torpedo tubes, one in the bow and one in the stern. Service history Tegetthoff in Pola in the late 1880s Tegetthoff was laid down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882;Sondhaus, pp. 71, 91 Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the ship in Pola.Sondhaus, p. 78 Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881.Sondhaus, p.58 At the time, she was the largest and most powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would keep that distinction until after the turn of the century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.Sondhaus, pp. 46‚Äì47 Tegetthoffs career was rather limited, in large part due to significant problems with her engines. For the first decade of her career, she was assigned to the Active Squadron, and her crew could only keep her engines fully operational in the years 1883, 1887, and 1888.Sondhaus, p. 91 Tegetthoff and an Austro-Hungarian squadron that included the ironclads , , , and and the torpedo cruisers and travelled to Barcelona, Spain, to take part in the opening ceremonies for the Barcelona Universal Exposition.

In contrast, Pfleeger and AtleePfleeger and Atlee, 2006, pg.526 focus on the risks associated with changes and state that IA is: \\"the evaluation of the many risks associated with the change, including estimates of the effects on resources, effort, and schedule\\". Both the design details and risks associated with modifications are critical to performing IA within the change management processes. A technical colloquial term is also mentioned sometimes in this context, dependency hell.  Types of Impact Analysis Techniques  IA techniques can be classified into three types:Kilpinen, 2008 * Trace * Dependency * Experiential Bohner and ArnoldBohner and Arnold, 1996 identify two classes of IA, traceability and dependency IA. In traceability IA, links between requirements, specifications, design elements, and tests are captured, and these relationships can be analysed to determine the scope of an initiating change.Eisner, 2002, pg.236-237 In dependency IA, linkages between parts, variables, logic, modules etc. are assessed to determine the consequences of an initiating change. Dependency IA occurs at a more detailed level than traceability IA. Within software design, static and dynamic algorithms can be run on code to perform dependency IA.Rajlich, 2000Ren et al., 2005 Static methods focus on the program structure, while dynamic algorithms gather information about program behaviour at run-time. Literature and engineering practice also suggest a third type of IA, experiential IA, in that the impact of changes is often determined using expert design knowledge. Review meeting protocols,Endres and Rombach, 2003, pg.17 informal team discussions, and individual engineering judgementAmbler, 2002, pg. 244 can all be used to determine the consequences of a modification.  Package management and dependency IA  Software is often delivered in packages, which contain dependencies to other software packages necessary that the one deployed runs. Following these dependencies in reverse order is a convenient way to identify the impact of changing the contents of a software package. Examples for software helpful to do this: * scripts like whatrequires http://www.pixelbeat.org/scripts/whatrequires for RPM, and debian package formats  Source code and dependency IA  Dependencies are also declared in source code. MetaData can be used to understand the dependencies via Static analysis. Amongst the tools supporting to show such dependencies are: * Integrated development environment * FindBugs * JRipples *AppDynamics *Crosscode Panoptics There are as well tools applying full-text search over source code stored in various repositories. If the source code is web- browsable, then classical search engines can be used. If the source is only available in the runtime environment, it gets more complicated and specialized tools may be of help.ohloh, discover, track, and compare open source. Learning techniques can be used to automatically identify impact dependencies.  Requirements, and traceability to source code  Recent tools use often stable links to trace dependencies. This can be done on all levels, amongst them specification, blueprint, bugs, commits. Despite this, the use of backlink checkers known from search engine optimization is not common. Research in this area is done as well, just to name use case mapsChange Impact Analysis for Requirement Evolution using Use Case Maps , Jameleddine Hassine, Juergen Rilling, Jacqueline Hewitt, Department of Computer Science, Concordia University, 2005.

Below is an incomplete list of major notable variations of the game. Standard play and terminologyTwo-player variations= Two-player dummy  A normal hand is dealt out to each player along with a 3-card dummy hand to each player. Each person picks up their dummy hand after trump has been called. Each player must make their best five card hand out of the eight cards available. Going alone is still an option and occurs when the calling player opts not to pick up the dummy hand.  12-card (or 11-card)  In this version there are no partners. Each player will end up with four hidden cards, keeping strategy very similar to the partnered-version. A normal deck of 9-10-J-Q-K-A in all four suits is used. The dealer places a card face down in front of the other player, and then in front of the dealer, alternating until each player has a row of four face-down cards. The dealer then places a face-up card on top of each face- down card, so now each player has 8 cards. The dealer then deals four more cards to each player, which they pick up and hold in their hand. The non- dealer looks at their 4 hand cards, 4 show cards, and the opponents 4 show cards, and bids the number of tricks they think they can take, with a minimum bid of 7. The dealer can bid higher or pass. The highest bidder sets the trump suit, and the non-dealer goes first. Players can play any card from their hand, or any of their face-up cards. If a face-up card is played that had covered a face-down card, the face-down card is flipped over and becomes eligible for play on the next trick. It is strategically important to remember to keep cards in the hand, as otherwise it is very easy for the opponent to lead off-suit and win. It may thus be better in cases to sacrifice a higher- value face-up card than to give up hand cards. Similarly, if out of trump cards, it may be worthwhile to sacrifice a high-value face-up card in hopes of revealing a trump card underneath. Points are only awarded or lost for the number of tricks bid: 1 point for 7 tricks, 2 points for 8 tricks, etc., up to 6 points for all 12 tricks. The player who bid gains the points if they succeed, and loses the points if they fail. The first player to get 10 points wins the game. In some variants, each player may be dealt a 3-card private hand with 4 sets of face up/face down cards, or a 5-card hand with 3 sets of face up/face down cards. Three-player variations= Missing Man  Missing Man Euchre ( George's Hand Euchre) is a three-handed Euchre tournament game of Western Wisconsin. It is also played on the gulf coast of Florida. It plays similarly to traditional four-handed Euchre. Four 5-card Euchre hands are dealt with the fourth hand being a dummy (sometimes called George's Hand), and the top card of the remaining cards is upturned. The trump suit is called in the normal fashion, in two rounds of bidding. However, either of the players who does not call trump may exchange their hand for the dummy. If no trump is called in the first two rounds of bidding, the dealer must either call a suit (other than that of the top card) or pick up the dummy hand and call any suit (including that of the top card). Play proceeds as normal. The calling player scores 1 point for 3 or 4 tricks, 2 points for all 5 tricks, and 4 points for a called loner. If the calling player fails to win the bid, the other players score 1 point each. Since the caller has no partner, leading trump is a good strategy, as when going alone in regular Euchre.  Three- hand dummy  Another common three-player variation is played by dealing out four hands, but with the fourth hand acting as a dummy hand (a.k.a. the dead hand, imaginary friend, George, Johann, etc.). After calling trump, the calling player picks up the dummy hand and makes the best five-card hand for themselves out of all ten cards. Alternatively, the caller may elect to \\"go alone\\" by not picking up the dummy hand. The caller then plays alone against the other two players, who play as partners for that hand. The calling player scores 1 point for winning the hand, 2 points for all five tricks, or 4 points for taking all five tricks while going alone. Variations may limit the size or utility of the dummy hand, because making the best hand from ten cards may be viewed as too advantageous. Examples include a three-card dummy or the calling player randomly choosing three cards from the dummy, then making the best hand out of eight cards. Sneaky Steve is a variant in which the dummy hand is called \\"Steve\\". After the trump is called and the 5-card dummy hand is used or discarded, the player with the 9 of diamonds (called \\"Sneaky Steve\\") may exchange it for a random card of the 3 bottom cards of the kitty (i.e.: not including the top card or a card exchanged for it). Play then proceeds normally.  Cut-throat Euchre  In Cut-throat Euchre,A new book of sports, p. 342 - Saturday review 1885 the dealing and bidding process is as normal. The caller scores 1 point for 3 or 4 tricks, 3 points for 5 tricks, and the defenders each get 2 points for 3 or more tricks. Strategy is similar to going alone in standard Euchre. Defenders should pay attention and keep high-value non-trump cards of the suit that their partner is not playing; this will increase the chances of taking the last trick, which is almost always a non- trump trick. Variants: * No 9s ‚Äì Played with the nines removed from the deck, which inflates the value of all hands, requiring more care in bidding. * Count down ‚Äì With the 9s removed from the deck, players start at 300 or 500 points and play down. Points are inflated: the caller loses 10 points for 3 or 4 tricks, 50 points for all 5 tricks, and the defenders each lose 20 points for 3 or more tricks. The first player to lose all points wins the game.  Canadian  In western New York, a three-player variation called \\"Canadian\\" is played (it is called Gyoza in Chicago and Buck Euchre in areas of the US Midwest). Four hands are dealt normally. The top kitty card is upturned and automatically becomes trump. Starting from the dealer's left, the players then have the option of exchanging their hand for the dummy hand, with their discarded hand then becoming the dummy hand available for exchange by the next player. After the dealer chooses to keep or exchange hands, the dealer then picks up the trump card and play begins.  Shooter In Southern Ontario, a three-person version exists called \\"Shooter\\". Three eight-card hands are dealt. Players then bid to call trump, with a minimum bid of 3 tricks. The winner of the contract calls the trump suit or may call \\"no trump\\", where aces are high and all jacks are treated as off-trump coloured jacks (i.e. beat a ten but lose to a queen). Players score 1 point for each trick won. If the caller fails to achieve their contract, they lose that number of points. A player who bid all 8 tricks, called \\"shooter\\", receives an extra 4 points if successful. The game is played to 31 points.  Ghost player  Four 5-card hands are dealt, with the extra hand going to the \\"ghost player\\". In clockwise order, players may opt to switch their hand with the ghost player's hand. The top card of the kitty is then upturned and bidding and play proceed as normal. If the caller played their dealt hand, they get 2 points for 3 or 4 tricks and 4 points for 5 tricks; but if the caller switched hands, they receive only 1 point for winning the majority of tricks. The defenders each receive 1 point each for 3 or 4 tricks, and 2 points each for all 5 tricks.  Threechre In Threechre (sometimes pronounced \\"tree-ker\\" or \\"three-kree\\"), only three suits are used and a joker serves as the left bower, regardless of drawn suit. The dealer may opt to go alone in the first round of bidding, in which case the top card is discarded and the remaining 4 cards of the kitty are given to the dealer's opponents, who pick their best 5-card hand from the 7 cards. In scoring, 3 tricks is a clear win for 2 points, while a 2‚Äì2 tie awards each tied player 1 point. There is a ‚àí1 penalty for the caller, so that calling and losing results in ‚àí1 points, calling and tying is 0 points, and calling and winning is 1 point.  Call-partner Call-partner is a variation for 3 to 10 players (using a deck adjusted so that the kitty will have 5 cards or less after dealing a 5-card hand to each player). The top card of the kitty is upturned and bidding proceeds as normal. The player who calls trump may call for a partner by naming a desired card. For example, if the caller names the left bower, the player with that card becomes their partner ‚Äì but this is not revealed until the left bower is played. This creates an element of uncertainty as to who the partner is or whether the named card might be in the kitty. The caller may also opt to go alone. Scoring as normal.  Euchress Euchress discards the 9s from the deck. Dealing and bidding are as normal, but the caller can choose a partner or go alone. Scoring is the same, with play typically going to 15 points.  Four-player variations = Benny variants  A common variation played in southwestern England pub leagues uses the standard Euchre deck with an extra card, usually a Joker or 2 of spades, called the \\"Benny\\" (or the \\"Bird\\" in Australia). This card is the highest trump no matter what suit is called. When the Benny is turned over by the dealer, the dealer must choose a suit to call as trumps before looking at his or her hand. Bidding and play then proceeds normally. The Duchy of Cornwall lays claim to the origin of the Benny in Euchre, its usage being exported by emigrant Cornish miners in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. = Railroad Euchre = There is an extension of this style wherein the 9s are removed from the deck and up to four \\"Bennys\\" are added (usually one or both jokers and/or one or both deuces). In its simplest form, with a single Benny, it is the same as the English variant (above). The Bennys are ranked trump ahead of the right bower, regardless of the suit of trump, with deuce(s) outranking jokers. If two Jokers are added, some method is achieved for establishing a \\"high\\" and a \\"low\\" Joker. Although somewhat complicated, the addition of up to four higher-ranking trump cards makes a significant strategic impact on gameplay. The two and three Benny versions are the most common. = 33-card deck = In Guernsey (Channel Islands) the game is played with a 33-card deck incorporating 7 to Ace plus a joker as Benny. When the Benny is upturned, the dealer must name the suit and play (though the dealer may still opt to chose a partner or go alone). Five players One five-player variant expands the standard deck, adding the 8s and a pair of 2s (or alternatively the jokers). The 2s or jokers are the highest trump cards, whichever suit is called. Five 5-card hands are dealt and the top card of the kitty is upturned. If no other player orders a trump suit, the dealer must do so. In the special case that the top card is a 2, the dealer cannot look at their cards for the first round of bidding, in which any suit can be called. Once trump is called, the caller may select a partner by naming a card (other than a 2) or may alternatively go alone. A player holding the named card becomes the caller's partner, though this is not revealed until the named card is played. Scoring is normal. There are no added benefits if the caller wins all 5 tricks when not going alone but the named card is in the kitty (i.e.: going alone must be intentional). The game ends when a player reaches ten or more points while holding at least a one-point advantage over all other players, with various rules for breaking ties. Six-player variations=Uneven Teams The above rules for five-handed euchre can also be used for 6 hands by adding the 7s. The team that makes trump will usually play 2 against 4. Triple Wild Deck Partnerships are two teams of three players. The deck consists of 8s through aces, with the addition of the 4, 3, and 2 of spades which are (in order) the highest trumps. After dealing, there is a single card left over which serves as the top card for bidding. The game is played to 15 points, scoring 3 for euchres and sweeps, and 5 for lone calls.  32-card deck  Partnerships are three teams of two players seated across from each other. The deck is 32 cards, 7 through ace of each suit. The kitty consists of only two cards. If defenders euchre the callers, both defending teams score 2 points. The game is won when the first team scores a specific number of points (usually 10), sometimes also requiring a certain lead over either opposing partnership to avoid ties.  34-card deck  Partnerships are two teams of three players. The deck consists of 7s through aces plus two jokers, which are the highest and second-highest trumps.  Six-suit deck  Partnerships are three teams of two players, seated opposite. Uses a deck constructed of three red suits and three black suits, such that there is one right bower and two left bowers (the first left bower played outranks the second). Bidding, play, and scoring is as normal, with additional rules for ties: If the calling team and another team each win two tricks, each of these partnerships score 1 point. If the two non-calling teams each win two or three tricks, each of these partnerships score 2 points. The first team to 10 points wins.  Double deck  Partnerships are two teams of three players. Uses two standard euchre decks (48 cards); if the same card is played twice in a trick, the card which is played first is highest. Each player is dealt 8 cards. Players bid how many tricks they can get (minimum 3), with the winner calling trump. The caller may go alone normally as a \\"Big Shooter\\" or optionally as a \\"Little Shooter\\" by receiving the best card from each teammate. Teams score 1 point for each trick won. If a team fails to make its bid, they don't receive any points and additionally lose the same number of points as their bid. Winning all 8 tricks scores an additional 4 points on a Little Shooter and 16 points on a Big Shooter. The game is won when a team has 32 points or more at the end of a turn when they called trump, or 34 points otherwise. Eight players Partnerships are four teams of two players, seated opposite. The deck is constructed such that there are three left bowers, with those first played ranking highest. Bidding, play and scoring are as standard, with additional scoring rules for ties: If the calling team and another team tie with 2 tricks, each of these teams scores 1 point. If the calling team fails to win and two other teams tie with 2 tricks, each of these teams scores 2 points. Nine players Partnerships are three teams of three players. A deck of 46 cards is constructed with 4 through ace of each suit plus 2 jokers and the 2 of spades. The jokers have variable ranks which are decided beforehand, with no commonly agreed-upon rules. Similarly for the case of the joker being the upturned top card in bidding. House rules may be modified for the specific deck being used, depending on whether or not the jokers are differentiated. The first team to reach 15 points wins. See also *Euchre *Bid Euchre *Haus *Glossary of card game terms ReferencesExternal links *Euchre Science Blogspot. *About.com Board and Card Games Blogspot.

Description of Thymectacin: Thymectacin, also known as NB-1011, is a small molecule phosphoramidate derivative of (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine with potential antineoplastic activity. Selectively active against tumor cells expressing high levels of thymidylate synthase (TS), BVdU pronucleotide analogue NB1011 is converted intracellularly by TS to bromovinyldeoxyuridine monophosphate (BVdUMP) which competes with the natural substrate, deoxyuridine monophosphate, for binding to TS. Unlike TS inhibitors, this agent is a reversible substrate for TS catalysis. Thus, TS retains activity and converts BVdUMP into cytotoxic metabolites.

It is the essence of Auditing It is the practice followed in an audit, with the objective of establishing the authenticity of the transactions recorded in the primary books of account. It essentially consists of verifying a transaction recorded in the books of account with the relevant documentary evidence and the authority on the basis of which the entry has been made; also confirming that the amount mentioned in the voucher has been posted to an appropriate account which would disclose the nature of the transaction on its inclusion in the final statements of account. Vouching does not include valuation. Vouching can be described as the essence or backbone of auditing. The success of an audit depends on the thoroughness with which vouching is done. After entering in all vouchers, only then can auditing start. Vouching is defined as the \\"verification of entries in the books of account by examination of documentary evidence or vouchers, such as invoices, debit and credit notes, statements, receipts, etc. The object of vouching is to establish that the transactions recorded in the books of accounts are (1) in order and have been properly authorized and (2) are correctly recorded. ‚ÄúSimple routine checking cannot establish the same accuracy that vouching can. In routine checking, entries recorded in the books only show what information the bookkeeper chooses to disclose, however these entries can be fictitious without any vouching or vouchers. By using a vouching or a voucher system a company will have concrete and solid documentation and evidence of expenses, capital, and written proof in audits. Vouching is the essence or backbone of auditing because when performing an audit, an auditor must have proof of all transactions. Without the proof provided by vouching, the claims provided by the auditor are just that, only claims. In most cases, hard to detect frauds can only be discovered through the use of vouching. This means that the auditor must conduct vouching with great importance, if not, he can be charged with negligence which happened in the case of Armitage v. Brewer and Knott. Through this case, the importance of vouching was realized. In this case, the auditors were found to be guilty on negligence, because the auditors did not display enough reasonable care and skill in vouching the wage sheets and ended up failing to detect fraud in manipulation of these wage records and cash vouchers. When delivering the decision the Judge stated that \\"It was clear that a good many documents were suspicious on either face and called for Inquiry\\". It was declared that it was essential that due care and attention are to be given to vouching in auditing.

Life  Mihkel Veske was born in Veske farm, Holstre Parish (now in Metsla village, Tarvastu Parish), Viljandi County in northern Livonia. He attended the village school in Pullerits, the parish school in Paistu and secondary school in Tartu. Between 1866 and 1867 he attended the mission school in Leipzig. In 1872 he graduated from the University of Leipzig with a doctoral degree. He published his doctorate in 1873 on comparative grammar of languages. Veske then returned to Estonia and worked as a journalist for the newspaper Eesti P√µllumees. From 1874 to 1887 Veske was a lecturer in Estonian language at the University of Dorpat. From 1886 until his untimely death in 1890 Veske was a lecturer in Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Kazan. During the 1880s, Veske was one of the leading representatives of the Estonian national awakening. He belonged to the strongly patriotic groups around the Estonian intellectuals and journalists Carl Robert Jakobson. From 1882 to 1886 Veske was the President of the Society of Estonian Literati. 1884 Veske edited the magazine Oma Maa (My Land). Veske was one of the first Estonian linguists to use the comparative method of historical linguistics. Between 1875 and 1884, he spent the summers traveling, comparing the dialects in different regions. In 1880 he visited Finland, and in 1885/86 Hungary. He advocated an Estonian standard language on the basis of the North Estonian dialect and phonetic spelling. During his time in Kazan, he studied the languages of the Mari and Mordvin, and dealt with the cultural relations between the Finno- Ugric and Slavic peoples. In 1881-83 he created a two volume textbook of the Finnish language. After his death in Kazan, Veske's body was returned to Estonia. He is buried at the Uus-Jaani cemetery in Tartu (Dorpat). The bronze bust on his tomb was created by the Estonian sculptor August Weizenberg (now lost).  Poetry  Veske's poetry is inspired by the simplicity of the popular Estonian folk song. Veske also collected folk poetry. He translated numerous German, Russian, Finnish and Hungarian folk songs into Estonian.

Ballinger. The film was inspired by the Boston Strangler, a serial killer of the 1960s.  Plot  Leo Kroll (Buono) is a mother-fixated lab technician who collects dolls. He is also a serial killer, responsible for the death of a number of nurses, and is questioned by the police regarding those murders, but is released. Kroll claims his next victim, Clara (Bates), the nurse who has been looking after his possessive mother, who is in hospital after a heart attack. However, he leaves a doll behind at the murder scene. (A subplot features Kroll becoming enamored of Tally (Davison), one of the girls who works at the amusement park stall from which he won this doll.) Kroll is again questioned by the police, but successfully passes a lie detector test and is released. He visits his mother in hospital and tells her how he killed Clara, which induces a second, fatal heart attack. Returning to the amusement park, he sees Barbara (Sayer), Tally's co-worker, talking to the police. This makes Kroll frantic. As Kroll is talking to Barbara about the police, he is visibly nervous. He misses ring after ring while he plays the game. When Barbara mimics one of the dolls by saying \\"Mama\\", this reminds Kroll of his mother and finally sets him off. Kroll goes to Barbara's apartment and strangles her as she is stepping out of the shower. The killing of a girl that works at an amusement park stand and not a nurse throws the police off. Meanwhile, it seems with his mother dead, Kroll finally feels free and it seems his hatred for women is fading. He visits Tally and proposes to her. After he is rejected, Kroll begins to believe in his mind that all the bad things his mother told him about women are true. After questioning Tally and getting a description, the police finally find their strangler. Kroll hides in Tally's apartment and waits to kill her when she comes home. The police, believing Tally could be the strangler's next victim, bug her room and stay close by to catch Kroll. Tally is packing her bag to leave town and ends up covering the bug in her room. The police are unable to hear what is going on when Kroll comes out and begins to strangle Tally. By the time they are able to realize Tally is in trouble they are too late. The police burst into the room right as Kroll finishes Tally off and they open fire. Kroll is hit, goes through the window, and plunges to his death. After taking his final victim, the strangler is dead.  Cast  The film's small budget limited the number of big names that could be hired, and the main leads were subject to Allied Artists' approval. Victor Buono, who had recently received an Academy Award nomination for his role in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, was cast as serial killer Leo Kroll independently of director Burt Topper, who chose David McLean for the role of Lt. Frank Benson. McLean was known for his lead role in the 1960 Western television series Tate. Veteran character actress Ellen Corby (later to become best known as Grandma Walton in The Waltons) played Mrs. Kroll, and Jeanne Bates was Clara Thomas, her attending nurse. Among the unknowns cast were Davey Davison as Tally Raymond, and Diane Sayer as Barbara Wells, Tally's colleague at the amusement park stand from which Kroll obtains a doll. Topper also drew on the \\"Burt Topper Stock Company\\" - an unofficial group of actors he worked with regularly - to fill some supporting roles, including Baynes Barron, Russ Bender and Wally Campo. * Victor Buono as Leo Kroll * David McLean as Lt.

The setting was later changed to an unnamed US city. Burt Topper was hired in the wake of his work on War Is Hell (1963) and production commenced mid-September 1963. Topper found working with Bischoff and Diamond a positive experience, but relations were not as smooth with his star, Victor Buono. Buono insisted the director change those scenes which he felt were \\"too suggestive\\" (indeed, cinematographer Jacques Marquette's main recollection of the shoot was Buono's refusal to do a scene in which Diane Sayer was supposed to be nude) and he once walked off set for a day, after an exchange with Topper over the actor's difficulty hitting his marks.  Reception  The Time Out Film Guide describes the film as a \\"compelling tawdry exploiter\\", acknowledging its star's contributions. Likewise, David Sindelar of movie website Fantastic Movie Musings & Ramblings cites Buono as one of the film's strengths, though criticizing the script's focus on the more logically motivated murders. Among contemporaneous reviews, Variety commended both Buono's performance and Topper's \\"dramatically skillful direction\\" while The New York Times film critic Eugene Archer seemed unimpressed.

It is located southeast of Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne, near Vatry, in the Marne department. It opened as Vatry Air Base in 1953 and switched from military to civilian use in 2000. For freight operations, it is marketed as Vatry Europort and gave its name to the former communaut√© de communes de l'Europort. For passenger traffic, it is also unofficially marketed as Paris-Vatry or Paris- Vatry (Disney), although it is east of downtown Paris and approximately away from Disneyland Paris. History Ch√¢lons Vatry Airport's origins began in 1950 when, with the Cold War, NATO faced several problems while attempting to solve the air power survival equation. Planning for first strike survival in both conventional and nuclear wars had to be considered. Construction began in 1953, and Vatry Air Base was designed for 50 fighters with three large hangars constructed. With the French withdrawal from the integrated NATO military structure in 1967, the American forces left Vatry Air Base and it was closed. For many years, Vatry Air Base was under the control of the French Air Force and used for a training facility. Around 2000, it was sold to civil interests and today is being used as an international heavy cargo and commercial passenger airport.Vatry International Airport at Sovereign-Publications.com Ch√¢lons Vatry Airport's serves too as a pilot training site for both commercial and military planes.

The player controls the eponymous daredevil and navigates time-limited courses, aiming to complete enough objectives to continue to further rounds. Joe Danger is presented in a light-hearted way, with emphasis on stunts and maintaining speed. It was released for the PlayStation 3, via the PlayStation Network, in June 2010, after Hello Games originally chose to publish it exclusively with Sony Computer Entertainment. A \\"Special Edition\\" for the Xbox 360, via the Xbox Live Arcade, was released on 14 December 2011; an iOS spinoff was released on 10 January 2013. In April 2015, a version for Android was released through the Google Play Store. On its release, Joe Danger received generally positive reviews; most reviewers praised the accessible gameplay and the ability to edit courses while playing them. Some suggested the game would have benefited from more options, such as sharing and rating user-generated content, and criticised the lack of an online multiplayer mode. Hello Games subsequently released downloadable content to add features that users and reviewers had requested in the months following the game's release. Using leaderboard statistics, Joe Danger was estimated to have sold at least 108,000 units in its first three months on sale. It was nominated for several awards, including the grand prize at the 2010 Independent Games Festival. Gameplay The player controls motorbike stuntman \\"Joe Danger\\" and guides him through ten \\"trials\\" to defeat his nemeses, the members of Team Nasty. The game uses elements of both racing and side-scrolling platform genres, in which the protagonist can move to the right and, by reversing, to the left as well as hopping over and ducking under various obstacles. Although the game is based on a two-dimensional plane, some of its courses are designed with three layers accessible by changing lanes. The bike is controllable in the air, allowing various tricks to be performed, for which points are awarded with higher scores awarded for long trick sequences, and for manoeuvring onto targets. Executing a stunt will build a \\"boost meter\\", which is used to increases Joe's speed, but drains the meter. The Select button is used to teleport Joe back to the last checkpoint passed. The boxing glove obstacle is representative of art director Grant Duncan's artwork and comic level design, the inspiration for which came from past jobs with Sega. Joe Danger level design was directly influenced by the Sonic the Hedgehog game series, as evidenced by the use of avoidable spikes, vertical loops, and springs placed in levels to allow higher jumps. Some elements are designed to hinder the player, such as conveyor belts, which slow the motorbike, oversized boxing gloves, which will propel the player backwards and barricades, which make it necessary to switch to an alternative lane. The primary goal in each level is to collect as many \\"stars\\" as possible. A star is collected for completing an objective, and once enough are collected, the next course is unlocked. Critics compared this process to that used in the Super Mario Bros. titles. The player is free to choose which objectives to complete, with the option of replaying a level to earn more stars. The most common objective is to finish a course within a time limit with as many points as possible. Other level-specific objectives include collecting a series of coins, hidden stars or letters spelling \\"Danger\\", while in others the player is required to land on every target, or to complete a course in one continuous sequence of tricks. Later levels require the player to do more than one objective simultaneously. Joe Danger contains a sandbox mode, which allows the player to drag and drop objects onto the course to customise levels. This mode is integrated into some single-player levels where the game may instruct the player to introduce obstacles such as ramps to access later sections. New levels can be shared online with friends via the PlayStation Network. The game has a split screen multiplayer mode for up to four players on a selection of specially-made tracks. There is leaderboard support, initially limited to those on the player's PlayStation Network friend list. Development Joe Danger arose from the team's wish to make \\"something that puts a smile on people's faces\\" similar to games such as Mario Kart and Micro Machines. An Evel Knievel toy was a main source of inspiration for the \\"Joe\\" character; the team had fun \\"firing that stunt cycle out of windows and down halls\\". Nevertheless, Murray likened work as an independent developer to \\"the reality of eating ice cream every day for every meal\\" as the novelty of working for themselves wore off. The team often spent more than 60 hours a week working on the project because of the \\"unrealistic\\" time scales for development and with only four team members, each had to fulfil several roles; they had no public relations representative nor did they have a business manager or a designer. No software design document was made throughout the production of Joe Danger, since the team felt they understood each other's ideas. The staff of Hello Games in their office in Guildford. From left: David Ream, Sean Murray, Grant Duncan, and Ryan Doyle. The game was announced on the developers' website on 23 September 2009 and given its first public showcase in November 2009 at the Eurogamer Expo in Earls Court. The team used this event as an opportunity for extensive playtesting, receiving feedback from those playing the game and creating new software builds for each day of the expo. Murray cited numerous \\"happy accidents\\" during development, which led to incorporation of various features into the end product. An example of this was a bug in the programming which enabled players to jump as often as they liked in mid-air; the team decided this was fun and incorporated it as a double jump. Hello Games struggled to find a third-party publisher for the game. Some of the reasons include worries about the lack of potential for porting it to other platforms, and comments such as \\"collecting giant coins feels unrealistic to me\\", and \\"we want games that are less about fun right now\\". One prospective publisher intimated that they might have published the game if the main character had been a monkey. When players were invited to make suggestions for additional characters, there was popular support for the monkey idea; this led to the introduction of a downloadable bonus character, Chuckles the Chimp. After nine months looking for a publisher, the team ran out of money. Murray later came up with the idea of selling his home to help fund development. He explained to Jessica Conditt of Engadget that he considered the house \\"like a blood diamond\\", since it was paid for with money earned at his job with Electronic Arts.  Release  After initially being unsure of the best platform on which to release Joe Danger, the developers announced in March 2010 that they would be releasing the game only on Sony's PlayStation 3. This decision enabled Hello to make use of Sony's \\"Publishing Fund\\", a scheme which offered advantageous financial terms in exchange for exclusivity. Murray said that the PlayStation Network was the ideal place to release the game because it was the only way they could publish by themselves and branded the Xbox Live Arcade platform a \\"slaughterhouse for small developers\\" due to poor sales figures for independent works. Joe Danger was released on 8 June 2010 in the North American PlayStation Store, with a European release the following day. In October 2011, Eurogamer picked up on an Xbox Live Arcade listing for a Joe Danger: Special Edition on the Korea Media Rating Board. The project was officially announced on 3 November; a GameSpot- exclusive trailer was released the same day. Murray said that the Special Edition will include new gameplay modes and characters; another new addition is the \\"Laboratory\\" mode, in which the player must complete unique \\"developer challenges\\". The edition was released on 14 December 2011 and was exclusive to the Xbox 360. Murray stood by his earlier statements criticising Microsoft's platform; he said, \\"Obviously a comment like that isn't meant exactly how it sounds. For probably a few years XBLA was basically the only show in town. If you managed to get your game on there it was almost a guarantee of success. I don't think that's the case now. That isn't Microsoft's fault, and it isn't developers' fault. It's just that a hundred games come out there a year, and of those maybe ten break through and make an impact. The rest don't.\\" He stressed the decision to port the game \\"made business sense\\", and that the team \\"jumped at the chance without even thinking about the economics of it\\". Since the release of Special Edition, a spin-off version for iOS and Android devices has been in development. The team decided not to directly adapt the original game for the new device; Murray told Mike Rose of Gamasutra that \\"simply porting a game is never something I could get excited about, it's soulless work\\". He explained that the team's aim is to create a game with similar graphics to a console game, while also keeping the frame rate at 60 frames per second. The game is being co-developed by Steven Burgess, who previously worked on WiiWare game LostWinds with Frontier Developments. It was given its first public showcase at the Penny Arcade Expo in Boston, Massachusetts, on 7 April. The iOS version, titled Joe Danger Touch, was listed on the iTunes Store on 10 January 2013. A version of the game for the PlayStation Vita was announced on 27 August 2014, containing both levels from the original game and levels exclusive to the PlayStation Vita. It was made available for free on the PlayStation Plus Instant Game Collection service in September 2014. There are 25 playable characters available in the game, as well as a modified level editor. Downloadable content Since the game's initial release, additional downloadable content has been made available. The first patch for the game, dubbed \\"The People's Patch\\", was released in August 2010 adding two features: the ability to upload video replays to YouTube and the ability to share customised courses with those not on the player's friends list. Their absence had been the source of early criticism by reviewers. Other additional features included custom soundtracks, new levels, and alternative costumes. The announcement of the game's expansion coincided with a level- designing competition in which the top five contestants won T-shirts and artwork. Murray said Hello were trying to respond to all suggestions from users, and that they would release a patch addressing \\"every concern we could\\". In November 2010, the team announced four new playable characters, each with a unique appearance and range of moves. Reception=Critical The single-player gameplay mode of Joe Danger was generally well received by critics. The game's accessibility was a source of praise; according to Eric Neigher of 1UP.com, it allows for \\"five-minute sprints\\" of gameplay, although more in-depth options take up more time. IGN's Daemon Hatfield compared the game favourably to Nintendo Entertainment System launch title Excitebike, and said that Joe Danger felt like a Nintendo game. Other critics focused on similarities to Super Mario Bros., such as non-linear level progression (the ability to play levels in any order, providing that the player has earned enough stars to \\"unlock\\" the level), the encouragement to play through multiple times to complete every objective, and the use of platforms. Another influences noted with favour by critics was the combo system, which some compared with the Tony Hawk's series of skateboarding games. Comments were also made on the influence of early Sonic the Hedgehog titles. The cheerful, cartoon-like nature of Joe Danger artwork was well received; Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell said \\"I've worked on games websites for over a decade and not enough games are happy and colourful. This one is. More of this, please, everyone.\\" Opinions were less uniformly complimentary about other modes of the game. Scott Alan Marriott of G4 TV was disappointed with the shortage of options in multiplayer modes, in particular the inability to play against others online. The game's leaderboard feature was another source of criticism, with several reviewers noting severe lag issues. The Daily Telegraph Martin Gaston said \\"it would also have been nice to see the game give dedicated players the opportunity to study from the world's finest by implementing online replays\\", an option not originally included; the decision not to allow sharing custom courses with users outside the player's friend's list was labelled \\"questionable\\" and \\"obtuse\\". Minor criticisms related to the lack of variety in sound design and background scenery. Two months after the initial release, Hello Games' first patch for Joe Danger contained features to cover most critics' concerns. Before its release, Joe Danger was up for the \\"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\\" and for the \\"Technical Excellence\\" award at the 2010 Independent Games Festival at the Game Developers Conference, losing to Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine and Limbo respectively. The game was unsuccessfully nominated for the \\"Best New Download IP\\" award at the same year's Develop Industry Excellence Awards in Brighton, instead winning the studio the \\"Best New Studio\\" and \\"Micro Studio\\" awards. It received a nomination for \\"Best PlayStation Network Exclusive Game\\" at the PlayStation Network Gamers' Choice Awards in March 2011 but was beaten by Dead Nation; it appeared in the \\"Best Downloadable Game\\" category at GamesMaster Golden Joystick Awards in September 2011, but missed out to Minecraft. The same month, Play placed it top of its \\"50 Best PSN Games\\" feature, ahead of titles such as Braid and The Last Guy. Commercial Joe Danger sold over 50,000 units in its first week on sale on the PlayStation Network. The team announced at the Develop Conference 2010 that they broke even on the day of release. Based on research published by Gamasutra's Ryan Langley, who used the number of unique entries on a game's online leaderboard to estimate the number of sales, it sold more than 68,000 units in its first month of release. In July, the same statistics indicated a further 24,000 units had been sold, bringing the two-month total to over 92,000. The next month saw at least 16,000 new players. Exact sales figures are uncertain because only a limited number of scores can be held within a leaderboard for PlayStation Network games, but on the basis of these numbers the game sold at least 108,000 units in its first three months. Murray said that as Joe Danger does not allow scores of zero to make the leaderboards, the true quantity sold was likely to be substantially higher than indicated. In December 2011, PlayStation Network's senior director Susan Panico named Joe Danger the year's third best-selling game to be supported by Sony's Publishing Fund behind Hoard and Tales from Space: About a Blob. Sales for the Xbox Live Arcade version were less impressive; Langley's statistics indicate that 8,300 units sold in the first week, and by December's end that figure rested at around 16,800. At least 6,800 further sales were noted with the same technique in January 2012, and by March the overall figure was thought to be least 37,500 units. Sequel Several months after Joe Danger release, Hello Games began to advertise positions on their website, indicating that work was proceeding on a new project. New staff were added and towards the end of the year the organisation moved its offices. After an announcement on Hello Games' website a week prior, Joe Danger: The Movie was presented for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne in August 2011. Murray said the game is \\"kind of\\" a sequel to Joe Danger, but that he envisioned it big enough to dwarf the original. Renamed Joe Danger 2: The Movie, the game was released 14 September 2012, and was the last of Hello Games' projects to be based around the character.

The first recording sessions were held in Spain, and the album was completed in California, at the Hitsville West studio in December 1988. The 1980s saw a period of very few album releases from Shirley Bassey: All by Myself (1982); the acclaimed album I Am What I Am (1984); her recording of James Bond themes from 1987, The Bond Collection, (which had met with problems and remained unreleased until 1992); and La Mujer. In 1987 the Swiss electronica band Yello approached Shirley Bassey about recording a song with them. The track \\"The Rhythm Divine\\" was a minor hit in the UK, charting at number 54 in the UK singles chart but achieving more success on mainland Europe.\\"The Rhythm Divine on Official Charts CompanyAustrian singles chart The success of the single released by Mercury Records, led to an album deal on the label. This is the second album of non-English recordings made by Shirley Bassey, the late 1960s and early 1970s had seen her record several tracks in Italian. As preparation for the recording Shirley had twenty hours of Spanish lessons.Shirley Bassey, liner notes, original CD, La Mujer The album brings together new Spanish material and new versions in Spanish of such Shirley Bassey classics as \\"Without You\\" (\\"Sin Ti\\") and \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" (\\"Hoy No Tengo Nada\\"). Spanish lyrics were provided by Leonardo Schultz, who also wrote the new material appearing on the album. The album's debut was a performance by Bassey at the \\"Vi√±a Del Mar Song Festival\\" in Chile in February, 1989, and further appearances in South America followed. The performance in Chile was filmed and an edited version featured on a CD/DVD release in 2004, the set called Super Estellas del Amor features five tracks on CD from the album and seven live performances on DVD. This release also includes performances from Matt Monro and Demis Roussos that were also recorded in Spanish and produced by Leonardo Schultz. The album was mainly marketed for the Spanish speaking countries in South America, the US and mainland Europe, very little promotion was undertaken in the UK for this release. The original releases for La Mujer in Germany and the US (on LP, cassette and CD) featured the same artwork as its South American counterpart, but differing layouts.

As in all Plasmodium species, P. hermani has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are birds. Description This species was first described in 1975 by Telford and Forrester in a wild turkeyTelford S.R., Jr. and Forrester D.J. (1975) Plasmodium (Huffia) hermani sp. n. from wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in Florida. J. Euk. Microbiol. 22 (3) 324-328 The presence and degree of pigmentation vary with maturity of the host cell. Host cell nuclei may be displaced, but are not distorted, except slightly by pressure from the parasite. The asexual stages parasitize all cells in the erythrocyte series. In heavy infections the parasites occur predominantly in erythroblasts and their precursors. Schizonts are rounded with 6‚Äì14 nuclei arranged peripherally as a rosette. Infected cells are often rounded and enlarged. Gametocytes are elongate and slender with irregular margins and are found exclusively in erythrocytes. The pigment is dispersed in black granules throughout the cytoplasm. The host cells may be somewhat distorted in shape by lateral hypertrophy. Differential diagnosis Plasmodium hermani can be distinguished from Plasmodium durae by *low level (< 6%) parasitemia *nonlethal in turkey poults *absence of phanerozoites in capillary endothelium of the brain and viscera *inability to infect chicks (Gallus domesticus) Mature gametocytes of P. durae also exhibits the following characteristics which are not found those of P. hermani *tend to lie obliquely within the host cell *displace the nucleus to one pole of the cell *possess one or more clumps of clear pigment granules Plasmodium hermani resembles Plasmodium elongatum in *schizogony in all types of erythrocyte precursors *concentration of schizonts in heavy infections in bone marrow and spleen *gametocyte morphology *gametocytes occurring in erythrocytes only It can be distinguished from Plasmodium elongatum by *its lack of infectivity to passeriform and anseriform hosts *by the strong immune response which develops in infected birds Geographical occurrence This species is found in Florida, USA.

Left: the old mill building The Wipperm√ºhle was a watermill in the historic landscape of Vorsfelder Werder in the North German state of Lower Saxony. It was first mentioned in the records in 1366 and was finally closed in 1936. It was driven by the Wipperaller stream which drained the old pond known as the Wipperteich. Today the old mill lies within the city of Wolfsburg immediately on its boundary with the municipality of R√ºhen (Gifhorn district).  Location  In previous centuries the mill lay off the beaten track. The old military road from Vorsfelde to Brome ran past several hundred metres to the west. Since the road was moved in the 19th century it has run through the middle of the mill yard, which has one building on either side of the road. On 19th century maps there are several buildings in the shape of a small hamlet. Today the state road from Wolfsburg-Wendschott to Brechtorf carries a large amount of through traffic that runs past the old watermill.  Name  The name Wipperm√ºhle comes from the name of the stream that drives it, the Wipperaller. This name in turn is derived from the river it flows into, the Aller, prefixed by the word Wipper. Wipper comes from the Old Slavic word vepri which means Eber or wild boar. The Slavic tribe known as the Wends, who lived here on the Vorsfelder Werder until the Middle Ages, named many villages and streams in their own language.  Mill  The mill has been in existence since the Middle Ages as a watermill, powered by the Wipperaller stream. This stream rises on the ridge of the Vorsfelder Werder near Hoitlingen. It still drains the gently sloping, expanse of the Wipperteich bowl today and flows down into the Dr√∂mling. After about 11 km the Wipperaller discharges into the Aller near Wolfsburg-Vorsfelde. Because the Wipperaller is only a small stream, it is likely that the Wipperteich had already been dammed by the Middle Ages. The exit to the pond enables the mill to be operated all year round even in times of low precipitation. In 1841 however the pond did run dry.  History  The Wipperteich (1829) drove the Wipperm√ºhle (red dot, lower right) The first recorded mention of the Wipperm√ºhle is in 1366 in a list of levies drawn up by the town of Brunswick, which says: De mole up deme wipperbeke ghift VI.sol (The mill on the Wipperbach gives 6 schillings). The villages of the Vorsfelder Werder were required to pay levies to the town of Brunswick, which the Duke William of Brunswick-L√ºneburg retained as a pledge. During the Thirty Years War, that saw the areas like the Vorsfelder Werder ravaged by plundering, devastation and famine, the watermill collapsed. In 1654 it was named once more in an enfeoffment. The mill owner, Heinrich Wipperm√ºller borrowed 30 talers for six years after the end of the war from Vorsfelder citizen Hans Hoppe to rebuild the mill and paid the tax with grazing rights on his meadows. In 1658 it was recorded in the documents that the miller had paid 25 groschen house interest for his mill, the property tax of its day. From 1674 the miller was regularly reminded to keep the Wipperaller free of vegetation and, in 1709, issued with a warning about it. In 1850 the mill burned down and was rebuilt 50 metres further south at its present location. In 1936 the mill was closed. Electrically driven mills were more profitable. After the end of the Second World War in 1945, former forced labourers killed the last miller near his mill as they plundered it.

The Pennsylvania Railroad in 1914 needed a steam locomotive to haul the passenger trains that the smaller E class Atlantics (4-4-2) could not handle. The 1737 was the first K4s ever built for the PRR. In passenger service, the 1737 would handle passenger trains, like the railroads flagship passenger train, the Broadway Limited. In the 1930s, as the Pennsylvania Railroad had increased passenger service time tables, the trains became longer and heavier than a single K4s could handle, necessitating double-heading with a second engine. The \\"Standard Railroad Of The World\\" made attempts to replace the 1737 and its sisters with larger, more powerful classes including: K5, S1, and the T1, none of which were successful, thus the K4s continued hauling passenger trains until the Pennsylvania Railroad replaced steam locomotives with the increasingly popular and less costly diesel-electric locomotives in 1957. Commuter service The 1737 was no stranger to commuter service. The New York and Long Branch Railroad in South Amboy, New Jersey used the K4s to haul commuter trains. When the famous electric locomotive, the Pennsylvania Railroad GG1, would bring the trains from New York City's Penn Station, the K4s would take over the train and make the run from the South Amboy station to Bay Head, New Jersey. Fate The 1737 was originally slated to be preserved as part of the PRR's Historical Collection at the Northumberland, PA Roundhouse. However, by the late 1950s, 1737 had deteriorated to a point where the PRR deemed the locomotive to be too far gone to preserve. Instead, the PRR quietly took another K-4, PRR 3750 and renumbered it to represent the 1737 while the real 1737 was cut up for scrap.

Znojmo Castle is a castle in the city of Znojmo, a historic city in Moravia, Czech Republic.  History  The Znojmo Castle was initially a wooden structure built by the P≈ôemyslid Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia, and completed around 1080. The structure was intended to replace an old castle across the Granice Valley, as part of an attempt at strengthening the defenses along the river Dyje against Austrian attack. From the new castle the river valley and surrounding area could be observed. However, in 1140, the wooden castle was besieged and destroyed. Towards the end of the 12th Century the castle was reconstructed, this time in stone, and included a deep moat. The entrance to the castle was guarded by an octagonal tower called the Robber's Tower, which collapsed due to neglect at the end of the 19th Century. The Royal City of Znojmo was founded by King Ottokar I of Bohemia and the Znojmo castle became the city's stronghold, connected to the city walls and containing a strong garrison of soldiers. The importance of Znojmo Castle diminished near the end of the 17th century, after the Turkish threat was averted by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Roman Emperor Joseph I redeemed the castle in 1710. The front end of the castle was sold to local citizens and became the town brewery, producing Hostan beer. The rear of the castle came into the hands of the Lords of Deblin who built a Baroque chateau on the space, which still stands. The only remains of the castle used by the P≈ôemysl dukes is the Romanesque Rotunda of Saint Catherine, the interior of which is covered with 11th-century frescoes depicting biblical scenes and illustrating the life of P≈ôemysl.

It stars Chris Jericho, Richard Christy, Tammin Sursok, and Alex Neustaedter. Plot The film opens in the small town of Shiloh, where two boys on bicycles ride through the woods up to the gates of the legendary Albino Farm. The oldest goes in and the youngest stays outside. The oldest boasts he isn't scared of anything, and then a figure leaps out and drags him into the woods. The film cuts to Stacey (Tammin Sursok), Melody (Alicia Lagano), Brian (Nick Richey), and Sanjay (Sunkrish Bala) driving down a forest road, working on a history research project about backwoods American customs and legends. They almost hit someone, whom they initially take to be a young boy, scraping roadkill off the asphalt. To their sudden fright, the \\"child\\" turns out to be a dwarf who turns his head, with an unsettling countenance. When they walk back to their SUV, they see they have a flat tire. They keep driving until they see a gas station with a local man (Duane Whitaker) out front, who is blind. They talk to him and he talks eccentrically and incoherently, with a biblical turn. They acquire a tire to replace the flat one; Brian, the jerk of the group, deliberately underpays the blind man. The students continue their trip and stop at a white tent pitched in a field. Melody and Brian head up to investigate and are greeted by another local with a harelip who tells them about the Albino Farm and alludes that it may be a legend. There's a revival meeting in the tent, and the harelipped man strongly suggest that they receive salvation. The foursome keeps driving until they reach the old-fashioned town of Shiloh. They stop at a diner and eat, as night falls. They're served by a friendly, buxom waitress whom Brian and Sanjay knock themselves out over until they note that she has deformed hands, with clawlike fingers. Brian and Melody go looking for the Albino Farm while Sanjay and Stacey talk to an old woman inside an old church who suspiciously and unconvincingly tells them there is no such thing as the Albino Farm. Retreating to a back room, Stacey and Sanjay enter to see the woman breastfeeding a hideously deformed baby. Meanwhile, Melody and Brian ask a small boy, who communicates via chalkboard, where the Albino Farm is. He tells them to ask a group of unruly and somewhat disgusting teens in a car. There they meet Levi (Chris Jericho) and his two deaf friends, who agree to take them to the Albino Farm for twenty-five dollars and a view of Melody's breasts. After a minor argument, Melody reluctantly agrees, and they head off to the Albino Farm. The teens drive crazily, causing Melody to vomit. They stop in front of the gates to the farm and get into an argument. A fight between Levi and Brian breaks out and the teens drive away after flipping them off. Brian and Melody enter an old house and Brian sees a person and chases after them, with Melody following. Brian gets his leg caught in a bear trap. Sanjay and Stacey go looking for their friends and ask the same boy for directions. After driving to the farm with the boy as a guide, who bikes away after they arrive. They find a hysterical Melody, and she leads them to where she had last saw Brian, but he is gone. He had been captured and brought to a house inhabited by strange, horribly deformed people‚Äîone with a tongue protruding from a rosebud mouth, one with a pinhead, and several of them pig- like. The \\"Pig Bitch\\" (Bianca Barnett) reveals her cleavage and does a striptease for Brian, who rejects her. She then takes a meat hook and shoves it through Brian's mouth and cheek. Melody, Sanjay, and Stacey, after hearing their car alarm, run back to their car to see that it has been oddly vandalized. Sanjay's camera, luckily, catches the perpetrator, who had also taken their luggage. The three go searching for Brian and find their luggage in a clearing, along with other people's. They then see a tree hung with skulls and bones. Going ballistic, Melody runs back through the woods, only to get attacked by the deformed pig people and have her neck snapped. Stacey and Sanjay find a dilapidated shack and enter cautiously. They see Brian in a chair with his back to them and approach him quietly, only to realize that he's dead. The pig people arrive at the shack and barricade the door. One of them breaks through the wall, but Sanjay hits him in the arm with an axe. The shack catches fire; Stacey and Sanjay flee into the woods. They discover Melody hanging upside down in the bone tree. They run, and the crazed, deformed clan chases them. They hide behind a tree, letting the killers pass without seeing them, but the killers wind up finding them and force them to continue running. They soon bump into the Pig Bitch, who knocks them out and captures them. They wake up in a cave and find their arms sewn together. They hobble away and stumble upon the pig people's cave campsite. One sees them, and the pair race away. They light a torch and try to rip their arms apart. They gorily succeed. They try to escape, but are attacked by the Pig Bitch. Stacey jabs the torch into her face, forcing her to let go, and they get away. Sanjay ends up falling into a chasm. Stacey climbs down into the chasm and consoles, him and then turns on some propane tanks when Pig Bitch attacks Stacey with a meat hook. Stacey and Pig Bitch fight. The rest of the monsters arrive, and Sanjay comes to and reaches for the torch. Pig Bitch and Stacey choke each other, and Stacey rips out some of Pig Bitch's hair. Stacey then picks up the meat hook and slashes Pig Bitch's throat before repeatedly stabbing her with the hook. Sanjay then heroically lights the torch, killing himself and a good number of the deformed people, and Stacey runs out of the cave as an explosion ensues, knocking her out. Stacey wakes up as dawn breaks and runs into the woods before reaching a field. She drops the meat hook as she comes upon the same white tent where a church congregation is meeting. She hysterically runs in and tries to explain what has happened. The preacher, who takes off his sunglasses and reveals abnormally light (albino) eyes, laughs with the rest of the congregation. The congregation is composed of people who are deformed as well‚Äînot as horribly as the Albino Farm residents, but in the unsettling way of a freak show‚ÄîSiamese twin sisters, another suckling deformed baby, a man with a stretched-out smile, another with a fat, pasty face, and the dwarf encountered earlier. As Stacey cries, \\"My God, its the whole town!\\" the preacher quotes the passage about the sins of the fathers visiting the children. The audience, visibly amused, sings on, with Stacey, who by now is completely over the edge, grins widely and manically.

It was also filmed in nearby Warrensburg and just outside Willard. The film is loosely based on a legend about college students exploring to the Ozark Mountains, who never came back from the Springlawn Farm. Make-up and special effects The costumes and make-up were created by special effects and makeup artist Jason Barnett.  Release  The film was released by MTI Home Video on September 22, 2009 with a time from 90 minutes,New Releases - Albino Farm R (MPAA) / MTI Home Video / DVD the German FSK 18 DVD runs 85 minutes. Reception Dread Central panned the film, awarding it a score of 1 1/2 out of 5, writing \\"Albino Farm can be summed up in one word: ‚Äúunremarkable‚Äù. An unremarkable script, unremarkable score, unremarkable cinematography, unremarkable (and even occasionally downright poor) editing and direction, and a swimming-through-treacle first two acts all conspire to remove any possibility of a recommendation. Once the violence kicks off it's relatively entertaining, but I wouldn't blame you if you can't make it that far\\". Kurt Dahlke from DVD Talk gave the film a negative review, complimenting the film's make-up but criticized the film's lack of originality, and overuse of teen horror clich√©s.

It is the biggest existing private park in Hong Kong.The Dragon Garden, Time Out, 12 February 2010 This modern-day Chinese garden features architectural design from the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties and is intricately tinted with touches of Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian elements. There are over 100 plant species in the garden, and it is home to more than 30 of likely the largest Buddhist pines in the city. It is also open to the public for guided tours. History In 1949, Dr. Lee Iu Cheung purchased a barren hill in the New Territories from the Hong Kong Government. He spent the next 20 years planning, designing and landscaping the garden. In July 2006, news surfaced that Dragon Garden was to be sold to developers after 60 years of private maintenance. Hong Kong's Conservancy Association appealed to the Town Planning Board against its demolition, claiming that the mansion ought to be kept as an edifice of heritage. On 25 September 2006, the garden was recognized as a Grade II Heritage Site by the Hong Kong Antiquities and Monuments Office. In January 2008, Lee Shiu, youngest son of Dr. Lee Iu Cheung, expressed frustration towards the Hong Kong Government because it was stalling the finalization of its official agreement with him. Lee planned to present Dragon Garden to Hong Kong as a public park. However, the stalemate resulted from the government's reluctance to shoulder the cost of the garden's maintenance, which included restoring the garden's structures and installing visitor facilities to allow public touring. The Development Bureau said that the government welcomed the proposal of the Dragon Garden's donation to the public, but still needed more time to further negotiate with Lee on the best way to revitalize the garden. Description The Dragon Garden integrates architectural features of both the East and the West. Apart from the characteristics of Sung, Ming and Qing dynasties and the influences from Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, it also incorporates some Western elements into the architecture. For example, the two colorful glass windows in the ancestral hall resemble a Catholic church. However, the clouds, birds and rectangular patterns on the windows are in Chinese style. Yet, the oil paintings are also Western-influenced. Like other traditional Chinese gardens, the architecture of the Dragon Garden symbolizes the unity of man and nature. Following Chinese feng shui tradition, the order of nature is maintained in the garden so that it does not look wild or chaotic. The landscape is a miniature of the natural landscape with hills and valleys, bridges and rivers, winding paths, rock gardens and plants. The roofs of the ancestral hall and the pavilion are curved with the four corners pointing upward, which imitates the contour of nature. The wide and flat architectural design contrasts with the tall and slender buildings of the West. The preservation of the garden's natural environment is inspired by the Chinese value of living in nature with fear and respect, never trying to intimidate it or challenge its power. The design of the Dragon Garden also follows the concept of harmony and balance. If divided into two equal halves, the ancestral hall and the pavilion appear identical from the inside and outside. The animals on the four corners of the pavilion are mascots of luck and intend to protect people in the house against evil spirits. Technically, however, the little animals are used to cover the nail holes that secure the half-cylinder shaped tiles to the eaves. This prevents the wood structure from rotting. In many ways, the architecture of the Garden is a reflection of Dr. Lee's life and the influences he received. The balanced blend of Chinese and Western influences reveal Dr. Lee's cultural upbringing as a Chinese as well as the time he spent studying in the United States and interacting with British officials in Hong Kong. Ownership= Founder ‚Äì Dr. Lee Iu Cheung Born in Hong Kong to a migrant family from Guangdong Province, China, Lee Iu-cheung (1896‚Äì1976) spent his childhood in the Sheung Wan district. Lee was awarded the Lugard Scholarship upon passing all his Cambridge University local examinations held in Hong Kong. He then joined the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 1913. Lee left for Cornell University, where he enrolled in a special study on River Conservancy and Sanitary engineering in 1919. However, upon the death of his father, he abandoned his studies and returned to Hong Kong, where Lee became a part-time lecturer in Hydraulic Engineering at his alma mater. Dr. Lee served as a permanent advisor of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals for 29 years. He received a Member of the Order of the British Empire) from King George VI in 1949. He was awarded an O.B.E (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1952 and a C.B.E (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II. He was also conferred a LL.D. (honoris causa) by HKU in 1969.Brief Information 1444 Historic Buildings (pg 226). Dragon Garden Charitable Trust In July 2006, Dr. Lee Iu Cheung's granddaughter, Cynthia Lee Hong Yee founded the Dragon Garden Charitable Trust after the garden was saved from being bought over by developers. Instigated by the preservation of the garden, the Trust aims to \\"preserve cultural and heritage property in Hong Kong, for public benefit.\\" The Trust holds a number of activities, including guided walks, thematic talks, heritage exhibitions and sponsorships of student conservation projects. The Trust actively seeks to re-examine Hong Kong's outdated Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance in order to protect and preserve Hong Kong's cultural assets. Trust sponsored events Bi-city Biennale of Urbanism \\\\ Architecture 2009= The Trust was an Events Partner of the Hong Kong & Shenzhen Bi-city Biennale of Urbanism \\\\ Architecture 2009, which was held in West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade from December 2009 to February 2010. Its sponsorship to the biennale followed its motto of elevating public concern on heritage preservation. =Dragon Garden Art Exhibition 2010= In March 2010, the Dragon Garden Charitable Trust organised a fund-raising Art Exhibition at the Cat Gallery in Sheung Wan, where featured artists were commissioned to draw their inspiration from and present their vision of the Dragon Garden. All of the artworks were sold at the exhibition in aid of the conservation of the Dragon Garden heritage. Kay Tse, a famous local singer, helped the charity gain publicity as she worked with Olaf Mueller, one of the featured artists in his photo shoots and attended the opening of the Art Exhibition. Outlook Meanwhile, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department has also expressed concern over the Trust's proposal as it involves not only the restoration of existing buildings as a heritage site but also the construction of new facilities for exhibition, organic farming, wedding and educational purposes. The fixed costs of implementing this proposal approximate HK$30 million, as evaluated by Wai-hung Cheng, surveyor and member of the Advisory Committee on Revitalisation of Historic Buildings. Movies The Dragon Garden was featured in The Man with the Golden Gun, a James Bond movie released in 1974, starring Roger Moore as James Bond. There are about 20 minutes of scenes with Dragon Garden as a backdrop. (movie clip). And was featured in Noble House Access Dragon Garden is located along Castle Peak Road, not near any MTR station. The closest is Tsuen Wan Station on the Tsuen Wan Line. At the station, the road is situated at the southern exit.

He is the Carl G. Hempel and William K. Frankena Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan. Education and career Sklar was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1938 and educated at Oberlin College (B.A., 1954‚Äì1958) and Princeton University (M.A., Ph.D., 1959‚Äì1964) where he worked with Hilary Putnam. He worked at Swarthmore College from 1962 to 1966, first as an instructor and then as an assistant professor. He then worked as an assistant professor at Princeton University until 1968. Since 1968, he has been at the University of Michigan, where he is now a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus. He has held visiting professorships at the University of Illinois (1963), the University of Pennsylvania (1968), Harvard University (1970), UCLA (1973) and Wayne State University (1977). Philosophical work He specializes in the philosophy of physics, approaching a wide range of issues from a position best described as highly skeptical of many of the metaphysical conclusions commonly drawn in the physical sciences. He advocates the 'MIMO' (metaphysics in, metaphysics out) principle, claiming that much of the metaphysical content of interpreted theories in the special sciences arises from metaphysical assumptions made during their formulation. Personal life While at Swarthmore, Sklar met and married Swarthmore undergraduate Elizabeth Sherr Sklar, who would later become an English professor at Wayne State University. Their daughter is mathematician Jessica Sklar.

Pre-war Francis (Frank) Kinloch Huger, a son of Benjamin Huger and Elizabeth Celestine Pinckney, was born in Norfolk, Virginia in 1837. Like his father, Huger attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from west Point in 1860 and was assigned to the 10th U.S. Infantry as a second lieutenant. Huger resigned his commission on May 21, 1861 to join the Confederate cause. Civil War service Frank Huger entered the Confederate service, as did his father. Commissioned a captain, Huger led the Norfolk Light Artillery. The battery was attached to the brigade of Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright in the elder Huger‚Äôs division in the Seven Days Battles. At the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Fredericksburg his battery was attached to the division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson. He was absent from the Battle of Antietam, when it was led by Lt. C. R. Phelps. Huger‚Äôs guns were involved, together with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Cadmus Wilcox, in the Battle of Salem Church. Huger was promoted to major on March 2, 1863. At first, he was second in command of a battalion of artillery led by Col. Edward Porter Alexander. Alexander welcomed Huger, describing him later as \\"my glorious & beloved Frank Huger, who never shirked a care or danger or grumbled over a hardship in his life...\\"Alexander, p. 194. In that capacity, Huger served in the Battle of Chancellorsville, including bombarding federal lines from high ground at Hazel Grove on May 3, 1863.Wise, pp. 508-509. Huger was sent on May 4 to support the division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson in the Battle of Salem Church.Wise, pp. 534, 537. His guns were among those that fired the last shots of the battle the next day, as the Union VI Corps retreated across the Rappahannock River.Wise, p. 541. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Huger was involved in supporting the attack of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps on the federal left on July 2.Wise, p. 646. During July 3 Huger took immediate command of the guns as Alexander was assigned responsibility for the bombardment preceding Pickett's Charge.Wise, p. 664. Huger went West with Longstreet's Corps, but he arrived too late for the Battle of Chickamauga. When Longstreet moved into eastern Tennessee to evict federal forces, Alexander served as his chief of artillery. Huger consequently commanded Alexander‚Äôs battalion in the Knoxville Campaign. When Alexander became the permanent chief of corps artillery in late 1863, Huger officially took over command of the battalion.Wise, p. 720. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel shortly thereafter, being promoted on February 27, 1864.Alexander, p. 338. Huger's battalion served in the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. In Alexander‚Äôs absence, he was temporarily in charge of the artillery of the First Corps posted near Elliott's Salient at the time of the Battle of the Crater.Wise, pp. 846, 866-867 At the height of the Union attack on July 30, 1864, following the explosion of the mine under the Salient, Huger was seen helping work a gun along with members of Alexander's staff.Alexander, p. 466. Huger was promoted to the rank of colonel on February 18, 1865. He was captured during the Battle of Sailors' Creek by Union cavalry led by Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, a fellow West Point graduate (Class of 1861). Huger was treated by Custer more like a guest than a prisoner.Alexander, p. 522 describes the capture and its aftermath in detail. Post war After the war, Frank Huger became involved in railroads.Sifakis, p. 324. He died in 1897. NotesReferences * Alexander, Edward Porter, Fighting for the Confederacy, ed. Gary W.

Her international efforts focus on grassroots, community-based female diplomacy, namely empowering women as agents of change and a critical driving force in stabilizing an insecure world. She and Cheryl Benard contributed the piece \\"Benevolent despotism versus the contemporary feminist movement\\" to the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, edited by Robin Morgan. Career Schlaffer started Women without Borders in 2001, headquartered in Vienna, which partners with local organizations in various countries to implement a number of integrated projects that aim to strengthen capabilities through education, collaboration and self-confidence: key tools for establishing a female power base in countries in crisis and transition. In 2008 she launched the Sisters Against Violent Extremism (SAVE) campaign, focusing Women without Border‚Äôs efforts to the security arena, organizing women (and men) internationally to take part in a research-based, family-centered counter- radicalization platform. Schlaffer‚Äôs work seeks to propagate a security paradigm in which women serve on the front lines; one in which women‚Äôs talents, skills, and unique position within the family structure are used to shape a new security architecture. In implementing the SAVE platform, Schlaffer has partnered with organizations in 16 different countries including India (and Kashmir), Pakistan, Tajikistan, Indonesia, Zanzibar and Nigeria to set up \\"MotherSchools.\\" These series of weekly training meetings, run by female community leaders, empower mothers with the competence and confidence to safeguard the young from the threat of violent extremism and the lure of radicalization. Furthermore, these meetings allow for collaboration, mutual support, and shared understanding. A regular contributor to various news outlets including Huffington Post and Reuters Trust Law blogs, Schlaffer‚Äôs efforts and research focus on gender and counter-terrorism strategies, peace- building through dialogue, and examining the role of civil society in improving the security architecture. In 2013, Schlaffer, in collaboration with Dr. Ulrich Kropiunigg, conducted the first empirical research study into the potential of mothers to recognize early warning signs of radicalization in their sons and the needed tools to respond effectively. This study was supported by the Austrian Fund for Scientific Research. Additionally Schlaffer has produced a number of short films highlighting female change-makers as well as perpetrators and survivors of terrorist acts. Her recent film, Your Mother, features the testimonies of mothers of sons who harmed or intended to harm others in the name of Jihad. The film is used as an education tool to raise awareness in communities where radicalism is propagated. Schlaffer is a regular speaker in diverse settings: from TED talks, the Hedayah Center of Excellence, the Omega Institute, the Global Center on Cooperative Security, the Europe-wide Radicalisation Awareness Network to the OSCE and various United Nations branches. Women without Borders under her leadership has been lauded by both government and independent agencies, particularly surrounding its efforts to empower women in combatting extremism as an alternative security strategy. In 2005 she was awarded the Kaethe Leichter Austrian State Prize for Gender Equality and Research. In 2011 Schlaffer was named one of Newsweek‚Ä≤s \\"150 Movers and Shakers\\" and in 2010 she was named \\"21 Leaders of the 21st Century\\" by Women‚Äôs eNews. Recently she was included on the Daily Beast‚Ä≤s 2014 List of the World‚Äôs Women of Consequence and spoke at the 2014 Women of the World Summit at the Lincoln Center in New York about SAVE‚Äôs work in galvanizing women and mothers to counter the increasing radicalization of youth. In 2012 she spoke at TEDxWomen in Washington DC, alongside two members of SAVE‚Äôs partner organizations in Pakistan and India promoting reconciliation and collaboration among groups of women with histories of political conflict. Former Secretary Hillary Clinton has twice highlighted SAVE‚Äôs contributions to the field. Most recently Schlaffer was awarded the Aenne Burda Award for Creative Leadership at the 2015 Digital Life Design (DLD) Conference in Munich. Schlaffer currently serves as Civil Society Board Member for the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF). She was the former Director of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Politics and Interpersonal Relations, Vienna (1980‚Äì2001), and Chairperson of the Austrian Foundation for World Population and International Cooperation (2004‚Äì11). She is also the co- author of a number of titles covering themes of politics and gender relationships published in German. She earned a doctorate in Communication Science and Sociology from the University of Vienna (1972) and completed psychoanalytical training at the Children's Hospital in Vienna (1986).

Originally designed as a university project, it was expanded to a full game and released for Microsoft Windows as free download in 2005. Gameplay The player controls a girl who awakens in a coffin in a darkened room. She has no memory of how she got there, and opens the windows to reveal that she is in fact in space. The player must solve the puzzles and move from room to room, piecing together what happened to the crew of the station. Along the way, she discovers logs from a technician named Arthur Anderson documenting the mystery of the main laboratory, the titular \\"white chamber\\". Release history The first release of the game was released for free in 2005, and featured four endings depending on the player's choices during the game. It originally had no voice acting, but several animated sections, including an opening and ending. The inclusion of anime sequences meant the game was over 300 MB to download. The size was one of the contributing factors to the fact that it was originally available exclusively through bittorrent. In an article for PCZone Richard Perrin stated that using bittorrent allowed them to reduce their bandwidth costs greatly. The game is no longer available for direct download on the Studio Trophis site, due to unexpected increases in traffic. There is however, a download link on the site page. The game has been updated multiple times and is now at version 1.7. It features eight endings and the text in nine languages, English, Czech, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Russian and voice acting in either English or German. The game's source code and assets have been released under the CC BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license. That means anyone is free to share and modify the game as long as Studio Trophis is credited, it is not for commercial gain, and that the result is made available under a similar license (\\"Freeware\\"). The game's engine (\\"Wintermute\\") source code was later released under the MIT license in 2013 on Bitbucket. Around 2014 a remastered version was announced for commercial re-release, by Richard Perrin's successor company. Reception The game has received very positive critical reactions. The New York Times described it as \\"Grisly and intriguing, with logical puzzles and surprising plot twists, Chamber is a first-rate garage game.\\" The Inventory magazine called it \\"A genuinely suspenseful horror game in a marvelously drawn anime style. All in all this game is a marvelous first outing by Studio Trophis.\\" and gave 80/100 points. IndieGames.com included it in their list of top adventure games of for 2006. As of May 2006 the game has been downloaded over 100,000 times and has featured on many magazines across the world (including the UK's best-selling SFX magazine and The New York Times) and appeared often on cover discs.

Proc Indian Natn Sci Acad 82 No. 4 September 2016 pp. 1325-1338 He is counted among the doyens of geology in independent India and revered as a leading scientist from Andhra Pradesh. He studied and taught geology at Andhra University, India; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California; Oxford University, United Kingdom, University of Western Ontario, Canada; University of Sagar, India; University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Mozambique. He has served as the Dean and Director of Centre for Advanced Study in Geology, University of Sagar, India; Head of Department of Geology, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Director, State Mining Corporation, Tanzania and Adviser on Environment and Technology, Mozambique. He also served as Consultant to UNDP, World Bank, Louis Berger Inc., and SIDA, while in Mozambique. Education Aswathanarayana had a difficult childhood because of poverty. He was a student of the Municipal High School, Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, India. He nearly missed the mathematics examination in the Secondary School Leaving Certificate of the then Madras Presidency when he reached the examination hall 30 minutes late, as he had to walk barefoot in the hot sun for a considerable distance. He scored 100% marks in mathematics and set up a record for aggregate marks in the examination. Despite his meritorious performance in the high school, he almost gave up the idea of going to college because his parents could not afford it. Ultimately his mother had to sell whatever jewels she had to send him to college and then to university after a gap of time. It was the vision of his mentor, Prof. C. Mahadevan of Andhra University, that launched him on his doctoral studies in what later came to be known as nuclear geology. Geology in those days was just hammer and hand lens affair. He did doctoral research in radioactivity studies using the equipment that he built himself with the help of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. It was the first doctoral thesis on nuclear geology in India and was examined by Arthur Holmes, F.R.S. of UK, J. Tuzo Wilson, F.R.S., of Canada, and Louis Ahrens then at Oxford. Later he did post-doctoral work on lead isotopes with Clair Patterson in Caltech in 1957, and Rb ‚Äì Sr and K ‚Äì Ar dating with S. Moorbath in Oxford, England, in 1963. Career In the course of a career of teaching, research and institutional capacity building spanning more than half a century, Aswathanarayana has been associated with Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, India, which was his alma mater; California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA; Oxford University, Oxford, England; University of Western Ontario, London, Canada; University of Saugar, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, India; University of Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo, Mozambique. He has served as the Dean and Director of Centre of Advanced Study in Geology, University of Sagar; Head of Department of Geology, University of Dar es Salaam; Director, State Mining Corporation, Tanzania and Adviser on Environment and Technology, Mozambique. He also served as Consultant to UNDP, World Bank, Louis Berger Inc., and SIDA, while in Mozambique. He was a UGC National Fellow, India (1976‚Äì79); UGC National Lecturer, India and UNIDO Consultant on Non-Metallic Minerals, Vienna (1988). Geoscience and social welfare Aswathanarayana's exposure to the extremely severe human problems endemic in Africa convinced him of the need to switch to the application of geoscience to human welfare. Using geochemical and isotopic tools, he and his Tanzanian and Finnish associates could identify the pathways of geoenvironment-induced endemicity of diseases, such as fluorosis, stomach cancer and goitre. His most significant contribution to the advancement of science lay in the original way he did high ‚Äì quality science in the process of developing paradigms for improving the quality of life of the ordinary people in Africa. Thus, his work entitled \\"Innovative use of people-participatory technologies for poverty alleviation and improvement of the quality of life in Chamanculo, a slum area near Maputo, Mozambique\\" has been chosen by the Third World Network of Scientific Organizations (now Consortium on Science, Technology and Innovation for the South), Trieste, Italy and UNDP, New York, as an outstanding example of \\"Innovation in Development in the Third World\\". Mahadevan International Centre for Water Resources Management After returning to India, he got instituted the Mahadevan International Centre for Water Resources Management of which he has been the Founder and Honorary Director. The Centre was formally established on 6 May 2001, with the co-operation of Prof. G.O.P. Obasi, the then Secretary-General, WMO, Geneva. The purpose of the Centre is to serve as a clearinghouse for water sciences and technologies in the developing countries. It is modelled after the Abdus Salam ICTP, Trieste, Italy, in its ethos, and mode of functioning. Like ICTP, the Mahadevan Centre offers a series of customised courses for the water scientists, technologists and managers from the developing countries. Honours and awards Aswathanarayana is recipient of the Excellence in Geophysical Education Award (2005; International Award ( 2007) of the American Geophysical Union Certificate of Recognition (2007) of the International Association of GeoChemistry; and Eminent Citizen Award in the area of Water Sciences of the Sivananda Trust, India (2007). He is a recipient of the fellowships from UNIDO (1989) and United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (1989). Other mentions Aswathanarayana served as general secretary, Geological Society of India (1976‚Äì1979), Chairman, Working Group on Isotope Geochemistry of IAGC(1979‚Äì1983), Leader, IAVCEI W.G. on Deccan Volcanism (1979‚Äì83) and Chairman of the Working Group on \\"Geochemical Training in Developing Countries\\" of the International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry (1996‚Äì2008).

Early life Charles James Fox Campbell was born in 1811 at Kingsborough House, Isle of Skye. The son of John and Annabelle Campbell, he was born into a prominent family, the Campbell baronets of Glenorchy (1625). In 1821 his family migrated to New South Wales in the chartered ship Lusitania. His father, Colonel John Campbell, J.P.,(1770-1827), who was related by marriage to Governor Lachlan Macquarie, then established Bungarribee estate on the road between Sydney and Parramatta. Bungarribee is now a Sydney suburb and in 2000 the historic Bungarribee Homestead site was listed on the heritage register.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=5051257 On this estate his family engaged in breeding and raising livestock, particularly horses for the East India Company and the British Army in India.http://www.campbelltown.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1761 Orphaned at 16, he devoted himself to the field of agriculture, particularly pastoralism, after finishing his education. In about 1836 in partnership with his brother, Dalmahoy Campbell, he established Dundullimal Homestead near Dubbo. Dalmahoy Campbell later moved to Melbourne, where in 1850 he was influential in the establishment of Australian rules football.http://www.ozsportshistory.com/melbournerules/campbell.html Overlanding In 1838 Charles Campbell participated in the first overland cattle expedition to South Australia, led by Joseph Hawdon. In 1839 he joined with several other young gentlemen, namely Evelyn Sturt, James Stein, and William Hardy of Yass to overland 5,000 sheep from Bathurst to Adelaide. He then partnered with Stein during 1839-40 in two further overland livestock expeditions, both being profitable. In 1842, in connection with Henry Strong Price, he established the first sheep and cattle run on the Hill River, near Clare, which was managed by a resident stock keeper, William Roach. This run, soon taken up by William Robinson, was later known as the Hill River Station (or Hill River Estate) and became one of the great pastoral estates of South Australia. Roach had been formerly employed by W.S. Peter on his Light River run, where in September 1841 he had allegedly murdered an Aboriginal.Southern Australian newspaper, 3 September 1841, page 3. Having been acquitted, Roach was employed by Campbell as his stock-keeper at Hill River. Roach's confrontations with Aboriginals continued there, until in February 1845 at Campbell's Adelaide home he was killed through falling from a horse while intoxicated.Register newspaper, 19 February 1845, page 3. Lochend at Campbelltown, Adelaide In 1842 Campbell purchased Sections 309 and 310 on a fertile plain beside the River Torrens near Adelaide and built a home he called \\"Lochend\\" after the ancestral home of his family in Scotland. Lochend was built of local river stone and included a stucco porch, hall and living room with a finely moulded ceiling. Campbell later substantially expanded Lochend by the addition of three bedrooms and a cellar. Lochend included of garden and in the estate, primarily used as pastoral land. In 1849 he subdivided into 40 gardening blocks under the name \\"Campbelltown\\". Campbell was a close friend and financier of Evelyn Sturt, who was also a local landholder of the district. It is thought that Campbell had bought land from his brother Charles Sturt in New South Wales in early 1838 (requires confirmation). After Charles Sturt's arduous expedition to explore Australia's interior from 1844‚Äì1846, Campbell and his near neighbour from Newenham (now a part of modern-day Paradise), Arthur Hardy, conveyed Sturt home in a carriage for part of the way on his journey from Moorundi to Adelaide in January 1846 where Sturt records he \\"arrived home at midnight on the 19th\\". Sturt named Campbell's Creek in the eastern Flinders Ranges (requires confirmation) as a tribute to Campbell. In 1850 he married Martha Levi, sister of pastoralist Philip Levi. They had four sons together, Philip born 1851, Fredrick born 1852, Edmund born 1855 and William born 1857. Campbell became very well known in the early days of South Australia, partially through his relationship with prominent people like Sturt, but also through his community involvement. He was a Justice of the Peace and is recorded as standing for the East Torrens Electorate of the Legislative Council in 1851. He was known as a great orator and sporting gentleman and was well liked and respected. North-West Bend Station Campbell sold Lochend in 1858 for 2,600 pounds and purchased the pastoral occupation license for the recently established North-West Bend Station (or Nor'West Bend Station), a sheep run of 55 square miles sited where the River Murray changes from its westerly course to southerly near Morgan. This run, which carried 5,500 sheep in 1866, was on the main road from Adelaide to Wentworth.Bailliere's South Australian Gazetteer, Adelaide 1866. While the new homestead at that location overlooked the fertile River Murray valley, the surrounding country was an extensive semi-arid plain of bluebush with belts of mallee scrub. Campbell died there on 5 March 1859 of blood poisoning from a minor cut to hand caused by a piece of glass, which subsequently turned septic.The Argus newspaper, 9 March 1859, page 5 (relates cause of death and relationship to Dalmahoy Campbell). He is interred at the West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide and his headstone is in good condition. His widow Martha married wealthy businessman John Beck (c. 1826 ‚Äì 22 November 1903), on 7 August 1873. They left for England in 1882 and never returned. He was a director and largest shareholder of the Commercial Bank of South Australia which collapsed in February 1886. Martha died sometime around 1897. Legacy Campbell's influence on his beloved Campbelltown was immense and lasted well past his departure from the area and subsequent untimely death. When residents of the area, then part of the District Council of Payneham, decided to form their own Council in 1868, attendees at the public meeting overwhelmingly voted to name the new District Council \\"Campbelltown\\" in his honour. The first meeting of the newly formed Council was held on 2 March 1868 at the Paradise Bridge Hotel. In 1992 the Campbelltown High School based at Playford Road, Newton, South Australia was closed and merged with the Thorndon High School located on Campbell Road, Paradise, South Australia. The newly created school was named the Charles Campbell Secondary School in honour of Campbell. The school has been amalgamated with the Campbelltown Primary School to form the Charles Campbell College. This opened in 2012. His house, Lochend, fell into a derelict condition and was almost irretrievable. However, it was faithfully restored to near original condition by the City of Campbelltown, South Australia under the guidance of the Campbelltown Historical Society and was officially reopened on 29 February 2004. His great nephew was Sir Walter Campbell, a Governor of Queensland.

The mesa rises up to from the floor of Ganges Chasma, nearly to the same elevation as the surrounding plateaux of Lunae Planum. Like Hebes Mensa, the mesa is completely separated from the surrounding canyon walls and has sustained significant erosion that has caused it to retreat in areal extent. The mesa is composed of friable, thinly-layered units which decompose into fluted patternations, interpreted by most researchers as erosional aeolian features known as yardangs. It is capped by a more resistant layer that is interpreted by many researchers to be volcanic in origin. Although the mesa is understood to have formed through some combination of volcanism and sedimentary deposition, there is ongoing contention over whether the volcanism associated with the mesa occurred subglacially (into an ice megalaccolith) or subaqueously (into a paleolake). Those who favor the subglacial hypothesis believe that Ganges Mensa is a tuya that is extremely similar to analogues observed in the Azas Plateau of Tuva, Russia. Context Ganges Mensa is a mesa that sits in a deep upstream basin of the peripheral Ganges Chasma arm of the Valles Marineris valley network. It stretches for nearly from east to west and to the north and south between the walls of Ganges Chasma, bounded to the north by a sharp escarpment and gradually tapering towards the valley floor on the south. At its peak, the mesa rises up to from the Ganges Chasma floor, and its profile has an average elevation of from the valley floor. Ganges Mensa and Hebes Mensa are the only mesas of Valles Marineris that extend to the height of the surrounding plateau terrain. The mesa is separated from the canyon walls to the north by a moat- like stretch of valley floor, similar to Hebes and Capri Mensae and many of the mesa structures observed within Valles Marineris. Some researchers have interpreted Ganges Mensa to overlay chaos terrains in upstream Ganges Chasma. The mesa is surrounded by the most extensive and densely-concentrated dune sea on Mars outside the polar regions of the planet. A broad sandy plain stretches out to the south of the mesa and is interspersed with knobby plains and smaller mesas up to across in size, gradually decreasing in size to the east. This region has been interpreted as a chaos terrain or a mantled, eroded remnant of volcanic edifices. The moat-like region to the north of the mesa province is dominated by landslide terrains from collapses in the Ganges Chasma canyon wall. Some of this area has since been mantled by sand dune cover. Researchers have also reported evidence for sulfate signatures manifesting in light-toned mounds that can be observed across the Ganges Chasma floor. Some researchers have interpreted these landforms as originating in the erosion of sulfate-bearing layers present within units of Ganges Mensa. Ganges Mensa is in the Coprates quadrangle of Mars, centered near the equator in the western hemisphere at 7.2¬∞ S and 48.8¬∞ W. The landform was named after a classical albedo feature that was published in a 1930 manuscript called La Plan√©te Mars authored by the French-Greek astronomer Eug√®ne Michel Antoniadi. The International Astronomical Union officially approved Ganges Mensa's name in 2006. Geology A HiRISE image of one of the edges of Ganges Mensa. The dune sea of the floor of Ganges Chasma is visible to the left of the image, with other sand dunes forming dark streaks across Ganges Mensa's cap. Fluted texturations are visible, sloping downwards to the left. Steeper slopes tend to have a lighter texturation in Ganges Mensa. Researchers have identified two, three, four, or five stratigraphic units on the mesa that are most conspicuously defined by the presence, distribution, and length of long erosional flutes (interpreted by many researchers as yardangs and, historically, possibly as the result of groundwater sapping), and thematically consistent features of differing albedo. Yardangs are fleets of elongated linear features cut from bedrock by winds that blow in a sustained direction, surficially covering vast swaths of the mesa. These landforms are generally hundreds of meters long and tens of meters high, but they have been observed to become much larger on the northern face of Ganges Mensa. The mesa's southwestern face is steeper and contains the most well-incised examples of yardangs on the landform, suggesting that wind erosion was most severe on this part of the mesa. These units were deposited in at least two depositional events, interspersed by at least one or possibly two extended periods of erosion, depending on specific interpretations about the presence of angular conformities observed in the stratigraphy. The basal stratigraphic units of Gange Mensa demonstrate spectral signatures of polyhydrated sulfates like kieserite, which are visible up to elevations of uphill on the mesa. These sulfate signatures are not consistently represented elsewhere in the Valles Marineris network but are present within Eos Chasma and Capri Chasma and particularly on Capri Mensa, which lies to the south. Some of these units are scored by what have been interpreted by some researchers to be foreset beds of dark aeolian (wind-formed) materials. These dark beds lack any spectral signatures of common mafic minerals such as pyroxenes, olivine, or iron oxides (like hematite). Against fluted terrains the beds have been observed to dip between 15¬∞ and 25¬∞. These thick and friable units, at their greatest extents, reach up to in thickness. They are capped by a highly resistant unit interpreted by some researchers to be volcanic in origin, but which has been undermined by the erosion of the underlying weak rock. The cap rock of Ganges Mensa does not display this dipping and instead appears to horizontally stack atop these layers. These layers have been tentatively dated to the Mid-to-Late Amazonian period, concurrent with the formation of some outflow channels debouching out into Chryse Planitia. Dark domes and ridges on the cap of the material have been historically associated with volcanic modification but have more recently been proposed to be the intrusive feeding source of this cap rock. Because of this susceptibility to erosion and collapse, Ganges Mensa was likely once far more extensive than it appears to currently be. An exhumed crater apron nearly to the east of the mesa appears to cross-cut a structure that has been interpreted by some researchers to be a now-buried part of the mesa. Large-scale mass wasting of these weaker stratigraphic units (most notably, in the landslide of two blocks down the southern face of the mesa) has been conspicuously observed on the mesa. The observed layers described above‚Äîtermed interior layered deposits by researchers‚Äîare of considerable interest to researchers studying the possibility of past life on Mars due to the spectrally-inferred presence of kieserite, a polyhydrated magnesium sulfate mineral. Such a mineral only forms in sufficient quantities in acidic aqueous environments, suggesting the longstanding presence of water in areas where these materials are found. Ganges Mensa is the westernmost of the regions where these kinds of layers have been found in the greater Valles Marineris region. In terrestrial situations, polyhydrated sulfates are almost always found together with hematite (an iron oxide mineral that also is known to form diagenetically in neutral aqueous environments), but no spectral signatures of hematite have been found with kieserite in Ganges Mensa. Researchers have speculated that hematite in Ganges Mensa has since weathered out and is no longer present within the ILDs there in significant quantities. Hematite has been found elsewhere in interior layered deposits downstream, suggesting that the aqueous environments of Valles Marineris including Ganges Mensa grew less and less acidic into the late Hesperian and early Amazonian. Formation mechanism interpretationsSubglacial volcanism hypothesis= The Table, a tuya in British Columbia. Some researchers have attempted to analogize Ganges Mensa to the tuyas of British Columbia, which are thought to have formed as a result of subglacial volcanic activity. The Ganges Mensa province and other interior layered deposits in Valles Marineris have been strongly analogized to the Azas Plateau, a region in the Tuva Republic (a federal subject of Russia) near Lake Baikal and the Mongolian border. The Azas Plateau volcanic field is thought to have formed through subglacial volcanism; that mechanism is used accordingly to interpret the geomorphology of Ganges Mensa, which has been analogized to a terrestrial landform known as a tuya. It has been proposed by some researchers that Ganges Mensa might be an extremely eroded version of one. Historically, other researchers have alternatively proposed that the modern shape of Ganges Mensa was a depositional and not erosional effect. The volcanic activity that formed Ganges Mensa could have occurred into a gigantic pingo-like laccolith composed of ice, or into a thoroughly-frozen lake within Ganges Chasma. Supporters of the subglacial volcanism origin hypothesis note that the Ganges Mensa's horizontally-oriented cap rock is morphologically consistent with the cap rock seen in tuyas in the Azas Plateau. Various domes and arcuate ridges have been observed across the cap rock of Ganges Mensa, leading some to speculate that these likely volcanic landforms are actually evidences of magmatic dikes, volcanic vents, or the erosional remnants of volcanic necks that may have intruded underlying layers to deposit the cap rock. The presence of extensive thin layering in the thick friable stratigraphic units underneath Ganges Mensa's cap rock could correspond closely to hyaloclastites, which are volcanic breccias that are formed when lavas are erupted directly into water or ice and then quenched. The proposed hyaloclastite facies have been analogized to those comprising tuyas in Iceland. Other authors have proposed that these layered terrains could constitute alternating mafic flows and tuffs made of palagonite, as has been observed in some Icelandic tuyas. Researchers have noted, however, that the studied mesas of Valles Marineris, including Ganges Mensa, are surrounded by an extensive dune sea that has never been observed in the vicinity of terrestrial tuyas. On the mesa itself, foreset beds are typical of terrestrial tuyas, but the dips of the bedding observed within Ganges Mensa are far steeper than those that have been observed in the tuyas of British Columbia. =Subaqueous volcanism hypothesis= A cartoon showing one proposed mechanism for the formation of Ganges Mensa, according to those who favor a depositional hypothesis for the formation of the interior layered deposits that have been described to form Ganges Mensa. Those who favor a subaqueous hypothesis for Ganges Mensa's formation argue that the mesa developed due to a combination of volcanic and sedimentary factors underneath a persistent kilometres-deep paleolake. Supporters of this hypothesis tend to favor a low-energy depositional explanation to the formation of the mesa rather than a subglacial one, with the basal sulfate-enriched IDLs deposited during the Hesperian, when the circum-Chryse outflow channels were forming. A subaqueous formation could explain the thinly-layered friable deposits within the walls of Ganges Mensa if they were turbidites, but because the sedimentary particles may be variable in composition and in distance traveled from source, the traditional Bouma sequence characteristic of terrestrial turbidites may not necessarily be observed. Critics of this hypothesis for Ganges Mensa note that there are no barriers in the chasmata that appear to confine a putative paleolake downstream towards the outflow channels that they usually source (such as how Ganges Chasma opens into the uplands of Chryse Planitia), and how there are no observed morphologies on Ganges Mensa or on any of the other mesas of Valles Marineris that could conceivably correspond to paleoshoreline benches. More generally, Hebes Mensa also extends to a higher elevation than the rim of Hebes Chasma, which has implications on the broader formational mechanism of the valley mesas that are unlikely to be explained by a lacustrine mechanism. However, it is entirely possible that resurfacing could have eradicated any sign of such paleoshorelines, and that the geometry of Ganges Chasma might have been different enough in the past to have supported the presence of a deep paleolake. Observational history=20th century In 1987, Susan S. Nedell and David W. Andersen (San Jose State University) and Steven W. Squyres (NASA Ames Research Center) reported on the presence of layered deposits across Valles Marineris, offering the first detailed observations about the structure, stratigraphy, distribution and composition of the landforms within the valley network on Viking imagery. They focused particularly on deposits in Candor Chasma, making some regional generalizations. Nedell and her co-authors offered preliminary hypotheses as to how these deposits formed. The researchers concluded that a lacustrine depositional mechanism was generally the most probable formational hypothesis, against aeolian or explosively volcanic hypotheses. They also did not find it feasible to assume that the layered deposits were consistent with the materials comprising their valley walls, but did note that some canyon wall landslide material would inevitably become incorporated into these layered deposits in the case of a depositional origin. Notably, Nedell and co-workers could not firmly support or oppose a volcanic origin for the deposits, identifying no calderas associated with any of the layered deposits, including Ganges Mensa. However, they noted that the presence of some central structure‚Äîeither volcanic and/or relict‚Äîcould account for the large sizes of these layered deposits relative to the amount of debris one might typically expect to deposit in a lacustrine environment. Goro Komatsu and Robert G. Strom of the University of Arizona submitted an abstract to the 21st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in 1990 to discuss recent observations about the geology of layered terrains on the mesa with possible volcanic intrusions. At this time, Komatsu and Strom favored a lacustrine (lake deposition) origination hypothesis for Ganges Mensa. In 1993, a study was published by Goro Komatsu, Paul E. Geissler, Robert G. Strom, and Robert B. Singer (all of the University of Arizona) examining the presence of layered deposits in Valles Marineris, elaborating on the work last discussed in 1990 at LPSC. In 1994, Baerbel K. Lucchitta, Nancy K. Isbell, and Annie Howington-Kraus (all of the United States Geological Survey) reported on the correspondence of geomorphic maps of Valles Marineris to digital terrain models, offering their insights into the geochronology of the valley network. The researchers argued that a lacustrine origin for interior layered deposits like Ganges Mensa was unlikely, as lake levels could not be sustained at the depth necessary to deposit such large features given the openness of the canyon system, although they admitted that the geometry of the canyon system might have been different and that the different chasmata might have been disconnected or isolated basins. Lucchitta and her co-workers noted that there was no evidence that Ganges Chasma was dammed, thus making a lacustrine origin hypothesis unlikely. They first advanced the hypothesis that Ganges Mensa might have been a tuya, a volcanic table mountain formed by eruptions into gigantic pingo-like ice laccoliths or shallow frozen lakes. Early 2000s In 2000, Jennifer A. Waggoner (South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, interning at the Lunar and Planetary Institute) and Allan H. Treiman (Lunar and Planetary Institute) used Viking imagery to geologically map Ganges Mensa, subdividing it into four units named for major rivers in India serving as tributaries to the Ganges River (Gandak, Brahmaputra, Tista, Yamuna). Mariner 9 data was used to create stereo images of the layered deposits. Waggoner submitted an abstract to the 31st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference to report on her results. In light of the use of these MOC stereo images, the researchers were unable to definitively confirm the presence of an angular unconformity proposed earlier by Goro Komatsu in 1993. In 2002, Meredith A. Higbie (Skidmore College, interning at the Lunar and Planetary Institute), Robert R. Herrick, and Allen H. Treiman (Lunar and Planetary Institute) submitted an abstract to present at the 33rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference discussing efforts to performing geologic mapping and to characterize interior layered deposits (ILDs) previously documented at Ganges Mensa on data from Mariner 9 and Viking. Higbie and her coworkers used MOLA and MOC data. Elaborating on earlier work by Waggoner, Higbie chronologically separated the mesa structure into five stratigraphic units (from bottom to top: Gandak, Brahmaputra, Tista, Yamuna, and Gomti). In 2004, Goro Komatsu, Gian Gabriele Ori (Gabriele D'Annunzio University in Italy), Paolo Ciarcelluti (University of Rome Tor Vergata), and Yury D. Litasov (Russian Academy of Sciences) first analogized the presence of the mesa interior layered deposit terrains of Valles Marineris to the subglacial volcanic features of the Azas Plateau in Tuva (a federal subject of eastern Russia) near the border with Mongolia. The researchers in particular described the presence of ILDs as mesas in Valles Marineris as likely analogues to terrestrial tuyas. This insight motivated later work by Ross Beyer and Alfred McEwen on investigating this hypothesis, in particular, in the context of Ganges Mensa. In 2004, Ross A. Beyer published his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of his advisor at the University of Arizona, Alfred McEwen. Among other topics of study, Beyer assessed the dip angle of layers in Ganges and Hebes Mensae. The details of this investigation was reported in Beyer's 2005 publication. In 2005, Ross A. Beyer and Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona used MOC and MOLA data to attempt to discern the dip angle of the dark aeolian materials visible in layers within Ganges and Hebes Mensa. Such layers were originally believed to have been bedrock but were later suspected to analogize foreset beds commonly observed in terrestrial tuyas (volcanic structures that erupted into overlying glaciers), which typically are angled at around 35¬∞. The dip angle examination was deemed possible as the terrain where these layers are visible in the south of Ganges Mensa is fluted, allowing a three-dimensional conceptualization of the orientation of the plane of at which these layer were angled. The authors submitted an abstract to the 36th Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference to discuss their work, reporting that the dip angle of these foreset beds in the Ganges and Hebes Mensae were far too shallow to approximate those seen in terrestrial counterparts. The shape of Ganges and Hebes Mensae are also not characteristic of terrestrial tuya, but might nevertheless represent what a terrestrial tuya might look like if it has experienced very significant erosion. That same year, Ross A. Beyer (now of NASA's Ames Research Center) submitted an abstract to present at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting to report on work clarifying the stratigraphy of the Ganges Mensa structure, now with higher-resolution infrared THEMIS data. Beyer argues more strongly, but not conclusively, in favor of the hypothesis that Ganges Mensa formed in a manner similar to a terrestrial tuya based on the presence of very friable, finely-layered aeolian debris against more resistant volcanic material. Late 2000s to present In 2006, Ross A. Beyer (NASA's Ames Research Center) submitted an abstract to the 37th Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference reporting on his work characterizing in detail the aeolian morphologies present across the surface of Ganges Mensa. Beyer also investigated a crater off the eastern edge of the mesa which appears to demonstrate evidence of burial and later exhumation. The unveiled portions of that crater superpose a toe of the mesa, adding significant evidence to the hypothesis that Ganges Mensa was once a much more extensive landform that has since been greatly weathered. Beyer also submitted an abstract to the American Geophysical Union meeting that year to report on the relationship of light- toned mound deposits in Ganges Chasma to the basal unit of Ganges Mensa, using OMEGA spectral data to note similarities in kieserite signatures between the sulfate-bearing mesa layers and those mounds. In 2008, Matthew Chojnacki and Jeffrey E. Moersch of the University of Tennessee presented a poster at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting to report on their work characterizing the ergs of Valles Marineris using moderate- to high-resolution THEMIS, CTX, and HiRISE data. Among other results, the authors asserted that the highest concentrations of dunes within Valles Marineris‚Äîincluding the largest non- polar erg on Mars‚Äîcan be found within Ganges Chasma immediately surrounding Ganges Mensa. In 2008, Mariam Sowe, Ernst Hauber and Ralf Jaumann (German Aerospace Center, or DLR), John F. Mustard and Leah H. Roach (Brown University), and Gerhard Neukum (Free University of Berlin) submitted an abstract to the European Planetary Science Congress to report an analysis of the composition of the interior layered deposits within Ganges Mensa using CRISM (spectral), THEMIS (day/night thermophysical), and HRSC (elevation) data. The researchers found spectral signatures on Ganges Mensa supportive of a saline lacustrine origin, owing largely to the likely presence of polyhydrated sulfates such as kieserite. These sulfate signatures are only observed on the upper unit identified by Sowe and her coworkers. In 2011, Mariam Sowe, Gerhard Neukum (Free University of Berlin) and Ralf Jaumann (DLR) published a comparative study of interior layered deposits across Valles Marineris and the region of its debouchment into Chryse Planitia. Ganges Mensa was one of two principal sites (along with Eos Chasma) where these ILDs had been observed and studied in the Valles Marineris network, with the remainder of the studied sites downstream to the northeast. A cross-section of a region including Ganges Mensa and Eos Chasma was prepared in the publication, and the particular formation mechanisms of the ILDs discussed therein. In 2017, Selby Cull-Hearth and M. Caroline Clark (Bryn Mawr College) presented a comprehensive investigation of the mineralogy of Ganges Chasma using CRISM data. The authors reaffirmed the lower stratigraphic levels of the mesa as a mixture of monohydrated sulfates and ferric oxides. The deposits that host these spectral signatures on Ganges Mensa tend to contrast with surrounding terrain more darkly, and they appear to generally manifest in more unconsolidated deposits (including sand dunes on the surrounding valley floor). Olivine signatures, linear to the wall-floor boundary of Ganges Mensa, were observed by the researchers across the central edifice of the mesa. However, in 2018, Giovanni Leone of the University of Atacama published a direct rebuttal to this publication, pointing out that Cull-Hearth and Clark had crafted their study around the assumption that the hydrated minerals of Ganges Mensa and Ganges Chasma required aqueous processes to form. Leone cited a variety of publications suggesting alternate explanations for alteration that the original co-authors did not address or otherwise rebut.

'Reticulated' means like a net. Reticulated foams are extremely open foams i.e. there are few, if any, intact bubbles or cell windows. In contrast, the foam formed by soap bubbles is composed solely of intact (fully enclosed) bubbles. In a reticulated foam only the lineal boundaries where the bubbles meet (Plateau borders) remain. Foam before reticulation (left), after reticulation (right) The solid component of a reticulated foam may be an organic polymer like polyurethane, a ceramic or a metal. These materials are used in a wide range of applications where the high porosity and large surface area are needed, including filters, catalyst supports, fuel tank inserts, and loudspeaker covers. Structure and properties Weaire‚ÄìPhelan structure A description of the structure of reticulated foams is still being developed. While Plateau's laws, the rules governing the shape of soap films in foams were developed in the 19th century, a mathematical description of the structure is still debated. The computer-generated Weaire‚ÄìPhelan structure is the most recent. In a reticulated foam only the edges of the polyhedra remain; the faces are missing. In commercial reticulated foam, up to 98% of the faces are removed. The dodecahedron is sometimes given as the basic unit for these foams, but the most representative shape is a polyhedron with 13 faces. Cell size and cell size distribution are critical parameters for most applications. Porosity is typically 95%, but can be as high as 98%. Reticulation affects many of the physical properties of a foam. Typically resistance to compression is decreased while tensile properties like elongation and resistance to tearing are increased. Production Robert A. Volz is credited with discovering the first process for making reticulated polyurethane foam in 1956 while working for the Scott Paper Company. Producing reticulated polyurethane foam is a two step procedure: a conventional closed-cell polyurethane foam is produced, then the faces (or \\"windows\\") of the cells are removed. The high surface area and lower mass of the cells' faces compared with the cells' struts (or edges) makes them much more susceptible to both combustion and chemical degradation; either filling the closed-cell foam with a combustible gas like hydrogen and igniting it under controlled conditions, or exposing the foam to a sodium hydroxide solution will remove the faces and leave the edges. Reticulated ceramic foams are made by coating a reticulated polyurethane foam with an aqueous suspension of a ceramic powder then heating the material to first evaporate the water then fuse the ceramic particles and finally to burn off the organic polymer. Reticulated metal foam can also be made using polyurethane foam as a template similar to its use in ceramic foams. Metals can be vapor deposited onto the polyurethane foam and then the organic polymer burned off. Applications Reticulated foams are used where porosity, surface area, low density are important. * Puppets (such as the bodies/faces/hands of The Muppets) * Humidifier pads * Air conditioner filters * Scrubbers * Ceramic filters for filtering molten metal * Vehicle and bacteria filters * Speaker grills * Face mask and pads * Shoe polish and cosmetic applicators * Ink jet cartridges * Aquaculture (water purification) * Anti-slosh filling in fuel tanks for aircraft and race cars For example: A-10 Thunderbolt II ReferencesExternal links *Reticulation Process, FXI Category:Polyurethanes Category:Plastics Category:Ceramic materials Category:Foams Category:Materials science ","title":"Reticulated foam"},{"id":"24526776","text":"Dysgonia conjunctura is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Francis Walker in 1858.Poole, R.

Let be a real-valued function defined on some open interval Œ© of the real line that is continuous in Œ©. Let D be an arbitrary subinterval contained in Œ©. The theorem states the following implication: : \\\\int\\\\limits_D F(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 0 ~ \\\\forall D \\\\subset \\\\Omega ~ \\\\Rightarrow ~ F(x) = 0 ~ \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\Omega right A simple proof is as follows: if there were a point x0 within Œ© for which , then the continuity of would require the existence of a neighborhood of x0 in which the value of was nonzero, and in particular of the same sign than in x0. Since such a neighborhood N, which can be taken to be arbitrarily small, must however be of a nonzero width on the real line, the integral of over N would evaluate to a nonzero value. However, since x0 is part of the open set Œ©, all neighborhoods of x0 smaller than the distance of x0 to the frontier of Œ© are included within it, and so the integral of over them must evaluate to zero. Having reached the contradiction that must be both zero and nonzero, the initial hypothesis must be wrong, and thus there is no x0 in Œ© for which . The theorem is easily generalized to multivariate functions, replacing intervals with the more general concept of connected open sets, that is, domains, and the original function with some , with the constraints of continuity and nullity of its integral over any subdomain . The proof is completely analogous to the single variable case, and concludes with the impossibility of finding a point such that . Example An example of the use of this theorem in physics is the law of conservation of mass for fluids, which states that the mass of any fluid volume must not change: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\int\\\\limits_{V_f} \\\\rho(\\\\vec x, t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\Omega = 0 Applying the Reynolds transport theorem, one can change the reference to an arbitrary (non-fluid) control volume Vc. Further assuming that the density function is continuous (i.e. that our fluid is monophasic and thermodynamically metastable) and that Vc is not moving relative to the chosen system of reference, the equation becomes: : \\\\int\\\\limits_{V_c} \\\\left [ {{\\\\partial \\\\rho} \\\\over {\\\\partial t}} + abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\vec v) \\\\right ] \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\Omega = 0 As the equation holds for any such control volume, the localization theorem applies, rendering the common partial differential equation for the conservation of mass in monophase fluids: : {\\\\partial \\\\rho \\\\over \\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\vec v) = 0 Category:Integral calculus ","title":"Localization theorem"},{"id":"24526795","text":"Bastilla axiniphora is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by George Hampson in 1913.

The route consists of two parts, County Route 615, maintained by Sussex County, New Jersey, and the remainder of the route, maintained by the National Park Service. County Route 615 is a short county highway in Sussex County, New Jersey. It is long from the intersection of Bridge Road, and Walpack Road (near Flat Brook) running north to the fork with Bevans Road, (same intersection as Kuhn Road), entirely within Sandyston Township. Official maps from both the New Jersey Department of Transportation and Sussex County list the termini of the route at the above points, but some maps suggest the route is much longer, extending as far as County Route 560 in the north, and as far as the Warren County line on Old Mine Road in the south.

The section is known as National Park Service Route 615.  Route description = National Park Service Route 615  View north at the south end of NPS 615 at Old Mine Road in Walpack Township National Park Service Route 615 begins at the Warren and Sussex County line south of Flatbrookville, New Jersey. Route 615 heads northward through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area along the alignment of the Old Mine Road until the intersection with Flatbrook- Stillwater Road, where the highway heads to the north. The route soon enters the small community of Flatbrookville, New Jersey (now maintained by the National Park Service), winding through woodlands as a two-lane asphalt highway. A short distance later, Route 615 cross the Flat Brook and turn to the northeast along Walpack Road, paralleling the Flat Brook for several miles. Eventually, the Flat Brook recedes to the southeast, and the highway makes a curve to the northeast through the rural farmlands for several miles. Soon the Flat Brook does return along Route 615 and intersecting with Haneys Mill Road, a dirt road, where the highway turns further northeast along Walpack. The highway continues down the Flat Brook Valley, passing a local RV park before heading northbound through woodlands, where it curves to the north. National Park Service Route 615 heading to the north in Walpack Center At the intersection with Pompey Road, Route 615 turns along Sandyston- Flatbrookville Road, passing the Walpack Inn and another RV park before entering the community of Walpack Center. In Walpack Center, Route 615 passes the nearby Ranger Station and enters the small community, passing the post office at the intersection with Main Street. After leaving Walpack Center, the highway continues northward through fields and sparse housing for several miles. Soon, the ROW of Fish & Game Road merges in with Route 615, where the route turns to the northeast and east. At the intersection with Bridge Road, National Park Service Route 615 turns to the north and heads through forestry before passing nearby houses. At that point, National Park Service Route 615 enters the community of Peters Valley (formerly Bevans), where the maintenance of Route 615 turns over to Sussex County at Kuhn Road.

The highway continue northeastward through Peters Valley, a small art-based community before heading northward through the local police archery and reaching the site of a trail, where Route 615 turns to the east. The highway turns eastward along Kuhn Road until the intersection with County Route 640 (Bevans Road), where Route 615 officially ends. Route 615's abandoned portion of Ennis Road at County Route 615 However, until 2009, signage continued along Ennis Road, a two concrete lane, closed off portion of Route 615 through the ruralmost parts of Sandyston Township. The alignment continued to the southeast, crossing through farmland until entering forestry, where it bended several times until reaching a concrete parking lot. A short distance later, the roadway ended in shrubbery and at a guard rail due to the lack of bridge over a stream. On the other side of the stream, the former alignment of County Route 615 (Ennis Road) continues to the northeast, passing through forestry and fields, where there are several dirt roads. The route continued northward until entering fields near a county maintenance department before intersecting with the County Route 560 (Tuttles Corner Road).  History  Route 615 follows the alignment of the Columbia and Walpack Turnpike through most of its alignment. The original turnpike was chartered in 1819 by the New Jersey State Legislature to run from the community of Columbia to Walpack Center by a vote of 43-2. The Columbia and Walpack Turnpike was originally constructed in 1832, which helped locals develop the communities of Millbrook and Flatbrookville. However, both communities dwindled by 1910, and as of 2009, both communities are used as little tourist attractions. Although the local communities dropped, the Columbia and Walpack Turnpike remained, and due to problems with waterbeds, was realigned during the 1950s. However, this also eliminated the crossroads at the heart of Millbrook and the nearby automobile traffic had already used the Old Mine Road to bypass Millbrook. The former alignment of the Columbia and Walpack is now just a dirt pedestrian path. In 2007, CR 615 officially continued farther south past Kuhn Road to State Park Road for a length of .

Uses of the cellars  The catacombs were initially created to protect the inhabitants of the city against invading forces. In some places the passageways led under the fortifications and out of the city, allowing the hidden inhabitants to escape from the town to search for food in times of siege. The caverns were adequately ventilated by air shafts. Fireplaces in the cellars were connected to house chimneys. Smoke could be seen by enemies, emanating from seemingly empty houses, making the town resemble a ghost town. Znojmo's inhabitants could survive for a long time in the refuge due to its wells and a drainage system . If enemies happened to find an entrance to the cellars, they would have to deal with defensive measures, including slippery slides which would drop invaders into deep wells that could not be scaled without ladders, as well as trapdoors and narrow passageways.

It was selected in the Competitive Section of the festival, one of the two Indian entries. Plot A journey of four people, Pradyut, Madhura, Neel and Angshuman, through the making of a film. Legendary actor, Pradyut, had chosen a life of exile. Madhura, National Awardee for her debut film, now leads a frustrated existence. Neel, passionate about dance and astronomy, chances on something that changes his destiny. Angshuman, returns from Italy eight years after completing a course in film direction. He has an interesting script on the curious relationship between a septuagenarian celebrity painter and a young nurse. The project is a non-starter with constant setbacks. A crime occurs brings emotional crises to a peak. Despite all adversities, Angshuman is determined to see his dream project through. Detailed storyline Angshumaner Chhobi (a film by Angshuman) deals with the relentless efforts of Angshuman (played by Indraneil Sengupta), a young film director who comes back from Italy after eight years, having studied cinema there, to make his first film. He puts up a determined fight against all obstacles to complete his film. As he is struggling with his goal, the story passes through many mutations - emotional drama, humour and the detection of crime. Along the way, other issues come up. Among these are the eternal tussle faced by every creative person between his mind and his emotions, the psyche of being in and out of the limelight and the inevitable pangs of conscience and humanism faced by celebrities. In this film-within-a-film, Soumitra Chatterjee has two roles. In the main story, he is a former matinee idol who has become a complete recluse and has cut himself away from the mainstream as much as from cinema. In the film that Angshuman is making, this actor, Pradyut Mukherjee is persuaded to enact the role of a 72-year-old painter suffering from dementia. The painter has an who looks after him. Indrani Haldar plays the in the film- within-the-film. In the main story, she is Madhura, an actress who won the National Award for Best Actress in her first film. But when Angshuman approaches her, after a stint in commercial films of little merit but good money, Madhura is now a popular jatra artiste with little connection with films. Angshuman had visualised these two actors for the two main roles for his first film and he is unwilling to compromise. Tota Roychoudhury plays the enigmatic Neel, who had been passionate about dance and astronomy and gets curiously involved with Angshuman's film. The detection of crime also plays an important role in bringing out the psychological interactions in a celebrity's life. These are strikingly different from those of the common man. So the usual concept of crime and punishment does not hold true here. An alleged suicide becomes the talk of the town for its mysterious nature and is handed over to the CID, Crime Branch, for investigation. The person assigned to the case is Sourjya Roy, SP, CID, whose no-nonsense analytical skills suggest that it was not a suicide but homicide. Ananya Chatterjee plays the role of this different police officer. Cast *Indraneil Sengupta as Angshuman *Soumitra Chatterjee as Pradyut *Indrani Halder as Madhura *Tota Roy Chowdhury as Neel *Ananya Chatterjee as Sourya *Sabyasachi Chakrabarty as Bikanranjan *Rudranil Ghosh as Rajiv *Anjana Basu as Sonali *Bhaskar Banerjee as Somnath *Soma Chakrabarty as Bindu *Pijush Ganguly *Debesh Roy Chowdhury *Kaushik Sen Singers and music Rupam Islam, Prateek Chowdhury, Subhomita Banerjee, Anwesha Datta Gupta, Sumana Chakraborty and Bhoomi provide vocals on the soundtrack. The film's soundtrack music was composed by Rocket Mondol. Director's note I was interested to explore a narrative that runs along three parallel tracks, telescoping into each other to span incidents happening around the same time. The main track is the one that centers on a filmmaker returning to Calcutta after eight years in Italy with the purpose of making his first feature film. The second track probes into the film-within-the-film, that includes the uphill climb the filmmaker goes through to get his principal cast together, then set them through the paces of their work, and so on. This track also explores the sensitive actor‚Äôs psyche ‚Äì the process of being in and out of limelight or the eternal tussle faced by every creative person between his mind and his emotions. The third track, deals with the police investigation of the mysterious death of a successful businessman. Here the detection of crime plays an important role in bringing out the psychological interactions in a celebrity‚Äôs life, which are strikingly different from those of the common man. About the director A post-graduate in journalism, Atanu Ghosh started his career in 1996 as scriptwriter and director of documentary films. Thereafter, he branched out to fictional serials and short films. Till date, he has directed 23 telefilms. He has also worked as scriptwriter and editor for many eminent directors.

Hedrick, 365 F.3d 644 (8th Cir. 2004) was a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in October 2002, appealing the dismissal of a case brought by defendant Benjamin Archuleta. Archuleta had been found not guilty by reason of insanity of assault and subsequently ordered to be confined in a prison mental hospital by the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri after his successful insanity defense, as he was evaluated by a psychiatrist as dangerous. His appeal challenged this confinement and \\"forced treatment\\", requested a withdrawal of his original insanity defense, and sought his unconditional release from custody. The appellate court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, saying that habeas corpus is a last resort remedy available to those without any other, and the case was remanded back to that court with the instructions to transfer the petition to another district court, the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Facts of case Benjamin Archuleta was charged with assaulting a federal official and found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) in the United States District Court for the District of Utah on July 23, 1999. Based on a psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of others, the court ruled that Archuleta's release posed a substantial risk of harm to others and ordered him committed to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. Although later Archuleta was conditionally released, his release was revoked on July 8, 2002 and he was recommitted to FMC Springfield until the time he was determined to be eligible for a conditional release by the hospital; such release would be under court supervision. Archuleta filed a pro se petition (a petition to represent himself) for habeas corpus relief (seeking relief for unlawful detention) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Missouri in October, 2002 requesting an unconditional discharge and release from confinement in the prison hospital. He argued that the statute under which he was committed is unconstitutional because only a judicial unit, not an administrative one, can determine the length and conditions of his sentence and also whether his confinement after his successful NGRI defense could exceed the sentence he would have received if found guilty under the law. He further argued that his confinement in the prison facility far from the court was equal to \\"banishment and exile\\" and that \\"forced treatment\\" violated the Eighth Amendment. He also contested the finding that he had violated the terms of his conditional release, saying that he did not refuse the forced treatment \\"but for the exception of being late on taking his [anti-psychotic] medication... one day\\". He also requested to withdraw his insanity defense. At the district court level, the counsel for both parties agreed to court‚Äôs interpretation of the pro se petition to focus on the issue of the involuntary administration of psychiatric medication. Decision The appellate court ruled that although Archuleta's post-acquittal confinement was constitutional under statute 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 4243, it decided to consider the unlawful detention question broadly as \\"substantial public interests are involved\\", as habeas corpus is a remedy available when no other is available. It ruled the lower court erred in overlooking the seriousness of the grievance, as the statute under which Archuleta was committed for involuntary treatment did not prevent him \\"from establishing by writ of habeas corpus the illegality of his detention\\". Some issues, such as whether an insanity defense can be withdrawn upon appeal, have not been settled. The court vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case back to the district court, instructing that court to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1406(a), a statute which provides that the appellate court in which a case is wrongly filed may either dismiss it, or in the interest of justice, transfer the case to any district in which it could have been brought.

Names Ma Mingxin's Arabic given name was IbrƒÅhƒ´m. After returning to China from Arabia he started calling himself 'Azƒ´z. He was also called Muhammad Emin (). Followers of the Jahriyyah sometimes refer to him by the title of WiqƒÅyatullƒÅh (Arabic: ŸàŸÇÿßŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) Life A Chinese-speaking Muslim from Gansu, Ma Mingxin spent 16 yearsGladney (1996), p. 50. Gladney says, though, that Ma Mingxin \\"returned after 16 years of study in Yemen and Arabian Peninsula in 1744\\". Given his dates of life (1719-1781), it would imply that he'd have to start his study in Arabia at 9 - so possibly there is a typo somewhere in that source. studying in Mecca and Yemen. He was a disciple of a Naqshbandi Sufi teacher named 'Abd al-KhƒÅliq,Lipman (1998), p.202 gives 'Abd al-KhƒÅliq's death date as 1740, without commenting on how that would match with the dates of Ma Mingxin's biography. who was a son of az-Zayn b. Muhammad 'Abd al-Baqƒ´ al-Mizjaji (1643/44-1725), originally of Mizjaja near Zabƒ´d, Yemen. Az-Zayn, in his turn, had studied in Medina under the famous Kurdish mystic Ibrahƒ´m ibn Hasan al- K≈´rƒÅnƒ´ (1616‚Äì1690), who was known for advocating the vocal (rather than silent) dhikr (invocation of the name of God). After returning to China in 1761,Lipman (1998), p. 90 Ma Mingxin founded the Jahriyya menhuan (order) () - the second Naqshbandi order in China after Ma Laichi's Khufiyya. In opposition to the \\"silent\\" Khufiyya Sufis, and following al-Kurani's teaching, Jahriyya adherents advocated vocal dhikr, which is reflected in the name of their school (from Arabic jahr, \\"aloud\\"). Ma Mingxin also opposed the emphasis that the Khufiyya members placed of the veneration of the saints, construction of grandiose elaborately decorated mosques, and the enrichment of religious leaders at the expense of their adherents. By the early 1780s, Ma Mingxin's Jahriyya had spread over much of the then province of Gansu (which at the time also included today's Qinghai and Ningxia), as had the late Ma Laichi's Khufiyya menhuan. Theological arguments between members of the two menhuans, as well as the orders' claim on members' contributions, against the background of government mismanagement of the provincial revenue, often resulted in both violent conflicts and lawsuits.Lipman, pp. 107-111Lipman, p. 96 (on fiscal mismanagement) The escalating conflict between the adherents of the two movements eventually attracted attention of the Qing government in 1781. The apparent center of the conflict at the time was in the ethnic Salar community of Xunhua County (in today's Qinghai Province, just west of today's Gansu's Linxia Prefecture). Considering the Jahriyya (dubbed by the government The New Teaching, in opposition to the \\"Old Teaching\\", i.e. the Khfiyya and the non- Sufi (gedimu) Muslims) subversive, the authorities had Ma Mingxin arrested, even though he wasn't personally anywhere around Xunhua at the moment. While Ma Mingxin was kept in Lanzhou during the Jahriyya revolt, a government expedition sent to Xunhua to take care of the Jahriyya business was destroyed by the Jahriyya Salars, who then rushed across the today's Linxia Prefecture and to the walls of Lanzhou. When the besieged officials brought Ma Mingxin, wearing chains, to the city wall, to show him to the rebels, the Salars at once showed respect and devotion to their imprisoned leaders. Scared officials took Ma down from the wall, and beheaded him right away. Ma Mingxin's widow, whose surname was Zhang (originally, from Gansu's Tongwei County), and his daughters were exiled to Xinjiang.Lipman, p. 112 Legacy Ma Mingxin's death did not stop conflicts with China's Muslim community, or those between the Muslims and the government. Three years after the death of Ma Mingxin, his follower Tian Wu started a rebellion against the imperial government; after its defeat, the authorities remained on lookout against the spread of the \\"subversive\\" Jahriyya teachings. Ma Mingxin's fifth generation descendant and the then leader of Jahriyya, Ma Hualong, was one of the chief leaders of the Great Northwest Hui Rebellion in Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Gansu in the 1860s.Gladney (1996), p. 50. Other sources, however, don't mention Ma Hualong's descent from Ma Mingxin, so possibly Gladney means \\"spiritual successor\\" (via Jahriyya's silsilah) when describin Ma Hualong as a \\"descendant\\" of Ma Mingxin. The Jahriyya order continues to this day, even if in more covert forms. In remembrance of Ma Mingxin, whose beard was shorn by government soldiers before his execution, many Jahriyya members shave the sides of their beards.Gladney (1996), pp. 52-53 In 1985, over 20,000 Chinese Muslims assembled at the site of Ma Mingxin's original (destroyed) tomb near Lanzhou for a commemoration ceremony. The tomb has since been rebuilt. Ma Mingxin's descendant was Ma Yuanzhang. Ma Shaowu was a fourth generation descendant of Ma Mingxin, and Ma Shaowu's uncle Ma Yuanzhang was also a descendant, as was Ma Shaowu's great uncle Ma Shenglin . Ma Shaowu's son Ma Cho-ya is a fifth generation descendant and he currently lives in Urumqi.

In 1953, he gave the first German performance of Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez.Jewanski, J√∂rg: \\"Behrend, Siegfried\\", in: Die Musik in Geschicte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 2 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 1999), c. 958. At the age of 30 he already was a world-renowned artist with this instrument, playing for the Shah of Persia, the Emperor of Japan and Gamal Abdel Nasser in Cairo. In 1962, he met singer Belina during the making of a TV Show and they endeavoured to create some musical projects together. With their chansons, folk songs and Yiddish songs, they became highly respected and well-known representatives of German culture in the aftermath of World War II. They performed in more than 120 countries and were regular guests on German television and talkshows. In these years, they recorded several LP albums. In the 1970s Behrend married the German actress Claudia Brdozinska, also a singer. In performances with her, Behrend focused more on contemporary art music. Behrend was also renowned as a teacher for classical guitar. Martin Maria Kr√ºger began studying the instrument with Behrend. In later years, Behrend and Kr√ºger became famous as 'The German Guitar Duo'. In the 1970s, Behrend gave several \\"International Masterclasses for Artistic Guitar Play\\" which were attended by individuals such as Michael Tr√∂ster and Manuel Negwer. Behrend was (co-)editor of several books aimed at a professional audience, including Volkslieder aus aller Welt (Folk Songs from the World) and Gitarrenstunden f√ºr Kinder (Guitar Lessons for Children). Together with Konrad W√∂lki, Herman Ambrosius, Heinrich Konietzny and others, Behrend was one of the leading proponents in the development of mandolin and plucked string music towards higher quality and enhanced expressivity in Germany after the war. Apart from many arrangements of baroque and folk music for plucked string instruments, Behrend focused on contemporary music. He conducted many premieres of works of Anestis Logothetis, Heinrich Konietzny, Klaus Hashagen, Dietrich Erdmann, Friedrich Gaitis and others. In the years 1960 to 1973, Behrend was conductor of the Saarland Plucked String OrchestraSaarl√§ndische Zupforchester ‚Äì at that time the leading Plucked String Orchestra in Germany.

Mangano (born March 24, 1962) is an American politician from the state of New York. A Republican, he was the County Executive from January 2010 to December 2017, and a former legislator in Nassau County, New York. He was elected in 1995 and served seven terms as a county legislator. In November 2009, he defeated incumbent Thomas R. Suozzi for Nassau County Executive. In November 2013, he was re-elected, again defeating Suozzi, by 59% to 41%. In October 2016, a 13-count federal indictment for fraud and bribery was unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Mangano, his wife Linda, and Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto. He did not seek reelection in 2017.Erik Hawkins, Mangano will not seek re-election: County executive misses deadline to run as independent, Long Island Herald (August 24, 2017). He was convicted in March 2019. Early life Edward Mangano was raised in Bethpage, New York, one of three siblings born to John and Rachel Mangano. During high school he worked as a janitor, in order to earn money for college.Berger, Joseph (October 1, 2013). \\"Rematch for Nassau Executive Could Be Bellwether of National Trend\\". New York Times (October 2, 2013). While pursuing undergraduate and law degrees from Hofstra University Mangano found the time to have a successful career in printing and publishing newspapers and, in 1988, was admitted to the New York State Bar. Additionally he went on to serve as counsel to a local law firm, Rivkin Radler, on Long Island. He and his wife, Linda, have two children. County Legislator Mangano represented the 17th legislative district of Nassau County as County Legislator for seven terms, from 1996, when the legislature was first formed, until 2009. This district includes areas of Bethpage, Hicksville, Plainedge, South Farmingdale, Levittown and Syosset. He served on the Rules Committee, the Public Works Committee, the Recreation and Parks Committee, the Procedures Committee, and the Economic and Community Development Committee. He was replaced by fellow Republican Rose Marie Walker. Mangano was the recipient of an award from New York's League of Conservation Voters for \\"working to preserve open space and setting aside $5 million for the acquisition of the (81 acre) Underhill Property\\" and for \\"fighting for the ‚ÄúClean Water/Clear Air bond act funding for the purpose of ground water protection\\".Ed Mangano on TV-55 WLNY 11pm News on Green Energy, youtube.com, July 13, 2009. 2009 County Executive campaign In the spring of 2009, Legislator Mangano began a campaign for Nassau County Executive. His platform included promises to cut wasteful spending, freeze and fix Nassau's broken property tax assessment system, repeal the new tax on home energy and electricity use, and halt the practice of borrowing and relying on debt to pay current expenses. In an upset in the November 2009 election, Mangano narrowly defeated the incumbent, Thomas Suozzi, winning the county executive position by 386 votes.Macropoulos, Angela (December 28, 2009). \\"L.I. Upstart Set to Take Center Stage\\". New York Times. nytimes.com. Retrieved August 1, 2017. He led the Republicans to a major victory, in which they took three of the four count-wide positions, and regained control of the County Legislature. In October 2009, Mangano's brothers business, New Media Printing, in Bethpage was found to have more than $900,000 in federal and state tax liens. Mangano stated that he no longer had an interest in this company. County Executive=Tax policy Mangano promised that if elected, he would repeal a $38 million home energy tax on homeowners passed by former County Executive Tom Suozzi, which cost households on average $7.27 a month. During his inaugural address, Mangano fulfilled his promise by signing an executive order to repeal the tax as of June 1, 2010. His administration estimated the repeal would save families and seniors hundreds of dollars each year. He eliminated a 13% property tax hike proposed by Suozzi. Due to the lost revenue from the tax cut, the Nassau County Interim Financial Authority (NIFA) found that the county's $2.6 billion budget was out of balance by $176 million. This led Moody's Investors Service to downgrade the county and put its finances on outlook negative. NIFA did not consider Mangano to have a satisfactory plan to make up for the lost revenue, and seized control of the county's finances. This outcome was called \\"a cautionary tale\\" and \\"a black eye for the Tea Party\\" by Reuters, although it was noted that much of the county's financial problems had been inherited from a previous financial crisis in 1999 under the administration of then-County Executive Thomas Gulotta which had led to the original creation of NIFA. In his proposed 2011 budget, Mangano proposed the removal of the county guarantee, a policy that saw Nassau County repaying taxes that were wrongfully collected and distributed to school taxes. Under the new policy school districts in Nassau, like the rest of the country, would be responsible for returning funds collected in error. This was met with heated opposition by the school districts, who objected that they would immediately be forced to begin setting money aside to pay the property tax refunds starting in 2013. The budget was approved by the Nassau County legislature on October 30, 2010, with all 8 Democrats voting against and all 11 Republicans voting in favor. Mangano has implemented several tax initiatives including \\"$35.6 million in revenue\\" garnered \\"from increased real estate fees that\\" have added \\"hundreds or thousands of dollars to the cost of buying, selling or refinancing properties in the county.\\" A CBS news story about the proposed inclusion of a $105 surcharge for every issuance of a traffic or parking ticket in Nassau County quoted several county residents deriding potential fallout from such fees; in the same story, Mangano said \\"the fee would help pay for the police force to work overtime in policing public events, and would alleviate homeowners from potential tax increases\\". On October 5, 2016, Nassau County legislature Democrats opposed Mangano's tax plan, claiming it was a 9.4% tax increase. =Assessment system= The property assessment system in Nassau County had been blamed for costing taxpayers $250 million each year, including $100 million in refunds and $150 million in interest on debt incurred to pay tax settlements in previous years. In all, this accounts for $1.13 billion of the county's $2.45 billion in outstanding debt. Mangano has stated that the average land owner in Nassau County pays 30% more in property taxes because of the broken assessment system. Mangano in March 2010 said he would make reforming the assessment system a priority in his administration, and instructed county lawyers to insist on a 3% rather than 4% interest rate for commercial tax certiorari settlements, saving the county $1 million annually, and created an Assessment Reform Team to study the property tax assessment system and make recommendations for fixing it. He also moved the county to a four-year assessment cycle so that the assessed property values would be more stable. In May 2010, Mangano returned to financing property tax refunds with new debt rather than out of its regular budget in what was described as a temporary measure, a move which was criticized by Democrats because it went against NIFA's wishes to end such borrowing completely. In late October 2010, errors were found in the first school tax-roll released by the Mangano administration, including incorrect tax-exempt statuses for various properties, such Nassau's own Executive Building, which was included on the roll at $56 million despite being tax-exempt, which contributed to assessing the county itself with an erroneous $1.3 million school tax bill. Following these errors, Mangano fired Assessor Ted Jankowski, who had been originally appointed by Thomas Suozzi and had been criticized by Republicans, and who was considered to be at fault for the errors not being caught. To fix the assessment system further, former Smithtown Assessor Gregory Hild was appointed to review the system. =Property tax= During Andrew Cuomo's Governor campaign, Mangano supported Cuomo's 2% Tax Cap plan which forces all property tax increases to be capped at the lower of 2% or the rate of inflation, and appeared at many Long Island rallies with him. In June 2011, after passing the State Legislature, Cuomo signed the Tax Cap plan in Lynbrook, along with Mangano and other County politicians. =Lawsuit against MTA= In July 2010, Mangano announced that Nassau County had filed a lawsuit against the State of New York and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) challenging the legality of the 0.34% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax, a payroll tax levied on employers in the 12-county area served by the MTA. Mangano said that the lawsuit was a reaction to the MTA's plans to significantly reducing funding to the Long Island Bus and asserted that it \\"costs Nassau government about $3 million a year and county business owners another $100 million.\\"Yancey Roy, MTA payroll tax is upheld - but lawsuit not over, Newsday (October 10, 2013). The lawsuit challenged the legality and constitutionality of the MTA Employer Payroll Tax and argued that it violated the New York State Constitution. Several municipalities joined Nassau's lawsuit, including Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Westchester, and Suffolk counties. Although the counties' suit was initially successful in the trial court,New York's MTA payroll tax unconstitutional: judge, Reuters (August 22, 2012). the counties lost on appeal.  Budgetary policy  Mangano delivered his first ‚ÄòState of the County‚Äô address on March 15, 2010. During the speech Mangano stated that, to solve Nassau County's woes, structural reforms would be needed to fix the property tax assessment system and rein in county spending. Mangano has reduced the public payroll, including highly paid managers, by $22 million in 2010. He also launched an effort to sell surplus property such as vehicles and equipment in an effort to reduce maintenance costs. He plans to also reduce the $150 million in annual waste caused by the county's assessment system. In 2011, Mangano faced a $310 million Nassau County deficit. In September 2011, Mangano released a proposed 2012 budget with a total cut of $62 million and planned layoffs of 1,010 out of 8,000 total employees (including those 300 already made prior to September 2011), with 5-15% cuts in every department, including the consolidation of police precincts (described below) and the closing of several museums. The budget would also require all employees to contribute 25% toward their health insurances. This budget was criticized by some legislators and police union representatives. This budget was approved in October 2011, by a party-line vote of 11 Republicans in favor and 8 Democrats opposed. In September 2011, Mangano proposed selling the Nassau County sewer system to a private operator in a private-public partnership for $1.3 billion. The county has hired Morgan Stanley as an advisor concerning this sale. Nassau's current Sewer and Storm Water Finance Authority has $162 million of its own debt, and is responsible for $305 million of sewer debt issued by the county before 2004. In January 2012, Mangano and other Nassau County officials announced a plan to consolidate Nassau County's eight police precincts into 4 precincts and to eliminate 108 mostly administrative jobs (95 officers and 13 civilian positions), which they claim could save $20 million a year. Mangano and county officials said that the number of police cars will remain the same at 177, but prisoners would be processed exclusively at the four remaining precincts, which are called community policing centers under the plan. The Nassau Police Benevolent Association and four other Nassau police unions were sharply critical of this plan and of earlier concessions that Mangano had called for, but a Newsday editorial supported it. Economic development In March 2010, Mangano reached an agreement with Democrats to amend the county's $166 million Capital Improvement Plan to align it with his priorities for the county. Due to the collapse of Charles Wang and Scott Rechler's Lighthouse project, County Executive Mangano partnered with Wang in early 2012 to rebuild the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, as well as add an Atlantic League Minor League ballpark and an indoor track and convention facility. Mangano cited the redevelopment as a major economic and business development boost for Nassau County, as well as a job generator. The proposition had support from numerous Long Island institutions, including The Long Island Association, Nassau Chambers of Commerce, the Nassau County Independence Party, and the National Hockey League. Nassau County held a special election in August 2011 to ask people to vote on whether they would agree to increased taxes amounting to $13.80 per household to pay for a bond to redevelop the area. The New York Daily News criticized this bond as a public subsidy for a risky private venture based on very optimistic projected attendance rates. Nassau voters rejected the proposed Coliseum redevelopment. After the special election, Mangano announced Request for Proposals (RFPs) for private companies to redevelop the 77 acres of Coliseum site. The request stated that all proposals must address job creation, quality of life and revenue. In October 2011, the County submitted a plan to the Empire State Development Corp. detailing the creation of a new Nassau Coliseum as well as a bio-research facility at the Coliseum site. The county is looking for state funding for the plan, as well as for the development of a casino and soccer stadium at Belmont Park and an expansion of film studios and homeland security facilities at the Grumman property in Bethpage. The plan also mentions a minor league ballpark and track facility in Mitchel Field. Mangano put together the annual Cruise To The Show car show and parade in 2011, featuring concerts, fundraisers, and a parade of classic cars, as well as awards. Mangano, who is a classic car enthusiast, was joined by Governor Andrew Cuomo, and his vintage corvette at the 2011 show. The governor and Mangano want to make Cruise To The Show a huge East Coast car event in Eisenhower Park, and Mangano stated his belief that it would increase tourism. Nassau County Legislator Kevan Abrahams criticized the show as a frivolous expense during a time of County budget cuts, claiming it would cost $75,000 in police overtime and noting that it was funded by a hotel/museum tax, which Abrahams said would have been better spent on museums. Issues with Long Island Bus The operation of Long Island Bus, the public bus transportation system for Nassau County, was subject to a funding dispute between its operator, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), and the county. For the past decade, the MTA had provided a unique subsidy to the Nassau County bus system, amounting to $24 million in 2011 and over $140 million since 2000, that the other New York City suburban county bus systems had not received at all. The MTA asked for an additional $17 million contribution from the county: the county's contribution had been $9.1 million per year out of a total budget of $133.1 million, and the MTA desired that this contribution increase to $26 million. By comparison, Westchester County had subsidized its similarly sized Bee-Line Bus System by $33 million per year, and that Suffolk subsidizes its substantially smaller Suffolk County Transit system by $24 million per year. The County refused to increase their contribution, accusing the MTA of waste and inefficiency, and on September 7, 2010 Mangano called for the immediate resignation of MTA Chairman and CEO Jay Walder while also asking the state's Gubernatorial candidates to make a simple promise to voters to shake up leadership at the Authority. The county began to consider terminating their operation agreement with the MTA and privatizing the bus system. In response to the lack of a funding agreement, the MTA considered eliminating half of Long Island Bus' routes in July 2011, and potentially eliminating the entire system by the end of 2011. The MTA had previously slashed its Able-Ride service, which was the primary mode of transportation for many people with disabilities, and increased bus and subway fares in an effort to increase their revenue by 7.5% to close a $900-million deficit for that year. The county hoped to reduce its annual contribution from $9.1 million to $4.1 million by using a private contractor rather than the MTA to operate the bus system. The planned county contribution was later decreased to $2.5 million per year. On July 22, 2010, Mangano announced he would immediately form a committee that would explore privatizing the bus service. On September 24, 2010 he issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to privatize Nassau's public bus service. A partial compromise was reached on April 1, 2011 as the New York State Legislature moved to provide an extra $8.6 million to avoid the July service cuts, which would have eliminated half of Long Island Bus' lines. This compromise saw Nassau County pay half the increase that the MTA had sought. No provision was made for future years, though, and later in April the MTA Board voted to terminate the Long Island Bus contract at the end of the year. On June 10, 2011, the RFP committee chose Veolia Transport as the operator. This privatization plan was the subject of heated county public hearings in which Long Island Bus riders and employees criticized the plan. In November 2011, Veolia and the county announced a new name for Long Island Bus, NICE (Nassau Inter-County Express). Mangano also announced that a five-person transportation committee will be formed, consisting of all Nassau residents, to oversee Nassau's bus future. The committee will have to vote on fare and route changes. Prior to this, as County Executive, Mangano had stated that all routes and fares will not change for a minimum of a year, and that Veolia will be re-instituting the lines the MTA wanted to cut. He has also stated that this private-public partnership will save taxpayers $32.4 million annually. On December 12, the full Legislature voted on the bus service, and unanimously voted to approve Veolia as the provider for County bus service. Veolia took over operations on January 1, 2012. Service cuts were announced by Veolia in February 2012, involving no route cancellations but including $7.2 million in cuts to existing routes, which was significantly smaller than the $26 million in cuts that the MTA had proposed the prior year. These cuts would take effect in April 2012. These planned cuts were criticized as occurring too soon, only six weeks after starting service. These consisted of service reductions and route concentrations planned for routes primarily serving northern and eastern Nassau County, with resources redirected towards busier routes. These cuts ultimately included decreased service on 30 routes, including elimination of weekend service and decreased midday service on seven routes. The Long Island Bus Rider's Union, a transit advocacy group, sharply criticized the cuts, claiming that \\"the announcements of service adjustments on the NICE bus website were very unclear\\", that service to many health care and social service centers was cut, and that \\"many of the NICE bus service cuts appear to be in low income communities where more people rely on buses to get to work and to access the few available health care centers that serve their needs.\\" In March 2014, the NICE bus system faced another $3.3 million budget deficit. At that time, the bus system expected \\"an increase of state aid ‚Äì its largest revenue stream ‚Äì of $1.2 million.\\" NICE chief executive Michael Setzer said that NICE would \\"take a fresh look\\" at \\"underperforming\\" lines. Bus advocates pressed the County Legislature to increase funding for NICE, noting that neighboring counties contribute significantly more to their bus systems, such as Suffolk County subsidizing Suffolk County Transit with about $29 million in county tax dollars, compared to only $2.6 million from Nassau County to NICE. On October 31, 2014, the Nassau County legislature adopted a 2015 budget that will increase Nassau County's contribution to NICE bus from $2.6 million to $4.6 million in 2015 and promised not to raise fares outside of MetroCard fare increases (MetroCard is controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority). However, on December 11, 2014, Mangano proposed cutting $4 million from Nassau County's NICE bus contribution (in addition to cuts to numerous other Nassau County services) to replace the $30 million that will be lost after the shutdown of Nassau County's controversial school speed zone cameras. Bribery charges On October 20, 2016, Mangano and his wife were arrested on corruption charges related to a bribery and kickback scheme, and charged in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The charges allege that Mangano helped restaurant magnate Harendra Singh with business deals and lucrative contracts with Nassau County, including a \\"six-figure contract to supply the Nassau County jail with bread and rolls\\", in exchange for free vacations, home improvements, a no-show job for Linda Mangano as a food taster at one of Singh's restaurants (Water's Edge), and other perks. Also, Singh sought Mangano's help in obtaining a loan guarantee from Oyster Bay Town Supervisor John Venditto (who was also charged) to operate a restaurant at that town's beach. In October 2016, Singh pleaded guilty \\"to bribing Edward Mangano and Venditto with benefits ranging from free meals at his restaurants to a no-show job for Linda Mangano that totaled $450,000 in pay.\\"Singh testifies he gave Venditto, family countless free luxury rides, Newsday (March 22, 2018). The Manganos and Venditto pleaded not guilty. The first trial, which began in March 2018,Joseph De Avila & Corinne Ramey, Prosecutors Say Long Island Corruption Case Started With $3000 Chair, Wall Street Journal (March 14, 2018). took place in Central Islip before U.S. District Judge Joan M. Azrack. Singh testified for the prosecution. On May 31, 2018 Azrack declared a mistrial on the case against Mangano. In the retrial, opening statements began on January 25, 2019. Mangano and his wife were convicted of multiple counts of corruption in March 2019. Tax Revolt Party The Tax Revolt Party (TR) is a minor political party in the United States founded in Nassau County, New York in 2009. It was unrelated to the similarly named Taxpayers Party of New York founded by Carl Paladino in 2010. In 2017, the Tax Revolt Party was effectively abandoned after its founder, Ed Mangano, chose not to seek re-election. Representative Peter T. King filed for use of the Tax Revolt line in the 2018 election, the only candidate of any office to do so. Background Nassau County's Tax Revolt Party provided a second ballot line to Republican candidate Ed Mangano during his 2009 run for Nassau County Executive. Mangano had only the Republican line while the Democratic, Independence, and Working Families lines went to County Executive Thomas Suozzi and the Conservative Party line went to Robert Bruno.Petitions for a third party line, A36, Newsday Strategy The Tax Revolt Party benefits from New York's electoral fusion laws that permit a single candidate to receive endorsements from multiple parties. The Tax Revolt Party only endorses Republican Party candidates. In statewide races, the TRP only endorses people from Nassau County. 2009 candidates In Nassau County the Tax Revolt Party cross-endorsed Republican Party County Executive candidate Ed Mangano. The Tax Revolt Party only supported other Republican Party candidates for county legislator, including Christian Browne, Howard Kopel, Rose Walker, and Joe Belisi. All of the Tax Revolt Party's petitions, other than Mangano's, were invalidated or withdrawn. 2010 candidates The party made another round of endorsements in 2010. It did not endorse a gubernatorial candidate, which barred the party from becoming one of the qualified New York parties. Bruce Blakeman was the party's nominee for the U.S. Senate seat held by Kirsten Gillibrand. It also made endorsements in three congressional races: Peter T. King in the 3rd district, Francis Becker in the 4th, and Elizabeth Berney in the 5th. For the New York State Senate, the party endorsed Carl Marcellino in the 5th state senate district, Kemp Hannon in the 6th, Charles Fuschillo in the 8th, and Dean Skelos in the 9th. For races in the New York State Assembly, the party endorsed a slate composed almost entirely of incumbents: Joseph Saladino in the 12th district, Brian F. Curran in the 14th, Michael Montesano in the 15th, David McDonough in the 19th, and Edward Ra in the 21st (the Republican running to replace retiring Republican Thomas Alfano). 2012 candidates For the 2012 elections, the TRP again endorsed congressional candidates King, Stephen LaBate, and Becker; Marcellino, Hannon, Jack Martins, Fuschillo, and Skelos for the state senate; and McDonough, Montesano, Thomas McKevitt, Ra, David Sussman, Curran, and Sean Wright for the state assembly. 2014 candidates For the 2014 elections, the TRP again endorsed Marcellino, Hannon, Martins, Skelos and Michael Venditto for state senate and Saladino, McDonough, Montesano, McKevitt, Ra, Curran, Cornelius Todd Smith and Avi Fertig for state assembly. King was the only congressional candidate to run on the TRP line. Platform The Tax Revolt Party's primary agenda is to reduce what many residents see as out-of-control taxes in Nassau County. The Tax Revolt Party intends to restore disciplined fiscal management to Nassau County following what they argued was eight years of fiscal mismanagement under former County Executive Thomas Suozzi. The Tax Revolt Party's platform includes cutting wasteful spending, freezing and fixing Nassau's broken tax assessment system, ending the Home Energy Tax, and creating local jobs and opportunities.Tax Revolt Times See also *Nassau County Politics ReferencesExternal links Category:1962 births Category:Hofstra University alumni Category:People from Bethpage, New York Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:Nassau County Executives Category:Living people Category:Politicians convicted of corruption in New York (state) ","title":"Ed Mangano"},{"id":"24527035","text":"Tracey Elizabeth \\"Traci\\" Phillips (born August 1, 1962 in Honolulu) is an American sprint canoer who competed from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.

Although in the past attributed to the 14th-century writer George Kodinos, the collection in fact dates from earlier centuries, being probably first compiled ca. 995 in the reign of Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) and then revised and added to in the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118).Cameron & Herrin (1984), p. 4 The collection contains: * a part of the patria of the 6th-century pagan writer Hesychius of Miletus, on the history of Byzantium from its foundation to the time where Constantine I refounded it as Constantinople. * the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai, which focuses chiefly on the antique sculptures of the city * another set of patria dating to ca. 995. * an anonymous Story on the Construction of the Hagia Sophia, written between the late 6th and the late 10th centuries, but more likely at some time in the 9th century. * a topographical study dedicated to Alexios I.

Tuna is the Samoan word for 'eel'.O le Tala ia Sina ma lana Tuna (Sina and the Eel) The story is also well known throughout Polynesia including Tonga, Fiji and MƒÅori in New Zealand. Different versions of the legend are told in different countries in Oceania. The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) has many uses and is an important source of food. It is also used for making coconut oil, baskets, sennit rope used in traditional Samoan house building, weaving and for the building of small traditional houses or fale. The dried meat of the coconut or copra has been an important export product and a source of income throughout the Pacific. The legend of Sina and the Eel is associated with other figures in Polynesian mythology such as Hina, Tinilau, Tagaloa and Nafanua. Sina is also the name of various female figures in Polynesian mythology. The word sina also means 'white' or silver haired (grey haired in age) in the Samoan language. There is also an old Samoan song called Soufuna Sina based on a Sina legend. Coconut shell showing the 'two eyes and mouth' of the eel. Local child taking a drink of water from the Mata o le Alelo pool in Matavai village, Safune village district, Savai'i The story On the island of Savai'i in Samoa, one version of the legend tells of a beautiful girl called Sina whose beauty was known across the Pacific. This beauty reached the Tui Fiti or the King of Fiji who was older than Sina. He took to heart and decided that he shall see to what the fuss was about. Using his Mana(Magic) he transformed himself to an eel and went to the village of which Sina resided. As he got to the village pool, he had seen the beauty that is Sina. However, when Sina looked into the pool, she saw the eel staring up at her. Angry, she cried 'You stare at me, with eyes like a demon!' (). But quickly Sina noticed that the eel was very nice and made it her pet. Years and years had passed and the Tui Fiti grew old and with it his magic. He had grown weak and decided to reveal himself. Explaining to Sina that he was once the King of Fiji and have come to see her beauty but knew that he had no chance due to his age. He had then asked Sina to plant its head in the ground. Sina followed the eel's request, and planted its head in the ground. A coconut tree grew from the ground. When the husk is removed from a coconut, there are three round marks which appear like the face of the fish with two eyes and a mouth. One of the marks is pierced for drinking the coconut, and hence when Sina takes a drink, she is kissing the eel. In Samoa, the fresh spring pool Mata o le Alelo in the small village of Matavai, Safune, is associated with the legend of Sina and the Eel. The pool is named after Sina's words to the eel in the legend. The pool is open to visitors.

It was established in the sixth century by one of the Nine Saints, Abba Garima, and built by King Gabra Masqal (also Gebre Meskel). The monastery became known for its early manuscript copy of the gospels and its treasury. History portrait illumination of Mark from G√§rima 2, likely the earlier of the two G√§rima Gospels The namesake of the monastery, Abba Garima is believed to have been a Byzantine royal with healing powers who was summoned to Axum by Abba Pantelewon. King Gabra Masqal built for him a monastery near Adwa, where he lived for some 20 years performing miracles and healing the sick. Above the monastery on a hill is a spring where Abba Garima is said to have spat on the spot and started a life form. The monastery was attacked twice during its history, once by Queen Gudit in the 10th century and a second time in the 1530s by Imam Ahmad Gragn, a Moslem who attacked the monastery with his Turkish muskets. The first European recorded to have visited the monastery in modern times was Henry Salt, who visited it on 14 September 1805. He was told at the time that the building had been built by Prince Gabra Masqal (a son of the Emperor Kaleb) in 560.John J. Halls, Life and Correspondence of Henry Salt, (London, 1834), vol. 1 p. 119 In around 1872 or 1873, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II of Ethiopia was blinded, and imprisoned with his brother and mother at the Abba Garima Monastery, where he died or was executed some years later. In 1896, the monastery proved an important location during the Italian invasion when Menelik II spotted the advancing troops from the monastery, which contributed to his decisive victory over the Italians. The following year, Ras Alula died at Abba Garima after being wounded in a battle with his old rival, Ras Hagos of Hamasien. His tomb is located at the rear of the main church. Beatrice Playne visited the monastery around 1950, and in found that the church had burned down twenty years prior and had been rebuilt before her arrival. Nevertheless, she was shown a number of prized possessions which were centuries old, including a number of illuminated manuscripts \\"whose ornamental headings struck me as Syrian in style.\\" The last treasured item he was shown was \\"an ancient spring which, they said, had never failed since the beginning of the world.\\"Beatrice Playne, Saint George for Ethiopia (London: Constable, 1954), pp. 103f The family of the fifth Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Abune Paulos was long associated with the Abune Garima monastery, and it is at this monastery that the Patriarch first took monastic vows as Abba Gebre Medhin. Layout and artifacts The Nine Saints (not all in photo) of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church The monastery is surrounded by rugged cliffs which are covered with cactus and shrubs. The roofs of the monastery are painted green, and the window frames and doors are painted green, red and yellow. The monastery consists of three churches, about fifteen square and circular cells in which the monks live and a notable treasury. The entrance to the treasury is a stone portal with steps and inside the round building is a glass cabinet as wide as the room. They contain an extensive collection of crowns, helmuts, crosses, chalices and manuscripts and other treasures from the various emperors and religious figures of Ethiopia dating back to the monastery's founder, Gabra Masqal whose silver cross with gold inlays remains, as does the crown of Zara Yaqob (1399‚Äì1468). There are also other items such as a pair of cow horns embedded in the wall, and leather bible satchels for the monks to preach in nearby villages. The library of the monastery is extensive and includes a detailed history of the early history by a priest named Hawi. The most important though are the two illuminated Garima Gospels which have been restored, and are housed in a former chapel for female pilgrims. According to legend, Abbu Garima himself wrote the gospels on thick goat's vellum in the Ge'ez language and illuminated the opening pages on both volumes. Most biblical scholars had previously proposed that these gospels, though inspired by on Abba Garima's example, must have been written centuries after his death, probably in the tenth century or later. However recent radiocarbon dating carried out at Oxford University has confirmed a date between AD 390 and AD 570 for Garima 2, likely the earlier of the two gospel books; meaning that it may well be older than Abba Garima himself. If so they are the earliest surviving dated Christian illuminated manuscripts.

The series deals with the repercussions of the death of ward sister Faye Byrne's son Archie, including the resignation of consultant Connie Beauchamp and the return of former registrar Thandie Abebe-Griffin. It also focuses on staff members' romantic and family lives. F1 Oliver Valentine becomes romantically involved with registrar Jac Naylor and ward sister Daisha Anderson, and his sister Penny embarks on a secret romance with a heart transplant patient. Consultant Linden Cullen is reunited with his estranged daughter Holly, nurse Donna Jackson decides to adopt her half-niece Mia, sister Chrissie Williams gives birth to a son, Daniel, and Faye becomes pregnant by her estranged husband Joseph. The series includes a crossover episode with sister show Casualty and it also has the highest number of episodes to date, as the series contains a small number of episodes which air during the same week. The series began with 15 roles receiving star billing. Executive producer Tony McHale and actresses Rebecca Grant and Phoebe Thomas announced their intentions to leave the show during the course of the year. Actresses Leslie Ash, Amanda Mealing and Tina Hobley took several-month breaks from filming, and actresses Ginny Holder and Anna-Louise Plowman reprised their roles as Thandie Abebe-Griffin and Annalese Carson respectively. The series received mixed to negative reviews from critics. It was criticised as presenting an inaccurate portrayal of real hospital life, and deemed a soap opera rather than a drama series by former Holby City writer Peter Jukes. It attained strong ratings, however, and was regularly the most-watched show in the 8 pm Tuesday timeslot, frequently drawing a quarter of the audience share. EpisodesProduction=Crew and scheduling The series was produced by the BBC and aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom. In December 2009, executive producer and series co-creator Tony McHale announced his intention to stand down, after four years producing the show. McHale was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime-time drama, and the BBC's controller of drama John Yorke praised him for his success. McHale stated: \\"I've had a terrific four years on Holby and am thrilled with what we've achieved. [...] I know the show will go on from strength to strength.\\" McHale was succeeded as executive producer by Belinda Campbell, and as lead writer by Justin Young, who intends to introduce a more writer-led commissioning process from series thirteen onwards. Young aims for writers to create more of the theme and story of their episodes than was previously the case. The series featured a number of different directors and writers. Each director worked on at least two episodes, except Robert Del Maestro and Edward Bazalgette, who directed one episode each. Dominic Keavey was the series' most frequent director, working on eight episodes. Graham Mitchell was the series' most frequent writer, writing six episodes. Holby City twelfth series aired in the 8 pm timeslot on Tuesdays across the United Kingdom, except in Scotland, where the series has no fixed timeslot. As a result, several episodes originally aired on BBC Scotland before their broadcast in the rest of the United Kingdom. The episode \\"Take No Prisoners\\" originally aired on 10 May 2010 on BBC Scotland. In the rest of the United Kingdom, the episode was rescheduled from 11 May to 12 May 2010 due to extended news coverage of the 2010 UK General Election, and the BBC received 83 complaints over the rescheduling. Episodes were repeated on BBC One on the Monday morning following their original broadcast. Music The series continued the technique of using musical montage or \\"songtage\\" segments in each episode, originally introduced by McHale as a means of modernising the programme. The opening episodes alone, \\"The Hands that Rock the Cradle\\" parts one and two, utilised \\"Ben's Song\\", \\"Answer\\", \\"Angel\\" and \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" by Sarah McLachlan, \\"Sweet About Me\\" by Gabriella Cilmi,\\"Can't Speak French\\" by Girls Aloud, \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" by Sia, The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II, \\"Golden Slippers\\" by Lester Bradley & Friends and \\"Svefn-g- englar\\" by Sigur R√≥s. Asked whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, series producer Diana Kyle responded: \\"Yes - sometimes. On a multi-strand series such as Holby, they are an excellent way of telling stories visually - a moment from each - to open or close an episode or create the passing of time in a concise way for the audience.\\" Kris Green of entertainment and media website Digital Spy suggested that the number of songs used per episode could be \\"very jarring\\", to which Kyle replied: \\"We plan to use music carefully in the future - maybe 'songtages', as above - and sourced music within a scene, that is music actually playing in the scene itself, for example on a radio - but less incidental.\\" Crossovers Series twelve included a crossover storyline with Holby City sister show Casualty. Holby originally launched as a spin-off from Casualty in 1999, and the two dramas have occasionally crossed over in special episodes broadcast as Casualty@Holby City. A new set of crossover episodes written by Casualty lead writer Mark Catley were planned for February 2010. In the event, however, the episodes which saw Casualty Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) operated on by Holby City Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) after suffering a heart attack were broadcast as regular Casualty and Holby City episodes, rather than under the Casualty@Holby City title. Casualty series producer Oliver Kent commented that, while it is \\"fantastic\\" to be able to produce crossover episodes, they are logistically difficult, as Casualty is filmed in Bristol, while Holby City is filmed in Elstree. In June 2010, Kent announced that the two shows would crossover again in September, for the launch of Casualty 25th series. He explained that Holby City nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) would appear in the first episode of the new season of Casualty, at the bequest of Cately, who again wrote the episode. Kent deemed it unlikely that another Casualty@Holby City episode would be produced in the \\"foreseeable future\\", but hoped that characters from the two shows would begin to crossover two or three times a year. 500th episode On 13 April 2010, Holby City reached its 500th episode with \\"Bette Davis Eyes\\", in which Jac (Rosie Marcel) offers to donate a kidney to her mother, who abandoned her as a child, and Chrissie (Tina Hobley) gives birth to a son. Marcel stated that she was \\"really proud\\" of the storyline, and grateful for the opportunity to show a different side of her character, explaining: \\"Everybody always has had their family dragged into things on the show, apart from me. It's actually been five years since I started and now we're finally getting to meet Jac's family. It's exciting.\\" Hobley also enjoyed her storyline, commenting that after Chrissie's first baby died and she then suffered a miscarriage, Chrissie was \\"due some happiness\\". Actress Amanda Mealing stated on the show reaching 500 episodes: \\"It's a huge achievement. Holby always had a good, high standard and that's not easy thing to do when you're on every week for an hour. We're always pushing it and making it better, too. To still be around for the 500th episode is testament to the passion that we all have.\\"  Cast = Overview  The series began with 15 roles receiving star billing. Amanda Mealing portrayed Connie Beauchamp, a consultant on the cardiothoracic surgery ward, Darwin. Paul Bradley played Elliot Hope, also a cardiothoracic consultant, and Luke Roberts played Joseph Byrne, a registrar on Elliot's firm. Hari Dhillon played consultant general surgeon and Director of Surgery Michael Spence. Hugh Quarshie acted as Ric Griffin, also a consultant on the general surgery ward, Keller. Rosie Marcel portrayed Jac Naylor, a general surgical registrar. Emma Catherwood and James Anderson appeared as Penny and Oliver Valentine, siblings and F1 doctors. Duncan Pow played Linden Cullen, a consultant on the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit. Robert Powell played Mark Williams, the unit's consultant nurse, and Tina Hobley played his daughter, ward sister Chrissie Williams. Patsy Kensit and Rebecca Grant played ward sisters Faye Byrne and Daisha Anderson, and Jaye Jacobs and Phoebe Thomas played staff nurses Donna Jackson and Maria Kendall. Patsy Kensit played ward sister Faye Byrne, but announced her intention to depart from the series in 2010. Two actresses departed during the course of the series, with Grant leaving in March 2010, and Thomas departing during the summer. Kensit, Mealing and Roberts also resigned from the show during its twelfth series, however their characters will not depart until series thirteen. Prior to her resignation, Mealing took a three-month break from the show to spend time with her family and travel to Bangladesh. Hobley took four months maternity leave, which coincided with her character's own maternity leave, and actor Alex Macqueen left his recurring role of anaesthetist Keith Greene, having appeared in Holby City since 2005. To compensate for the departing characters, several new characters joined the show during the course of the series. After appearing briefly as Chrissie's one-night stand, Bob Barrett became a main cast member playing locum consultant Sacha Levy. Meanwhile, having made a one off appearance as surgeon Greg Douglas in February 2010, Edward MacLiam joined the cast on a permamanet basis from June 2010. Olga Fedori was promoted to the main cast as Frieda Petrenko, while La Charn√© Jolly was cast as eager new nurse Elizabeth Tait (Holby City). Actors are given the opportunity to shadow real doctors as preparation for their roles. MacLiam spent time with one of Holby City medical advisors, and observed laparoscopic surgery being performed. The series featured several recurring characters, and numerous guest stars. Ginny Holder reprised her role as Thandie Abebe-Griffin, Ric's wife who last appeared in the show's ninth series. Shelagh McLeod appeared as Judith Marchant, a clinical matron who began a relationship with Mark. Judith was written out of the series in January 2010, but McLeod felt things were left \\"open ended\\", suggesting there could be a happy ending for them. She briefly reprised her role in March 2010, as the relationship between Judith and Mark concluded. Leslie Ash played hospital CEO Vanessa Lytton. In December 2009, it was announced that Ash would take a several-month break from the series, returning later in 2010. In June 2010, Anna-Louise Plowman reprised her role as Annalese Carson, wife of Michael Spence. Joshua Bowman had a semi- recurring role, portraying cardiothoracic patient Scott James, who became romantically involved with Penny. Riann Steele appeared as nurse Lauren Minster, and Rick Warden played locum consultant Toby Geddes, described as \\"hugely irritating\\" by Scott Matthewman of The Stage. On 29 June 2010, Jane Asher announced that she would be reprising her recurring role as Lady Byrne, mother of Joseph, for a storyline involving Faye's pregnancy.

Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror reviewed the opening episode positively, writing: \\"We should start a petition to get Holby's creator and exec producer Tony McHale back writing for the show more often, because when he turns in an episode like this one, it's a cracker.\\" However, Simon commented in a later review that Holby is often \\"Depressing as hell\\". In October 2009, former Holby City writer Peter Jukes wrote a critical piece for Prospect magazine, contrasting Holby and Casualty negatively with the standard of American television dramas. Jukes wrote that Holby City has become a soap opera, rather than a drama. Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent reviewed a December 2009 episode poorly, finding it \\"astonishing\\" that any patients leave Holby General alive, as the staff are \\"so busy looking stricken or lovelorn at each other\\". Sutcliffe criticised the themes of \\"bedside relationship counselling\\" and \\"intercollegiate rivalry\\", and commented: \\"Anyone in search of a comedy masterclass should watch, but, you know, I don't think this is meant to be a spoof either.\\" Janet Street- Porter, also of The Independent, felt that Holby City had \\"come to the end of [its] natural life\\" and should be cancelled. In November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticizing Holby City and Casualty for misrepresenting real hospital life. Andrew Billen of The Times reviewed the show's 500th episode, noting that he had lost interest in the series following the departure of Anton Meyer (George Irving) in 2002. He deemed the cast a \\"bizarre old mix\\", but concluded: \\"I could fall in love with this nonsense all over again.\\" Accolades During series twelve, Holby City was nominated for the \\"Best Drama\\" award at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards, however lost to rival BBC One drama Waterloo Road. It was shortlisted in the \\"Best Television Continuing Drama\\" category at the 2010 Writers Guild of Great Britain Awards, with a group nomination for McHale, Young, Catley, Mitchell, Dana Fainaru, Martha Hillier, Chris Murray, David Lawrence, Veronica Henry, Peter Lloyd, Joe Ainsworth, Abi Bown, Andrew Holden, Ian Kershaw, Sebastian Baczkiewicz, Rob Williams, Al Smith, Claire Bennett, Jake Riddell, Nick Warburton, Sonali Bhattacharyya, Rebecca Wojciechowski, Tom Bidwell, Dan Sefton, Paul Mari, Nick Fisher and Sally Abbott. The series was longlisted for the \\"Best Drama\\" award at the 2010 National Television Awards, with \\"Best Drama Performance\\" nominations for Roberts and Marcel, and a \\"Best Newcomer\\" nomination for Fedori, who progressed to the shortlist. It was additionally nominated in the \\"Best Soap/Continuing Drama\\" category at the 2011 Broadcast Awards. Ratings The twelfth series of Holby City averaged 6.3 million viewers and a 23.1% audience share.

In the United States, an estimated 1 million to 9 million children have at least one lesbian or gay parent.What happens to kids raised by gay parents?, Mackenzie Carpenter, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 10, 2007. Concern for these children and others to come are the basis for both opposition to and support for marriage for LGBT couples. Research and positions of professional scientific organizations Scientific research has been consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents.Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, The American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as Amici Curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees According to scientific literature reviews published in prestigious peer-reviewed journals and statements of mainstream professional associations, there is no evidence to the contrary. The American Psychological Association reports that some studies suggest parenting skills of gays and lesbians might be \\"superior.\\" Biblarz and Stacey state that while research has found that families headed by (at least) two parents are generally best for children, outcomes of more than two parents (as in some cooperative stepfamilies, intergenerational families, and coparenting alliances among lesbians and gay men) have not yet been studied.  United States  As noted by Professor Judith Stacey of New York University: ‚ÄúRarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights‚Äù. Among these mainstream organizations in the United States are the American Psychiatric Association, the National Association of Social Workers, Child Welfare League of America, the American Bar Association, the North American Council on Adoptable Children, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychoanalytic Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians. In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics stated in Pediatrics: > On the basis of this comprehensive review of the literature regarding the > development and adjustment of children whose parents are the same gender, as > well as the existing evidence for the legal, social, and health benefits of > marriage to children, the AAP concludes that it is in the best interests of > children that they be able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing > and care that comes with the civil marriage of their parents, without regard > to their parents‚Äô gender or sexual orientation. In 2006, the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and National Association of Social Workers stated in an amicus brief presented to the Supreme Court of the State of California: > Although it is sometimes asserted in policy debates that heterosexual > couples are inherently better parents than same-sex couples, or that the > children of lesbian or gay parents fare worse than children raised by > heterosexual parents, those assertions find no support in the scientific > research literature.

No credible empirical research suggests otherwise. > Allowing same-sex couples to legally marry will not have any detrimental > effect on children raised in heterosexual households, but it will benefit > children being raised by same-sex couples. Peer-reviewed studies indicate that no research supports the widely held conviction that the gender of parents matters for child well-being. The methodologies used in the major studies of same-sex parenting meet the standards for research in the field of developmental psychology and psychology generally and are considered reliable by members of the respective professions.Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: Affidavit - United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009) A roundup of related research on Journalist's Resource, a project of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, found few if any downsides to children being raised by a same-sex couple, and some positive effects. JournalistsResource.org, retrieved May 15, 2012  Canada  The Canadian Psychological Association stated in 2004 and 2006: > Beliefs that gay and lesbian adults are not fit parents, or that the > psychosocial development of the children of gay and lesbian parents is > compromised, have no basis in science. Our position is based on a review > representing approximately 50 empirical studies and at least another 50 > articles and book chapters and does not rest on the results of any one > study.

Australia  In 2007, the Australian Psychological Society stated: \\"The family studies literature indicates that it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting and relationships within the family) that contribute to determining children‚Äôs wellbeing and ‚Äòoutcomes‚Äô, rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents. The research indicates that parenting practices and children's outcomes in families parented by lesbian and gay parents are likely to be at least as favourable as those in families of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families. The main reason given (by lawmakers) for not allowing people to marry the person of their choice if that person is of the same gender has been the inaccurate assertion that this is in the best interest of children, and that children ‚Äòneed‚Äô or ‚Äòdo better‚Äô in a family with one parent of each gender. As the reviews, statements, and recommendations written by many expert and professional bodies indicate, this assertion is not supported by the family studies research, and in fact, the promotion of this notion, and the laws and public policies that embody it, are clearly counter to the well-being of children.\\" Many states and territories with the exception of Northern and Western Australia have laws that allow couples to register their domestic relationships, which is called de facto relationship. There is a concern regarding the rights accorded to family members in this type of relationship. The reason for this is that there is currently no Australian law covering the rights of these families except for a few domestic partner employment benefits. Families also do not have access to a set of benefits and mechanisms provided to married couples. For instance, same-sex couples usually face the burden of proof complexities required by institutions in order to avail of their services and this complicates the lives of members in cases of interpersonal or family conflict, affecting their psychological well-being. This is demonstrated in the case of being considered a legal parent for two women who used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to have a child. The biological parent is the legal parent whereas the other need to undergo the ordeal of having to prove the existence of a relationship with the mother of the child. There are also reports that the current debate on same- sex marriage results in the increasing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ) people. In a statement by the National Mental Health Commission, it was stated that ‚ÄúLGBTIQ people have experienced damaging behaviour in their workplaces, communities and in social and traditional media\\" and that it is \\"alarmed about potential negative health impacts these debates are having on individuals, couples and families who face scrutiny and judgment.‚Äù  In U.S. federal and state law  In Anderson et al. v. King County, a case that challenged Washington's Defense of Marriage Act, the Washington Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the law survive constitutional attack. The majority concluded that the legislature had rational basis, that is, it was entitled to believe, and to act on such belief, that only allowing opposite-sex marriages \\"furthers procreation\\".State Supreme Court upholds gay marriage ban In response, a group of marriage advocates filed what became Initiative 957 which, if passed, would have made procreation a legal requirement for marriage in Washington State. The Maryland Supreme Court used similar grounds to rule that it was permissible to confer the benefits of marriage only on opposite-sex couples. The issue of procreation highlights a biological inequality between opposite-sex and same-sex couples, an inequality that is raised in American legal circles in light of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act that defines marriage in Federal law as \\"a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife\\". Congressional record, a House Report (H.R. 104‚Äì664 at 33, 104th Congress, 2nd Session, 1996), states that procreation is key to the requirement of a valid marriage being a union and of one man and one woman. It has been suggested that Congress acted in anticipation to legal challenges based on the Defense of Marriage Act that might rely on a dicta made in a 1965 Supreme Court ruling, Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479) procreation is not essential to marriage: :: Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Griswold v. Connecticut In Conaway v. Deane (2003), the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that the State has a legitimate interest in encouraging a family structure in which children are born. The court then refrained from deciding whether this interest was served by the status quo, leaving it to the other branches to decide. The Massachusetts Supreme Court concluded in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that even if it were the case that children fare better when raised by opposite-sex parents, the argument against same-sex marriage is unsound because the state failed to show how banning same-sex marriages discouraged gay and lesbian individuals from forming families or how restricting marriage to heterosexual couples discouraged heterosexual individuals from having nonmarital children.Goodridge v. Department of Public Health - text of Massachusetts decision authorizing same-sex marriage In June 2005, a New Jersey state appeals court, in the decision Lewis v. Harris, upheld a state law defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, in part, by accepting that the marriage procreation link although maybe not wise wasn't irrational. However, in 2006, the New Jersey state Supreme Court unanimously overruled that decision, requiring the state to make available to all couples in New Jersey the equal protection of family laws irrespective of the gender of the participants but not necessarily the title. In 2003, the Arizona Court of Appeals, in a decision Standhardt v. Superior Court (77 P.3d 451, 463-464) with regards to Arizona's state marriage law, a three judge panel concluded that the petitioners had failed to prove that the State's prohibition of same sex marriage is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest holding that the State has a legitimate interest in encouraging procreation and child-rearing within the marital relationship, and that limiting marriage to the union of one man and one woman is rationally related to that interest and that even assuming that the State's reasoning for prohibiting same sex marriage was debatable, it was not 'arbitrary' or 'irrational'. In 1971, the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in the decision Baker v. Nelson (191 N.W.2d 185), ruled the state definition survived constitutional scrutiny. The case was appareled to the US Supreme Court who refused to hear the case for want of a substantial federal question. In the 2010 US case Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the trial judge found that \\"[c]hildren raised by gay or lesbian parents are as likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and well-adjusted,\\" and that this conclusion was \\"accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology.\\"Perry v. Schwarzenegger Controversy There is debate over the impact of same-sex marriage upon families and children. Social conservatives and other opponents of same-sex marriage may not see marriage as a legal construct of the state, but as a naturally occurring \\"pre-political institution\\" that the state must recognize; one such conservative voice reasons that \\"government does not create marriages any more than government creates jobs.\\" The article, Marriage and the Limits of Contract, argues that the definition proposed by same-sex marriage advocates changes the social importance of marriage from its natural function of reproduction into a mere legality or freedom to have sex. Dennis Prager, in arguing that marriage should be defined exclusively as the union of one woman and one man, claims that families provide the procreative foundation that is the chief building block of civilization. The focus of the argument is that relationships between same-sex couples should not be described as \\"marriages,\\" and that a rationale for this is that the putative ability to have natural offspring should be a formal requirement for a couple to be able to marry. Opponents of same-sex marriage, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Southern Baptist Convention, and National Organization for Marriage, argue that children do best when raised by a mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to the best interests of children. David Blankenhorn cites the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which says that a child has \\"the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents,\\" in support of this argument (before he reversed position on the issue). Some same-sex marriage opponents argue that having and raising children is the underlying purpose of marriage. The opponents of same-sex marriage assume that same-sex unions implicitly lack the everyday ability of opposite-sex couples to produce and raise offspring by natural means. They also argue that children raised by same-sex partners are disadvantaged in various waysBenne, Robert, and McDermott, Gerald. Speaking Out: Why Gay Marriage Would Be Harmful. Christianity Today 2006. and that same-sex unions thus cannot be recognized within the scope of \\"marriage.\\" The argument that a child has the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents leaves a number of issues open to debate involving same-sex marriage, including infertile heterosexual couples or couples not wishing for children, as well as same-sex unions where a family exists with children from previous relationships, adoption, artificial insemination, surrogacy, or co-parenting. Social consequences are also heavily debated, such as whether marriage should be defined in terms of procreation. In contrast, same-sex marriage advocates argue that by expanding marriage to gay and lesbian individuals, the state actually protects the rights of all married couples and of children raised by same-sex partners while in no way affecting the rights of opposite-sex married couples and their children, natural or adopted.Drucker, Peter. \\"Changing families and communities: an LGBT contribution to an alternative development path.\\" Development in Practice 19.7 (15 November 2009): 825-836. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009 Some same-sex marriage supporters also claim that the historic definition of marriage is viewed as a license to sexual intercourse and is a license to treat the wife as a possession of her husband, has already been changed by social progress. The legal equality men and women enjoy in modern marriage makes it no longer illegal to have sexual intercourse before marriage. Some proponents of same-sex marriage argue that laws limiting civil marriage to opposite-sex couples are underinclusive because they do not prohibit marriages between sterile opposite-sex couples or to women past menopause; therefore, they take the view that the procreation argument cannot reasonably be used against same-sex marriages.For example, Jonathan Rauch in \\"For Better or Worse?\\" in The New Republic. May 6, 1996. Reprinted in a book by Andrew Sullivan (editor) in 1997. Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con - A Reader. Vintage Books, a division of Random House, Inc., New York, and in Canada by Random House of Canada Limited, Toronto. Pages 175-176. Proponents also consider these laws restricting marriage to be unconstitutionally overinclusive, as gay and lesbian couples can have children either through natural or artificial means or by adoption.For example, In 2002, in a leading Canadian same-sex marriage case encaptioned Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General), a Canada court found that \\"excluding gays and lesbians from marriage disregards the needs, capacities, and circumstances of same-sex spouses and their children.\\" NARTH and American College of Pediatricians (a religious conservative organization; not to be confused with American Academy of Pediatrics) argue that mainstream health and mental health organizations have, in many cases, taken public positions on homosexuality and same-sex marriage that are based on their own social and political views rather than the available science The American Psychological Association, on the other hand, considers positions of NARTH unscientific, and the Canadian Psychological Association has expressed concern that \\"some are mis- interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values.\\" Views held by the American College of Pediatricians are also contrary to views of American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical and child welfare authorities which take the view that sexual orientation has no correlation with the ability to be a good parent and raise healthy and well- adjusted children.Brief of Amici Curiae National Association of Social Workers, p. 15 Stanley Kurtz of the Hoover Institution contends that same-sex marriage separates the ideas of marriage and parenthood, thereby accelerating marital decline. Kurtz points to Scandinavia as an example of such a place, though he admits that in that case, other factors have also led to the decline of marriage. Divorce rates Internationally, the most comprehensive study to date as it appears in the Issues in Legal Scholarship Journal is Nordic Bliss? Scandinavian Registered Partnerships and the Same-Sex Marriage Debate. It notes the effect of same-sex partnerships on opposite-sex marriage and divorce rates was conducted looking at over 15 years of data from the Scandinavian countries. The study by researcher Darren Spedale found that 15 years after Denmark had granted same-sex couples the rights of marriage, rates of opposite-sex marriage in those countries had gone up, and rates of opposite-sex divorce had gone down ‚Äì contradicting the concept that same-sex marriages would have a negative effect on opposite-sex marriages. (see pgs.29-31) A multi-method, multi-informant comparison of community samples of committed gay male and lesbian (30 participants each) couples with both committed (50 young engaged and 40 older married participants) and non- committed (109 exclusively dating) opposite-sex pairs was conducted in 2008.Roisman, Glenn I.; Clausell, Eric; Holland, Ashley; Fortuna, Keren; Elieff, Chryle. \\"Adult romantic relationships as contexts of human development: A multi-method comparison of same-sex couples with opposite-sex dating, engaged, and married dyads.\\" Developmental Psychology, Vol 44(1), January 2008, 91-101. Specifically, in this study the quality of same- and opposite-sex relationships was examined at multiple levels of analysis via self-reports and partner reports, laboratory observations, and measures of physiological reactivity during dyadic interactions. Additionally, individuals in same-sex, engaged, and marital relationships were compared with one another on adult attachment security as assessed through the coherence of participants' narratives about their childhood experiences. Results indicated that individuals in committed same-sex relationships were generally not distinguishable from their committed opposite-sex counterparts.

After releasing several singles, he and his label, Virgin Records, decided to go on a several month worldwide tour, The Voodoo Tour. D'Angelo decided to surround himself with a group for the duration of the tour, composed with artists close or not so close surrounding. Because of its composition, The Soultronics is considered a supergroup, composed of artists who are themselves already part of a group, or from different musical origins. The large-scale group consisted of up to thirteen members. Although created for D'Angelo's tour, the group was actually created by three other artists and close friends of D'Angelo's: Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson of The Roots, James Poyser and Pino Palladino, all of whom contributed to Voodoo.

It was produced by a subsidiary of Tobis Film. Location shooting took place around Potsdam, including at the Garrison Church. Interiors were shot at the Grunewald and Johannisthal Studios. It premiered at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo. Part of the tradition of Prussian films of the Weimar and Nazi eras, the film ostensibly deals with the intense conflict between Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I and his son and heir, Crown Prince Friedrich - the future King Friedrich II \\"The Great\\". This is a well-known incident of 18th century German history, which had drawn much public attention in the time itself, and been artistically treated before. However, in its specific presentation of this historical theme, the film was clearly seen to be a work of Nazi propaganda aimed at extolling the F√ºhrerprinzip, i.e. blind obedience to the Leader (the King in the film's plot, Hitler in the reality for which the film was a parable); complaints of \\"encirclement\\" and the need for Lebensraum also feature.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema, p 113 For that reason, the film was banned by the Allied military government following the Nazi defeat in 1945. However, after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany the FSK (\\"Voluntary Self Regulation of the Movie Industry\\") subjected it to a test on 4 August 1958 and ruled that, unlike other films made under the Nazis, the propaganda element in it was not so blatant as to justify its inclusion in the list of \\"Forbidden Films\\" (:de:Vorbehaltsfilm).  Plot  The film opens at Potsdam in the time of \\"The Soldier King\\" Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, with the Royal Family sitting at the breakfast table. It turns out that Crown Prince Friedrich, informally called \\"Fritz\\", had lost so much money at the gaming tables that he had to sign debentures. Members of the grenadier regiment had seen the crown prince appearing late in a wretched state, which greatly angers his father. The King would like to prepare his son for the future role as a ruler, and regards his preoccupation with music and literature with much displeasure. Fritz, for his part, is infuriated with the austere treatment by his father and hatches a plan to flee Prussia and get to France and England, where he expects a welcome from his mother's family. His companion Katte would like to help him in this plan. However, being a second lieutenant bound by his officer's code, he at first declines. The father-son conflict further escalates when Fritz accumulates even heavier gambling debts than those the King already had to pay off. The King insults the Crown prince, calling him \\"a liar and coward\\" and puts him under arrest. In the barracks, he is forbidden to engage in his beloved flute playing or read French literature. At night the King returns earlier than usual and surprises the Crown Prince playing the flute in the music room together with his sister Wilhelmine. Katte, who was also present, manages to hide just in time. The angry King throws Fritz's books and flute into the open fire and orders the Crown Prince to accompany him on a trip to South Germany. Fritz, more than ever determined on his escape plan, can count on Katte's support after this incident. However, the escape fails, and both the Crown Prince and Second Lieutenant Katte are condemned by a court martial to custody at the fortress of K√ºstrin. Indeed, the King goes much further, arbitrarily changing the judgement against Katte into capital punishment and insisting on having him actually executed. The Crown Prince submits to the King's authority and is moved to better quarters in a palace. Nevertheless, in a visit by the King it is evident that the relationship between father and son is still very chilly and they are estranged. Fritz, who in the meantime has proved his \\"character,\\" is now given his own household at Rheinsberg Castle where he can again follow his artistic inclinations. Still, reconciliation between the estranged father and son does come about shortly before the death of the King. The last words of the Old King to the Young are: \\"Make Prussia great!\\" (The audience, aware of basic elements of German history included in their school curriculum, know that Friedrich would duly proceed to do just that.)

DJ Hero 2 uses a special turntable-controller, the same as introduced in DJ Hero, to simulate turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and sound effect generators. The game is developed by FreeStyleGames and is published by Activision, and was released worldwide in October 2010. Similar to DJ Hero, players in DJ Hero 2 follow specific actions on the turntable controller in time to marked scrolling indicators on the game's screen, earning points for correctly performing actions in time. The game includes a new freestyle mode, giving the player the chance to freely crossfade between tracks, scratch a section of a mix, or add sample effects during marked sections. The game features 83 mixes on disc comprising over 100 different songs, with further mixes available as downloadable content. Most mixes have been assembled by FreeStyleGames, but other professional DJs, including David Guetta, deadmau5, DJ Qbert, Ti√´sto and RZA, have provided both their mixing skills and character avatar for the game. Players can challenge these mixes at any time in a Quickplay mode, progress through them in the single-player Empire mode, or play cooperatively or competitively with a second user in offline and online game modes. A third player can also participate through singing the mix' vocals. DJ Hero 2 was well received by critics, receiving praise for maintaining and improving upon the core elements of the first game, and for a soundtrack featuring a wide selection of genres. However, sales for the title were low, failing to reach similar numbers as DJ Hero from the previous year. In conjunction with poor sales from the Guitar Hero franchise, Activision announced the cancellation of further development in February 2011, leaving DJ Hero 2 as the final multi-platform iteration of the DJ Hero franchise. Gameplay DJ Hero 2 includes support for three players to play at the same time - two on turntables and one vocalist. DJ Hero 2 follows from its predecessor in simulating the performance of a disc jockey mixing one or two songs using a special turntable controller. The controller, the same unit as shipped previously with DJ Hero, includes a rotatable turntable to use for recording scratching, three \\"stream\\" buttons to match notes from the two music tracks and an effects track, and a slider to control the crossfade between tracks. These actions are presented to the players through on-screen notation that scrolls in time with the music. Players score points by performing the actions correctly, but are not penalized otherwise. By successfully completing a consecutive set of actions, the player can increase their scoring multiplier up to 4x; the multiplier returns to 1x should they miss any actions. Certain marked sections, when played correctly, fill a \\"Euphoria\\" (the \\"Star Power\\" for this game) meter which can be unleashed using another button on the controller and will temporarily double the scoring. The player can also earn the ability to rewind a song by a few seconds by playing a long string of consecutive notes. They can rewind the song by quickly spinning the turntable in reverse; the rewind effect can be used to either correct a mistake or further boost one's scoring. Small changes have been made in the turntable playback within DJ Hero 2: freestyle effects samples, previously based on game-wide preselected \\"effect packs\\", are mix-specific, and the game does not penalize the player for small variations in fast scratching sections as long as it follows the general beat of the song. Specially marked freestyle sections, previously limited to only added sample effects over the track, allow the player to freely mix between the two tracks, use their own scratch effects, or add effects hits while within these sections. The display for these freestyle sections shows marks where switching between the tracks would achieve a strong audio effect, and the player is graded on how well they hit these markers after the end of each mix. In addition to using a turntable, players have the option to sing or rap to the mixes' lyrics, similar to vocal parts in current Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using a compatible microphone controller from most previous rhythm games. The game will score vocals based on the matching of pitch, beat and rhythm. DJ Hero 2 features an improved single-player career mode called \\"Empire\\". Empire provides more structure for the player to proceed through the game than the simple set lists used in DJ Hero. Through Empire mode, the player works though a number of pre-determined setlists and boss battles (as described below) with the celebrity avatars and fictional DJ's at one of six different venues, earning stars that unlock additional venues to play at. Completing certain setlists or battles unlock new characters, outfits for those characters, and virtual turntable decks for the player. Five of these decks are \\"power decks\\" that slightly change the scoring mechanism or play style of the game; one increases the maximum multiple to 5x, while another one increases the rate that notes are displayed but increases the base scoring system. The primary focus of DJ Hero 2 has been the social aspects, according to FreeStyleGames' creative director Jamie Jackson; as such, many of the games' new modes feature multiplayer considerations. The game supports the \\"Party Play\\" mode introduced in Guitar Hero 5, allowing players to jump into a song, alter the difficulty during gameplay, change between turntable and vocals, and leave at any time, while the game continues to run in a jukebox mode. Several new competitive modes engage two DJ players against each other; some modes have both DJs performing alongside each other but with competitive edges such as a \\"Checkpoint\\" race where each DJ attempts to earn the best score within a section of a song. DJ Battles see two DJ's performing call-and-response style along with open freestyle sections. The online mode includes a simple role-playing video game mechanic whereby participating and winning battles with other players earns the player DJ Points that lead to level increases and additional perks. The game does not include \\"DJ vs Guitar\\" mode that was featured in DJ Hero, where a second player could use a compatible guitar controller to play alongside the DJ player. Development DJ Hero 2 was officially announced in June 2010 for release in the last quarter of 2010. Prior to the game's announcement, Activision revealed a month before the game's release that it is actively seeking artists for downloadable content and a sequel to the game. David Guetta has stated that he was set to work on the game's sequel, to arrive late in 2010. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that despite low sales of DJ Hero, they are committed to continuing the series, with the sequel due in 2010. The sequel, DJ Hero 2, was further confirmed during an Activision investors report for 2009, citing it as one of only 2 major Guitar Hero titles to be expected from Activision in 2010, with an expected late-2010 release date. Work on DJ Hero 2 started some months after the first game was completed, as the development team had endured heavy working hours to meet the release deadline. FreeStyleGames' creative director Jamie Jackson said that DJ Hero 2 took about seven months to complete. While they were able to easily build on the existing framework for DJ Hero, FreeStyleGames wanted to do more than just include new mixes, and sought to include additional features such as the Battle Mixes into the game. Many of the game's new features are a result of feedback from players, including the game's social modes and improvements in the game's interface to provide a cleaner look and instantaneous visual feedback to the player. The team also worked at improving the game's graphics; the appearance of DJ Heros graffiti-based menus gave the impression of being a hip-hop game, but FreeStyleGames wanted to distance DJ Hero 2 from that. They also wanted to clean up the gameplay's interface, providing better feedback to the player and making it easily to tell when they were winning or losing. While DJ Hero 2 does not use Kinect or PlayStation Move motion-sensing technology, Jackson had not ruled them out for a future iteration of the game. Another step to move the game from the apparent hip-hop nature was through its song selection. Jackson felt the first game was weighted too heavily to the genre, with about 60% of the songs being hip-hop. The songs in DJ Hero 2 represent a wider variety of music, including dance, drum and bass, and techno, along with some contributions from hip-hop. Jackson noted that they were able to work better with artists and publishers for DJ Hero 2, after the successful launch of the first game; with artists and publishers now knowing what to expect, \\"there is more understanding, so it has opened the doors to us in terms of getting more popular music\\", according to Jackson. However, licensing for such music remained a difficult barrier. Mixes for DJ Hero 2 are made first through computer-aided mixing of the two song tracks combined with effects noises, with simultaneous authoring of the gameplay markers. Noise for the scratching sections are filled in by recording the sounds of the tracks actually scratched on a DJ deck. Usher contributed his song \\"OMG\\" featuring will.i.am for DJ Hero 2, which he and will.i.am performed live at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Usher had previously been approached by Kotick before the release of DJ Hero for future projects for Activision. Usher found, after following the success of DJ Hero, that the game was \\"very interesting\\" as a means of connecting younger gamers to music such as his that they would not be able to experience live at a club, leading to his desire to be a part of the sequel. FreeStyleGames found that by selecting mix artists such as Deadmau5 and Ti√´sto who are more widely known than some artists in the first game, they were able to give DJ Hero 2 a different feel, embracing the theatrics of these artists. FreeStyleGames had tried to include Ti√´sto within the first game, but could not do it within the deadline, but instead was used as part of the first game's promotion, and later would be used as Activision's \\"ambassador\\" for the game to Europe. Furthermore, the game's soundtrack has been selected to include more dance and pop tracks taken from European artists to make the game more Euro-friendly. Promotion A demo for DJ Hero 2 was released to the PlayStation network and the Xbox Live on September 7, 2010. The demo contains four mixes, two of which were playable: Pussycat Dolls featuring Busta Rhymes - \\"Don‚Äôt Cha\\" vs. Pitbull - \\"I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)\\" and Lady Gaga featuring Colby O'Donis - \\"Just Dance\\" vs. deadmau5 - \\"Ghosts N Stuff\\". The mix Estelle featuring Kanye West - ‚ÄúAmerican Boy‚Äù vs. Chic - \\"Good Times\\" was used as a tutorial and the mix MSTRKRFT featuring N.O.R.E. - \\"Bounce\\" (Beat Juggle) could be heard in the menu background. A viral browser game, DJ Hero 2 Mix 2Gether, was released on October 17, 2010. The viral game was made by digital agency fish in a bottle and features a cut down version of the full game product. Three mixes are included in the viral and are all playable: Lady Gaga featuring Colby O'Donis - \\"Just Dance\\" vs. Deadmau5 - \\"Ghosts N Stuff\\", Blakroc featuring Pharoahe Monch and RZA - \\"Dollaz and Sense\\" and Ti√´sto and Sneaky Sound System - \\"I Will Be Here\\" vs. Ti√´sto - \\"Speed Rail\\". Unique to the viral game is a \\"Create A Mix\\" mode which allows players to create their own mixes, share them and challenge friends through email, Twitter, facebook and Myspace. DJ Hero 2 was sold with various promotional items. Within Europe and select stores in North America, players that purchased the game in one of two bundle packages (either with one or two turntable controllers) received the predecessor DJ Hero free. Other North American stores offered carrying cases for the turntables, MP3 versions of selected mixes, or redemption codes for in-game customization options. Post-release A glitch was observed by players on Xbox 360 where, if they were playing while online and had exactly 100 friends attached to their account, the game would freeze and/or they would be unable to play online. Activision issued a patch to correct this a few days after release. The music video for Ti√´sto's \\"Speed Rail\\" is composed only of footage from DJ Hero 2 including the Ti√´sto avatar. Soundtrack DJ Hero 2s setlist includes 83 mashups from nearly 100 songs from about 85 different artists. Game Informer stated that the game's soundtrack still strongly represents the genre of hip-hop, but adds more elements from electronica, pop, and dance. David Guetta, Deadmau5, DJ Qbert, Ti√´sto and RZA are playable avatars within the game and they will help create mixes for the game. Most of the in-game scratching was performed by former World DMC Champion DJ Blakey, and some by Joe Lenzie of Sigma. DJ Hero 2 supports downloadable content in the form of new mixes that can be purchased from the consoles' respective online stores. In addition, through an additional free add-on released in November 2010, players will be able to purchase existing downloadable content from the first game to use within DJ Hero 2. Activision's February 2011 decision to shutter their Guitar Hero development initially stated that no further downloadable content will be forthcoming for the title, but due to \\"continued support\\" from their fanbase, Activision has since decided it will continue to release downloadable content for the game through at least March and April 2011 with packs that were in the works prior to the closure of Guitar Hero. Reception DJ Hero 2 was well received by critics, who felt the game was a significant improvement in both gameplay, presentation, and song selection from its predecessor. Michael Brown of 1UP.com noted while there was very little overall change to the gameplay, \\"it's the minor tweaks that make it a definite improvement over the original\\". Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer believed that DJ Hero 2 was \\"much slicker, clearer and more tasteful\\" with changes in presentation and interface that quickly allows the players to jump into the game. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica called the title \\"the best kind of sequel\\" as it retained the best features of DJ Hero and added further improvements atop of those. Matt Wales of IGN noted that the early difficulty levels of the game were much more suited to beginners \\"to make for a more convincing DJing experience, without sacrificing that all- important accessibility\\". Critics praised the new freestyle features into gameplay, citing the overuse of the Flavor Flav default sample in the first game. MacDonald favored how FreeStyleGames transformed the limited freestyle sections of the first game into \\"an integral part\\" of the sequel. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer stated that the nature of DJ Hero 2s freestyling made him feel that he was \\"helping craft the mix, not just hitting buttons in time\\". While the addition of new multiplayer modes was well-received, many felt the vocal track addition did not work out well. Chris Watters of GameSpot noted that \\"the singing evaluation doesn't feel as slick as in other games\\", and unless the player knows the music from both tracks of a mix, singing the back-and-forth mix \\"isn't all that fun\\". Helgeson commented that attempting to sing lyrics from two separate songs \\"feels like playing karaoke game in the grips of a seizure\\". Reviewers found the soundtrack to provide a wider range of genres, moving away from hip-hop and into house and dance genres, to appeal to more players. Helgeson considered that the mixes were \\"uniformly great\\", and balanced popular artists with skilled DJ mixers. MacDonald stated the soundtrack was \\"faultless\\" and that while featuring a large number of songs from the club scene, the soundtrack is \\"still a powerful draw if you don't know or even like the music\\". Official Xbox Magazine UKs Mike Channell believed the \\"mashups also feel even more playful this time around\\", creating new interpretations of the lyrics of songs through the mixing. Cian Hassett of PalGN called the setlist \\"the most incredible fusion of contrasting genres known to man\\". Some critics commented that they felt the first game's track list was better; Damien Hatfield of IGN felt there was \\"more variety\\" in the original game's mix and better representation within certain genres, while Brown favored DJ Heros set for \\"how it mixed together frequently disparate tracks\\" and that many mixes in the sequel favored too much of one song in the mix. The NPD Group's North American sales estimates for DJ Hero 2 during its launch month were 59,000 units. Combined sales in North America of DJ Hero 2 and Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock were below one million in 2010, 63% below the total sales of Guitar Hero 5, DJ Hero, and Band Hero from 2009. As a result of faltering sales for its Guitar Hero series, Activision shuttered its Guitar Hero division, cancelling at least one planned game for 2011. The closure also affects the DJ Hero series, as Activision has stated that they do not expect to publish a music game during 2011.

It was designated as the 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry in 1903 and became 1st Battalion 10th Baluch Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 6th Battalion of The Baloch Regiment.Ahmad, Lt Col RN. (2010). Battle Honours of the Baloch Regiment. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre. Early history The regiment was raised in June 1820 at Bombay as the 2nd (Marine) Battalion 12th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry by Captain Deschamps. In 1824, it was designated as the 24th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. On 19 January 1839, it stormed and captured the city of Aden as part of a punitive expedition sent to rid the area of pirates. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857-58, the regiment, under the command of Major WG Duncan, operated in Central India against the Marathas led by Tatya Tope and the Rani of Jhansi. In December 1857, it joined the Central India Field Force and during the next six months, fought in several major engagements, including the storming of the fortress of Rahatgarh, the Relief of Saugor, the capture of Jhansi and the Battle of Kalpi, where the Mahratta Army was decisively defeated. It remained employed in mopping up operations till 15 December 1858. During the campaign, it suffered a total of 52 casualties. In 1879-80, it participated in the Second Afghan War, where it was deployed on the line of communication.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (1998). History of the Baloch Regiment 1820-1939.

(1938). History of the Bombay Army. London: Longmans & Green. In 1891, the regiment was localized to the Province of Baluchistan and reconstituted with Balochis, Brahuis, Pathans and Punjabi Muslims. It adopted uniform of drab colour with red trousers and its designation was changed to 24th (Baluchistan) Regiment of Bombay Infantry. In 1895, the Duchess of Connaught was appointed the Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. In 1896, it was dispatched to British East Africa under the command of Lieutenant Colonel AA Pearson to suppress a rebellion in areas now forming Kenya. In 1901, the regiment's designation was changed to 24th (Duchess of Connaught's Own) Baluchistan Infantry.230px 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, all former Bombay Army units had 100 added to their numbers. Consequently, the regiment's designation was changed to 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry and it was delocalized from Baluchistan. On the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment was sent to Persia in 1916, where it raised a second battalion later that year. The 2nd Battalion served with great gallantry in the Mesopotamian Campaign, where it fought in the Battles of Khudaira Bend, Jebel Hamrin and Tikrit. In 1918, it proceeded to Palestine and took part in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the defeat of Turkish Army in Palestine. In the meantime, a third battalion was raised in 1917, which served in South Persia and later, in the Third Afghan War of 1919 and during the Arab uprising in Iraq in 1920. The 1st Battalion also served in the Third Afghan War. During the First World War, the three battalions of 124th DCO Baluchistan Infantry suffered a total of 1179 casualties including 459 killed or died of disease. Subsequent History In 1921, the 3/124th DCO Baluchistan Infantry was disbanded, while the remaining two battalions were grouped with four other Baluch battalions: 126th Baluchistan Infantry, 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis and the 130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles), to form the 10th Baluch Regiment in 1922. The 1/124th DCO Baluchistan Infantry became the 1st Battalion and 2/124th DCO Baluchistan Infantry the 10th (Training) Battalion of the new regiment. During the Second World War, 1/10th Baluch (DCO) served in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. In 1943, the 10th Battalion became the 10th Baluch Regimental Centre. In 1945, the 10th Baluch Regiment lost its number and became The Baluch Regiment. On the independence of Pakistan in 1947, it was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, on the merger of 8th Punjab and Bahawalpur Regiments with the Baluch Regiment, 1 Baluch was redesignated as 6 Baluch (now 6 Baloch). During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion served in the Rann of Kutch and Kasur Sectors.300px Genealogy *1820 - 2nd (Marine) Battalion 12th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry *1823 - 2nd Battalion 12th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry *1824 - 24th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry *1885 - 24th Regiment Bombay Infantry *1891 - 24th (Baluchistan) Regiment Bombay Infantry *1895 - 24th (Baluchistan) (Duchess of Connaught's Own) Regiment of Bombay Infantry *1901 - 24th (Duchess of Connaught's Own) Baluchistan Infantry *1903 - 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry *1917 - 1st Battalion 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry *1922 - 1st Battalion (Duchess of Connaught's Own) 10th Baluch Regiment or 1/10th Baluch *1945 - 1st Battalion (Duchess of Connaught's Own) The Baluch Regiment or 1 Baluch *1956 - 6th Battalion The Baluch Regiment or 6 Baluch *1991 - 6th Battalion The Baloch Regiment or 6 Baloch See also 225px *10th Baluch Regiment *The Baloch Regiment *Lieutenant William Alexander Kerr, VC *General Sir Alfred Astley Pearson, KCB *British East Africa 1896 ReferencesFurther reading * Ahmad, Lt Col Rifat Nadeem.

The surviving minutes of the Assembly, which according to a project to have them published \\"arguably constitute the most important unpublished religious text of seventeenth-century Britain\\", run to over half a million words and are almost all in Byfield's writing. Life He was the third son of Nicholas Byfield, probably born before 1615. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge where he matriculated in 1620, and graduated B.A. in 1624. He was ordained in 1625 and became perpetual curate of the London church All Hallows Staining in 1629. In 1642 he was chaplain to Sir Henry Cholmondeley's regiment. On 6 July 1643 he was appointed one of the two scribes to the Westminster Assembly, the other being Henry Roborough. Their assistant was John Wallis. The scribes were not members of the assembly of which they kept the record, nor were they at first allowed, like the members, to wear their hats; but in common with the other divines the scribes were entitled to the allowance (irregularly paid) of four shillings a day. For their trouble they received the copyright of the Directory of Public Worship (ordered to be published 13 March 1645), which they sold for ¬£400. It was during the sitting of the assembly that Byfield obtained first the sinecure rectory, and then the vicarage of Fulham. Isaac Knight succeeded him in the rectory in 1645, and in the vicarage in 1657. At some unknown date between 1649 and 1654 Byfield received an appointment to the rectory of Collingbourn Ducis, Wiltshire, from which Christopher Prior, D.D., had been removed. Byfield was not disturbed at the Restoration. In 1654 he was nominated one of the assistant commissioners for Wiltshire, under the ordinance of 29 June for ejecting scandalous ministers, and was active among them, for example against Walter Bushnell, vicar of Box, (ejected in 1656). Byfield's assembly practice had made him sharp as an examiner. He died intestate in London, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, at the end of 1660 or very beginning of 1661. His wife, Katharine, survived him, and administered to his effects on 12 February 1661. Samuel Butler in Hudibras' made him iconic of those zealots for presbytery whose tactics opened the way to independency. Works Byfield's most important work consists of the manuscript minutes, or rough notes, of the debates in the assembly, which are almost entirely in his very difficult handwriting. They are preserved in Dr. Williams's Library, and were first edited by Alexander Ferrier Mitchell and John Struthers in 1874. According to Mitchell, Byfield had published a catechism some years before the assembly met. In 1626 he edited his father's Rule of Faith, a work on the Apostles' Creed. To Byfield is ascribed A Brief View of Mr. Coleman his new modell of Church Government, 1645. He also assisted Chambers in his Apology for the Ministers of the County of Wiltshire of 1654.

Music played in this style is known by the general public as \\"gypsy music\\". It is mainly instrumental and usually performed by strings, except in the Romanian variant where the panflute is the main instrument. The accompaniment may be executed by various instruments, but by preference includes a cimbalom and a double bass. Characteristics Music played in the Gypsy style can easily be recognized among many other styles. Characteristic elements of the style include: * instrumentation * the repertoire * the idiom Among these items the last one ‚Äî the idiom ‚Äî is decisive: it is mainly the way of playing that determines whether a tune is played in gypsy style or not. It is ‚Äî just like in jazz ‚Äì not the combination of instruments that determines the style, but its characteristic performance. Notwithstanding this, the first two items ‚Äì instruments and repertoire ‚Äì will be discussed before the main issue ‚Äì the idiom ‚Äì will be dealt with. Instrumentation right Thanks to its accompaniment the tunes are elevated above the level of simple folk-music. Part of the beauty of the music is founded on the harmonies that the cimbalom and the bass add to the score. :A good example is the well-known song Csak egy sz√©p l√°ny, also known as the slow movement in Pablo de Sarasate's Zigeunerweisen. In the sixth bar a modulation from C minor to E flat occurs. Violin and Cimbalom ‚Äì The primas playing in Gypsy style is at the same time orchestral leader and soloist. He suggests variations in the tempo with subtle movements of his bow and his body. He is supported by the cimbalom-player who beats the rhythm with his small hammers and shapes the harmonies. Franz Liszt has said of their cooperation: :Together they exercise the right to shape the music. The violin develops the melody, he shapes the phrases and introduces tiny pauses. The cimbalom sets the rhythm, indicates accelerations and de- accelerations, and affects the volume. Violin ‚Äì There doesn‚Äôt exist an instrument called ‚ÄúGypsy violin‚Äù. Players in gypsy style have a preference for violins with a dark tone-quality from which they can draw a special sound. The listener gets the impression that he hears a ‚ÄúGypsy violin‚Äù but that is not so. The cimbalom takes care of the harmony The Cimbalom ‚Äì A characteristic instrument for producing the gypsy style is the cimbalom. It has a playing- surface strung with steel strings which are hammered with two beaters. The chords are played in arpeggio: one note after the other in rapid succession. This provides the tinkling sound that adds much to the character of the gypsy style. Bass ‚Äì The double bass support the tunes this with its deep booming sound. He lifts, as if it were, the music above itself and gives it a profound base. Without double bass the strength and the soul of the music would be missing. Kontras ‚Äì the melodies win much power by introducing a second violin to the ensemble, the \\"kontras\\" who plays second voices and two-stringed harmonies, and adds in this way much to the musical effect of the Gypsy style. Viola ‚Äì The viola (called here by its German name Bratsche) plays a typical role in the music of this style. In slow movements it takes the two-stringed harmonies from the second violin which then can continue playing second voices. In fast movements the bratsch enhances the rhythm by playing the after-beat ‚Äì see Beat (music) ‚Äì often in a forceful manner, creating the typical Gypsy-style rhythm called ‚Äúestam‚Äù. Piano ‚Äì In larger gypsy style orchestras, especially in Western Europe, a piano is added which does little more than enhancing rhythm and harmony. It is a question of taste: Hungarian and Romanian based orchestras don‚Äôt like a piano in their ranks. But a typical Romani band like Tata Mirando leans on its piano, assisted by a (large model) guitar, and creates in this way a highly characteristic Gypsy sound. Clarinet ‚Äì Orchestras playing Hungarian melodies sometimes include a clarinet. It has a unique role by adorning the melody with ornaments and by ‚Äúplaying around‚Äù the melody. It can be compared with the role of the clarinet in a Dixieland ensemble. Sometimes the clarinet takes the lead and plays a variant of the main melody. The player blows across the open ends of the pipes The Panflute ‚Äì In Romanian orchestras the panflute ‚Äì or na√Ø in Romanian ‚Äì takes the place of the violin in other combinations. The panflute plays the fierce dance tunes of the Romanian folk music in a way similar to the violin in Hungarian fast movements: with many ornamentations and rhythmic variations, but in a style that is instantly recognizable as Romanian. In slow movements it introduces the Gypsy style by varying the pitch, by sliding to a tone and by using different shades of sound. Accordion ‚Äì Romanian and Russian related orchestras often include an accordion. It reinforces the rhythm and strengthens the after-beat. It shall however sparingly be deployed as otherwise the accordion might drown the other voices. In doinas and ballads or czardasses it sometimes takes care of the solos. Larger Formations ‚Äì With the formations described above, a limit in size has been reached. With more than about seven to eight players it becomes difficult to play by heart. Written scores then make their appearance and the Gypsy style is lost. Repertoire The music played in Gypsy style is usually of Hungarian, Romanian or Russian origin. But also melodies from Czech, Bulgarian or other East European origin may be used. The Hungarian melodies are always played in a strict succession: first the slow movements, ballads or lassans, then the medium tempo palotas and thereafter the fast czardas or the even faster friss czardas. A special role is played by the n√≥ta, written music in a folk-style, but played by heart in Gypsy style. The Romanian melodies have an altogether other character, melodically simple but with more complicated rhythms. The fast hora is played in a straightforward 2:2 or 2:4 rhythm, the sirba in a complicated rhythm. The slow doina resembles the blues in jazz and is often improvised with a rubato background of chords. The Russian melodies are characterized by songs that easily can be remembered. Well-known melodies, such as Black Eyes or Kalinka, stem from the Russian repertoire. Slow movements alternate with czardasses; also Cossack songs are played in Gypsy style. A special class is formed by melodies written by Western European musicians in a Gypsy style, such as the Monti czardas, nicknamed Spaghetti Czardas by its critics. Idiom The gypsy style is mainly determined by the characteristic way of playing the violin The most important aspect of the gypsy style is its musical idiom, that can well be compared with the concept of idiom in speech: an American and an Englishman speak the same language, but each of them does that with his own accent, uses his own words and expresses himself in his own manner. In the same way an orchestral violinist and a gypsy violin player use the same instrument, but here as well exist great differences. Each has his own sound, uses his own phrases and expresses himself in his characteristic way. In short, both of them play in their own idiom. Ornamentation The Gypsy style differs from the style of the original folk music by its rich and sometimes oriental ornamentation. The music may sometimes be so embellished that the original melody hardly can be recognized. Simple folk songs are transformed into elaborate melodies that often surpass their originals. :The transformation starts already when playing one tone. A long note is not simply played but is either approached by an elaborate ornament, or ‚Äúslides‚Äù towards the tone, or is reached by a number of short notes in a bouncing effect. An effective way of embellishment is the use of rhythmic variations in the melody: just too early, or just too late. In faster rhythms this produces a bouncing effect that may become most exciting. Accompaniment Like the melody, the accompaniment does not simply follow the harmonic structure of the original but is embellished as well. Characteristic features are: * Chords are more often varied than in the original melody * Harmonic transitions are introduced that did not exist in the original * A harmonic transition that occurs in the original is emphasized so that it sounds as if it were an added harmony * At the end of a melody sometimes a transitional chord is added to prepare for the repetition of the melody * There is a preference for diminished chords, like in some types of jazz music Another effect is joining in \\"too late\\" which enhances the impression of improvisation. The double-bass player sometimes seems to search for the right tone by gliding over the strings towards the right tone. Breathing space A Romani violinist taking ample breathing space; small breaks in the development of a melody. The duration of a pause is critical. Too short of a pause has a reduced dramatic effect, and too long of a pause risks losing the attention of the audience. Taking breathing spaces (Luftpausen in German) is characteristic for a good soloist. : Some Romani violinists go to extremes. Once the primas of the Romani orchestra Tata Mirando took his violin from his shoulder and inspected the shoulder rest whilst his orchestra continued its accompaniment and treated his break as a prolonged Luftpause. It just sounded as if it was meant so from the beginning. After a while the primas could proceed without any embarrassment. Am Tisch A typical element is playing am Tisch ‚Äî the players assemble around the table of a particular party and give there a kind of private concert. This table-music goes back to an old tradition; more than two hundred years ago the first female primas, Panna Czinka, played in this way at the table of her hosts and was extra rewarded for her efforts. Panel A panel of three musical experts was once requested to listen to music played in Gypsy style. The panel consisted of an internationally known conductor, a teacher of musical theory and a musician with experience in improvised music. They listened to a variety of Hungarian lassans, palotasses and czardasses; to Romanian c√¢ntecs, horas, s√¢rbas and doinas; and to Russian romances and czardasses. Their statements were unambiguous: * Exotic scales like the so- called Gypsy scale are rarely used. All melodies are in the classic minor and major tone scales, the harmonies are uncomplicated and have usually a \\"classic\\" sound. * In a few phrases, only an East Asian influence, or a small part of the Gypsy scale, was recognized. * It is the improvised way of playing that makes the music sound to be in the \\"Gypsy style\\": the rhythmic shifts, the ornaments, the treatment of the tone. \\"Beautifully played and very characteristic,\\" was the verdict. \\"Very clever,\\" was said of the small rhythmic shifts in the fast melodies. \\"It lets the music swing, in a way similar to jazz, although with another character.\\" * The harmonic structure of the slow movements has a special character: dissolving of a chord is often postponed so that tension is created. ‚ÄúThe soloist postpones the solution,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe lingers on the dominant,‚Äù were characteristic statements. * In the Romanian music the rhythmic variations were appreciated, but not found complicated. * When listening to Russian melodies the remarkable statement was made that the style does not differ ‚Äì at least in the ears of this panel ‚Äì from that of Hungarian tunes. The melodies may stem from another repertoire, but the manner of playing is not different. Even the balalaika in some of the Russian melodies made use of the same characteristic and improvising style as the violin in other records.

It's the first of Pallett's records to be released under his own name. Since the album was his first to be released in Japan, he wished to avoid generating confusion with the Final Fantasy video games from Square Enix, and to avoid infringing on any trademarks. Pallett stated that his previous albums will be repackaged and reissued under his own name at some point. The record was mixed by New York producer Rusty Santos.Domino Records Artists: Owen Pallett The album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize. Concept and development As a prelude to the album, Pallett recorded an EP, Spectrum, 14th Century. Both the EP and the subsequent full-length are set in an imaginary realm called Spectrum. The songs on Heartland form a narrative concerning a \\"young, ultra-violent farmer\\" named Lewis, commanded by an all- powerful narrator‚Äînamed Owen. According to Pallett, the songs are one-sided dialogues with Lewis speaking to his creator. In an interview, Pallett commented that the idea behind Heartland is \\"preposterous. I wanted to have this contained narrative that has the breadth of a Paul Auster short story.\\" Michael Barclay of Maclean's states that the lyrics raise all sorts of theological questions about believers' relationship with a deity and the nature of fate, but the construct is just a blank canvas.

The ruins of Dohna's former home, Schloss Dohna Schlobitten at S≈Çobity, Poland formerly East Prussia Wilhelm Hermann Alexander F√ºrst zu Dohna-Schlobitten (Alexander, Prince zu Dohna- Schlobitten) (11 December 1899 ‚Äì 29 October 1997) was a German Junker, soldier, businessman and author. Youth Dohna was born in Potsdam, the son of Richard Emil Prince zu Dohna-Schlobitten (1872‚Äì1918) by his marriage to Princess Marie Mathilde zu Solms-Hohensolms-Lich.Alexander F√ºrst Dohna- Schlobitten, Erinnerungen eines alten Ostpreu√üen. , 2006 He grew up in Potsdam, where his father was in the service of the Gardes du Corps, and at his family's estate of Schlobitten. After the outbreak of World War I, due to the danger of invasion by the Russians, Dohna was evacuated to Darmstadt, together with his siblings, where they lived at the court of his uncle-in-law Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse. In 1916 he moved to Davos, Switzerland, where he passed his Abitur in 1918. On 1 June 1918 he joined the Prussian Army regiment Garde du Corps and was deployed to the Ukraine for a short time before the War ended in November. He returned to Schlobitten after his father's death, received a training in agriculture and forestry, and studied at the University of Bonn. From 1924 until 1945 he administered the family estates of Schlobitten and Pr√∂kelwitz. In 1926, Dohna married Countess Freda Antoinette von Arnim-Muskau (1905‚Äì1999).Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F√ºrstliche H√§user, volume XVI. Dohna-Schlobitten. C.A. Starke Verlag, 2001, pp. 428-431. . They had six children between 1927 and 1943. World War II After the Nazis came to power in Germany, Dohna, who was a classmate of Karl Wolff, met Heinrich Himmler and Hermann G√∂ring and planned to join the SS. However, under the influence of Kurt von Plettenberg and his uncle Heinrich Graf zu Dohna-Schlobitten, he distanced himself from going in that direction. Dohna was drafted into the Wehrmacht at the start of World War II and served as a Rittmeister throughout the German invasion of Poland and later the Soviet Union. On 18 January 1943 he was one of the last to be evacuated from Stalingrad, carrying personal letters and the awards of Friedrich Paulus. From January 1944 he served with the LXXV Army Corps in Italy. In March 1944, a U.S. Army commando group of 15 men had landed near La Spezia to blow up railway tunnels as part of Operation Ginny II but were captured by German and Italian troops. Even though these men were wearing US army uniforms (and were therefore POWs), Dohna was ordered to sign the execution orders. However, Dohna refused to do so as this would have violated the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War (thereby constituting a war crime); he was dismissed from the Wehrmacht for this insubordination.Richard Raiber: Anatomy of perjury: Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, Via Rasella, and the Ginny Mission (S. 158) General Anton Dostler, who signed the execution order, was tried for this war crime after hostilities ended. Dostler was subsequently convicted, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. Dohna returned to Schlobitten during the Soviet Army take-over. He organized the flight of the populace of his estates and left Schlobitten on 22 January 1945. With 330 refugees, 140 horses and 38 horse carts he arrived at Hoya on 20 March 1945. The caravan brought Trakehner horses with them, including 31 broodmares, ensuring the survival of that breed. Post-War Shortly before the end of the war Dohna was able to save a significant portion of the inventory of Schlobitten Castle before it was destroyed by arson following occupation by the Red Army. Dohna lived in Thedinghausen from 1945 to 1948. He moved to Switzerland in 1948 and worked for Hoffmann-La Roche. From 1961 to 1979 he owned a dry-cleaning company in L√∂rrach, and in 1979 he moved to Basel, where he wrote his memoirs and died in 1997 at the age of 97. His grandfather, Prince Richard (1843-1916) and father, Prince Richard (1872-1918) having both died toward the end of the Great War, Alexander became the head of his branch of the House of Dohna before World War II. The Kingdom of Prussia had incorporated the lands of the various branches (Lauck, Schlobitten, Reichertswalde and Schlodien-Carwinden) into a privileged family trust in 1840, of which Alexander became a primary beneficiary. Alexander was also the male heir of the Schlobittens, entitled by hereditary grant of 1 January 1900 to bear the title of Prince, as well as Burgrave, and the style of Serene Highness, titles recognised post-monarchy by Germany only as part of his surname. (The other two surviving branches of the Dohna- Schlobitten line were never elevated to princely status; the family historically carried only comital rank, their burgravial fief never having been declared an Imperial State within the Holy Roman Empire.) Alexander was succeeded as head of the Dohna-Schlobitten princely line by the eldest of his sons, the Burgrave Friedrich (born 1933), who has declined to make use of the family's princely title. By his former wife, Countess Alexandra Hahn von Burgsdorff (born 1943), Friedrich is the father of five children including his own heir, Count R√ºdiger zu Dohna-Schlobitten (born 1966), a software designer in Karlsruhe. The Dohna-Schlobitten art collection was exhibited in Berlin's Sch√∂nhausen Palace in 2019.

The need arose when Japan's Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido) was planning for standard-gauge Hokkaido Shinkansen high-speed trains to operate in the undersea Seikan Tunnel from 2016. The problem was that narrow-gauge freight trains did not operate at high speeds. Since the tunnel is 53.85 km (33.46 mi) long, incorporating slower trains into the timetable would significantly disrupt high-speed services. The solution was to mount narrow-gauge freight trains on to faster standard-gauge freight trains. Development When the Hokkaido Shinkansen opened between and in 2016, high-speed Shinkansen trains would need to share the dual gauge tracks through the Seikan Tunnel linking the main island of Honshu with Hokkaido. While in the tunnel, freight trains on the narrow-gauge rails were limited to . The \\"Train on Train\\" concept involved loading narrow-gauge KoKi 100 container wagons on to specially built standard-gauge wagons to allow operation at speeds of up to . , although the plan had not been implemented, speeds were reported as having been increased to after extensive testing. Piggyback by Trainload concept The \\"Train on Train\\" concept was announced in 2006 and a full-size mockup vehicle was built and demonstrated at Naebo Works in 2007. The next phase was to build a prototype train for actual operation. JR Freight was developing new Class EH800 20/25 kV AC electric locomotives to haul these and other trains through the tunnel. A \\"Forum 2050\\" presentation by JR Hokkaido in 2010 stated that using a \\"double traverser\\" arrangement would allow an entire train to be transferred to and from the Train on Train wagons in approximately 10 minutes.

The traditional view among Jews is to regard same-sex relationships as categorically forbidden by the Torah. This remains the current view of Orthodox Judaism, but not of Reconstructionist Judaism, Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism, which started changing its position to same- sex unions in 2006. As the issue of same-sex marriage has broached the forefront of social and political consciousness in the United States over the past few years, it has also become more prevalent in the Jewish community as well. Certain branches of Judaism that had until recently been less open to gay rights have made organizational changes on the issues. The Conservative Movement was the last of Judaism‚Äôs liberal streams to adopt a more progressive streamlined approach to dealing with issues related to homosexuality. Even within the insular Orthodox community, there is a small, but growing population of individuals and leaders who are actively engaged in the struggle for same-sex marriage as a secular institution in America. Rabbi Steven Greenberg is an openly gay Orthodox rabbi who is leading the charge among open-minded Orthodox and traditionally-observant Jews around the world. Leading Orthodox rabbis have denounced reparative therapy and have embraced a much more toned-down approach to homosexuality in Judaism. Each year dozens of observant Jewish students \\"come out of the closet\\" and many have increasingly remained involved in organized Jewish life. Organizations have been established to assist Jews struggling with the perceived dichotomy between living a traditional Jewish life and being homosexual. Eshel was established by Rabbi Greenberg as a platform to advocate for greater acceptance of LGBT Jews in Orthodox life. Jewish Queer Youth (JQY) also exists as a platform to connect with and advocate for LGBT rights within Jewish communities across the United States. Branches of Judaism=Orthodox Judaism Orthodox Judaism maintains the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriage amongst members of the same sex.Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, \\"Orthodox Response to Same- Sex Marriage,\\" NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004) http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/ou_resp_same_sex_marriage/ (visited January 20, 2008) The Orthodox Union in the United States supported a federal Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. In Australia, the Organisation of Rabbis Australasia (ORA) have made submissions and written public letters against legalising same-sex marriage. Despite the general consensus against same-sex marriage, there are some dissenters including Rabbi Steven Greenberg who argues new interpretation of the halacka that is more accepting of homosexual people is required. Rabbi Greenberg became the first Orthodox rabbi to officiate at a same-sex wedding that was legally recognized by the local government in November 2011. Reform Judaism Ed and Eddie under the huppah, (2008) An ad hoc committee of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) has declared same-sex relationships worthy of affirmation through Jewish ritual, but leaves it up to individual rabbis whether to officiate such rituals. In 1996 the CCAR passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, it made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages, stating, \\"However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as sexual preference and lifestyle‚Äîwe cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a 'marriage' within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of qiddushin (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.\\"\\"Question 18.3.8: Reform's Position Ib...Homosexualiy.\\"Soc. Culture. Jewish Newsgroups. Retrieved November 26, 2014 The CCAR supported the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage and opposed governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage, stating, \\"this is a matter of civil law and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.\\" In 1997 the General Assembly of the Union for Reform Judaism (formerly known as the Union of American Hebrew Congregations) passed a resolution supporting secular efforts to promote legislation which would provide through civil marriage equal opportunity for gay men and lesbians; encouraging its constituent congregations to honor monogamous domestic relationships formed by gay men or lesbians; and supporting the efforts of the CCAR \\"in its ongoing work as it studies the appropriateness of religious ceremonies for use in a celebration of commitment recognizing a monogamous domestic relationship between two Jewish gay men or two Jewish lesbians.\\"(adopted by the General Assembly 1997) (visited January 20, 2008). In 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on Human Sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention), which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \\"may be present in committed same-gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community.\\" The report called for the CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy teshuvah (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.CCARnet.org archived December 17, 2004, at the Wayback Machine. In March 2000 the CCAR issued a new resolution stating, \\"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same-gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\\" Also in 2000, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the Reform seminary, established the Institute for Judaism, Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity to \\"educate HUC-JIR students on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues to help them challenge and eliminate homophobia and heterosexism; and to learn tools to be able to transform the communities they encounter into ones that are inclusive and welcoming of LGBT Jews.\\" It is the first and only institute of its kind in the Jewish world.\\"Institute for Judaism and Sexual Orientation\\" In 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the bisexual and transgender communities, issuing a resolution titled, \\"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities\\".\\"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities\\" Also in 2003, Women of Reform Judaism issued a statement describing its support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the bisexual and transgender communities: \\"Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and Calls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130516091332/http://www.wrj.org/Advocacy/ResolutionsStatements/Resolutions2003/2003TransgenderandBisexualRights.aspx.

The issue was previously introduced in the Law Committee of Conservative Judaism in December 2006 which simultaneously prohibited same-sex marriage in Conservative Judaism and allowed Conservative Rabbis to perform same-sex commitment ceremonies. The ruling was reversed, however, in June 2012, the Committee of Jewish Law and Standards voted on the issue of same-sex marriage with thirteen for, zero against, and one abstention. The committee also established two different services that can be used as a guide for rabbis marrying a same-sex couple though neither applies the language or symbols associated with kiddushin (\\"holy union\\" in Hebrew and the legal term for marriage) as the term is gender-specific. Ben Sales, \\"Conservative rabbinic group issues guidelines for same-sex wedding rituals\\", JTA, June 4, 2012 Some synagogues within Conservative Judaism still reject recognition of same-sex unions as marriages, but permit celebration of commitment ceremonies, in part as an expression of their belief that scripture requires monogamy of all sexually active couples.Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Homosexuality, Human Dignity, & Halakhah: A Combined Responsum for the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (approved by a majority of the Committee on Dec. 6, 2006) at http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Dorff_Nevins_Reisner_Final.pdf (visited January 20, 2008) Reconstructionist Judaism As of 1992 with the Report of the Reconstructionist Commission on Homosexuality, the Reconstructionist Movement of Judaism has expressed its support for same-sex marriages as well as the inclusion of gay and lesbian people in all aspects of Jewish life. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation leaves the choice of whether or not to perform same-sex marriages to individual rabbis but the procedure is included in the Reconstructionist Rabbi's Manual and many choose to use the traditional language and symbols of kiddushin. Public opinion Among American religious groups in a 2013 Pew Research Center survey, Jews were the most in favor of allowing same-sex marriages, at 83% (+/‚àí 11%). A 2013 poll by Haaretz showed support among Israelis (including Arabs) for same-sex marriage at 59%, with secular and traditional Jews particularly supportive and Haredi Jews firmly opposed.

It was held on February 26 and 27, 2009 at Bahrain International Circuit at Sakhir, Bahrain, together with 2010 V8 Supercar Championship Series' Desert 400. It was the first of two rounds to be held at the circuit, the other being the 2009-10 Bahrain 2nd GP2 Asia round. The layout used for this Race will not be used for the following event, as it acts as a F1 Support race.  Report  Race 1 Despite Jules Bianchi starting on Pole, Davide Valsecchi clinched the GP2 Asia title with three rounds to spare by winning in the Bahrain feature race. The iSport driver lurked in third for most of the distance, before mounting another late surge which has become his characteristic this year, to overcome Arden's Javier Villa and Meritus' Luca Filippi and claim his third victory in five rounds. With Valsecchi's nearest rival and team-mate Oliver Turvey delayed in the pits and unable to score, the win gave Valsecchi an insurmountable points lead. Filippi and Villa burst from the second row into the lead at the start, while polesitter Jules Bianchi (ART) immediately fell out of contention for victory for a very poor start. Villa looked faster than Filippi in the opening laps, but with no way past on track, he dived in for an early stop. The extra speed on fresh tyres paid dividends for Villa, and by the time the pitstops were complete he was in the lead ahead of Filippi and Valsecchi. As has been the case throughout the championship, Valsecchi got quicker and quicker as the race progressed. An initial dive-bomb move on Filippi for second saw him skitter over the run-off at the Turn 10 hairpin, but he quickly regrouped and passed his countryman into Turn 1 with six laps to go. He then caught Villa in just one lap and took the lead with a straightforward outbraking move - only to then run wide at Turn 10 later in the lap and hand first place back again. It was only a brief respite for Villa though, as Valsecchi soon repassed him into the first corner and pulled away to secure victory. Villa lost more pace as his tyres faded, allowing Filippi to drive around the outside of him and take second. DPR's Giacomo Ricci came within 0.2 seconds of depriving Villa of third too as they diced on the final lap. Charles Pic took the second Arden car to fifth ahead of Coloni's returnee Alvaro Parente and Addax's Sergio P√©rez. Adrian Zaugg got quicker throughout the race on his return with Trident, charging past Turvey and Bianchi in the closing stages to claim eighth and pole for race two. Turvey had lost several places in his pitstop with a wheelgun problem while Bianchi never got up to speed after dropping down the order at the start. Race 2 In race 2 Charles Pic earned his first GP2 Asia/GP2 win by breaking away from the early chaos in the Bahrain Sprint race. The Frenchman overtook initial leader Adrian Zaugg and then escaped from his pursuers while they spent the next few laps tripping over each other. For much of the race it looked like Arden would score a one-two, with Pic's team-mate Javier Villa all over the back of second placed Giacomo Ricci. But the latter picked up his pace later on and charged away to secure DPR's third podium finish in the last two events. Having gained pole position on the partially reversed grid thanks to his eighth place yesterday, Zaugg (Trident) led into the first corners while Coloni's Alvaro Parente and Addax's Sergio P√©rez fought for second. The pair ended up banging wheels approaching Turn 4, leaving P√©rez with a broken wing and sending Parente spinning into the barriers as his apparently wounded car broke loose on the following downhill sweeps. There was more contact further down the pack, and newly crowned champion Davide Valsecchi (iSport) had to pit for a new wing, while race one podium finisher Luca Filippi (Meritus) spun down the order. Leader Zaugg did not have the pace to pull away and soon had Pic, Ricci, ART's fast-starting Jules Bianchi and Villa queuing up behind him. Pic dived ahead at the end of the backstraight on lap four, with Ricci then following him in the next corner. As Zaugg tried to fight back, Bianchi got alongside him as well, with all three cars wheel to wheel through the last turn, down the pitstraight and into the first complex - where it ended in tears as contact damaged Zaugg and Bianchi's cars. That settled the top three positions, Pic having pulled clear and Ricci eventually dropping Villa and securing second. Rapax's Daniel Zampieri had emerged from the mayhem in fourth, but was hunted down as the race progressed - Sam Bird (ART) and Edoardo Piscopo (DAMS) demoting him in the closing stages. Zampieri then handed the final point to iSport's Oliver Turvey when he ran wide while trying to fend off the Briton with two laps to go, and also dropped behind his charging Rapax team-mate Vladimir Arabadzhiev. Turvey's sixth place ensured that iSport wrapped up the teams' title alongside Valsecchi's drivers' crown. Among the other incidents in the race, Meritus driver Alexander Rossi received a ten place grid penalty for the next round after forcing Ocean's Fabio Leimer off the track. The American eventually broke his front wing on the back of Leimer's car and then slid into Coloni's Will Bratt, ending both their races early.

Two general types exist: one is a compact design using two or three speaker drivers, usually in car audio, and the other is a two-way high-power design for professional audio, also known as single-source or dual-concentric loudspeakers. Car audio A car audio speaker with a coaxial tweeter in front of the woofer Coaxial speakers in automobiles are 2- or 3-way loudspeakers in which the tweeter, or the tweeter and a mid-range driver, are mounted in front of the woofer, partially obscuring it. The advantage of this design is the ability to use a smaller area, hence their popularity in car audio. The low frequency sound waves from the woofer are not reduced too much by the drivers in their path. Without time-alignment correction, the sound from the tweeter may arrive slightly before the sound from the woofer; this misalignment is not generally addressed in automobile sound systems. This design was popularized in the 1970s with Electronic Industries, Inc. of South Holland, Illinois introducing the general concept in May 1973, and Jensen Loudspeakers introducing a retail model the next month. This was followed by designs from Sparkomatic, Clarion, Infinity and others. Professional audio The studio monitors over the window are a pair of UREI 813s, each of which has a 15-inch coaxial (below, with the blue rectangle), and a plain 15-inch driver (above). The high frequency component of the coax is a horn, which includes blue foam rubber to attenuate undesired anomalies. Coaxial loudspeakers in professional audio enable sound from two drivers to come from one source. This characteristic allows a wider field of listening to a synchronized summation of speaker drivers than loudspeaker enclosures containing physically separated drivers. As well, the pattern of response is symmetric around the axis of the loudspeaker. Since the 1943 introduction of the Altec Lansing Duplex 601 coaxial driver, recording studio monitors have often been coaxial loudspeaker designs. In 1945 the improved Altec 604Audioheritage. Altec Duplex was introduced, and it soon became the recording industry standard studio monitor in the U.S. First shown in 1947 in England, the Tannoy Dual Concentric design assumed the same role across Europe from the 1950s onward. The Altec 604 combined a woofer with a compression driver attached to a horn to carry the high frequencies. The Tannoy also used a 15-inch woofer and a compression driver for high frequencies, but differed in that the woofer itself served as the final horn flare for the high frequency driver. Thus, its output pattern was radially symmetric, not just mirror-image symmetric as in the Altec. Both designs placed the high frequency driver behind the low frequency driver, and both were not initially time aligned. The high frequencies arrived at the listener's ear slightly later than the low frequencies. One drawback of the design is the production line difficulty in mating the two drivers, and in replacing or reconing the woofer. Another drawback is that the low frequencies tend to modulate the high frequencies, causing greater intermodulation distortion. The Tannoy style of coaxial, with the woofer forming part of the high frequency horn, had greater intermodulation distortion. Designs similar to the Altec 604 have further problems with diffraction of the low frequencies around the central horn, and with rearward emanations from the horn body reflected forward by the woofer out of time with direct sound. All of the problems with sound waves tend to increase with sound pressure level, causing significant shifts in tone as the loudspeaker changes volume. In the late 1970s, Bill Putnam of Universal Audio worked with Ed Long and his patented Time Alignment crossover design to fix the long-standing problem of the two bandpasses not being aligned in time at their crossover point. The Altec 604 was given this elaborate new crossover feature and incorporated into the UREI 813 studio monitor, which also had a second woofer physically separate from the coaxial pair. This design dominated recording studios of the 1980s, and time alignment became a feature of competing manufacturers. In 1977, Bob Cavin of McCune Sound in San Francisco modified the Altec 604 for the McCune SM-4, a large proprietary stage wedge, using John Meyer's patented high-compliance compression driver diaphragm, a higher-power woofer, and processor-controlled bi-amplification with line-level all-pass time alignment. The McCune SM-4 was the first multi-angle stage monitor, and was used by many McCune clients such as the Playboy Jazz Festival and the Monterey Jazz Festival. In the 2000s, digital signal processing (DSP) was used by Fulcrum Acoustic to reduce some of the coaxial drawbacks such the diffraction of the woofer's upper range around the central horn, by filling in this \\"shadow\\" with low frequency sound from the compression driver, and by countering the out-of-time reflections bouncing off of the woofer. Coaxial loudspeakers have been used in concerts for on-stage foldback duties, giving musicians a more even sound field because of the single-source characteristic. As well, the enclosure may be made more compact. In the 1980s, Professional Audio Systems (PAS), using Time Alignment technology from Ed Long, sold the popular SW series of compact stage wedges, offered with a 12- or 15-inch woofer, and having a projecting high-frequency horn as in the 604. Other stage monitors using coaxial designs are made by Clair Brothers, L-Acoustics, Radian Audio Engineering, RCF, Beyma, dB Technologies, Fulcrum Acoustic, and Rat Sound in partnership with Eastern Acoustic Works. coax sound. David Gunness and Fulcrum Acoustics have designed coaxial loudspeakers beginning in 2009, notably collaborating with PreSonus in 2013 to create the self-powered line of Sceptre S6 and S8 coaxial studio monitors, and releasing Fulcrum's own FH15 full-range horn-loaded loudspeaker series in 2018. All of the coaxial Fulcrum designs use digital signal processing to reduce distortion modes. Fulcrum's patented process is called Temporal Equalization (TQ). Home audio Tannoy has produced coaxial loudspeakers, for the hi fidelity home consumer market since the early 1950s. Their \\"Dual Concentric\\" drivers early series included in order of introduction: Tannoy Blacks, Tannoy Reds, and Tannoy Golds. Jensen introduced several coaxial speakers in the 1950s including their highly regarded triaxial models. Several other manufacturers introduced coaxial speakers and drivers in the 1950s including University, however due to their higher cost most did not last in the consumer market. In 1988, KEF introduced an extension of the coaxial loudspeaker concept. Their Uni-Q driver is a coincident driver, where the two drivers share the same acoustic center and therefore are closer in time alignment. This was made possible by using the then newly affordable powerful yet small neodymium magnets for the tweeter making the whole tweeter assembly small enough, magnet included, to fit inside the woofer's voice coil. Other home audio speaker companies making coaxial speakers include TAD, Cabasse with their 4-way Concentric QC-55 Driver as seen in their flagship model - La Sph√®re, Hsu, Vandersteen, until recently Theil, and a budget speaker made a few years ago by Insignia.

The preliminary work for an electric tramway started in 1900. The concession for building this 12 kilometer long track was issued on February 9, 1906 and the tramway went into operation on February 9, 1908. The line was descending from Matulje at the elevation of 212 meters (650 feet) to the sea level on the coast. The luggage was transported in separate wagons.

In 2001, FITT began to accredit academic institutions and organizations already offering international business courses to offer FITTskills courses. There are currently over 43 educational partners in Canada, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Romania and the UK, offering FITTskills courses in a classroom setting. FITT's CITP designation was first offered in 1998, and the competency requirements were revised in 2006 and again in 2016. Since 2009, it has also been trademarked as the FIBP designation in the U.S. and Europe. FITT has also awarded honorary CITPFIBP designations to several notable figures in international trade, including former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister John Manley, Canadian Chamber of Commerce CEO Perrin Beatty, Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz, and former Canadian Minister of International Trade Stockwell Day.

Gould\\" Early life and education Gould was born in San Francisco, California, in 1948. She spent her junior year of high school as an exchange student in Southern France, the foundation of her interest in French culture and literature. She received a diploma from the Sorbonne in 1969, a B.A. degree in French from Occidental College in 1970, and a Ph.D. in Romance Languages from the University of Oregon in 1975. While her dissertation and early research focused on native French writers, she was among a small group in the 1970s who recognized the legitimacy, importance, and relevance of looking critically at the francophone periphery, literature produced in the French language outside France. Academic career Gould began her teaching career at Bucknell University in 1973. She also taught at Virginia Polytechnic University from 1980 to 1985, and Bowling Green State University from 1985 to 1996. She served as dean of the College of Arts and Letters at Old Dominion University from 1996 to 2001, dean of the McMicken College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Cincinnati from 2001 to 2007, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at California State University, Long Beach from 2007 to 2009. She was named the ninth president of Brooklyn College (a campus of the City University of New York) in June 2009. Gould has written or co-edited six books and over 50 articles on contemporary Quebec literature, francophone women writers, and the modern French novel. Beginning her scholarly work with a book on French novelist Claude Simon, she shifted her attention to Qu√©bec women writers in the 1980s. Using feminist theory, she explained difficult experimental texts in clear and accessible language. She has interpreted feminist poetry and prose in the context of Qu√©bec intellectual history. In journal articles and book chapters Gould has discussed such writers as Louky Bersianik, Marie-Claire Blais, Nicole Brossard, Madeleine Gagnon, Anne H√©bert, Suzanne Lamy, Monique LaRue, Madeleine Monette, France Th√©oret, √âlise Turcotte, and Ying Chen.\\"Karen Gould Receives Donner Medal,\\" Canadian Studies Update, Vol. 25, No. 1 (Spring 2006), pp. 9-10.

She contributed more than $100,000 to a number of African-American artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance, equal to more than $1 million in 2003. This was especially critical during the Great Depression, when foundation support declined. She helped young artists become established. Biography She was born Charlotte Louise Van der Veer Quick in Franklin Park, New Jersey on May 18, 1854U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925 to Peter Quick and Phoebe Van der Veer. She was brought up by her maternal grandfather, Schenck Van der Veer, whose last name she used in preference to Quick.Dartmouth College Yearbook, 1898, p. 46 She was educated privately, as was typical for wealthy girls. Van der Veer married Rufus Osgood Mason on April 27, 1886.\\"New York, New York, Marriage Index, 1866-1937\\" She came from a rich family and her wealth increased when she inherited the estate of her husband after his death. She used her wealth to become a literary and cultural patron, supporting such artists and writers as Alain Locke, Aaron Douglas, Langston Hughes, Arthur Fauset, and Miguel Covarrubias of the Harlem Renaissance.Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance, Taylor & Francis, Zora Neale Hurston was another emerging writer she supported, at the recommendation of Locke, after Hurston published some short stories. Hurston was also studying anthropology and, from 1928-1932, Mason supported the writer during her research into African-American folklore and culture in the Deep South, Haiti and Jamaica. She also supported her during Hurston's writing of a book on Cudjo Lewis, known then as the last survivor of the 1860 illegal Clotilda. For various reasons this was not published in 1931, when Hurston submitted it to a publisher. It was published posthumously in 2018 as Barracoon: The Story of the Last \\"Black Cargo\\". After learning about Cudjoe Lewis from Hurston's 1928 article about him, Mason also helped support the elderly man, who lived in Africatown, a neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. Mason has been criticized for trying to control the work of the writers she supported; she wanted to be called \\"Godmother\\", but she also developed strong relationships with some of the people she helped. She contributed a total of \\"more than $100,000 to African-American writers and artists during the Harlem Renaissance, the equivalent of more than $1,000,000 in 2003.\\". She is cited in \\"Zora and Langston: A Story of Friendship and Betrayal\\" by Yuval Taylor (2020). Black feminist scholar bell hooks writes critically of the relationship between Mason and Hurston: \\"It is difficult to believe that Hurston was blind to the cultural imperialism, the white supremacy of her sponsor, Mrs. Mason. This \\"world's most gallant woman\\" had compelled Hurston to sign a legal agreement which specified that all material she gathered would be the legal property of her patron and that Hurston could use such material only when granted permission\\".bell hooks, \\"Saving Black Folk Culture: Zora Neale Hurston as anthropologist and writer\\".

It is designed to simulate localized, high-intensity wind patterns such as downbursts and tornadoes that have never been studied before. The Wind Engineering, Energy and Environment Research Institute (WindEEE RI) was established in 2011. WindEEE is part of the new Advanced Manufacturing Park (AMP) where, together with other facilities (e.g. the Fraunhofer Project Centre and Western Accelerator Centre) will contribute to create an industry oriented research incubator at Western working with local, national and international partners. The WindEEE Institute already has an extensive national membership with more than 40 researchers from 18 universities across Canada. Internationally WindEEE collaborates with more than 30 Institutes across four continents. In October 2013, WindEEE RI organized its first \\"Wind Innovation Symposium\\" to which more than 100 participants from around the globe participated.  About  The areas of research at WindEEE target the three EEE's: wind Engineering, Energy and Environment. Main topics relate to: impact of non-synoptic wind systems (such as tornadoes and downbursts) on buildings and structures, optimization of wind farms and wind turbines, physical modelling of flow over rough surfaces, urban canopies, complex topography and forestry, outdoor and indoor air quality, and wind driven rain and snow. Also, ancillary research is conducted on risk analysis and models, power grid operations, policy, economics and decision making models. The Institute acts as an enabler of industry-academic partnership in wind-related research in which commercial funding is matched with academic research funds in order to multiply the initial investment. Collaborations focus on, but are not limited to insurance, wind and solar energy, electric transmission/distribution, and construction materials industries. WindEEE collaborates closely with other wind engineering facilities at Western, including the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL), which together provide a large palette and long history of expertise in wind research and applications. Building Features= WindEEE Dome  This is the facilities architectural cross-section of the top-view The Wind Engineering, Energy and Environment (WindEEE) Dome is the world's first hexagonal wind tunnel. Its large scale structure (25 meters diameter for the inner dome and 40 meters diameter for the outer return dome) will allow for wind simulations over extended areas and complex terrain. In a nutshell WindEEE will, for the first time, allow for the manipulation of inflow and boundary conditions to reproduce, at large scales and under controlled conditions, the dynamics of real wind systems. Mounted on the peripheral walls and at the top of the dome, an array of specialized fans will be activated using a sophisticated control strategy to provide time-varying and spatially-varying flow fields in the test section. By manipulating the outflow and direction of theses fans the facility will be capable of producing time-dependent, straight, sheared or swirl winds of variable directionality. Therefore, a large variety of wind fields such as boundary layers, portions of hurricanes, tornados, downbursts, low level currents or gust fronts will be physically simulated. Side view of the facilities architectural cross-section An active topographic capability will generate a wide diversity of surface topographies at unprecedented scales allowing wind simulations over areas of the order of 10 km2 . The same system will be used to locally seed for the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system that will measure the wind field over extended areas. A traverse mechanism will allow for a LASER head to traverse the flow in a multitude of vertical and horizontal sections in order to produce PIV wind field measurements with a full scale equivalent resolution of 10 meters. It is expected that for the first time laboratory tornado-like flows as large as 6 meter in diameter will simulate the equivalent of F3 Fujita Scale intensity winds. Large scale models of wind farms or portions of transmission lines will be tested under a wide range of wind conditions. The interference between wind turbines (wake and array effects) will be investigated and a full scale wind turbine blade can be traversed through the 25 m diameter dome and tested under realistic wind shear and wind turbulence conditions. The dispersion of pollutants, the effects of winds on forests and plant canopies will also be addressed. The hexagonal wind tunnel has 106 fans to simulate a tornado. The force created is so weak that a person can simply stand inside but still feel the effects of the wind. In the Media The facility appeared in Wild Weather with Richard Hammond where Richard Hammond tried to track the speed of a tornado near the ground.

In For the Glory, the player chooses from over 190 nations spanning the 1000 province globe to guide a single nation from 1399 to 1819, managing its economy, military, political alliances, scientific development, exploration and colonization, religious affairs, and internal stability. It features over 10,000 historically accurate events and rulers.For the Glory - PC Game Review, Armchair General Retrieved 2010-01-11. The game's reviews praised its immersive experience in the history of the period, its improved graphics, and its enhanced interfaces (when compared to its Europa Universalis II start point). However, multiplayer stability issues, laborious management, and irritating sound effects soured opinions.For the Glory Review, Gamespot Retrieved 2010-01-11. Gameplay alt=A preview image of For the Glory showing the map, interfaces, menus, units and Western Europe. For the Glory is in real time, which flows continuously during gameplay, rather than taking place in turns. The player is able to pause the game, speed up, or slow down time at her or his whim. Unlike most real-time strategy games, the focus is not on military management. Instead, as with other grand strategy titles, the player manages their chosen nation juggling the nation's economy, military, political alliances, scientific development, exploration and colonization, religious affairs, and internal stability. A major aspect of For the Glory is managing domestic policies. Every ten in-games years, and through events, the player can use sliders to determine domestic policies, which impact the game. Balancing the nation's budget and keeping a lid on inflation is another primary objective. Money is used for multiple things including funding the military, trade, and research. The player can invest funds in their country's stability as well, and stability affects just about every aspect of a nation's performance. Instability is usually the result of in-game actions, such as declaring war on a neighboring country without a casus belli, and it can also be influenced by events. Low stability means land and naval forces stand a greater chance of losing battles; the frequency of internal rebellions rises; diplomatic actions are less successful; and the founding and expansion of colonies are more likely to fail. Foreign policy and interaction with computer-controlled nations is another sizable facet in For the Glory. AI nations work to maintain the balance of power. If a player tries to conquer territory quickly, his or her international reputation will tarnish, AI nations are more likely to form alliances against the player.For the Glory Review , Gamer Daily News Retrieved 2010-01-11. Besides brute force there are other methods to nation-building. Through diplomacy, it's possible to vassalize or annex other countries. Aggressive actions still negatively impact country's' reputation, but less than taking territory by force. Also, a casus belli makes the war seem less threatening, reducing the impact on reputation. Casus belli can come through events or religious differences, but the player can also use diplomacy to create one. The player can influence their neighbors as well, with the effectiveness of diplomatic actions determined by the ruler's diplomacy skill. Battles take place in real time, but the player doesn't have significant control over them. Conflicts between armies are resolved and if the invader wins they besiege the province's garrison. Once the player starves out the garrison, the player controls the province. However, occupation does not equal ownership in For the Glory. Instead, the enemy must agree to cede the territory in a peace treaty, and the likelihood that they'll agree to terms is determined by how much territory the player controls and how well their units fared in battle. Development For the Glory was created by Crystal Empire Games, a development studio created in June 2008 after the announcement of the Europa Engine Licensing Program by Paradox Interactive. Many Crystal Empire Games team members were active in the Paradox Interactive community for years, contributing mods and tools dedicated to the company's games. As a result, For the Glory is predictably modification friendly. For the Glory features thousands of new events, both random and historical, the majority of which are country-specific. This is the result of years of intense research, design and post-playtest development from the collegial \\"AGCEEP\\" (Alternative Grand Campaign - Event Exchange Program) modification team from the Europa Universalis II fora. The interface, graphics, and tool tips were changed when compared to its Europa Universalis II starting point. The number of resolutions supported was increased as well.For the Glory Interview Page Two, Gaming Nexus Retrieved 2010-01-11. A number of new For the Glory features now impact performance in battle, including terrain and weather. These elements now also impact losses from attrition. Weather still affects naval attrition, but the player's fleets now automatically sail to the nearest friendly port when in danger of sinking. The AI now concentrates its forces, making combat against nonplayer nations more difficult. Reception For the Glory received mixed reviews. Reviewers highlighted its historical immersion, improved graphics and interfaces, and plethora of historical events as major draws for fans of the series.

Seringapatam was originally ordered as a 38-gun frigate, but the re-classification of British warships which took effect in February 1817 raised this rating to 46-gun.  Class and subclassess  The Admiralty ordered six further ships to this design ‚Äì including three ships which had originally been ordered as s, but the Seringapatam design was subsequently altered to produce a Modified version which was labelled the Druid sub-class, and three of the ships formerly ordered to the Seringapatam original design (Madagascar, Nemesis and Jason) were re-ordered to this modified design. Subsequently a further modification of the design was produced, which was labelled the Andromeda sub-class, and the remaining three of the ships formerly ordered to the Seringapatam original design (Manilla, Tigris and Statira) were re-ordered to this modified design.

These events could include dark matter, low energy solar neutrinos, double beta decay or rare radioactive decay. It works by simultaneously measuring both the light pulse and heat pulse generated by a particle interaction within its internal scintillator crystal. The device washttp://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?198809032 originally proposed by L. Gonzalez-Mestres and D. Perret-Gallix (LAPP, IN2P3/CNRS) In their http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/21/000/21000903.pdf rapporteur contribution to the Proceedings of the XXIV International Conference on High-Energy Physics, Munich, August 1988, Gonzalez-Mestres and Perret-Gallix wrote : Perhaps bolometry should in some cases be combined with other detection techniques (luminescence?) in order to produce a primary fast signal as timing strobe. If light is used as a complementary signature, particle identification can be achieved through the heat-light ratio, where nucleus recoil is expected to be less luminescent than ionizing particles. The success of such a development would open the way to unprecedented achievements in background rejection for rare event experiments. Further explanations, including a description of the detector and possible applications incorporating in particular BGO and tungstates, were given by these authors in other papers such as their contribution to the March 1989 Moriond Meeting (pages 16-18). The luminescent bolometer has since then been developed by scientists from several groups, including the CNRS Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale and University of Zaragoza collaboration in view of the proposed ROSEBUD particle detector experiment in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory. Rosebud uses a bismuth germanate (BiGeO, \\"BGO\\") detector crystal. The CRESST collaboration is currently using the same kind of device with CaWO4 crystals in an experiment to detect dark matter at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso.

History  In 1817, Uri and Lorenzo Beach, two brothers, settled in the area.J. A. Caldwell, Caldwell's Atlas of Madison County, Ohio, Condit, Ohio, 1875, Pg. 10. Previous to their arrival, agriculture was the only business in the area, but Uri Beach built a sawmill along the Big Darby Creek, and later added a carding machine. Spinning and weaving were also done at the factory. This factory provided all of the lumber for northern Madison County's earliest frame buildings. About 1826, Lorenzo opened a general store of his own,Bryan, Chester E., History of Madison County, Ohio, B.F. Bowen & Company, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana, 1915, Pg. 174. The West Canaan Post Office was established on January 16, 1829, and as of 1831, the community also contained a hotel and a blacksmith shop. A small community began to form around these businesses, so the Beach brothers purchased a tract of land and laid out the community of West Canaan on April 1, 1831, and the name was recorded at the London Courthouse on January 3, 1833. In November 1834, there was additional land added to the town's corporation limits, and the town and post office names were changed to Amity. In 1834, Lorenzo opened a second store in another part of town, and as of 1835, the town contained two dry good stores, a woolen factory, a sawmill, a distillery, a comb factory, and a number of blacksmith and minor mechanical trades shops. At this time, Amity was more of a trading point than Plain City. But a combination of the factory's dam being declared a nuisance and torn down and a trunk-line for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad being laid through Plain City in 1851 caused most of the business to be transferred to the latter. By 1875, Amity had one dry goods store, one wagon and blacksmith shop, one church, and one physician. There was a windmill manufacturing company based in Amity during the 1880s and 1890s.T. Lindsay Baker, A field guide to American windmills, University of Oklahoma Press, 1985, , Pg. 335 The Amity Post Office was discontinued on July 31, 1901, and the mail service sent through the Plain City branch, and as of 1915, the village contained only one store, and one blacksmith.  Demographics  As of 1875, the population was about 100, and only about 35 in 1915.

It was designated as the 127th Baluch Light Infantry in 1903 and became 3rd Battalion (Queen Mary's Own) 10th Baluch Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 10th Battalion of The Baloch Regiment.Ahmad, Lt Col RN. (2010). Battle Honours of the Baloch Regiment. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre. Early history In 1843, the British conquered Sindh after defeating the ruling confederacy of Baloch chieftains. General Sir Charles Napier, the British commander, was much impressed by the ferocious courage of his Balochi opponents and decided to recruit two irregular battalions of Bombay Army for local service within Sindh. The first of these was raised at Karachi as the Scinde Bellochee Corps or the Bellochee Battalion by Major F. Jackson in 1844. Its manpower was mostly drawn from Balochis, Sindhis and Pathans from Sindh. Later, it also recruited Brahuis and Punjabi Muslims, while the recruitment area was extended to include Baluchistan, North-West Frontier Province and the Punjab. On the raising of the 2nd Battalion in 1846, the regiment was designated as the 1st BeloochOld spelling of Baluch; now pronounced Baloch. Battalion.Maxwell, Lt Col WE. (1948). Capital Campaigners: The History of the 3rd Battalion (Queen Mary‚Äôs Own) the Baluch Regiment. Aldershot: Gale & Polden.Cadell, Sir Patrick. (1938). History of the Bombay Army. London: Longmans & Green. When the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, the 1st Belooch Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Farquhar was dispatched across the Sindh desert to join the Delhi Field Force. It was engaged in several actions during the siege and capture of Delhi. During the next two years, it fought in numerous engagements in Oudh and Rohilkhand, as the British systematically stamped out all resistance. The regiment was brought into line for its services in North India as the 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry or the 1st Belooch Regiment. In 1868, it took part in the long and arduous Expedition to Abyssinia. The splendid performance of 1st Belooch Regiment in Abyssinia was much appreciated and as a reward, it was converted into Light Infantry. In 1879-80, the 1st Beloochees participated in the Second Afghan War, followed by the Third Burmese War of 1885-87, where they earned the nickname of Capital Campaigners for their excellent performance. In 1897-99, the regiment was sent to British East Africa to quell an insurgency in areas now forming Uganda.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (1998). History of the Baloch Regiment 1820-1939. Abbottabad: Baloch Regimental Centre.330px 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, all former Bombay Army units had 100 added to their numbers. Consequently, the regiment's designation was changed to 127th Baluch Light Infantry. In 1906, the Princess of Wales (later Queen Mary) was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. The regimental full dress uniform in 1914 included a rifle green turban and kurta (knee length tunic) piped in red, worn with red trousers and white gaiters. The red trousers were a distinctive feature of all five Baluch infantry regiments then serving in the Indian Army.Barthorp, Michael; Jeffrey Burn (1979). Indian Infantry Regiments 1860‚Äì1914. p. 32. London: Osprey. On the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment served in German East Africa and Persia. In 1918, it raised the 2nd Battalion 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry, which served in the Palestine and took part in the Battle of Megiddo that led to the defeat of the Turkish Army in Palestine. The 2nd Battalion was disbanded in 1921. Subsequent History In 1922, the regiment was grouped with five other Baluch battalions: 1st & 2nd Battalions of 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry, 126th Baluchistan Infantry, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis and the 130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles), to form the 10th Baluch Regiment. The 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry was redesignated as the 3rd Battalion (Queen Mary's Own) 10th Baluch Regiment. During the Second World War, 3/10th Baluch served in Iran, Iraq, North Africa, Sicily, Italy and Greece. In 1946, it was selected for conversion into an airborne battalion, but the events of 1947 intervened and on the Partition of India, the battalion, along with the Baluch Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army.Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin.

He was heir to a financial empire as well as a convicted felon and originator of the Moody Gardens resort complex. Moody was also the grandson of insurance and financial tycoon William Lewis Moody Jr. Personal life Shearn Moody Jr., was born on May 23, 1933, to Shearn Moody Sr. and Frances Moody Newman in Galveston, Texas. His father died in 1936, while he was an infant. Moody was well known for eccentric behavior, such as building a slide from his bedroom window to a swimming pool, where he kept pet penguins, and wearing house slippers wherever he went. Moody, a homosexual, never married and spent the final years of his life involved in civil court cases. His longtime partner was a former Las Vegas dancer named Jimmy Stoker. Moody felt that the court system was corrupt and believed that his enemies used the legal system to try to steal his wealth and power; he claimed to have employed \\"several hundred\\" lawyers in various legal battles and even at one point hired nationally known lawyer Roy Cohn to help in his ongoing litigation problems. Moody died at home in 1996, after suffering from years of chronic high blood pressure and kidney disease. Business and legal dealings His grandfather, William L. Moody Jr., made a fortune by founding the American National Insurance Company, and the younger Moody hoped to follow in his grandfather's footsteps by establishing the Alabama-based Empire Life Insurance Company. This dream was short lived, however, as in 1972 his own company ousted him after the federal government began investigating his business dealings. The investigation would eventually lead to his conviction of bankruptcy fraud. In 1987 Moody was convicted by a federal court of mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with attempts to defraud his family's Moody Foundation. Moody had long served on the board of the charitable foundation, helping to direct millions of dollars in grants to just causes. However the Internal Revenue Service accused him making millions of dollars of grants to himself, and therefore owing more than $14 million in taxes and penalties. After a trial that included accusations of witchcraft, Moody singing a risque song he had commissioned about the legal profession, and threats to \\"blow the legs off\\" former Watergate attorney Douglas Caddy, a federal appellate court overturned the convictions. In 1987, Moody was featured on the cover of Texas Monthly magazine and proclaimed \\"the sleaziest man in Texas\\" and in November 1989, after an investigation spanning more than a decade, he was convicted of bankruptcy fraud in connection with the now defunct Empire Life Insurance Company. Although sentenced to five years in federal prison, Moody served little time and was released on parole in May 1991. Legacy In his later years, Moody devoted much of his time to his work on the board of directors of Moody Gardens. He was quoted in the Houston Chronicle as saying, \\"I originally conceived the project of the gardens because we wanted to use the gardens to give this community another source of income\\" See also *American National Insurance Company *Moody Foundation *Moody Gardens NotesExternal links *Moody National Bank *The Moody Foundation *Moody Mansion Historic Home *William Lewis Moody Jr. at Handbook of Texas Online *Mary Elizabeth Moody Northen at Handbook of Texas Online Category:1933 births Category:1996 deaths Category:American financiers Category:American bankers Category:American philanthropists Category:People from Galveston, Texas Category:American fraudsters Category:American money launderers Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Wealth in the United States Category:American people convicted of fraud Category:American businesspeople convicted of crimes Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Shearn Moody Jr."},{"id":"24528784","text":"Damaging Consent was the second full album from The Micronauts, released in 2007.

The cars were released in New York and in other locations in the United States. Each auto was a part of testing of pistons, piston rings, and other engine parts manufactured by McQuay Norris. The bodies of the aluminum eggs were mounted on standard chassis of cars of different brands. They were driven in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, in different climates and highway conditions. The aluminum eggs featured a streamlined design which reduced air resistance. Streamlining was effective in enabling the installation of fifteen instruments used in testing. These included a blow-by meter, which measured the gas which escaped to the auto's crankcase, having passed by the pistons and piston rings. Another instrument employed was an exhaust gas analyzer.

Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. All are categorized as the Psi Pok√©mon. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, known as the strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. Able to remember everything since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam is also one of the handful of Pok√©mon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes its appearance undergo a few noticeable changes. In the Pok√©mon anime, Abra and Kadabra appear under the ownership of Sabrina. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon Alakazam plays a large supporting role in the plot of the game. All three appear in the Pok√©mon Adventures manga in various roles. IGN described Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam as \\"losing most of its charm\\" as it progressed. Calling Abra cute, they describe Kadabra as having \\"a bit of that personality\\", and Alakazam as being a \\"distinctly grim, foreboding character\\". Design and characteristics Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam were three of several different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Originally called \\"Casey\\", \\"Yungerer\\", and \\"Foodin\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Abra and Kadabra were initially intended to be named Hocus and Pocus (which were also the original names in the Pok√©mon Red and Green Beta Version) for American audiences, but were instead changed to Abra and Kadabra, based on the famous incantation along with Alakazam. Alakazam's Japanese name Foodin was inspired by a rough translation of Harry Houdini's last name. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pok√©mon characterized by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They look like they are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld- like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side and one in the back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead. Abra uses various extrasensory powers, even when sleeping. With the ability to read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pok√©mon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected. Appearances=In video games The first video game appearance of Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam was in Pok√©mon Red and Blue versions. When encountered in the wild, Abra will always use Teleport to attempt to escape the battle on the first turn. Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Abra and Kadabra later appear in every subsequent sequel. In Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, before the Elite Four are defeated for the first time, an Abra appears as an NPC at the Indigo Plateau area, which will teleport the player character back to New Bark Town. This NPC appears again in their remakes, but does not perform this function. In the main game series, many trainers use Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam in their teams. Notable trainers include Saffron City Gym Leader Sabrina; Blue, the player's rival in Pok√©mon Red and Blue and their remakes; Silver, the player's rival in Pok√©mon Gold and Silver and their remakes; Salon Maiden Anabel from the Hoenn Battle Frontier; and Sinnoh Elite Four member Lucian. Outside of the main series, Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam appeared in Pok√©mon Pinball, the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games, and the Pok√©mon Ranger games, while Abra and Alakazam appeared in Pok√©mon Puzzle League and Abra appeared in Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, Pok√©Park 2: Wonders Beyond. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon, Alakazam plays a large supporting role in the plot as the leader of a Gold Rank rescue team along with Tyranitar and Charizard. Abra appears as a Pok√© Ball Pok√©mon in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, using Teleport to warp itself and fighters off the stage, potentially KO'ing them. In anime In the Pok√©mon anime, the Saffron City Gym Leader, Sabrina owns an Abra, which she sends out in a battle against the series protagonist, Ash. After battling, Sabrina's Abra evolves into Kadabra, causing Ash to forfeit the match due to Kadabra's new and more powerful psychic abilities. Ash later returns for a rematch, and Ash's Haunter makes Sabrina laugh, which causes Kadabra to also laugh due to the psychic bond it has with Sabrina. Because of Kadabra and Sabrina's laughter, they are unable to fight, and hand over the gym badge. Abra later appears in the series under the ownership of Mira, who offers to teleport everyone to Hearthome city using her Abra, but instead teleports them to a flooded city to find a Pok√© Ball containing a Sandshrew that was lost in the newly flooded lake. One of Abra and Kadabra's other appearances is living in an abandoned mining colony with several other Psychic-type Pok√©mon. Alakazam's first appearance was as a giant Alakazam awakened near the site of the Pok√©mopolis ruins. Alakazam has also been owned by many notable trainers, such as Luana, the Gym Leader of Kumquat Island, Eusine, Anabel, and Kenny. In printed adaptations In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Abra makes a cameo as the stolen Pok√©mon of the Pok√©mon Fan Club President. Later when Red frees the Pok√©mon kidnapped by Lt. Surge; instead of his beloved Abra, the President of the Pok√©mon Fan Club finds himself with a not-so-cute Alakazam. Like her anime counterpart, Sabrina also owns a Kadabra. After Red's aptitude test to be the Gym Leader of Viridian City, a swarm of wild Pok√©mon suddenly appear outside the Gym after being attracted by Pok√©mon March music, one of which is an Alakazam. Blue captures all of them with his Scizor. Alakazam is seen again as part of Blue's team for the Gym Leader faceoff, and again as one of the Pok√©mon in Viridian Gym. It defeated Yellow's Pikachu easily using a combination of Role Play and ThunderPunch. Green is seen to have an Abra, using its Teleport move to transport Silver away to a safer location. Cultural impact=Critical reception IGN described Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam as \\"losing most of its charm\\" as it progressed. Calling Abra \\"cute\\", they described Kadabra as having \\"a bit of that personality\\", and Alakazam as being a \\"distinctly grim, foreboding character\\". At the same time, they cited them as one of the \\"most versatile\\" groups of characters in the franchise. IGN also listed Alakazam, and to a lesser extent Kadabra, as one of the \\"best Psychic types\\", alongside Mew, Mewtwo, and Starmie. They commented that Alakazam was good for \\"down-to- Earth\\" players who don't want to use legendaries like Mew or Mewtwo. They further described Alakazam as \\"arguably the single most popular non-legendary Psychic type in any of the current games\\" and as a \\"brilliant yet brittle brainiac\\". Boys' Life named Abra one of the five \\"coolest\\" Pok√©mon from Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen at fourth. The St. Petersburg Times also praised the characters, describing their names as \\"clever\\". IGN called Abra \\"unimpressive\\", but \\"worth raising\\" because it evolves into the \\"more powerful\\" Kadabra. GameSpy further commented that Kadabra makes up for the \\"shortcomings\\" of Abra. 1UP FM praised the characters' design, as the hosts noted them as some of their \\"favorite\\" Pok√©mon in the series and that they were \\"impressed\\" with their appearance. GamesRadar editor Henry Gilbert praised Kadabra and Alakazam's mustaches, listing them on their list of \\"The 10 greatest mustaches in gaming history\\". GamesRadar editor Brett Elston labelled Abra's moveset \\"lame\\", while acknowledging its potential to evolve into more powerful Pok√©mon. However, he claimed that Alakazam was \\"useful\\" only in \\"limited\\" circumstances. Elston also called Alakazam one of the \\"most disturbing\\" Pok√©mon of all time for the game's assertion that its brain cells \\"continually multiply\\" until it dies a horrible death. In a poll conducted by IGN, Kadabra was voted as the 91st best Pok√©mon, where it was called \\"much cooler\\" than Alakazam because \\"He doesn't need to show off by bending two spoons\\". Alakazam was voted as the 20th best Pok√©mon, where the staff commented on the evolution line, stating they \\"not only loved the clever naming system but the creatures' designs and abilities as well\\". They further stated that \\"Abra has always been a bit of a pain to raise and evolve, but the end result, an Alakazam, is well worth it in my book.\\" Controversy Some fundamentalist Christian groups have targeted Kadabra as representing anti- Christian aspects of the franchise. In Palm Beach, Florida, Pastor Eugene Walton distributed pamphlets that described the symbol on its head as \\"a pentagram\\" (even though Kadabra simply has a red five-pointed star on its head, different than a pentagram) and claimed the symbol on its chest was representative of Nazi Germany's Waffen-SS. In the book It's a Dark World, Roger Boehm argued that due to its psychic-status and the symbols on its body of the latter, Kadabra represented the occult, further arguing that the etymology of its name tied directly to them. In November 2000, it was reported that Uri Geller, an Israeli \\"psychic\\"-magician who claims to bend spoons with his mind, sued Nintendo over the Pok√©mon Kadabra, due to its Japanese name (Yungera) which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity. Geller learned of the similarity after fans of both himself and Pok√©mon noted a resemblance to the character's Japanese name, behavior and face, and presented him with cards of the character to autograph after he had finished taping a television special in Japan. He further claimed that the star on Kadabra's forehead, and the lightning patterns on its abdomen, were symbols popular with the Waffen-SS and that, through the character, Nintendo had \\"turned him into an evil, occult Pok√©mon character\\". Nintendo countered by stating there was no connection between the two and that they had not named any of the Pok√©mon after actual people to the knowledge of their staff. In 2008, Pok√©mon anime director and storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka confirmed in an interview that Kadabra would not be used on a Pok√©mon Trading Card until an agreement was reached on the case.

The Somport railway tunnel, which carried the Pau‚ÄìCanfranc railway under the Pyrenees into France, is located at one end of the station. The station, which was opened during July 1928, was constructed on a grand scale to serve as a major hub for cross-border railway traffic. Its main building incorporates elaborate Beaux- Arts architecture, featuring 365 windows and 156 doors, along a length of . The station experienced numerous highs and lows, services having been temporarily interrupted by the intentional sealing of the Somport tunnel during the Spanish Civil War, while being extensively used by international traffic during the Second World War as the ‚ÄòCasablanca in the Pyrenees‚Äô. The postwar era brought a period of stability and prosperity for the station and the line, although officials became increasingly pessimistic for its future during the 1960s. International services came to an abrupt end during 1970 following a train derailment that damaged a key bridge in France. Canfranc station has remained open despite the international line's curtailment in 1970, but only being served by a handful of trains from the Spanish side alone. It has experienced a major decline and neglect, resulting in much of the site becoming derelict. The local government has ambitions to reopen the international line and to redevelop the station, which shall involve the renovation of the existing station building for use as a hotel and its replacement by a new facility. During February 2020, funding for both the relaunch of international services and the station's rehabilitation was made available by the European Union.  History =Origins During the nineteenth century, two major border crossings were established between France and Spain. However, even prior to the start of the twentieth century, it was recognised that there was consistently insufficient capacity to accommodate demand for cross-border traffic, and that a third border crossing was required. At one point, the cost of constructing such a crossing had been reportedly estimated at 3.2 million pesetas (roughly equivalent of ‚Ç¨20,000 at the time), in addition to in excess of 1.2 million pesatas for supporting infrastructure such as access points, docks and other facilities. According to railway historian Alfonso Marco, Spanish officials found it desirable for such a railway to be provisioned with a grand station that would demonstrate the nation's engineering prowess, thus when such a project got underway, it was decided to build such a facility at the village of Canfranc, situated in a relatively undeveloped valley. The practicality of building a grandiose station was the decision for the French and Spanish railway operators to share the facility, rather than having their own individual stations, which meant that Canfranc would serve as a prominent hub for the route, greatly shaping its design and scale. On 12 July 1912, construction work commenced on the Somport railway tunnel from the French side; it would be completed in 1915, the work having been delayed by the outbreak of First World War. Construction of the station itself would not begin until 1923, headed by the Spanish project engineer Ram√≠rez de Dampierre. It was formally opened on 18 July 1928, in the presence of King Alfonso XIII of Spain and the president of the French Republic Gaston Doumergue. Operational years Roughly three years following its grand opening, Canfranc International railway station suffered a major fire; having started in the lobby, the blaze propagated throughout the adjacent areas, causing an estimated 500,000 pesetas in damages overall. After this event, numerous officials lost their optimism in the value of the station. During the Spanish Civil War, Nationalist leader Francisco Franco ordered the sealing of the tunnels on the Spanish side, allegedly to prevent arms smuggling. However, as a consequence of the Franco-Spanish international convention under which it was built, the station itself remained open. During the Second World War, the station and the surrounding area acquired a reputation as the ‚ÄòCasablanca in the Pyrenees‚Äô due to it serving as a key crossing point for goods, as well as being the epicentre of espionage for Nazi and Spanish authorities. Spain had formed an operational agreement with the Wehrmacht, which saw freight trains carrying mined tungsten northwards while French grain, as well as trans-shipped Swiss gold, was borne southwards. Passenger services also continued during the conflict, which provided an escape route into Spain for both Jews and Allied soldiers alike. Aware of these movements, Nazi agents frequently sought to intervene against passengers of interest. Following the end of the war, railway traffic promptly returned to normality. The relative stability experienced during the 1950s and 1960s brought about a period of prosperity, but this soon proved to be rather short- lived. In the 1960s, the future of both the station and the Pau-Canfranc railway became increasingly threatened, and was chronically underfunded, leading to frequent incidents that eventually raised safety concerns. The station is often said to have been used in the filming of Doctor Zhivago (1965), but although the film was shot largely in Spain, there is no evidence that Canfranc was a location. The station's principal purpose of operation came to an abrupt halt on 20 March 1970. A train derailment on the Pau- Canfranc railway line had demolished the L'Estanguet bridge on the French side of the Pyr√©n√©es Mountains. Under financial pressure from French national railway company SNCF, the French government decided not to rebuild the bridge, which effectively forced the closure of the cross-border line. Despite this, the station remained open, served only by a handful of Spanish trains. As a consequence of the through route's abrupt termination, the population of the village fell sharply over the following years.  Present  Abandoned side of the Canfranc international railway station in 1994 Spanish train services to Zaragoza from Canfranc Since the closure of the through route, much of the station and its facilities have been neglected and have become inoperative. Large portions of the site have become overgrown, but the majority of the buildings have remained largely intact and can be entered. The main building has been re-roofed, but is otherwise in a state of disrepair, and thus is fenced off and remains closed to the general public outside of guided tours during July and August. Between 2013 and 2017, approximately 120,000 people, mostly Spaniards, toured the station, a greater number than had used the station when it was in service. During the 2010s, the railway station, using its more modest facilities, has been open for the twice daily passenger trains to and from Zaragoza-Delicias railway station, plus the occasional freight train to the grain silo. During 2007, the station was declared to be a Site of Cultural Interest. The government of Aragon has long held various ambitions for the rehabilitation of the station. Plans have been mooted to redevelop the main station building into a hotel, which would involve the construction of a new station beside it to replace it. There have been explorations of options to reopen the through line as the \\"western trans-Pyrenean line\\"; this initiative shall reportedly involve the assistance of the government of Aquitaine, the adjacent French region. In February 2020, it was announced that funding from the European Union had been made available for the purpose of reopening the through line and relaunching international services. Description Canfranc International railway station was often referred to around the time of its opening as the \\"Titanic of the Mountains\\", in part due to its large size, being the second largest station in Europe at the time of its completion. Architecturally, it was deliberately designed with prominent symbolism, the exterior features an eclectic Beaux-Arts style that was reportedly inspired by French palatial architecture, while the interior was adorned with elements drawn from classical Roman architecture. Large quantities of glass, cement and iron are present throughout the structure, which is adorned with 365 individual windows. The station's platforms have a length of . Extensive infrastructure is present to service and transfer transiting passengers, baggage and freight between Spanish and French trains, because the French rail standard gauge of was incompatible with the Spanish gauge of at the time and hence prevented through-traffic. This gauge complication transformed a routine customs-control exercise into a lengthy logistics exercise. The site includes a large locomotive depot, two sheds for the transshipment of freight between French and Spanish trains, various other outbuildings and a resultant extensive layout of tracks. There are also an array of underground passages running across the site, many of which remain accessible. Part of the station was considered to be French territory; a school was established in the village for the children of its French staff.

Biography Duggie Fields grew up in the English countryside. He first came to notice in 1958, when he was 14, in the Summer Exhibition at the Bladon Gallery, Hurstbourne Tarrant, while he was attending the nearby Andover Grammar School. Fields briefly studied architecture at Regent Street Polytechnic before studying at the Chelsea School of Art for four years starting in 1964. He left with a scholarship that took him on his first visit to the United States, in 1968. As a student, Fields' work progressed through minimal, conceptual and constructivist phases to a more hard-edged post-Pop figuration. His main influences were at that time Jackson Pollock, Mondrian and comic books, with a special regard to those worked on by Stan Lee. In 1968, after his US visit, Fields went to live in Earl's Court Square and shared a flat with Syd Barrett, who had just left Pink Floyd. Fields still lives in the same flat and he works in Barrett's former room, using it as his atelier. By the middle of the 1970s his work included many elements that were later defined as Post-modernist. In one painting Marilyn Monroe is shown with her head severed. In 1983 Fields was invited to Tokyo by the Shiseido Corporation, where a gallery was created to show his paintings. For the occasion the artist and his work were simultaneously featured in a television, magazine, billboard and subway advertising campaign throughout Japan. In 2002, he designed posters for Transport for London. In 2013 he was taken to Los Angeles by artist and benefactor Amanda Eliasch with fashion designer Pam Hogg for Opfashart, which Eliasch had put together for \\"Britweek\\". From 2013 to 2015, Fields worked for the preservation of Earls Court Exhibition Centre designed by architect Howard Crane and the surrounding area. The campaign was not successful but made people aware of the general decline of architecture in the London area. In 2016 Fields was celebrated by the British Film Institute FLARE with a collection of his videos.

The charges against Israel were dismissed by the prosecutor, Homer Stille Cummings, who later became Attorney General of the United States. The case, which gained national attention, became the basis for a 1947 film by Elia Kazan, Boomerang!. The Israel prosecution was praised in the Wickersham Commission report on law enforcement in the United States, which criticized police interrogation methods. Harold Israel confessed to the murder, but later recanted. Israel, a vagrant and former serviceman, was charged with the murder of Father Hubert Dahme, a popular Catholic priest, at the intersection of High and Main Street in downtown Bridgeport on the evening of Feb. 4, 1924. Twelve thousand people attended the funeral. Newspapers pressed authorities to find the killer, and police conducted an intense search for the perpetrator. Eight days later, Israel, who had been arrested in Norwalk, Connecticut on a gun-possession charge, was accused of the murder. He was described as a \\"transient indigent, and a person of low mentality of the moron type.\\" Homer Cummings, the prosecutor, said the evidence was so strong that \\"upon its face, at least, seemed well nigh a perfect case.\\" Israel met the general physical description of the gunman, was in the vicinity at the time of the shooting, and was in possession of the gun that the police believe had been used in the crime, a black .32 caliber revolver. The police case included identifications by seven eyewitnesses, and Israel confessed to the crime, though he later recanted and protested his innocence. Prosecutor Homer Stille Cummings discredited his own police department's case against Israel. At arraignment on May 27, 1924, Cummings dropped the case, entered a plea of nolle prosequi, and proceeded to discredit the evidence compiled by the Bridgeport police in a 90-minute presentation to the court. Cummings rebutted the circumstantial case against Israel, who was serving a 90-day jail term for possession of the .32 caliber revolver, and said that the confession was coerced from a person of diminished mental capacity. Three physicians had found that Israel was exhausted and overwhelmed, and Israel said he would have confessed to anything just to get some sleep. Cummings called expert witnesses who undermined the ballistics evidence. Cummings told the court that \\"it is just as important for a state's attorney to use the great powers of his office to protect the innocent as it is to convict the guilty.\\" Cummings' decision to drop the case surprised and outraged Bridgeport police, and Cummings received criticism from the Democratic Party, where he was a national committeeman. However, despite being snubbed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he was chosen by Roosevelt as his first Attorney General. The case was never solved. In 1954, a Bridgeport resident admitted to witnessing the killing, said that he was threatened with death if he spoke about it, and said that Israel was not the killer. Israel later married and had \\"a house, a Ford, a wife, and a child.\\" In Boomerang!, which was largely filmed in Stamford, Connecticut, the character based on Israel was played by Arthur Kennedy.

Using this method, page designers do not work on finished pages, but rather on various layout templates and pieces of content, which can then be combined to create a number of finished pages. In cases where the same content is being used in multiple layouts, the same layout is being used for several different sets of content, or both, dynamic page publishing can offer significant advantages of efficiency over a traditional system of page-by-page design. This technology is often leveraged in web-to-print solutions for corporate intranets to enable customization and ordering of printed materials, advertising automation workflows inside of advertising agencies, catalog generation solutions for retailers and variable digital print on demand solutions for highly personalized one to one marketing. The output from these solutions is often printed by a digital printing press. Dynamic publishing is often considered to be a subset of automated publishing that enables generation of long documents, such as manuals or books from a content repository. Dynamic publishing is often used to build high value documents, such as ads, collateral, brochures, catalogs, direct mail, eBooks and other documents on demand or in variable data printing workflows.

Founded in 1989, Seabury is the only independent school in the South Puget Sound marketed towards intellectually advanced children. Seabury is a member of the Pacific Northwest Association of Independent Schools (PNAIS)PNAIS and the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges (NASC).Seabury School Children from Tacoma, Federal Way, Kent, Auburn, Gig Harbor, Puyallup, the Puget Sound region and even further come to Seabury for its personalized approach to education. They put emphasis on the development of creative and analytical thinking skills. Seabury serves students from pre- kindergarten through eighth grades on two campuses: pre-k to fifth in Northeast Tacoma (Browns Point), and six to eighth in downtown Tacoma. History The school began when two principals, one in private education and the other retired from public school administration, met and were reflecting on their careers. Barbara Field and Lee Woodworth Fisher were concerned with the lack of appropriate educational placement for very bright, highly exceptional students. At that time, funds for these students were not generally available in the public schools under the assumption these students could \\"fend for themselves.\\" In 1988, Field and Fisher met with educators from private gifted schools to learn about the structure, curriculum, and Washington state's legal requirements for private schools. The two founders then met with psychologists, educators from the University of Washington and other public and private programs, in addition to state officials from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. By late fall, it was decided that the school would open with grades kindergarten through second and with plans for inclusion through grade six. After accumulating used furniture, materials and books, Field and Fisher rented a commercially zoned building on 51st Street NE near Commencement Bay in Northeast Tacoma. The school's name reflected the location's scenic environment and Field's past connections with Episcopal schools. The incorporation of the non-profit organization was certified in November 1988. Barbara Field was named as the registered agent. Lee Woodworth Fisher, Lyle Starkey, and Don Field were named incorporators. Evergreen Bank, a teachers' bank in Seattle, provided a $10,000 loan to support the opening of the school, and The Medina Foundation and private donors supplied funds for the school‚Äôs initial operation. In September 1989, Seabury School opened with eighteen students, two teachers and parent volunteer aides. Mrs. Field donated her first year of teaching and administration. Wenda Collins was the upper primary grade teacher. Fisher started the school library with used books and 20 years of National Geographic magazines. The founding Board of Directors included Fisher, financial and legal professionals Ed Opstad (board president) and Scott Jablon, educators Manvel Schauffler and Mary Helen Robinson, and child psychologist Richard Borton. By September 1990, Seabury had 38 students, a director, three teachers, three aides, a set of bylaws and an ever-expanding set of policies. In 1992, the school was accepted as a candidate member of the Pacific Northwest Association of Independent Schools. In the fall of 1993, enrollment had expanded so Seabury offered a full academic program of classes for students in preschool through grade six, including French language instruction. In 2009, Seabury continued fulfilling its vision of establishing academic schools for students by opening a middle school for gifted students in grades 6-8 within the heart of downtown Tacoma. Seabury buses its students between the sites.Fisher, Lee. \\"History of Seabury.\\" Dec. 10, 2009Field, Barbara. \\"Seabury History.\\" Nov. 17, 2010 Lower School Seabury's Lower School is located in its original location in Northeast Tacoma, and houses pre-kindergarten through fifth grades.

InterSystems is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company's revenue was $727 million in 2019.  History  InterSystems was founded in 1978 by Phillip T. (Terry) Ragon, its current CEO. The firm was one of the original vendors of M-technology (aka MUMPS) systems, with a product called ISM. Over the years, it acquired several other MUMPS implementations: DTM from Data Tree (1993); DSM from Digital (1995); and MSM from Micronetics (1998); making InterSystems the dominant M technology vendor. The firm eventually started combining features from these products into one they called OpenM, then consolidated the technologies into a product, Cach√©, in 1997. At that time they stopped new development for all of their legacy M-based products (although the company stills supports existing customers). They launched Ensemble, an integration platform, in 2003 and HealthShare, a scalable health informatics platform, in 2006. In 2007, InterSystems purchased TrakHealth, an Australian vendor of TrakCare, a modular healthcare information system based on InterSystems technology. In May 2011, the firm launched Globals as a free database based on the multi-dimensional array storage technology used in Cach√©. In September 2011, InterSystems purchased Siemens Health Services (SHS) France from its parent company, Siemens. In September 2017, InterSystems announced InterSystems IRIS Data Platform, which, the company said, combines database management capabilities together with interoperability and analytics, as well as technologies such as sharding for performance.

Customers  The largest customer for InterSystems is Epic, a leading health records vendor. Like InterSystems, Epic is privately held. \\"Both are rooted in an older programming language called MUMPS, developed at Mass General Hospital in the 1960s. Their founders coded the first products, and turned down outside investors, preferring to maintain control,\\" said Zina Moukheiber in a Forbes profile in 2013. Other large customers include the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; Partners HealthCare; Cleveland Clinic; the National Health Services of England, Scotland and Wales; the European Space Agency and Credit Suisse.  Microsoft dispute  On August 14, 2008, the Boston Globe reported that InterSystems was filing a lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation, another tenant in its Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, seeking to prevent Microsoft from expanding in the building. InterSystems also filed a lawsuit against building owner Equity Office Partners, a subsidiary of the Blackstone Group, \\"contending that it conspired with Microsoft to lease space that InterSystems had rights to, and sought to drive up rents in the process\\". In 2010, CEO Terry Ragon led a coalition in Cambridge called Save Our Skyline to protest a city zoning change that would have allowed more signs on top of commercial buildings, partly in response to Microsoft's desire to put a sign on top of their shared building. Both disputes were eventually settled, and Microsoft and InterSystems agreed to both put low signs only in front of the building at street level.

Eucalyptus citriodora (also known as Corymbia citriodora) was planted along the entrance. Eucalyptus dumosa, part of the mallee collection. Eucalyptus oleosa, also part of the mallee collection. The Australian Inland Botanic Gardens (AIBG; previously: Sunraysia Oasis Botanical Gardens) is a botanical garden in the Australian state of New South Wales located within The Mallee and the Sunraysia regions. It is located on River Road in Wentworth Shire's Mourquong northwest of Buronga. The regional city of Mildura, Victoria is located nearby, across the Mildura/Buronga George Chaffey Bridge. AIBG is the Southern Hemisphere's first semi-arid botanical gardens. Its specialization in arid-adapted species is unique among New South Wales and Victoria botanic gardens. History Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) are credited with the idea to form the gardens and the inaugural meeting of the Garden's Steering Committee met in 1983. Five years later, the land, previously used as a sheep grazing property, was acquired as a donation to the community. The volunteer group, Friends of the Australian Inland Botanic Gardens, was also developed in 1988. In 1989, AIBG was established. John Wrigley, inaugural Director of the Australian National Botanic Gardens, drew up the master plan. The first planting occurred in 1991. AIBG patrons, Lady Stephen and Sir Ninian Stephen, the former Governor-General of Australia, participated by planting Eucalyptus citriodora along the entrance drive. The first planting also included the garden's first floral display area of Australian salt-tolerant flora. In the same year, Garnpang, a historic, pine log sheep station homestead, was acquired by the Mildura Historical Society and subsequently dismantled for transport to AIBG. Much of it was rebuilt at the Gardens. It is used in a variety of ways, including as a temporary visitors' centre, classroom space and as a social centre. Garnpang's surrounding path is made of locally mined gypsum. In 1992, full-time employees were hired. A pump was placed on the Murray River to permit an early irrigation system installation. This allowed for the salt tolerant area planting, and the formally designed Rose Garden establishment, its first rows planted by Victoria's Governor, Richard McGarvie and his wife. The following year, planting began on other sections including the American and European sections. At the same time, the Historical Society transferred Garnpang's ownership to AIBG. Maps and plans were published in the book, Garnpang, in 1993, by the Friends of Sunraysia Oasis Botanical Gardens, and the Mildura and District Historical Society. The irrigation system was completed in 1995, and planting began on other sections, including the dry land Australian, New Zealand, Asian, and African sections. The Gardens' windmill was donated by a Gol Gol settler. The Garden's train was purchased from Mourquong's Orange World. Area The initial development occurred on of which roughly half was apportioned to the Dryland Gardens and the other half to Irrigated Gardens. AIBG is now a botanic garden. It includes: * River frontage reserved for future development as a natural recreation area and boat mooring () * Clifftop, reserved for future development for facilities * Mallee sandhill fenced area () * Nature trail Collections AIBG has over 20,000 planting and approximately 50% of the plants are labelled. It features not only Australian native plants, but also those from New Zealand, African, European, Asian, North and South American floras. The garden includes preserved, mature mallee, including Eucalyptus dumosa, Eucalyptus oleosa, Eucalyptus socialis, Eucalyptus gracilis, and Eucalyptus viridis, some of which may be as much as 2500 years old. The rose garden has 1624 colour co-ordinated rose bushes. Salt-tolerant local flora and exotic plants separated into geographical zones are also part of the collections. There is also a rockery. Operations An independent garden, it is operated by a committee of management. Its operations rely on donations and \\"in kind\\" services. The gardens are tended by paid staff and the Friends of AIBG. It is a member of the Council of Heads of Australian Botanic Gardens, and Botanic Gardens Conservation International. It is the lead partner of the Barkindji Biosphere Reserve. Water, under pressure and on demand, comes from Murray River. A flag, monitored by NSW Department of Agriculture, indicates underground water level. A rabbit- and kangaroo-proof fence surrounds the gardens. Weeds are left undisturbed to protect from soil erosion. Mulch is provided through local wineries and from a saw mill. Blue- topped pegs are found in a grid pattern on the ground to identify locations. Open daily, admission is free of charge. There is no indoor exhibition space and no plants are offered for sale. Plans are underway for an interpretation centre in conjunction with the biosphere. Education The Bush Chapel, which acknowledges the ideas of one of the CSIRO scientists, doubles as classroom space for visiting students. Sunraysia Institute of TAFE students perform practical work assignment at the gardens as part of their education. There are plans by La Trobe University to use the facility for research projects. A Green Corps environmental leadership training program, hosted and accredited by Greening Australia, was established at AIBG in 2008. On the first Sunday of each month, a tractor/train tour is available for visitors. At least 38 different bird species have been identified at the gardens by the Bird Observers Club.

The donkey walk () is a Russian Orthodox Palm Sunday ritual re-enactment of Jesus Christ's entry into Jerusalem. The best known historical donkey walk was practised in Moscow from 1558 until 1693. The Metropolitan and later Patriarch of Moscow, representing Jesus Christ, rode on a donkey, while the Tsar of Russia humbly led the donkey on foot. From 1561 to 1655 the donkey walk began in the Kremlin and terminated at Trinity Cathedral (now Saint Basil's Cathedral), but in 1656 Patriarch Nikon reversed the order of procession. The donkey walk and the Great Blessing of Waters on Epiphany were the two most important Muscovite court ceremonies, emphasizing the tsar's respect for the Orthodox Church,Bushkovitch, p. 21 projecting an image (not necessarily true) of harmony in politics.Muir, p. 253 Similar rituals in other cities existed until 1678 until Moscow monopolized the ritual. The tradition was abolished by Peter I. Donkey walks have been occasionally recreated in the 2000s. Contemporary accounts In the first half of the 16th century the ritual, of either WesternMuir, p. 252 or Byzantine origin, emerged in Novgorod, where key roles were played by the Archbishop of Novgorod and namestniks. It was imported to Moscow by Metropolitan Makarius. The first attested donkey walk attended by Makarius and Ivan the Terrible took place in 1558, when Trinity Cathedral was under construction. After the completion of Trinity Cathedral in 1561 the processions terminated at its western sanctuary dedicated to the Entry into Jerusalem; the cathedral itself became known as Jerusalem (the current popular name of Saint Basil's Cathedral emerged only in the 18th century). Western visitors left descriptions of the procession as it existed before the Time of Troubles: Mikhail Kudryavtsev noted that all cross processions of the period began, as described by Petreius, from the Dormition Cathedral, passed through St. Frol's (Saviour's) Gate and ended at Trinity Cathedral, popularly known simply as Jerusalem.Kudryavtsev, p. 85 For these processions the Kremlin itself became an open-air temple, properly oriented from its \\"narthex\\" (Cathedral Square) in the west, through the \\"royal doors\\" (Saviour's Gate), to \\"sanctuary\\" (Trinity Cathedral) in the east. The ritual was mocked and abused by Ivan the Terrible in his 1570 campaign against the Novgorod clergy. After looting the churches of Novgorod, Ivan demoted the archbishop of Novgorod and ordered him, a tonsured monk, to mount a mare backwards, ride to Moscow in a skomorokh's garb, marry there and lead a life of a skomorokh until the end of his days.Madariaga, pp. 246-247 Nikon's reform The Donkey Walk. Dutch print, 17th century. Patriarch Nikon, among his other reforms, reversed the order of the donkey walk; since 1656 it began at Lobnoye Mesto (allegory of Golgotha) and terminated in the Kremlin (the new allegory of Jerusalem). Nikon's voluntary retirement in 1658 vacated the Patriarch's seat de facto but not de jure; Metropolitan Pitirim of Krutitsy acted for the Patriarch during the 1659 donkey walk, causing Nikon's instant, unforgiving response. Nikon, still the head of Russian Orthodox Church, banished Pitirim from his seat and bitterly reprimanded Alexis I of Russia as an accomplice in \\"promiscuity of spirit\\". He wrote that for him riding the donkey was a fearful act of being a living icon of Christ himself, a deed and burden that only the Head of Church may bear. Pitirim repeated his act in 1661 and 1662 and was anathemized by NikonUspensky, chapter 2.1 although the retired patriarch's rage had little effect in real politics and Pitirim remained at the helm of the church. According to a description by Adam Olearius, who attended the 1636 procession,Gardner and Moosan, p. 326 the direction of the donkey walk has already been changed by that time. Olearius left an account of the procession starting at Lobnoye Mesto (incorrectly called Execution Place but in reality only a platform for public announcements) and proceeding into the Saviour's Gate of the Kremlin. The procession was led by a wagon carrying \\"a beautiful tree whose branches are hung with apples and various other treats\\" and six boys singing Hosanna.Gardner and Moosan, p. 327 Similar processions, without the tree, were also held on the day of enthronement of the Patriarch in Moscow and ordination of the bishops in other cities,Uspensky, chapter 2.1 but in 1678 donkey walks outside of Moscow were prohibited by the Synod. Demise of the tradition Feeble-bodied tsar Feodor III of Russia, the eldest surviving son of Alexis, was too weak to attend the ceremonies of 1676 and 1677.Bushkovitch, p. 112 By 1678 he recovered and participated in that year's donkey walk along with Patriarch Joachim; later, he seems to have attended most of the ceremonies of his short reign until failing to take part in the donkey walk of 1681.Bushkovitch, p. 118 After Fyodor's death the throne passed to co-rulers, brothers Ivan and Peter. In 1683 Ivan was sick and Peter led the donkey aloneBushkovitch, p. 140 but in the next few years Ivan and Peter participated in the ritual together. As Ivan's health declined, Peter became the sole leader of the procession. After the death of his mother (January 25, 1694) he cancelled the procession;Bushkovitch, p. 181 in fact, 1694 became the last year of Muscovite court ritual as it existed under the first Romanovs. Peter, who forced the church into submission to the state, needed no external shows of political harmony and formally abolished the ritual in 1697; instead, it was replaced with a mock drunk orgy of Peter's statesmen and minstrels. Modern Russia The ritual was resurrected in the 2000s in Rostov, with key roles being played by the Archbishop of Rostov and Yaroslavl and the governor of Yaroslavl Oblast. Saint Petersburg officially debuted the tradition on Palm Sunday 2014https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2ky5xJ6oqw with the civil and Orthodox leaders of the city in the leading roles.

There are two isomers of the molecule, with (E)- and (Z)-configurations. The molecule contains a benzofuran element associated with a benzylidene linked in position 2. In aurone, a chalcone-like group is closed into a 5-membered ring instead of the 6-membered ring more typical of flavonoids. Aurone derivatives Skeletal structure of an (Z)-aurone with numbering scheme used for nomenclature of derivatives Aurone forms the core for a family of derivatives which are known collectively as aurones. Aurones are plant flavonoids that provide yellow color to the flowers of some popular ornamental plants, such as snapdragon and cosmos. Aurones including 4'-chloro-2-hydroxyaurone (C15H11O3Cl) and 4'-chloroaurone (C15H9O2Cl) can also be found in the brown alga Spatoglossum variabile. Most aurones are in a (Z)-configuration, which is the more stable configuration according to Austin Model 1 computation, but there are also some in the (E)-configurations such as (E)-3'-O-Œ≤-d-glucopyranosyl-4,5,6,4'-tetrahydroxy-7,2'-dimethoxyaurone, found in Gomphrena agrestis. Biosynthesis Aurones are biosynthesized starting from coumaryl-CoA. Aureusidin synthase catalyzes the creation of aurones from chalcones through hydroxylation and oxidative cyclization. Applications Some aurone derivatives possess antifungal properties and analogy with flavonoids suggests that aurones could have other biological properties.

Biography Douglas MacKillop was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Manchester University. He served in the army during World War I. Diplomatic career After the war he joined the Diplomatic Service and served in Sofia, Helsinki, Athens, Brussels, Moscow, Hankow, Riga and Berne as well as in the Foreign Office. In 1937, when he was temporarily in charge of the Moscow embassy, he made \\"one of the most thoughtful attempts to explain\\" Stalin's Great Purge: he argued that in all advanced states there was a growing tension between the principles of individualism and community. While governments felt impelled to pay lip-service to the notion of popular sovereignty and individual freedom, they also recognised that promoting economic welfare and national power required them to make the life of the common man more planned, managed and regulated. Although the Soviet regime took this process to an extreme by using terror as an instrument for regulating the population‚Äôs behaviour, MacKillop argued that the growth of state power to achieve economic goals was a phenomenon across Europe. The move towards totalitarian government in the Soviet Union reflected deep social and economic tensions that were influencing political development across the globe. In 1942, while he was in Berne, MacKillop worked to facilitate the emigration of a large group of Hungarian Jewish children to Palestine. As head of the Refugee Department in the Foreign Office in January 1946, he wrote that the exodus of Polish Jewry arose ‚Äòpartly for racial and economic reasons, understandable since the new Poland does not offer them thc same opportunities as the old, and there is a spontaneous general wish on the part of European Jewry to go to Palestine. ... Though it is magnified and artificially fostered by Zionist propaganda, it is a real aspiration.‚Äô Despite this Foreign Office understanding, however, the British government continued to resist Jewish migration to Palestine. MacKillop's final posting was as Consul-General at Munich. He left the Diplomatic Service in 1952 and was for a time employed in NATO International Secretariat.

The song became the third number-one single for the singer in the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart after \\"Ahora Te Puedes Marchar\\" in 1987 and \\"La Incondicional\\", the preceding single.

Song history Released as the third single from Luis Miguel's studio album Busca Una Mujer, \\"Fr√≠a Como el Viento\\" became a very successful song and was included on the track list for his 20 A√±os Tour in 1990. Five years later, during his live performances in the National Auditorium in M√©xico City, the song was performed in a medley along \\"Yo Que No Vivo Sin T√≠\\", \\"Culpable O No\\", \\"M√°s All√° de Todo\\", \\"Entr√©gate\\", \\"Tengo Todo Excepto a T√≠\\", and \\"La Incondicional\\".

There were rumors about the re-recording of this song as a duet with Mexican singer Paulina Rubio or Chilean performer Myriam Hern√°ndez. However, this recording never took place since was announced that Miguel's following album at the time, C√≥mplices (2008), would be his first full-length album written and produced by Spanish singer-songwriter Manuel Alejandro.

Sargassum muticum, commonly known as Japanese wireweed, is a large brown seaweed of the genus Sargassum. It is an invasive seaweed with high growth rate (up to 10 cm per day during spring). It has an efficient dispersion thanks to its floats. Description Sargassum muticum is a brown seaweed, normally brown to yellowish with a length up to 10 m. It is an autotroph that uses energy from sunlight. The photosynthesis is facilitated thanks to aerial vesicles which allows the algae to raise to the surface. Sargassum muticum is composed of two distinct parts: a perennial part, which contains the holdfast and one or more short main axes; and an annual part: the secondary axes, which develop on the main axis, whose growth is unlimited and the size is variable. There are three types of ramifications: laterals with foliaceous expansions called fronds, laterals with fronds and aerocysts and laterals with fronds, aerocysts and reproductive organs called receptacles. In winter, only the perennial part persists (5 cm). In summer, the lateral part is in maximum development of 2‚Äì3 meters to 10 meters. Reproduction The mode of reproduction is both sexual and asexual. S. muticum reaches sexual maturity in the summer when gamete production takes place in receptacles. The species is monoecious, i.e. an individual is capable of producing male and female gametes. Its cycle of development is monogenic (i.e. only one generation is present during its life cycle). At the level of fertilization: male gametes are dispersed in seawater while female gametes remain in the receptacle where fertilization takes place). Development is also done at the receptacle and then once at the stage of seedling, the latter is detached for fixation on a new support and form a new individual. This species can also reproduce asexually, but this has never been observed in temperate environments. Habitat Sargassum muticum grows from half-tide to infralittoral areas (to a depth of 10 m.Thomas D. N. (2002). Seaweeds. The Natural History Museum, London.). It is fixed on solid substrates like rocks, stones, shells. It is highly tolerant towards temperature and salinity variations. The optimal temperature is between 17 and 20 ¬∞C but it tolerates -9 and 30 ¬∞C. Repartion areas, invasiveness, impacts=Repartition areas Originally from Japan, it is thought to have gained worldwide distribution through being transported with Japanese oysters (Crassostrea gigas). Sargassum muticum was introduced to the Californian coast in the 1940s and in Europe in the 1970s (The species was first found in the British Isles in the Isle of Wight in 1973). Currently, the alga is widespreaded from Norway to Portugal along Atlantic's coasts. Sargassum muticum has a range stretching from Campbell river, British Columbia to Baja in California.Abbott I. A. & Hollenberg G. J. (1976). Marine Algae of California. Stanford University Press, California. In Europe it extends along the coasts of Great Britain, France, Scandinavia, Baltic Sea, Helgoland, Netherlands, Ireland, the Iberian Peninsula and into the Mediterranean from Italy and the Adriatic. It is recorded from Japan, China and Alaska. Recently, some specimens were found on Moroccan coasts. It illustrates its huge tolerance regarding to its environments. Herbarium specimens are now stored in the Ulster Museum (BEL catalogue numbers: F11241 - F11242; F11182 - F11185). Invasiveness and impacts Its proliferation is important especially during the summer, which causes economical and ecological problems. Ecological: Because of its large size and dense ramifications, S.muticum forms a screen within the water column preventing the penetration of light. It also captures the nutrients in disfavor of other species such as phytoplankton. However, S.muticum also serves as shelter and protection for fish larva or crustaceans as well as laying support for cuttlefish. Economical: S.muticum fixes itself to the shells of oysters creating problems in shellfish farming through increased manual work to eliminate the algae. In addition, it can wrap around the farming structures, requiring additional maintenance. It also gets entangled with the propellers of the boats. Options for removal Mechanical removal‚Äîhowever this promotes dissemination of the species and the technique is labor-intensive. Chemical‚Äîthe use of herbicides is advised against, because it poses a major risk to the environment and others organisms. Biological‚Äîthere are few natural predators, one example is a little copepod that will eat only the unhealthy and damaged parts of S. muticum. Currently the distribution is stabilized, and only mechanical removal is performed. Uses There are some potential uses for Sargassum muticum. In agriculture, algae are used as sources of nitrate and potash for fertilization. It is also used in aquaculture as feed for juvenile sea cucumbers. Water treatment: the cell walls of S. muticum contains alginates and fucoidans. The association of both molecules forms a bigger molecule and this one can be a flocculant. This process can be a method to catch organic matter present in sewage. This flocculant, rich in proteins and oligoelements, is easily biodegradable and could be used for fertilizer. Previous studies have shown that Sargassum muticum is able to carry out the biosorption of heavy metals like cadmium, chlorophenolic compounds, and nickel. Antifouling: Secondary metabolites produced by marine algae could be an interesting alternative antifouling agent. Previous studies have shown the potential of hydrocarbon and fatty acid compounds in antifouling activities, compounds such as galactolipids and palmatic acid, 1-tetradecene or 1-hexadecene. Moreover, the peak production of antifouling compounds is during the spring. Antioxidant compounds: Sargassum muticum is rich in antioxidant compounds such as phenolic compounds (cathechins, phlorotannins, quercetins), pigments (fucoxanthin) and vitamins(vitamin C, K, E in the forme of alpha-tocoph√©rol and gamma- tocopherol). Applications are possible in pharmaceutics, cosmetics and health fields thanks to the antioxidant activities of these molecules.

In 1878, Samuel Langley, Henry Draper, and other American scientists needed a highly sensitive instrument that could be used to measure minute temperature changes in heat emitted from the Sun's corona during the July 29 solar eclipse, due to occur along the Rocky Mountains. To satisfy those needs Edison devised a microtasimeter employing a carbon button. Description of operation The value of the instrument lies in its ability to detect small variations of temperature. This is accomplished indirectly. The change of temperature causes expansion or contraction of a rod of vulcanite, which changes the resistance of an electric circuit by varying the pressure it exerts upon a carbon-button included in the circuit. During the total eclipse of the sun in 1878, it successfully demonstrated the existence of heat in the corona. It is also of service in ascertaining the relative expansion of substances due to a rise of temperature. The functional parts are represented in the partial cross section, which shows its construction and mode of operation. The substance whose expansion is to be measured is shown at A. It is firmly clamped at B, its lower end fitting into a slot in the metal plate, M, which rests upon the carbon-button. The latter is in an electric circuit, which includes also a delicate galvanometer. Any variation in the length of the rod changes the pressure upon the carbon, and alters the resistance of the circuit. This causes a deflection of the galvanometer- needle‚Äîa movement in one direction denoting expansion of A, while an opposite motion signifies contraction. To avoid any deflection which might arise from change in strength of battery, the tasimeter is inserted in an arm of a Wheatstone bridge. In order to ascertain the exact amount of expansion in decimals of an inch, the screw S, seen in front of the dial, is turned until the deflection previously caused by the change of temperature is reproduced. The screw works a second screw, causing the rod to ascend or descend, and the exact distance through which the rod moves is indicated by the needle, N, on the dial. The instrument can also be advantageously used to measure changes in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this case the strip of vulcanite is replaced by one of gelatine, which changes its volume by absorbing moisture. Other uses 1878 was a time when great advances were being made in electric arc lighting, and during the solar eclipse expedition, which Edison accompanied, the men discussed the practicality of subdividing the intense arc lights so that electricity could be used for lighting in the same fashion as with small, individual gas burners. The basic problem seemed to be to keep the burner, or bulb, from being consumed by preventing it from overheating. Edison thought he would be able to solve this by fashioning a microtasimeter-like device to control the current. He boldly announced that he would invent a safe, mild, and inexpensive electric light that would replace the gaslight. Abandonment Edison declined to patent the device, saying it was only of interest to scientists, and allowed companies in London and Philadelphia to manufacture tasimeters royalty-free. The scientists who tested it found it too erratic to be of use for quantitative measurement purposes, and it was soon abandoned.

It is born in the eastern Shibar Pass (which connects the provinces of Parwan and Bamyan, or watersheds of the Ghorband and Kunduz River) and passes in an eastbound direction which it maintains throughout most of its course. It runs along the south and the imposing central range of the Hindu Kush, receiving meltwater in the Shibar Pass area of Salang. It flows from this in a long valley between the high range of the Hindu Kush (north) and Koh-i-Baba in the south. It then converges with the Panjchir, on its right bank, 10 kilometers east of Charikar. It flows through the districts of Sheikh Ali, Chinwari, Ghorband and Surkh Parsa. The Ghorband receives many tributaries from both left and right, all fed mainly by snowmelt in spring and summer. Its main tributary is the Turkman but the Salang River converges on the left bank, and its valley is an important access route to the pass and towards the northern half of the country.

It is located on Highway 671, approximately west of Highway 43 and northwest of Grande Prairie. Established as a post office in April 1919, after the residents petitioned for postal service, the name Goodfair was chosen, being descriptive of the area, the name was changed to the current spelling since there was already a Goodfair post office in Saskatchewan. John Third was the first postmaster. The area was originally known as Kempton. The community of Goodfare is a vibrant farming community, as well as home to entrepreneurs, tree planters and artists. The community centre - Goodfare Hall - is a popular venue for wedding receptions, Christmas parties, baby and bridal showers, and other community activities. A ball diamond is found behind the Hall, and a small outdoor skating rink next to it. The rink is iced yearly by a community volunteer, depending on weather. There is also a small changing room for families to lace up skates and put on hockey equipment. Every Thursday night in the summer you will find locals playing Horseshoes behind the hall. Across the highway, is the former Goodfare store and Goodfare postal boxes. The former store is now closed and under renovations by a German couple, who bought the run down property in 2007. The store was more useful to Goodfare residents when getting to the nearest town (Beaverlodge) was more difficult in the old days, but now the new paved highway makes it more accessible. Goodfare originally ran a one-room school near the hall. Currently, families in Goodfare send their children to elementary school (grade 1-6) in Beaverlodge. For junior high and senior high, students go to Hythe and Beaverlodge respectively. Residents of this rural area refer to themselves as \\"Goodfarians\\" with a grain of humour.

M. H. a. M. A. (1983). William S. Dix. In W. A. Weigand (Ed.), Leaders in American Academic Librarianship: 1925-1975 (pp. 50-71) Chicago: American Library Association. His contributions to the field of librarianship, however, are varied and notable, making him worthy of recognition in the American Libraries 100 most important figures.Dewey, M. (1999). 100 of the MOST IMPORTANT LEADERS WE HAD in the 20TH CENTURY.(library leaders). American Libraries, 30(11), 38. American Libraries, 30(11)  Education and early career  Dix received his bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia in 1931 and his M.A. in English from that same university a year later. He began his career at the Darlington School for Boys in Georgia, where he taught English for seven years. He taught at several other schools, eventually landing at Harvard University, where he taught for a year while finishing his doctorate in American literature at the University of Chicago.Tuttle, H. W. (Ed.) (1993) World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services (Vols. 3). American Library Association. In 1947, Dix became an English instructor at the Rice Institute (which is now Rice University) in Houston, Texas. A year later, he accepted the additional responsibilities of directing the school's library. By the time he left Rice in 1953 to head the library at Princeton University, Dix was an associate professor of English and librarian. Some of Dix‚Äôs most notable contributions to the field of librarianship were during his 22 years at Princeton, culminating in his service as president of the ALA from 1969-1970.  McCarthy era  Dix was a staunch advocate for intellectual freedom and stoutly opposed censorship. These beliefs were especially pertinent during the early Cold War years when Senator Joseph McCarthy was exploiting the fear of communism and calling for censorship of communist propaganda from American libraries and from libraries across the world.  IFC  From 1951 to 1953, Dix was chairman of the Intellectual Freedom Committee (IFC), a committee within the American Library Association (ALA) whose purpose was, and continues to be, to protect the rights of people who use libraries. While he was chairman, there was a debate among professionals in the field of librarianship about whether to censor materials that were deemed to promote communism, or that were anything but anti-communism. A sizeable number or people, led by Ralph Ulveling, felt that materials that were anything but anti-communism should be labeled, so that people were aware of their contents. Others felt that the labeling of materials was, in a way, censoring them. The IFC, with Dix as chairman, agreed with the latter group and decided that library users should have a choice as to what they read. Library collections should offer a variety of perspectives (whether they are pro or anti-communism) and allow patrons to decide what they thought about it.  The Freedom to Read  Shortly after this decision, to assuage the fears librarians across the country still felt, Dix and IFC Executive Secretary Paul Bixler began planning a conference to formulate a statement that later became known as The Freedom to Read. This statement, of which Dix was the principal author, was adopted by the ALA and the American Book Publishers Council (now known as the Association of American Publishers) on June 25, 1953, and unequivocally states that ‚Äúthe ordinary individual, by exercising critical judgment, will select the good and reject the bad. We trust Americans to recognize propaganda and misinformation, and to make their own decisions about what they read and believe.‚ÄùPublishers, A. L. A. a. t. A. o. A. (2004). Freedom to Read Statement. In K. H. a. B. E. Sheldon (Ed.), The Portable MLIS: Insights from the Experts (pp. 225-228). Westport: Libraries Unlimited. This statement was subsequently endorsed by twenty-one other organizations, including the Freedom to Read Foundation and the National Coalition Against Censorship.  International work  As a direct result of his work with the IFC, Dix‚Äôs next career move was as a member of the United States Commission to UNESCO in 1955. In the following years, Dix became one of the better traveled librarians from the United States. He also chaired the ALA‚Äôs International Relations Committee from 1955-1960.  Centralized Cataloging  Dix's commitment to the Association of Research Libraries included terms as executive secretary (1957‚Äì1959) and president (1962‚Äì1963). Dix was chairman of the Association of Research Libraries' Shared Cataloging Committee. He was instrumental in shaping the Library of Congress' international program of centralized cataloguing and testified before congressional committees in 1965 and 1967 on the need for centralized cataloguing as opposed to the then- current system in which each library catalogued new books using its own sometimes idiosyncratic system.Princeton University Library Mudd Manuscript Library. http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=AC236&kw;=  President of the ALA  During Dix‚Äôs time as president of the ALA, there was a lot of controversy on the direction that the ALA should take. According to Raber, people wanted more member participation and they wanted the ALA to take stands on social issues (particularly against the Vietnam War).Raber, D. (2007). ACONDA and ANACONDA: social change, social responsibility, and librarianship.(Activities Committee on New Directions, Ad Hoc Activities Committee on New Directions ). Library Trends, 55(3), 675(623) paper in pdf From these requests came the resolution establishing the Activities Committee on New Directions for the ALA (ACONDA), which was passed on June 25, 1969, with the support of Dix. This committee, whose members consist of ALA leadership and general members, studies issues and recommends changes for the direction of the new ALA. The final report of ACONDA, finished in 1970, resulted in a chaotic debate. Ultimately, ACONDA resulted in relatively minor changes within the ALA structure, and by 1972 it was back to business as usual. But this was a time in which the ALA was challenged; it was somewhat tumultuous and chaotic, and Dix presided over it all.  Legacy  During his twenty-two years at Princeton, William Shepherd Dix wrote the bulk of The Freedom to Read Statement, attended numerous international conferences and was president of the ALA while publishing numerous articles and books. His hard work resulted in his recognition as one of the top 100 most important figures in librarianship. He was honored by the American Library Association with the Dewey Medal (1969), the Lippincott Award (1971) and Honorary Membership (1978).American Library Association.

Born in Kurdistan, she moved to Holland as a refugee with her family in 1997. She rose to prominence in 2005 through her television show, \\"B√™ Kontrol\\", which was the first of its kind in the Kurdistan Region to explore pop culture and related aspects of contemporary Western culture candidly. Many people in the Kurdistan Region, particularly the youth, consider Dashni to have broken down cultural and traditional barriers for young women. In 2009, Dashni began her musical career with the release of her first album, \\"Hela Hopa\\", which although successful was also controversial. Her provocative dance moves in the music video led media outlets to refer to her as the \\"Shakira of Kurdistan\\". Although many of the younger generation appreciated her music and music videos, the more conservative side of society saw them as inappropriate. Morad released two further albums, \\"Hom Shika Wawa\\" and \\"Frishtay Mihreban\\", and a series of singles, before taking time off from her musical career in 2014 to pursue her humanitarian and environmentalist projects. She founded \\"Green Kids\\" in 2012, which is a charity focused on underprivileged children, in particular refugee children, as well as the environment. Morad has been actively working to try and improve conditions at the refugee camps in the Kurdistan Region, and through campaigns has managed to donate significant money and aid. She is also a prominent campaigner for women‚Äôs rights and is seen as an inspirational feminist figure to many young women in the Kurdistan Region She was one of the first Kurdish female artists to appear as a pop singer and dancer and opened the gate for other Kurdish girl to become successful singers just like her.  Early life  Morad was born on 1 January 1986 in the city of Sulaimaniyah in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to Kurdish parents. Following the Kurdish uprising against the Ba‚Äôath regime in 1991, 1,400,000 Kurds fled the Kurdistan Region in fear of reprisals from Saddam Hussein. Morad, then aged 5, was forced to flee to the Iranian border with her family, until it was safe to return home. In 1997, aged 11, she moved to the city of Arnhem in the Netherlands as a refugee with her family. Whilst there, she attended St. Paulus school for two years, until she moved to the nearby town of Didam in 1999. There she attended Liemers College, where she acquired a HAVO diploma. She started modeling when she was 16 and also took up street dance. She also used to play football as a teenager, until her parents forced her to leave because of cultural reasons.  Career = 2005-07: Rise to prominence  Having always wanted to work in television, in 2005, aged 19, Morad auditioned for her own show at a nearby Kurdish television station, where her concept was accepted. The show, \\"B√™ Kontrol\\", was the first of its kind in the Kurdistan Region to explore Western culture candidly. Many people in the Kurdistan Region, particularly the youth, consider Morad to have broken down cultural and traditional barriers for young women. The show aired for two years on Kurdistan TV, a major Iraqi Kurdish television network, and Morad soon became a household name in the Kurdistan Region.  2008-11: Music and controversy  Morad had always dreamt of becoming a singer and in 2008 she met a producer, Halkawt Zahir, whom she would eventually make three albums with. In 2009, she began her music career with the release of her first album, \\"Hela Hupa\\", which although successful was also controversial. The style of the album was considered as folk music with pop beats. Her provocative dance moves in the \\"Hela Hupa\\" music video led media outlets to refer to her as the \\"Shakira of Kurdistan\\". Although many of the younger generation appreciated her music and music videos, the more conservative side of society saw them as inappropriate. A number of Imams preached against her at mosques and certain more conservative television channels boycotted her music videos. At one point, she also received death threats. Morad persisted to make music with intentionally open Western themes. In 2010, she released her second album, \\"Shika Wawa\\", which was boycotted by much of the television and media industry in the Kurdistan Region. However, the first single released from the album, \\"Hom Shika Wawa\\", was more successful abroad, receiving significant airtime on the Arab world‚Äôs leading music channel, Rotana. Fadi Haddad, the renowned Lebanese director, directed the music video for \\"Hom Shika Wawa\\". It was the first time that an Iraqi Kurdish artist had a music video aired on a major international music channel. Also in 2010, Morad presented \\"The Dashni Show\\", which was a talk show that openly discussed female issues such as romantic relationships, which is a subject that remains taboo in Kurdish society. In 2011, she released her third album, \\"Frishtay Mihraban\\", which was a much bigger success than her second album. Later in 2011, well known for her kind- heartedness, Morad helped an Ethiopian maid, Maha, to become a singer in the Kurdistan Region.  2012‚Äì14: New beginnings  Having left her old producer, in 2012, Morad released her first English single, \\"Open Your Eyes\\", which was not only a hit in the Kurdistan Region, but also the wider Iraq, Lebanon and Holland. In Holland, \\"Open Your Eyes\\" was number one for six weeks on FunX Radio‚Äôs XCHART. \\"Open Your Eyes\\" was produced by Gary Stevenson and written by Goran Kay. Morad was relieved that she was finally able to make the type of music that she wanted. Later that year, In solidarity with the Syrian people, Morad recorded the song \\"Power of Love\\". This image shows us making the music video to Open Your Eyes. Morad also in 2012, began presenting a new talk show, \\"Shepolakani Jiyan\\", or \\"Waves of Life\\", where she focused on education, women‚Äôs rights and environmental issues. In 2013, Morad and fellow artist Karwan Kamil were awarded a Golden Record for the Best Music Award 2013 by the Institute of Music in Duhok for their single \\"Binaz\\". Later that same year, Morad collaborated with the Kurdish musical trio Le Din√™, to release the single \\"Take Me Home\\". Also in 2013, Morad was offered a record deal by a Lebanese music label to release her album in 24 countries. However, the deal collapsed after being sabotaged by her management team. In 2014, after further difficulties with her management team, she decided to leave them, and focus on her charity projects.

S. (1995). The Free Dictionary. Retrieved September 20, 2009, from http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Carnovsky,+Leon Carnovsky was recognized by American Libraries as being one of the 100 most influential figures in Library and Information Sciences.McCormick, L. K. P. S. E. (1999). 100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century. American Libraries 38(11). Personal life Carnovsky was born on November 28, 1903 in St. Louis, Missouri, one of seven children born to Isaac and Jennie Stillman Carnovsky. In early life, Carnovsky found intellectual pursuits to be most interesting, and was encouraged by his parents to continue his intellectual growth, which included frequent trips to the local library.Wedgeworth, R. (1993). World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services (3 ed.). As a young man in the library profession, Leon met Marian Satterthwaite, director of the Enoch Pratt Free Library training class in Baltimore, and was eventually married on August 25, 1939. After her death in January 1965, Leon was remarried in 1967 to Ruth French Strout, Dean of Students and Associate Professor in the Graduate Library School at Chicago University.Haygood, W. C. (1968). Leon Carnovsky: ASketch. The Library Quarterly 38(4), 422-428. Education After completing his grade school education, Carnovsky took a position in St Louis as a secretary in a manufacturing company that produced pistons and piston rings, not planning to further his education. However, after much prodding from his boss, he decided to return to the University of Missouri to pursue a degree in Journalism. After a short time at the University, he became enamored with his philosophy professor, Glenn R. Morrow and changed his major to philosophy, with a minor in sociology. Upon completion of his degree, he researched the possibility of pursuing a career in librarianship. After studying as the first male library student at the St. Louis library school for a year, he received a scholarship from the Carnegie Foundation and moved to Chicago to pursue a Master's degree from the new Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago. During his tenure in the Graduate Library School, he was convinced to continue his studies past the attainment of a master's degree and instead completed his Ph.D., titling his dissertation ‚ÄúThe Reading Needs of Typical Students, with Special Attention to Factors Contributing to the Satisfactions of Reading Interests.‚Äù Early career After graduating from the University of Chicago, Carnovsky joined the faculty of the university in 1932 as an instructor, a position that he kept until his retirement in 1971. During his early career at the university, he, along with many other faculty, began to write to further the academic purpose of the Graduate Library School. Many of these works focused on the theory behind library science, as opposed to earlier works that primarily included ‚Äútrade-schoolish‚Äù direction. Surveyor of libraries As Carnovsky began to further his career, he became more interested in the inner workings of public libraries. He undertook his first library survey during his early teaching career. During the survey of metropolitan library services, which was funded by the Chicago Library Club, Carnovsky developed a comprehensive list by which to guide future surveys that would be conducted by himself and his colleagues. During his career, he was asked to contribute to surveys of libraries across the country and around the world. From his surveys, Carnovsky provided reports that discussed his findings, many of which were collaborative pieces. These surveys were conducted throughout the United States, including Michigan, New York, Illinois, and North Carolina.Schlipf, F. A. (1968). Leon Carnovsky: A Bibliography. The Library Quarterly, 38 Other major professional accomplishments Later on in his career, issues surrounding international librarianship became of great concern to Carnovsky. He became an important consultant across the world, and conducted surveys of libraries in many different countries. As a consultant to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), he advised the Israeli government on the potential opportunity to open a school for library education. Upon his recommendation in his report ‚ÄúReport on a Programme of Library Education in Israel,‚Äù the beginnings of a library education were built. After the completion of his work in Israel, UNESCO asked him to conduct a similar study in Greece; however, his recommendations were not followed in this case. Along with his constant analysis through library surveys, Carnovsky also held various board positions with the American Library Association (ALA), was President of the Association of American Library Schools, and received a Fulbright Grant to conduct a study of international public libraries. During the time that Carnovsky served as the chairman of the ALA Committee on Accreditation, he spent his time travelling to libraries throughout the country to conduct accreditation visits. In his post as editor of the Library Quarterly, which he held from 1943 to 1961, Carnovsky became more well known for his contributions to international librarianship. Throughout his career, Carnovsky furthered the work of librarians in the United States and around the world by publishing many works that discussed the issues that were at the heart of librarianship. His extensive bibliography includes journal articles, reports, addresses, books, letters, biographies, and even a poem or two. According to a 1968 bibliography, some of his many works include: * What People Want to Read About * Reading in a College Residence Hall * The Dormitory Library: An Experiment in Stimulating Reading * Libraries in Nazi Germany * A Study of the Relationship between Reading Interest and Actual Reading * They Read: What Then? * T.E.

It is a major tributary of the Helmand River.  Geography  The river rises in the far northern province of Daykundi Province in Daykundi District in the region called Hazarajat not far from the boundary with Bamyan Province. Shortly after its birth, Kaj follows a southbound direction. It ends with its confluence with the right bank in Helmand, about forty miles north of Deh Rawod. Hydrology The seasonal pattern of flow is typical of rivers in high mountains of central Afghanistan taking into account seasonal snow melt. The average annual flow or module was calculated over a period of 6 years (from 1974 to 1979) and was more or less than 35 cubic meters per second. The curve oscillation observed daily flows in 1978 is quite similar to the average of these 6 years. The period of high water occurs in late winter and the beginning of spring. The maximum flow is observed in late February to early May when there is snowmelt. It reaches 200 to 300 cubic meters per second on average during the first half of April. This period of high water is followed by a steadily declining rate that falls below 20 cubic meters as of early June The drop therefore slows and the rate reached its lowest average of 5 to 7 m¬≥ per second in early autumn, i.e. in September‚ÄìOctober. Some thunderstorms and showers are present in the dry season which account for occasional breaks in the trend. An intermediate period (with a moderate flow rate) occurs during the cold season, from early October to early March, during which the average rate rises slowly but fairly steadily, from 7 to 15 cubic meters per second. For the year 1978 the rate fluctuated between a low of 5 and a high of approximately 160 m¬≥. The peak was reached rapidly melting snow in April.

A Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker in flight Roles Some of the roles carried out by counter-insurgency aircraft include: *Transportation in support of combatants and civilians alike, including casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). *Intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance. *Psychological operations (PSYOPs) through leaflet drops, loudspeakers, and radio broadcasts. *Air-to-ground attack against soft targets. For an aircraft‚Äîwhether fixed-wing or rotary‚Äîto effectively carry out all these roles, it should have specification characteristics such as low loitering speed, long endurance, simplicity in maintenance, and the capability to perform short or vertical take-offs and landings from makeshift and roughly constructed runways. History A Cessna O-1 Bird Dog  Colonial times The first use of counter-insurgency aircraft was in the 1920s and 1930s during some of the colonial wars, in nations like Ethiopia and Iraq. The benefits offered by even a single aircraft in tasks such as reconnaissance or strafing small groups of individuals proved immeasurable. As the British found in Iraq in the 1920s and from some encounters within the frontiers of Pashtunistan, aircraft stripped away many of the advantages that traditional insurgents had held. It also offered a way of inflicting direct and cost-effective retaliation on the communities that supported the guerrilla. No special plane was developed. Regular military aircraft were used. It was not unusual for many air forces to field dual role planes: bomber and transport.  Post colonial wars By the late 1950s, French air operations in the Algerian War was decidedly counter-insurgent in nature, with helicopters such as the Piasecki H-21 being used not only to carry infantry, but also machine guns and rocket launchers on an ad hoc basis, to reach FLN guerilla positions on otherwise inaccessible mountain ridges and peaks. In the early 1960s it was clear enough for US planners a plane would be needed for guerrilla wars in Asia or Africa. As a consequence U.S. Army tested armed versions of the YAT-37D Dragonfly, A4D-1 Skyhawk and G.91. The tests were good but the Army was prohibited from operating fixed-wing aircraft in combat. As late as the Vietnam War, counter-insurgency missions were flown by existing aeroplanes and helicopters, sometimes hastily adapted for the role, notable examples being the North American T-28 Trojan and Douglas A-1 Skyraider. Eventually, as the US budget allowed it, dedicated specialized counter-insurgency aircraft began to be produced for Vietnam war. Other countries adapted existing training planes to COIN and light attack. Examples including: PSYOP warfare A new approach of COIN were the gunships created by the US. A gunship is an aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. These gunships were configured to circle the target instead of performing strafing runs. Such aircraft have their armament on one side harmonized to fire at the apex of an imaginary cone formed by the aircraft and the ground when performing a pylon turn (banking turn). In the Vietnam War, the old Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport was successfully modified by the United States Air Force with side- firing Miniguns for circling attacks. It was the later and larger Lockheed AC-130 that became a notable gunship in US military aviation. These heavily armed aircraft used a variety of weapon systems, including 7.62 mm GAU-2/A Miniguns, 20 mm (0.787 in) M61 Vulcan six-barrel rotary cannons, 25 mm (0.984 in) GAU-12/U Equalizer five-barreled rotary cannons, 30 mm Mk44 Bushmaster II chain guns, 40 mm (1.58 in) L/60 Bofors autocannons, and 105 mm (4.13 in) M102 howitzers. The Douglas AC-47 Spooky, the Fairchild AC-119, and the AC-130 Spectre/Spooky, were vulnerable, and meant to operate only after achieving air superiority. Smaller gunship designs such as the Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker and the Helio AU-24 Stallion were also designed by the United States during the Vietnam War. These aircraft were meant to be cheap and easy to fly and maintain, and were to be given to friendly governments in Southeast Asia to assist with counter-insurgency operations, eventually seeing service with the Khmer National Air Force, Royal Thai Air Force, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force as well as limited use by the United States Air Force.

This is also the method used to produce light in a cathode ray tube (CRT), but, unlike CRTs, ESL lamps do not include magnetic or electrostatic means to deflect the electron beam. A cathodoluminescent light has a transparent glass envelope coated on the inside with a light-emitting phosphor layer. Electrons emitted from a cathode strike the phosphor; the current returns through a transparent conductive coating on the envelope. The phosphor layer emits light through the transparent face of the envelope. The system has a power supply providing at least 5kVDC to the light emitting device, and the electrons transiting from cathode to anode are essentially unfocused. Additional circuits allow triac-type dimmers to control the light level. Lights produced so far have a color rendering index of 90. The energy consumption can be 70% less than that of a standard incandescent light bulb. Claimed lifetime can be as long as 10,000 hours which is more than ten times that of a standard incandescent light bulb. Unlike fluorescent lamps, which produce light through the electrical excitation of mercury vapor, ESL lamps do not use mercury. The first commercially available ESL product was a reflector bulb. Drawbacks include high weight, a slightly larger-than-normal base and ‚Äì as with compact fluorescent lamps ‚Äì when switched on, a slight delay before illumination begins and a static charge which attracts dust to the bulb face. As of 2016 the cost is higher and claimed efficiency is less than half that of commercially available LED bulbs, although it is considerably better than that of traditional incandescent lamps.

It is dedicated to the exhibition and collection of contemporary glass art worldwide and also offers public demonstrations and seminars to glass students in its glass-blowing studio. Establishment The museum was founded in 1985 by Danish glass artists Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch. It is administered by the private Foundation for the Collection of Contemporary International Studio Glass. The museum makes its home in Ebeltofts's former Customs and Excise House; in 2006 a modern wing was added to the original building. In addition to exhibition spaces, the museum has a library, gift shop and cafe that are open to the public. Also in 2006 an enclosed garden and glass-blowing studio were added to the complex. The glass studio presents glass working demonstrations to the public and seminars for students of glass. Lynggaard (1930-2011), originally a ceramicist, had lectured in Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario, where he encountered the studio glass movement. Studio glass‚Äîstarting in the early 1960s‚Äîembraced glass as a medium for independent sculpture artists, in contrast to utilitarian or conventionally decorative glass work (typically produced by craftsmen to the specifications of a designer, as with companies such as Tiffany & Co.). ‚ÄúAfter raising the profile of glass in Gothenburg, London and elsewhere in Europe, in 1980 [Lynggaard] moved to Ebeltoft (‚ÄòApple Hill‚Äô) ‚Äì considered a ‚Äòwilderness‚Äô by some of his students ‚Äì to set up a glassblowing studio.‚Äù Exhibitions The museum presents four to six exhibitions per year that focus on contemporary glass art. It shows experimental work by young artists in group and solo shows, as well as new work by well-established artists. Organized by museum staff, the exhibitions often include catalogs that are printed in several languages for the benefit of an international audience. Glasmuseet Ebeltoft often loans the exhibitions it creates to museums in other countries. In the past these countries have included China, England, Finland, Germany and the United States. Collections Glasmuseet Ebeltoft‚Äôs collection contains 1500 objects by 600 artists. Its holdings are composed of donations and loans of art works, obtained in most cases directly from the artists whose work is desired by the museum. The museum‚Äôs collection is most unusual in that artists who have been invited to be represented in it are permitted to exchange or supplement their works in the collection with new pieces.

Normally, bond lifetimes are expected to diminish with force. In the case of catch bonds, the lifetime of the bond actually increases up to a maximum before it decreases like in a normal bond. Catch bonds work in a way that is conceptually similar to that of a Chinese finger trap. While catch bonds are strengthened by an increase in force, the force increase is not necessary for the bond to work. Catch bonds were suspected for many years to play a role in the rolling of leukocytes, being strong enough to roll in presence of high forces caused by high shear stresses, while avoiding getting stuck in capillaries where the fluid flow, and therefore shear stress, is low. The existence of catch bonds was debated for many years until strong evidence of their existence was found in bacteria. Definite proof of their existence came shortly thereafter in leukocytes. Discovery Catch bonds were first proposed in 1988 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society by M. Dembo et al. while at Los Alamos National Laboratory. While developing molecular model to study the critical tension required to detach a membrane bound to a surface through adhesion molecules, it was found that it is theoretically possible for bond dissociation to be increased by force, decreased by force, and independent of force. The terms \\"slip bond\\", \\"catch bond\\", and \\"ideal bond\\" were coined by Dembo to describe these three types of bond behaviors. Slip bonds represent the ordinary behavior originally modeled by G. Bell, Dembo's former postdoctoral mentor at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1978. Slip bonds were supported by flow chamber experiments where forces are applied on molecular bonds linking cells to chamber floor under shear flow. By comparison, no decisive evidence of catch bonds was found until 2003. This is due to experimental conditions that were unfavorable for detecting catch bonds, as well as the counterintuitive nature of the bonds themselves. For example, most early experiments were conducted in 96 well plates, an environment that does not provide any flow. Some experiments failed to produce shear stress that is now known to be critical to lengthen the lifetimes of catch bonds, while other experiments conducted under flow conditions too weak or too strong for optimal shear-induced strengthening of these bonds. Finally, Marshall and coworkers found that P-selectin:PSGL-1 bonds exhibited increasing bond lifetime as step loads were applied between 0 and ~10 pN for monomeric interaction but 1 and ~20 pN for dimeric interaction, exhibiting catch bond behavior; after reaching maximum values, which were ~0.6 and 1.2 seconds for monomeric and dimeric interaction, respectively, the bond lifetime fell rapidly at higher loads, displaying slip bond behavior (\\"catch- slip\\" bonds). These data were collected using an atomic force microscope and a flow chamber, and have subsequently been duplicated using a biomembrane force probe. These finding prompted the discoveries of other important catch bonds in the 2000's, including those between L-selectin and PSGL-1 or endoglycan, FimH and mannose, myosin and actin, platelet glycoprotein Ib and von Willebrand factor, and integrin alpha 5 beta 1 and fibronectin. Emphasizing their importance and general acceptance, in the three years following their discovery there were at least 24 articles published on catch bonds. More catch bonds were discovered in the 2010's, including E-selectin with carbohydrate ligands, G-actin with G-actin or F-actin, cadherin-catenin complex with actin, vinculin with F-actin, microtubule with kinetochore particle, integrin alpha L beta 2 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), integrin alpha 4 beta 1 with vascular adhesion molecule 1, integrin alpha M beta 2 with ICAM-1, integrin alpha V beta 3 with fibronectin, and integrin alpha IIb beta 3 with fibronectin or fibrinogen. Sivasankar and his research team have found that the mechanism behind the puzzling phenomenon is due to long-lived, force- induced hydrogen bonds. Using data from previous experiments, the team used molecular dynamics to discover that two rod-shaped cadherins in an X-dimer formed catch bonds when pulled and in the presence of calcium ions. The calcium ions keep the cadherins rigid, while pulling brings the proteins closer together, allowing for hydrogen bonds to form. The mechanism behind catch bonds helps to explain the biophysics behind cell-cell adhesion. According to the researchers, \\"Robust cadherin adhesion is essential for maintaining the integrity of tissue such as the skin, blood vessels, cartilage and muscle that are exposed to continuous mechanical assault.\\" The above catch bonds are formed between adhesion receptors and ligands, and among structural molecules and motor proteins, which bear force or generate force in their physiological function. An interesting recent development is the discoveries of catch bonds formed between signaling receptors and their ligands. These includes bonds between T cell antigen receptors (TCR) or pre-TCR and peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules, Fc gamma receptor and IgG Fc, and notch receptor and ligands. The presence of catch bonds in the interactions of these signaling (rather than adhesion) receptors have been suggested to be indicative of a possible role of these receptors as mechanoreceptors. Variations and related dynamic bonds=Triphasic bonds Other type of \\"dynamic bonds\\" have been defined in additional to the original types of catch bonds, slip bonds and ideal bonds classified by Dembo. Unlike slip bonds, which have been observed in the entire force range tested, catch bonds only exist within certain force range as any molecular bond would eventually be overpowered by high enough force. Therefore, catch bonds are always followed by slip bonds, hence termed \\"catch-slip bonds\\". More variations have also been observed, e.g., triphasic slip-catch-slip bonds. Flex bonds The transition between catch and slip bonds have been modeled as molecular dissociation from two bond states along two pathways. Dissociation along each pathway alone results in a slip bond but at different rates. At low forces, dissociation occurs predominately along the fast pathway. Increasing force tilts the multi-dimensional energy landscape to switch the dissociation from fast pathway to slow pathway, manifesting catch bond. As dissociation along the slow pathway dominates, further increase in force accelerates dissociation, manifesting slip bond. This switching behavior is also called flex bond. Dynamic catch The above bonds involve bimolecular interactions, which arguably represents the simplest types. A new type of catch bonds emerges when trimolecular interactions are involved. In such cases, one molecule can interact with the two counter-molecules using two binding sites, either separately, i.e. one at a time in the absence of the other to form bimolecular bonds, or concurrently to form a trimolecular bond when both counter-molecules are present. An interesting finding is that even when the two bimolecular interactions behave as slip bonds, the trimolecular interaction can behave as catch bond. This new type of catch bond, which requires concurrent and cooperative binding, is termed dynamic catch. Cyclic mechanical reinforcement Most catch bonds were demonstrated using force-clamp force spectroscopy where upon initial ramping, a constant force is loaded on the bond to observe how long the bond lasts, i.e., measuring the bond lifetime at a constant force. Catch bonds are revealed when the mean bond lifetime (reciprocally related to the rate of bond dissociation) increases with the clamped force. Zhu and colleagues demonstrated that bond lifetime measured at the force-clamp phase could be substantially prolonged if the initial ramping included two forms of pre-conditioning: 1) loading the bond by ramping the force to a high level (peak force) before clamping the force at a low level for lifetime measurement, and 2) loading and unloading the bond repeatedly by multiple force cycles before clamping the force at a peak value for lifetime measurement. This new bond type, termed cyclic mechanical reinforcement (CMR), is distinct from catch bond, but it nevertheless resembles catch bond in that the bond lifetime increases with the peak force and with the number of cycles used to pre-condition the bond. CMR has been observed for interactions between integrin alpha 5 beta 1 and fibronectin and between G-actin and G-actin or F-actin. Force history dependence The CMR phenomenon indicates that how long a bond can sustain force at a given level can depend on the history of force application prior to arriving at that force level. In other words, the \\"rate constant\\" of molecular dissociation at a constant force depends not only on the value of force at the current time but also on the prior force history the bond has experienced in the past. This has indeed been observed for interactions of P-selectin with PSGL-1 or anti-P- selectin antibody, L-selectin with PSGL-1, myosin with actin, integrin alpha V beta 3 with fibrinogen, and TCR with pMHC. Various catch bonds of specific molecular interactions=Selectin bondBackground= Leukocytes, as well as other types of white blood cells, normally form weak and short-lived bonds with other cells via selectin. Coated outside the membrane of leukocytes are microvilli, which have various types of adhesive molecules, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a glycoprotein that is normally decorated with sulfated sialyl-Lewis x. the sulfated-sialyl-Lewis-x-contained PSGL-1 molecule has the ability to bind to any type of selectin. Leukocytes also exhibit L-selectin that binds to other cells or other leukocytes that contain PSGL-1 molecules. thumb335x335pxTop: Under normal blood flow conditions, leukocytes (gray circles) float freely in the bloodstream. Bottom: Under conditions of infection and inflammation, high shear stress causes leukocytes to bind and roll along blood vessel walls (red lines). This is known as the shear-threshold phenomenon. An important example of catch bonds is their role in leukocyte extravasation. During this process, leukocytes move through the circulatory system to sites of infection, and in doing so they 'roll' and bind to selectin molecules on the vessel wall. While able to float freely in the blood under normal circumstances, shear stress induced by inflammation causes leukocytes to attach to the endothelial vessel wall and begin rolling rather than floating downstream. This ‚Äúshear-threshold phenomenon‚Äù was initially characterized in 1996 by Finger et al. who showed that leukocyte binding and rolling through L-selectin is only maintained when a critical shear-threshold is applied to the system. Multiple sources of evidence have shown that catch bonds are responsible for the tether and roll mechanism that allows this critical process to occur. Catch bonds allow increasing force to convert short-lived tethers into stronger, longer-lived binding interactions, thus decreasing the rolling velocity and increasing the regularity of rolling steps. However, this mechanism only works at an optimal force. As shear force increases past this force, bonds revert to slip bonds, creating an increase in velocity and irregularity of rolling. =Leukocytes adhesion mediated by shear stress= In blood vessel, at very low shear stress of ~.3 dynes per squared centimeter, leukocytes do not adhere to the blood vessel endothelial cells. Cells move along the blood vessel at a rate proportional to the blood flow rate. Once the shear stress pass that shear threshold value, leukocytes start to accumulate via selectin binding. At low shear stress above the threshold of about .3 to 5 dynes per squared centimeter, leukocytes alternate between binding and non-binding. Because one leukocyte has many selectins around the surface, these selectin binding/ unbinding cause a rolling motion on the blood vessel. As the shear stress continue to increase, the selectin bonds becomes stronger, causing the rolling velocity to be slower. This reduction in leukocytes rolling velocity allow cells to stop and perform firm binding via integrin binding. Selectin binding do not exhibit \\"true\\" catch bond property. Experiments show that at very high shear stress (passing a second threshold), the selectin binding transit between a catch bond to a slip bond binding, in which the rolling velocity increases as the shear force increases. = Leukocyte rolling mediated by catch-slip transition = Catch-slip transition allows leukocytes to roll along blood vessel walls. Researchers have hypothesized that the ability of leukocytes to maintain attachment and rolling on the blood vessel wall can be explained by a combination of many factors, including cell flattening to maintain a larger binding surface-area and reduce hydrodynamic drag, as well as tethers holding the rear of the rolling cell to the endothelium breaking and slinging to the front of the rolling cell to reattach to the endothelial wall. These hypotheses work well with Marshall‚Äôs 2003 findings that selectin bonds go through a catch-slip transition in which initial increases in shear force strengthen the bond, but with enough applied force bond lifetimes begin to decay exponentially. Therefore, the weak binding of a sling at the leading edge of a rolling leukocyte would initially be strengthened as the cell rolls farther and the tension on the bond increases, preventing the cell from dissociating from the endothelial wall and floating freely in the bloodstream despite high shear forces. However, at the trailing edge of the cell, tension becomes high enough to transition the bond from catch to slip, and the bonds tethering the trailing edge eventually break, allowing the cell to roll further instead of remaining stationary. = Proposed mechanisms of action  Allosteric model  thumb359x359pxAllosteric model states that applied tension results in an extended conformation of the EGF domain, causing a conformational change to the lectin domain, resulting in increased binding affinity. Though catch bonds are now widely recognized, their mechanism of action is still under dispute. Two leading hypotheses dominate the discussion. The first hypothesis, the allosteric model, stems from evidence that x-ray crystallography of selectin proteins shows two conformational states: a bent conformation in the absence of ligand, and an extended conformation in the presence of the ligand. The main domains involved in these states are a lectin domain which contains the ligand binding site and an EGF domain which can shift between bent and extended conformations. The allosteric model claims that tension on the EGF domain favors the extended conformation, and extension of this domain causes a conformational shift in the lectin domain, resulting in greater binding affinity for the ligand. As a result of this conformational change, the ligand is effectively locked in place despite tension exerted on the bond.  Sliding-rebinding model  The sliding-rebinding model differs from the allosteric model in that the allosteric model posits that only one binding site exists and can be altered, but the sliding-rebinding model states that multiple binding sites exist and aren‚Äôt changed by EGF extension. Rather, in the bent conformation which is favored at low applied forces, the applied force is perpendicular to the line of possible binding sites. Thus, when the association between ligand and lectin domain is interrupted, the bond quickly dissociates. At larger applied forces, however, the protein is extended and the line of possible binding sites is aligned with the applied force, allowing the ligand to quickly re-associate with a new binding site after the initial interaction is disrupted. With multiple binding sites, and even the ability to re-associate with the original binding site, the rate of ligand dissociation would be decreased as is typical of catch bonds. Mechanism of a single selectin binding A single PSGL-1 and selectin binding is similar to conventional protein binding when the force is kept constant, with a dissociation constant. As the force exerted starts to increase, the dissociation constant decreases, causing binding to become stronger. As the force reach a threshold level of 11 pN, the dissociation constant starts to increase again, weakening the bond, causing the bond to exhibit a slip bond property. FimH bondBackground= Catch bonds also play a significant role in bacterial adhesion, most notably in Escherichia coli. E. coli and other bacteria residing in the intestine must be able to adhere to intestinal walls or risk being eliminated from the body through urine. This is possible due to the bacterial protein FimH, which mediates high adhesion in response to high flow. The lectin domain is one that provides FimH binding the catch bond property when binding to mannose residues from other cells. Experiments have shown that when force is loaded rapidly, bonds were able to survive high forces, thus pointing to catch bond behavior. Catch bonds are responsible for the failure of E. coli in the urinary tract to be eliminated during urination, thus leading to a urinary tract infection. This knowledge is important not only in understanding bacteria, but also for learning how anti-adhesive technologies can be created. =Bacteria adhesion mediated by shear stress= Similar to selectin binding, FimH binding also have a threshold where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 dynes per squared centimeter, slightly larger than that of selectin binding. Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues. However, different from selectin binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses. This cause FimH binding to exhibit a \\"stick-and-roll\\" adhesion, not rolling adhesion in the case of selectin binding. And unlike selectin binding which requires integrin to help with firm adhesion, FimH binding can become stationary, and this process is reversible. All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 dynes per squared centimeter, FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 dynes per squared centimeter, slow rolling is observed.

He soon progressed to Pontypool RFC, who were at the time making a notable appearance at club level and gaining caps internationally. In 1906, Evans was one of five Pontypool players to be selected to face Paul Roos' 1906 touring South African team as part of the Monmouthshire team.Billot (1974), pg 45. Evans was partnered at centre for the Monmouthshire game with Pontypool teammate Jack Jones, but Evans spent much of the game in defensive cover and he and Jones were deemed out of form against the much faster Springboks.Billot (1974), pg 45-48. The game ended in a 17-0 defeat for Monmouthshire. Just a few months after the South Africa game, Evans won his first international cap for Wales when he was brought in as centre for the opening game of the 1907 Home Nations Championship. Partnered with Rhys Gabe, Evans was given the difficult task of replacing Gwyn Nicholls one of the most inventive and loved centres in Welsh rugby history. The 1907 campaign started well, with a convincing win over England, and the Welsh selectors responded by keeping faith with Evans for the next two games of the tournament. Wales suffered a narrow loss to Scotland, but responded with a large victory over Ireland.
