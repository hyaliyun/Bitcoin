He was a General in the army, a colonel in the 76th Regiment. He was a Brigadier General in the Portuguese Service and was appointed a Knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal (KTS). He was awarded the Army Gold Cross, with three clasps, for the battles of Busaco, Albuera, Badajoz, Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and the Military General Service Medal, with two clasps, for Corunna and Ciudad Rodrigo.A.

Retrieved 17 August 2009 Biography Arbuthnot was born at Rockfleet Castle, County Mayo, Ireland, the fourth son of agriculturist John Arbuthnot Senior of Rockfleet, Co Mayo. He was the brother of the Right Honourable Charles Arbuthnot, Bishop Alexander Arbuthnot and of Lieutenant-general Sir Thomas Arbuthnot. He entered the army as a cornet in the 23rd Light Dragoons on 1 January 1797, and was present at the Battle of Ballinamuck in the Irish rebellion on 8 September of the following year. He subsequently served with his regiment at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1806, and in South America as aide-de-camp to General (afterwards Lord) William Beresford, with whom and the rest of the troops under General Beresford's command he was made a prisoner of war, and remained a prisoner for 18 months, until released under the convention made by General Whitelock. On his return from America, Arbuthnot, then a captain in the 20th Light Dragoons, resumed his position on General Beresford's staff at Madeira, and served with him as aide-de-camp, and afterwards as military secretary, throughout the greater part of the Peninsular War. Few officers have taken part in so many general actions. Besides the Battle of Ballinamuck, two at the Cape, and three in South America, Sir Robert was present at the Battle of Corunna, the passage of the Douro, the battle of Busaco, the lines of Torres Vedras, the siege and reduction of Olivenza, the first siege of Badajoz, the battle of Albuera, the siege and storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, the third siege and storming of Badajoz, the battles of the Nivelle, Nive, passage of the Adour, and the battles of Orthes and Toulouse. He received the gold cross and three clasps for Busaco, Albuera, Badajoz, Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and the war medal and two clasps for Corunna and Ciudad Rodrigo. He also received Portuguese and Spanish orders, including the special star given by the Portuguese government to all English officers of superior rank engaged at Albuera. He brought home the despatches regarding Albuera, and on that occasion was appointed a brevet lieutenant-colonel. He was created a knight of the Tower and Sword by the government of Portugal, and in 1815 was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In 1830, he attained the rank of major-general, and in 1838 was appointed to the command of the troops in Ceylon, after which he commanded a division in Bengal until his promotion as lieutenant-general in 1841. In 1843, he was appointed colonel of the 76th Foot. Sir Robert Arbuthnot was an officer of conspicuous gallantry, and was remarkable for his quickness of eye and readiness of resource. At Albuera he distinguished himself by galloping between two regiments, the British 57th and a Spanish regiment, and stopping the fire which by mistake they were exchanging ‚Äì a feat which he performed without receiving a single wound. In the same battle, at a critical moment, he was enabled by his quickness of sight to discern a retrograde movement on the part of the French, which Marshal Beresford had not perceived, and induced the latter to recall an order which he had just given for the retirement of two batteries of artillery. At an earlier period, in South America, when he and General Beresford were prisoners in the hands of the Spanish, and when all the officers were about to be searched for papers, he contrived by a clever stratagem to secrete in an orchard an important document, viz. the convention which had been executed between General Beresford and the Spanish general Linieres, and of which the Spanish were anxious to regain possession. Family He married his first wife, Susan Vesey in Belfast on 1 February 1802 (who died in Teddington, Twickenham on 30 June 1822). Susan was the only child of Colonel William Vesey of Farm Hill. Sir Robert married second at St James's Church, Piccadilly, 4 January 1826, Harriet Smith (dsp 5 December 1861), daughter of and co-heir of Thomas Smith of Castleton Hall, Lancashire.

Most famous for being the second Japanese Iron Chef on the show, Iron Chef, he has worked at numerous restaurants such as the Oriental Hotel in Osaka, Nadaman in the Hotel New Otani, and the Nadaman Singapore in the Shangri La Hotel. He later became the manager of Nadaman in the Hotel New Otani. He now has his own restaurant in Ariake, Tokyo. On Iron Chef he wore a purple outfit trimmed with gold in the Japanese style.  Iron Chef Nakamura In the fall of 1995, Nakamura's predecessor, Rokusaburo Michiba, had fought in the first overtime battle in Kitchen Stadium, a grueling process that led to his retirement at the 1996 Mr. Iron Chef tournament. Michiba's last battle was against fellow Iron Chef Chen Kenichi, and for two months, Kitchen Stadium had only two Iron Chefs while Michiba was tasked to find a successor. During this time, Michiba had repeatedly requested Nakamura to be his successor, but Nakamura repeatedly declined due to two main factors: the first was that, at that time, Michiba's fusion-style Japanese dishes had promoted the stigma among the traditionalist chefs' circle that Iron Chef was to be avoided; the second was that, in contrast to Chen or Hiroyuki Sakai, who owned their own restaurants, Nakamura was a hired chef, and thus had more riding on the line with each battle. Nakamura was ultimately convinced by an old high-school friend who he refers to as his older brother to become an Iron Chef after taking note of the fact that the Iron Chef Japanese was a one-of-a-kind position. Nakamura is, in stark contrast to Michiba before him and Masaharu Morimoto after, considered to be more of a traditional Japanese chef that was forced to improvise due to unusual-for- traditional-Japanese-cuisine secret ingredients that tended to favor the challenger. He also appeared to be the most concerned about winning and losing - a fact that may have led him to his 24-11-1 record with one no-contest. Not surprisingly, his decisions on the dishes he made were often influenced by his bosses at Nadaman, perhaps to maintain a good corporate image although the restaurant itself ceased to care about Nakamura's performance as an Iron Chef after a year. During his tenure as an Iron Chef, Nakamura was always compared to Michiba, who was regarded as the top Iron Chef during his tenure. It was said that Nakamura was even ostracised by his family whenever he lost, which was why Nakamura had acquired a pet Shiba dog named \\"Chef\\" one year into his tenure. Curiously, despite a sub-par overall performance as an Iron Chef, Nakamura has won the majority of battles against returning challengers going 3-1-1 and other Iron Chefs going 2‚Äì1. After a grueling battle with Toshiro Kandagawa (in which he lost), Nakamura retired from Kitchen Stadium in 1998 at the age of 50. His final battle was against Yukio Hattori in Tuna Battle on February 20, 1998, a battle in which he won. He did return for Iron Chef Morimoto's one year anniversary, which was Battle Egg on March 12, 1999, a battle in which he won.

The Assembly was preceded and followed by three days of feasting.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar √âirinn 1.26 He also built a structure at Tara called the M√∫r nOlloman or Scholar's Rampart. In the 1870s E.A. Conwell made the claim that Cairn T in the Loughcrew megalithic tomb complex was the tomb of Ollamh Fodhla. The link was based on a claim by James Fergusson (\\"Rude Stone Monuments in All Countries\\", 1872, Ch.V, p.199) that the tomb complex at Loughcrew was the cememtery known as Tailten (or Talten) known from historical documents, with the modern settlement of Teltown being representative of the old place name. Conwell also linked a large stone with neolithic carvings on it at the site, known as Hag's chair, as the judicial seat of Ollamh Fodhla, who was recorded as being a law giver/maker - this supposed link was a large part of his thesis linking the king and site. The claim is mostly conjecture.

Owned and operated by Jardine Matheson, the gun is fired every day at noon and has become a tourist attraction. Origin The Noonday Gun is located on the waterfront of the area formerly known as East Point, present- day Causeway Bay. East Point was the first plot of land in Hong Kong to be sold by the colonial government by public auction in 1841, and was purchased by Jardine Matheson. Over the years, land reclamation has shifted the coastline northward, and the siting of the gun has changed accordingly. The name East Point is now disused.What‚Äôs the story behind the Noonday Gun?, HK Magazine, 4 June 2015 The tradition originated over an incident in the 1860s. Jardines' main godowns and offices were located at East Point, and its private militia would fire a gun salute to welcome a Jardine tai-pan's arrival by sea. On one occasion, a senior British naval officer became annoyed by this practice because he was new to Hong Kong and did not know of such a tradition. This was because such a salute was normally reserved for government officials and senior officers of the armed services. As a result, Jardines was ordered, as a penalty, to fire a gun every day at noon, in perpetuity. In 1941, during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese Imperial Army dismantled the gun and it was lost. After British forces regained Hong Kong in 1945, the Royal Navy provided Jardines with a new six-pound gun with which to continue the tradition of the noonday gun. On 1 July 1947, the Noonday gun was back in operation. Following complaints that the gun was too loud, in 1961 the marine police replaced the six-pound gun with a Hotchkiss three-pounder that saw action in the Battle of Jutland during the First World War. Tourist attraction Although British rule ended in Hong Kong in 1997, the tradition of the noonday gun is continued by Jardines. A small crowd will gather for this daily event. Other than noon, the gun is also fired by a Jardines official at midnight every New Year's Day to celebrate the new year. At the daily firing event, a Jardines' guard marches up to the site in uniform. The guard rings a bell to signal the end of the fore-noon watch, a practice which dates from the time when Jardines' main offices and warehouses were located at East Point. Then, the guard marches up to the Noonday Gun and fires it, after which he rings the bell again, locks the chain blocking access to the gun and goes off. It is accessed from a tunnel passing under Gloucester Road from the basement car park in The Excelsior hotel, which is operated by Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, a Jardines subsidiary. For a donation of HK$33,000 to the Community Chest charity, anyone can arrange to pull the lanyard that fires the gun. In popular culture The firing of the gun was famously mentioned in No√´l Coward's humorous song \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\". :In Hong Kong, they strike a gong, and fire off a noonday gun :To reprimand each inmate who's in late See also *Noon Gun: Signal Hill, Cape Town, South Africa *One O'Clock Gun: Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland.

He was hailed for a huge, thunderous technique that made him a thrilling interpreter of Liszt and Rachmaninoff and a late representative of the grand school of Russian Romantic pianism. Emil Gilels described him as a \\"phenomenon of the musical world\\". Biography Pavel Berman, Lazar Berman's son Berman was born to Jewish parents in Leningrad. His mother, Anna Lazarevna Makhover, had played the piano herself until prevented by hearing problems. She introduced her son to the piano at the age of two. Berman entered his first competition at the age of three, and recorded a Mozart fantasia and a mazurka that he had composed himself at the age of seven, before he could even read music. Berman was first noticed while participating in city young talents competition. The jury under the chairmanship of Leonid Nikolaev noticed child's \\"rare exceptional case of musical and piano skills\\". Now, after being officially given title \\"prodigy\\" at the age of four, he started studying with Leningrad State Conservatory professor, Samariy Savshinsky. In 1939 when Berman was nine, the family moved to Moscow so that he could study with Aleksandr Goldenweiser, first at Central musical school, and then at the Conservatoire, where he graduated from in 1953. The following year he made his formal debut playing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 25 with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1941, students, pupils and parents were evacuated to Kuibishev, a city on the Volga, because of World War II. Living conditions were so poor that his mother had to cut the fingers from a pair of gloves to allow him to continue to practise without freezing his hands. He subsequently began to acquire a small international visibility. At the age of 12 he played Franz Liszt's La campanella to a British audience over the radio. In 1956 became a laureate of two international piano competitions: Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Belgium, with Vladimir Ashkenazy, and Franz Liszt in Budapest, Hungary. As a result of these accomplishments, Berman was offered an international tour, and landed a recording deal, which included recordings of Liszt's sonata and Beethoven's \\"Appassionata\\". In 1958, he performed in London and recorded for SAGA.Discogs: Lazar Berman, Liszt*, Beethoven* ‚Äì Sonata In B Minor ‚Ä¢ Appassionata From 1959 to 1971 Berman was not allowed to travel abroad due to his marriage to a French national (the marriage soon fell apart); however, he continued to tour around Soviet Union, and did some recordings at \\"Melodia\\" studio, including Liszt's Transcedental etudes. That recording became one of the first soviet recordings done with the use of Stereo technology. From mid 1970s Mr. Berman was again allowed to tour abroad, which he did to high acclaim. In 1968 he married Valentina Sedova and in 1970 their son, Pavel, was born. Lazar and Valentina Berman (2000) Although he was known to international music aficionados who had heard the occasional recording on the Russian Melodiya record label, as well as those who visited the Soviet Union, he was not generally well known outside Russia before his 1975 American tour, organised by the impresario Jacques Leiser. His now legendary New York debut at the 92 Street Y, where he played Liszt's Transcendental √âtudes, struck the music world like lightning. He became an overnight sensation. Before that, he had been generally restricted to the Soviet concert circuit, playing on old and decrepit pianos to audiences of varied degrees of interest. Invitations to tour outside the Soviet Union were ignored by the Soviet state concert agency, Gosconcert. He lived in a tiny two-room apartment in Moscow, with a grand piano occupying an entire room. But after his 1975 tour, he was immediately in great demand, with Deutsche Grammophon, EMI, and CBS vying to record him. He recorded the Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto with Herbert von Karajan, as well as broadcasting it on international television with Antal Dor√°ti, to mark United Nations Day in 1976. His playing of Chopin is well documented, in both a concert film and a DGG recording of the polonaises from the 1970s.Discogs: Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Lazar Berman ‚Äì PolonaisesPresto Classical: Lazar Berman plays Chopin: Polonaises & Mussorgsky: Pictures at an Exhibition Most of his British appearances came in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In December 1976, he performed music by Sergei Prokofiev and Franz Liszt at the Royal Festival Hall. In 1980, at the height of his popularity, Berman again was barred from leaving Soviet Union. This time it was because a book by an American writer (censored in the USSR) was found in his luggage while he was passing custom in Moscow's airport. In August 1990 Berman left USSR for Norway, followed by final relocation to Italy, where he became a teacher. Four years later he became Italian citizen, and the following year he got invited to Musical School of Weimar, Germany, where he continued teaching until 2000. He often performed along with his son, violinist Pavel Berman. Berman died in 2005, survived by his third wife, Valentina Sedova, also a pianist, and their son, talented violinist and conductor Pavel Berman. His students included Sonya Bach, Italian pianists Giuliano Mazzocante, Maurizio Baglini, Enrico Elisi, and Enrico Pace, Vladimir Stoupel, Ioana Lupascu, Vardan Mamikonian, , Rueibin Chen, and Viktoriya Yermolyeva. Berman was buried at the Cimitero delle Porte Sante in Florence. The epitaph on his burial stone says: \\"You and your music are always with us\\".

He was the eldest son of his father's second wife, Fatimih Khanum, later known as Mahd-i-'Ulya, whom Bah√° ºu'll√°h married in Tehran in 1849. Muhammad  ªAl√≠ received the title from his father of GÕühusn-i- Akbar (\\"Greatest Branch\\" or \\"Greater Branch\\").The elative is a stage of gradation in Arabic that can be used both for a superlative or a comparative. GÕühusn-i-Akbar could mean \\"Greatest Branch\\" or \\"Greater Branch.\\" Early years M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ was born on December 16, 1853 in Baghdad during Bah√° ºu'll√°h's first year of exile in that city. In 1863, at the age of nine, he accompanied his family in their exile to Constantinople and Adrianople. During the final days in Adrianople, M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ wrote about eighty letters to the believers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, such as those in Baghdad and its surrounding towns. He also asked permission of his father to travel abroad and spread the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. At the age of fifteen, when Baha ºu'll√°h's family was imprisoned in Acre, the duty of copying Bah√° ºu'll√°h's writings was given to M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠. Dispute with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° In the Kit√°b-i- ªAhd (\\"Book of the Covenant\\"), Bah√° ºu'll√°h appointed  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as his successor, with Muhammad  ªAli given a station \\"beneath\\" that of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Both were noted explicitly by their titles, with Muhammad Ali being called GÕühusn-i-Akbar and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° being called GÕühusn-i-A ªzam. As time passed, Muhammad  ªAl√≠ claimed that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was not sharing power. According to some interpretations, Muhammad  ªAl√≠ insisted that he should instead be regarded as the leader of the Bah√° º√≠s. Many accusations were leveled against each other by both  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and Muhammad  ªAl√≠, culminating in Muhammad  ªAl√≠'s accusing his older brother of conspiring against the Ottoman government. This resulted in the imprisonment and near-death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and his family. Almost all Bah√° º√≠s accepted  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as Bah√° ºu'll√°h's successor. At the time of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death, Shoghi Effendi was appointed the Guardian of the Faith by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in his Will and Testament, while Muhammad  ªAl√≠ was reprimanded in the same document as \\"The Center of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief.\\" Because Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Kit√°b-i- ªAhd named Muhammad  ªAl√≠ as \\"after\\"  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s, he took the opportunity of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death to try to revive his claim to leadership, but his attempt to occupy the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h by force left him on the losing end of a legal battle that removed any rights he had to the property. The division between rival sects with M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ and Shoghi Effendi as their respective leaders was short-lived and Shoghi Effendi emerged as the leader of the global Bah√° º√≠ community, labeling Muhammad  ªAl√≠ the arch-breaker of the Covenant of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ would lead the small Unitarian Baha'i denomination. In 1904, he sent his oldest son, Shua Ullah Behai, to the United States where he led the Unitarian Baha'i community. From 1934 to 1937, Behai published Behai Quarterly, a \\"Unitarian\\" Bah√° º√≠ magazine written in English and featuring the writings of Mirza Muhammad  ªAl√≠ and various other Unitarian Bahais, including Ibrahim George Kheiralla. This schism had very little effect overall. In the  ªAkk√° area, the followers of Muhammad  ªAl√≠ represented six families at most, they had no common religious activities, and were almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society. This group essentially disappeared. Quote from source: \\"After the death of Shoghi Effendi (1957) the only significant oppositional movement was that led by ‚Ä¶ C. M. Remey‚Ä¶. The movement subsequently splintered‚Ä¶.\\" A modern academic observer has reported an ineffectual attempt to revive the claims of Muhammad Ali. Some of Mirza Muhammad  ªAl√≠'s works that were preserved by his family have been published in A Lost History of the Baha'i Faith: The Progressive Tradition of Baha'u'llah's Forgotten Family.

Death Mirza Muhammad  ªAl√≠ died on December 10, 1937, in Haifa Palestine. His remains were carried by hand from his house to King's Way, a distance of one mile, where the remains were placed on a vehicle and escorted to Acre, where again he was carried by hand to his burial plot at Bahji, near the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Memorial services were held at Haifa on Tuesday, January the 18th, 1938. Some supplications which were revealed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h towards M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ were recited: : ‚Äú..O my God, verily this is a branch who hath branched from the firm and lofty tree of Thy Singleness and One-ness‚Ä¶. assist him with the hosts of earth and heaven, and help, O my God, whosoever helpeth him, choose whosoever chooseth him, and assist whosoever cometh to him. Then forsake whosoever denieth him and desireth him not.‚Äù His death was broadcast by radio stations, including the British Broadcasting Corporation.

The battle was a decisive defeat and the Zulu lost their belief in victory. The war ended after the Battle of Ulundi on 4 July 1879. Prelude Following the disaster at the Battle of Hlobane on 28 March 1879, the forces of Colonel Evelyn Wood prepared to receive an attack by the entire Zulu impi, of which they had encountered only the leading sections. Soon after dawn of 29 March, Transvaal Rangers rode out to locate the impi, the cattle were put out to graze and after some deliberation, two companies were despatched to collect firewood. By the Rangers had returned with the news that the impi was on the move and was to attack Kambula at noon. Wood also now received information that the impi was nearly 21,000 men strong, consisting of regiments that had already defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana and other battles. Many of the Zulus were armed with rifles taken from the British dead at these battles. Shortly after this, the Zulu impi was sighted away across the plain, coming on due westwards in five columns. The warriors of the impi had not eaten for three days. The woodcutters and cattle were brought back in. Confident that the defences could be manned within a minute and a half of an alarm being sounded, Wood ordered the men to have their dinners. Cetshwayo responded to pleas from the abaQulusi for aid against the raids of Wood's troops by ordering the main Zulu army to help them. He ordered it not to attack fortified positions but to lure the British troops into the open even if it had to march on the Transvaal to accomplish this but his orders were ignored. The impi moved and Wood initially thought it was advancing on the Transvaal but it halted a few miles south of Kambula and formed up for an attack. Kambula camp The defences on Kambula consisted of a hexagonal laager formed with wagons that were tightly locked together, and a separate kraal for the cattle, constructed on the edge of the southern face of the ridge. Trenches and earth parapets surrounded both sections and a stone redoubt had been built on a rise just north of the kraal. A palisade blocked the between the kraal and redoubt, while four 7-pounder guns were positioned between the redoubt and the laager to cover the northern approaches. Two more guns in the redoubt covered the north-east. Two companies were sited in the redoubt; another company occupied the cattle kraal and the remaining infantry manned the laager. The gunners had been told that if the Zulus got in close they were to abandon their guns and make for the laager. Wood's force mustered 121 Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, 1,238 infantry and 638 mounted men. With headquarters staff, it totalled 2,000 men, of whom 88 were sick in hospital. Battle At on 29 March 1879, the tents were struck, reserve ammunition was distributed, and the troops took up their battle stations. As the troops moved to their posts they could see the Zulu right horn, circling north out of British artillery range before halting north-west of the camp. The left horn and centre of the impi continued westwards until they were due south of Kambula. At Lieutenant-Colonel Redvers Henry Buller was ordered with his mounted troops, to sting the right horn into premature attack. The men rode out to within range of the massed Zulus, fired a volley and raced back, closely followed by a great wave of 11,000 Zulu warriors shouting \\"Don't run away Johnnie! We want to speak to you\\". As soon as the horsemen had reached Kambula and cleared the field of fire, the British infantry opened fire with support from their four 7-pounders firing shell, which had been firing over the heads of the horsemen and then when the Zulus got closer, engaging them with case (canister shot). A small number of Zulus managed to burst into the laager and were repelled with bayonets, while the bulk of the advance was held at bay by the steady British volley fire and artillery. Some of the Zulu force swung right to come in against the western sides of the laager but was met with equally effective volley-fire. At about the Nkobamakosi of right horn drew back to the north-east. As the right horn made its withdrawal, the left horn and centre comprising the Umbonambi (uMbonambi), Nokene (uNokhenke) and the Umcityu advanced towards a ravine below the redoubt, then attacked from the ravine at about The leading warriors fell to volley fire from the 13th Light Infantry in the south face of the laager and the shrapnel and case shot from the four British guns in the laager and the two in the redoubt. More and more Zulu got into the ravine, about from the cattle kraal. About forty Zulu riflemen climbed to the lip of the ravine and two parties took over some huts to the east and the rubbish dump to the west, about either side of the camp. The fire of the Zulu riflemen from the three positions forced most of the infantry in the cattle kraal to retreat into the redoubt and the rest to shelter at the wagons to the rear. Zulu morale rose at the sight of the British retreat, the men in the ravine advanced on the cattle kraal, confronted only by fire from one side of the main laager and soon forced their way into the kraal, fighting hand-to-hand with men of the 1/13th Company. The cattle in the kraal hampered both sides but with Zulu pressure mounting, most of the British troops managed to extricate themselves and pull back to the redoubt, with four killed and seven wounded. Zulu riflemen were now able to open fire from behind the walls of the kraal to give covering fire for more Zulu advancing from the ravine. At about this time the right horn came on again from the north-east, charging across the north face of the redoubt towards the guns and the eastern sides of the laager. Although attacked on both sides, Wood appreciated that to the south, 5,000 Zulu could shelter in the cattle kraal, only away, well within charging distance. Wood ordered two companies of the 90th Light Infantry to retake the cattle kraal with a bayonet charge. Led by Major Hackett the men shifted a wagon from the north-east corner of the laager and formed line with bayonets fixed. The British charged across the open ground, forcing the Zulus back over the rim of the ravine. The troops then lined the crest and opened volley fire into the packed warriors. The counter-attack had succeeded perfectly but Hackett's men suddenly found themselves under fire from their right, when Zulu marksmen in the huts and rubbish dump on the left opened fire. Wood ordered the recall, Hackett sounded the 'Retire' and his men returned to the cover of the laager, losing a colour- sergeant, a subaltern and Hackett receiving a blinding head wound; forty-four men were killed or wounded. The Royal Artillery fought their guns in the open and poured round after round directly into the right horn and bombarded the huts with explosive shell and shrapnel to suppress the Zulu riflemen. The rubbish dump was on the other side of the laager and was struck by volley fire which stopped the Zulu reply. During this period the Umcityu massed in dead ground beyond the ravine and another wagon was pushed aside for a company of the 13th Light Infantry to sortie but the light infantry were forced back by the Zulu. The sight of this withdrawal encouraged the Zulus in the ravine to charge again but the gap in the defences was under the guns in the redoubt and on the ridge. At close range the gunners bombarded the Zulu infantry with case shot, creating a killing zone in front of the laager. The Uncityu was repulsed but rallied as Zulu all round the perimeter attacked continuously. The Nkobamakosi, who had been firing from the rocky area they had retreated to three hours earlier, attacked the redoubt again but were defeated by volley and artillery-fire from behind the wagons and the redoubt. The Zulus charged again and again, with unwavering courage but the head of each charge was shot away. More Zulu massed in the ravine but before their attack got going, two companies of the 13th Light Infantry ran to the edge of the ravine and shot down the Zulu below. At about the Zulu survivors began to retire. Pursuit As soon as the Zulus began to move eastwards Woods ordered Buller to pursue the Zulu with his 600 horse. The Zulu continued to jog-trot as the horsemen, in three columns, closed up and attacked were harried mercilessly towards Zunguin Nek, mounted troops firing one handed with carbines from the saddle, using their carbines as clubs and spearing them with discarded assegais. The abaQulusi, only recently arrived, ran with the rest of the Zulu force. Captain Cecil D'Arcy of the Frontier Light Horse (FLH) told his troopers to take no prisoners and told them, \\"no quarter boys and remember yesterday!\\" referring to the action at Hlobane, where his men had suffered severely. The FLH singled out the abaQulusi, chasing them as far as Hlobane and extracting a savage revenge for their comrades killed the day before. D'Arcy recalled that they, 'butchered the brutes [Zulus] all over the place' while Buller was, 'like a tiger drunk with blood'. Following the cavalry, the British infantry and African auxiliaries combed the field killing any wounded or hiding Zulus. Around 6:30 p.m. as dusk fell, a mist rose around the Zunguin mountains, stopping the pursuit. Aftermath=Analysis Kambula was the decisive battle of the war, in four hours the British fired and The British demonstrated that shield and assegai were no match for an entrenched force with artillery and the Martini-Henry rifle. Never again would an impi fight against a prepared position with the ferocity and resolution displayed at Kambula. The Zulu commander, Mnyamana, tried to get the regiments to return to Ulundi but many warriors simply went home and resumed raiding. A few days later, 400 men lifted thirty cattle and 1,500 sheep from the farm of the late Piet Uys. The shock of the defeat contributed to a weakening of the Zulu resolve to maintain armed resistance to the British invasion. In 1995, Ron Lock wrote that Commandant Schermbrucker had written that, and that the Zulu army never recovered from the bloodbath at Kambula. At Ulundi the Zulu fought another battle but without a belief in victory and the price for the British was the defeat at Hlobane the day before Kambula. The British never acknowledged the part played by the colonial horse soldiers. Four days later, about 11,000 Zulu were defeated at the Battle of Gingindlovu and the siege of Eshowe was raised. At the Battle of Ulundi the Zulu charged again and were routed by volley-fire, artillery and Gatling guns. Casualties A total of 785 Zulu dead were counted in the vicinity of the camp by burial parties two days after the battle, but their total losses were significantly higher. In 1992, John Laband wrote that Zulu losses are a matter of some debate. In 2003, Ian Knight wrote \\"785 [bodies] were collected from close by the camp. Many more lay out on the line of retreat where the slaughter had been heaviest... Perhaps as many as 2,000 died\\" and Frances Colenso (1880) wrote of 1,000 dead. Some of the dead had been carried away by friends or relatives but had to be abandoned during the pursuit. Many more warriors retreating from the battle were overtaken and killed by British mounted troops and furthermore, many wounded warriors died before they could reach home and help, the following day 157 bodies were counted along the line of retreat with reports of more in the distance. The official British estimation in the War Office narrative put the total Zulu losses of dead and wounded at 'nearly 2,000'. The Zulus thought that their casualties were at least as high or higher than those suffered at Isandlwana. The British suffered casualties of 18 British soldiers killed, 8 officers and 57 men wounded, 11 of whom later died. In 1995 Ron Lock wrote that the morning after the battle, an officer, James Francis, found 800 Zulu dead within an radius of the camp and that probably another 1,500 Zulu were killed along the line of the pursuit. A pit long and deep was dug to bury the Zulu dead; the British suffered 83 men killed or wounded.

It is essentially an indoor, stacked car park. Parking structures may be heated if they are enclosed. Design of parking structures can add considerable cost for planning new developments, and can be mandated by cities or states in new building parking requirements. Some cities such as London have abolished previously enacted minimum parking requirements.  History  A circa 1929 drawing shows a cross-section of a typical multi-story car park of that era, using the d'Humy Motoramp design. The earliest known multi-story car park was opened in May 1901 by City & Suburban Electric Carriage Company at 6 Denman Street, central London. The location had space for 100 vehicles over seven floors, totaling 19,000 square feet. The same company opened a second location in 1902 for 230 vehicles. The company specialized in the sale, storage, valeting and on-demand delivery of electric vehicles that could travel about 40 miles and had a top speed of 20 miles per hour. The earliest known parking garage in the United States was built in 1918 for the Hotel La Salle at 215 West Washington Street in the West Loop area of downtown Chicago, Illinois. It was designed by Holabird and Roche. The Hotel La Salle was demolished in 1976, but the parking structure remained because it had been designated as preliminary landmark status and the structure was several blocks from the hotel. It was demolished in 2005 after failing to receive landmark status from the city of Chicago.Preservation Chicago A 49-story apartment tower, 215 West, has taken its place, also featuring a parking garage. Design Basement parking A large, mostly enclosed multi-storey car park forms the base or \\"pedestal\\" of two connected high rises. At nearly 20 stories and over , it is an exceptionally large car park that comprises a significant portion of the building. The inside of a multi-storey car park Motorcycle parking inside a multi-storey car park The movement of vehicles between floors can take place by means of: * interior ramps ‚Äì the most common type * exterior ramps ‚Äì which may take the form of a circular ramp (colloquially known as a 'whirley-gig' in America) * vehicle lifts (or elevators) ‚Äì the least common * automated robot systems ‚Äì combination of ramp and elevator Where the car park is built on sloping land, it may be split-level or have sloped parking. Many car parks are independent buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often less than the office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55‚Äì60 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either prestressed concrete double-tee floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems. In recent times, car parks built to serve residential and some business properties have been built as part of a larger building, often underground as part of the basement, such as the parking lot at the Atlantic Station redevelopment in Atlanta. This saves land for other uses (as opposed to a car park), is cheaper and more practical in most cases than a separate structure, and is hidden from view. It protects customers and their cars from weather such as rain, snow, or hot summer sunshine that raises a vehicle's interior temperature to extremely high levels. Underground parking of only two levels was considered an innovative concept in 1964, when developer Louis Lesser developed a two-level underground parking structure under six 10-storey high-rise residential halls at California State University, Los Angeles, which lacked space for horizontal expansion in the university. The simple two-level parking structure was considered unusual enough in 1964 that a separate newspaper section entitled \\"Parking Underground\\" described the parking lot as an innovative \\"concept\\" and as \\"subterranean spaces\\".Los Angeles Times, 25 June 1963, \\"High Rise Developer Defends Loss of View to Convenience\\"Los Angeles Times, 15 March 1964, Tom Cameron, \\"$118 Million Going into Expansion at L.A. State\\" In Toronto, a 2,400 space parking lot below Nathan Phillips Square is one of the world's largest. Car parks which serve shopping centres can be built adjacent to the centre for easier access at each floor between shops and parking. One example is Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA, which has two large parking lots attached to the building, at the eastern and western ends. A common position for car parks within shopping centres in the UK is on the roof, around the various utility systems, enabling customers to take lifts straight down into the centre. Examples of such are The Oracle in Reading and Festival Place in Basingstoke. These car parks often have low ceiling clearances, which restrict access by full-size vans and other large vehicles. On 15 December 2013, a man was killed during a robbery in the parking garage at The Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, New Jersey. The paramedics responding to the shooting were delayed because their ambulance was too large to enter the structure. In the United States, costs for parking garages are estimated to cost between $25,000 per space, with underground parking costing around $35,000 per space. Structural integrity Shuttered construction site of multistorey car park nearly two years after partial structural failure Parking structures are subjected to the heavy and shifting loads of moving vehicles, and must bear the associated physical stresses. Expansion joints are used between sections not only for thermal expansion but to accommodate the flexing of the structure's sections due to vehicle traffic. Seismic retrofits can be applied where earthquakes are an issue. Some parking structures have partly collapsed, either during construction or years later. In July 2009 a fourth-floor section failed at the Centergy building in midtown Atlanta, pancaking down and destroying more than 30 vehicles but injuring no- one. In December 2007, a car crashed into the wall of the deck at the SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina, weakening it and causing a small collapse which destroyed two cars below. On the same day, one under construction in Jacksonville, Florida collapsed as concrete was being poured on the sixth floor. In November 2008, the sudden collapse of the middle level of a deck in Montreal was preceded by warning signs some weeks before, including cracks and water leaks. Parking structures are generally not subject to building inspections after being checked for their initial occupancy permit. In October 2012 four people were killed and nine more injured when a parking structure under construction at a campus of Miami-Dade College in Florida collapsed, purportedly due to an unfinished column. Precast parking structures Precast parking structure showing an interior column, girders and double-tee structural floors. The two gray circles are covers to close the lifting anchor holes. As multi-story car parks have become more common since the middle of the twentieth century, many constructions of such structures have been using precast concrete to reduce the construction time. The design involves putting parking structure parts together. The parts of precast concrete include multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, girders, wall panels, stairs and slabs. The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using precast concrete lifting anchor systems at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include using of covers to close the holes in the precast concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing facades to the exterior of the structures. In modern construction of the precast modules, there are other features to improve the strength of the structure. An example is to use prestressed strands on post-tensioned concrete for the construction of the shear walls. Another example is the use of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to replace steel wire mesh to lighten the load and yield more corrosion resistant especially for the cold-climate areas which use salt for melting snow. Architectural value The 1111 Lincoln Road parking garage These structures are not usually known for their architectural value. As Architectural Record has noted, \\"In the Pantheon of Building Types, the parking garage lurks somewhere in the vicinity of prisons and toll plazas.\\" The New York Times has labeled parking structures as \\"the grim afterthought of American design\\". A handful of structures have received considerable praise for their design, including *1111 Lincoln Road, in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, Florida and designed by the internationally known Swiss architectural firm of Herzog & de Meuron. *The Brutalist Preston bus station in the United Kingdom, which incorporates a multi-storey car park *Castle Terrace Car Park in Edinburgh, United Kingdom *In the United States, several have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including Boston's North Terminal Garage Nomenclature The term multistorey car park (often abbreviated to multistorey or multistory) is used in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and many Commonwealth of Nations countries, and it is nowadays most commonly spelled without a hyphen. In the western United States, the term parking structure is used, especially when it is necessary to distinguish such a structure from the \\"garage\\" connected with a house. In some places in North America, \\"parking garage\\" refers only to an indoor, often underground, structure. Outdoor, multi-level parking facilities are referred to by a number of regional terms: *Parking garage is used, to varying degrees, throughout the U.S. and Canada as well often referring to underground parking, and professionally by civil engineers; *Parking deck is used mostly in the Southern United States. *Parking ramp is used in the upper Midwest, especially Minnesota and Wisconsin, and has been observed as far east as Buffalo, New York. *Parkade is widely used in Western Canada and South Africa. *Parking building is used in New Zealand. Architects and civil engineers in the USA are likely to call it a parking structure since their work is all about structures and since that term is the vernacular in some of the western United States. When attached to a high-rise of another use, it is sometimes called a parking podium. United States building codes use the term open parking garage to refer to a structure designed for car storage that has openings along at least 40% of the perimeter, as opposed to an enclosed parking garage that requires mechanical ventilation.International Code Council. International Building Code 2012 (Second Printing) Natural or mechanical ventilation provides fresh air flow to disperse car exhaust in normal conditions, or hot gas and smoke in case of fire. Typically car park experts describe the number of car park floors in terms of \\"G+x\\". G stands for ground and x for the number of floors above ground. For example, G+5 is a multi-story car park structure with a ground floor and 5 floors above that, i.e. a total of 6 floors. Construction types * Concrete * Steel structure * Automated (mechanical) Steel structure Structure car parks are car parks made of structural steel components connected to each other to carry the loads and provide full structural rigidity. Steel is a high-strength material requiring less material than other types of structures like concrete and timber. Steel construction features: * Cost savings: inexpensive to manufacture and erect, and requires less maintenance than traditional building methods. * Speed: Allows construction/prefabrication off-site with rapid installation on-site. Some suppliers claim construction in days. * Durability: Suppliers claim 50-plus years lifespan. * Removability: Steel car park structure could be designed to be removed at a later date. * Expandability: Steel car park structures can be expanded easily at a later date. * Creativity: Steel allows for long column- free spans. The ceiling slab of the steel structure car park is typically made of composite material such as corrugated steel sheets and concrete. The surface of the first-floor parking can be left bare or covered with epoxy or tarmac. Foundationless and modular Demand, steel features, and innovation have led to the development of a foundationless, modular, removable steel car park structure. Parking demand often grows quickly, significantly and sometimes unexpectedly. Modular steel car parks could be the proper solution if the surface area available is not sufficient and can be expanded upwards, or whenever it is not feasible to build up a multi-story parking. The development of the building concept of modular car parks came about by using the modular assembling method of vertical and horizontal elements (such as columns and beams) Modular car park structures are versatile and can be built in phases or in different sizes and shape. The solution makes it possible to develop a parking structure even in case of particular conditions or constraints, such as archaeological sites or city centres, because it allows: * To virtually double the parking surface without leaving any footprint on the ground, as no settlement for excavations or traditional foundations is needed; * To double the parking surface by means of a light steel single-deck car park system. * Prefab modular components of the system make each project versatile and suitable for both large and small sized areas. These parking structures are generally demountable and can be relocated to avoid making the choice of converting a surface to parking area irrevocably. They could be used as permanent structures or are conceived as temporary parking facilities for temporary parking demand needs. A number of parking decks have been demounted after a few years ‚Äì to make room for the development of a permanent structure ‚Äì and relocated to respond to local parking demand. Automated parking Automatic underground car storage in Thessaloniki, Greece The earliest use of an automated parking system (APS) was in Paris in 1905 at the Garage Rue de Ponthieu.Sanders McDonald, Shannon.\\"Cars, Parking and Sustainability\\" , The Transportation Research Forum http://www.trforum.org/.Retrieved on 16 October 2012. The APS consisted of a groundbreaking multi-story concrete structure with an internal elevator to transport cars to upper levels where attendants parked the cars. A 1931 Popular Mechanics article speculated about design for an underground garage where the car is taken to a parking area by a conveyor then an elevator to shuttles mounted on rails.\\"Underground Garage to End Parking Problem\\", February 1931, Popular Mechanics The total cost of ownership of automated parking needs to be carefully considered. The actual cost of construction of automated car parks is typically higher than conventional car park structures, however, this can be offset by the higher space efficiency. The cost of the mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs to be added to the building cost. In addition, operation and maintenance costs of the mechanical equipment need to be added in order to determine the total cost of ownership. Other costs could be saved, for example, there is no need for an energy-intensive ventilating system, since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed. For naturally ventilated car parks structures, the ventilation equipment is not needed. Automated car parks rely on similar technology to that used for mechanical handling and document retrieval. The driver leaves the car in an entrance module, and it is then transported to a parking slot by a robotic trolley. For the driver, the process of parking is reduced to leaving the car inside an entrance module. At peak periods a wait may occur before entering or leaving, because loading passengers and luggage occurs at the entrance and exit rather than at the parking stall. This loading blocks the entrance or exit from being available to others. It is generally not recommended to use automated car parks for high peak hour volume facilities. Additional factors that need to be taken into consideration are: * Fear of breakdowns (How does the user get the car back) * Maintenance contracts needed with suppliers  Other technologies Ultrasonic sensors above each lot in this indoor car park determine if a car has already taken the lot and indicate using LEDs; and some can send a Bluetooth/SMS message with the parking space number or code. Modern car parks utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, car location when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience. This includes adaptive lighting, sensors and parking space LED indicators (red for occupied, green for available and blue is reserved for the disabled; above every parking space), indoor positioning system (IPS), including QR code, and mobile payment options. The Santa Monica Place shopping mall in California has cameras on each stall that can help count the lot occupancy and find lost cars.\\"Servant or snoop in the parking garage?\\" Los Angeles Times Online booking technology service providers have been created to helped drivers find long-term parking in an automated manner, while also providing significant savings for those who book parking spaces ahead of time. They use real-time inventory management checking technology to display car parks with availability, sorted by price and distance from the airport.  Multistorey parking ship  P-Arken as seen from water P-Arken as seen from land In 1991, a 1975 marine vessel was transformed into a floating pontoon multi-storey car parking facility. The ship was given the new name P-Arken (a pun on the words park and ark) and it is permanently towed in Gothenburgs harbour Lilla Bommen near Skeppsbron. In November 2019, a fully- clad parking barge for automobiles was patented in the United States. Its angular sides are designed to protect against driving wind, rain, and debris.  Education & research  In October 2009, the National Building Museum opened an exhibition solely devoted to the study of 'parking garages' and their impact on the built environment. This exhibition, titled House of Cars: Innovation and the Parking Garage, was on view until 11 July 2010.

The Monastery of Santa Catalina de Siena is a monastery of nuns of the Dominican Second Order, located in Arequipa, Peru. History The foundress of the monastery was a rich widow, Maria de Guzman. The tradition of the time indicated that the second son or daughter of a family would enter a life of service in the Church, and the monastery accepted only women from upper class Spanish families. Each family paid a dowry at their daughter's admission to the monastery. The dowry expected of a woman who wished to enter as a choir nun‚Äîindicated by wearing a black veil‚Äîand who thereby accepted the duty of the daily recitation of the Divine Office, was 2,400 silver coins, equivalent to about $150,000 (U.S.) today. The nuns were also required to bring 25 listed items, including a statue, a painting, a lamp and clothes. The wealthiest nuns may have brought fine English china and silk curtains and rugs. Although it was possible for poorer nuns to enter the convent without paying a dowry, it can be seen from the cells that most of the nuns were very wealthy. In 1871, Sister Josefa Cadena, O.P., a strict Dominican nun, was sent by Pope Pius IX to reform the monastery. She sent the rich dowries back to Europe, and freed all the servants and slaves, giving them the choice of either remaining as nuns or leaving. In addition to the stories of outrageous wealth, there are tales of nuns becoming pregnant, and amazingly of the skeleton of a baby being discovered encased in a wall. This, in fact, did not happen in Santa Catalina, and there are rumors of the same story in the nearby Santa Rosa monastery, as well. At its height, the monastery housed approximately 450 people (about a third of them nuns and the rest servants) in a cloistered community. In the 1960s, it was struck twice by earthquakes, severely damaging the structures, and forcing the nuns to build new accommodation next door. It was then restored in stages by groups including Promociones Turisticas del Sur S.A. and World Monuments Fund and opened to the public. This also helped pay for the installation of electricity and running water, as required by law. Image:Alley Monastery Santa Catalina Arequipa Peru.jpgOne of the many alleys within the monastery.

Lines of reflections are blue. Gyrations are given as numbers in the center. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. The regular pentadecagon has Dih15 dihedral symmetry, order 30, represented by 15 lines of reflection. Dih15 has 3 dihedral subgroups: Dih5, Dih3, and Dih1. And four more cyclic symmetries: Z15, Z5, Z3, and Z1, with Zn representing œÄ/n radian rotational symmetry. On the pentadecagon, there are 8 distinct symmetries. John Conway labels these symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, (2008) The Symmetries of Things, (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278) He gives r30 for the full reflective symmetry, Dih15. He gives d (diagonal) with reflection lines through vertices, p with reflection lines through edges (perpendicular), and for the odd-sided pentadecagon i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for cyclic symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry. These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedoms in defining irregular pentadecagons. Only the g15 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges. Pentadecagrams There are three regular star polygons: {15/2}, {15/4}, {15/7}, constructed from the same 15 vertices of a regular pentadecagon, but connected by skipping every second, fourth, or seventh vertex respectively. There are also three regular star figures: {15/3}, {15/5}, {15/6}, the first being a compound of three pentagons, the second a compound of five equilateral triangles, and the third a compound of three pentagrams. The compound figure {15/3} can be loosely seen as the two-dimensional equivalent of the 3D compound of five tetrahedra. { class=wikitable width=360 - align=center valign=top !

It peaked at #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #4 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and has been included on several compilation albums, such as Retrospective II and The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974-1987. The lyrics, written by drummer Neil Peart, reflect on the power of \\"big money\\" and the sheer magnitude of trade in the modern global economy, particularly during the 1980s. When asked about the idea that the song's lyrics were inspired by a John Dos Passos book of the same name, Peart replied, \\"I am a big fan of Dos Passos' stylistic ability, his poetic approach to prose, but the ideas presented in the songs are quite different from those which he exemplified.\\" Peart also stated that \\"the only connection is in the titles\\". Music video The video for the track was directed by Rob Quartly, produced by Allan Weinrib (Geddy Lee's brother), and created by Green Light Productions, using, for the time, state-of-the-art computer graphics similar to those seen in the video for the song \\"Money for Nothing\\" by Dire Straits. The video also features the band performing the song on an oversized Monopoly- style game board with the words \\"Big Money\\" in the middle. A full-length version of the video was included on the VHS and laserdisc releases of Rush's Grace Under Pressure tour concert film, while an edited version was released to MTV and other outlets, as well as on the short-lived CD Video format, directed by Weinrib. The car featured in the animated intro has a license plate that reads \\"Mr. Big\\", a reference to producer Peter Collins, who produced Power Windows. Neill Cunningham, the album cover model for Power Windows, also appears in the video. Live performances When performed live, many of the synthesizers and sound effects heard in the original track are triggered through pedals used by Lee and Alex Lifeson, plus Peart's electronic drum pads. The song was first performed live during the Power Windows Tour and was the show opener on the Hold Your Fire Tour (as heard on the 1989 live album A Show of Hands). The song would be performed during most of Rush's later tours, including the Roll the Bones Tour, the Test for Echo Tour, the Vapor Trails Tour (documented on the 2003 album Rush in Rio), and most recently, the Clockwork Angels Tour (documented on the 2013 album of the same name).

It is located at the junction of the Barwon and Moorabool rivers. At the 2016 Census, Fyansford had a population of 196. Fyansford is one of the earliest places of settlement in the Geelong region. Fyans established his police camp nearby where the Moorabool could be forded‚Äîgiving the name Fyan's Ford.City of Greater Geelong: Fyansford Industry The area was once a centre for Geelong industry. In 1845 the first flour mill was erected by William Henry Collins on the banks of the Barwon.Geelong Timeline 1802 - 1910 By 1859 the population was sufficient to justify a Post Office which opened on 1 February 1859 (closing in 1978). The Barwon Paper Mill opened at nearby Buckley Falls in 1876. In 1895 mill became part of the Australian Paper Mills company, the predecessor of Amcor Limited. Cement production began at Fyansford in 1890 led by Peter McCann, but it was not until 1911 that a modern rotary kiln was installed. The original Australian Portland Cement company plant was located at the foot of the Fyansford hill between Deviation Road and Hyland Street. In 1918 a railway line was extended from the North Geelong railway station to the top of the hill above Fyansford, and in 1926 the narrow gauge Fyansford Cement Works Railway was opened to serve a new quarry,The Fyansford Quarry Railway Buckland, John Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June, 1951, pp81-82 and the works themselves expanded across Hyland Street, which became the main production site, Geelong Cement, in later years. The cement works were later acquired by Adelaide Brighton Cement, and were closed in 2001.Adelaide Brighton Ltd Summary Report: December 2000 Transport The Hamilton Highway runs through the town. The first river crossing at Fyansford was a ford, with the first wooden bridge built downriver by the Corio and Bannockburn Shire councils in 1854, and was tolled until 1877. It was in poor condition by 1898, with load restrictions being put into place. A new bridge was built nearby in 1900 by John Monash and J. T. N. Anderson, the three-arch bridge being the largest Monier reinforced concrete bridge in the world at the time.John, McNeil (1990) A Journey to Destiny 1890-1990 100 Years of Cement Manufacturing at Fyansford by Australian Cement Limited In 1970 a new bridge was built on the site of the old wooden bridge to cater for heavier traffic on the Hamilton Highway, the 1900 bridge retained for pedestrians. High Street (now Hyland Street) was one of the first sealed roads in the area in 1933, the road being relaid in concrete in 1937. Deviation Road was built between 1931‚Äì32 with unemployment labour during the Great Depression and opened in 1933. Cut into the hillside, the surface was originally of concrete construction. The road opened 54 years after the first petition by Fyansford residents for such a road.

The American Renaissance and the Critics. Wakefield: Longwood Academic. . A central term in American studies, the American Renaissance was for a while considered synonymous with American RomanticismKnight, Denise D. Writers of the American Renaissance: An A-to-Z Guide. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2003: XI. and was closely associated with Transcendentalism. Overview Scholar F. O. Matthiessen originated the phrase \\"American Renaissance\\" in his 1941 book American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman. The thematic center of the American Renaissance was what Matthiessen called the \\"devotion\\" of all five of his writers to \\"the possibilities of democracy\\". He presented the American Renaissance texts as \\"literature for our democracy‚Äù and challenged the nation to repossess them.Lauter, Paul. A Companion to American Literature and Culture. Chichester; Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010: 68 Often considered a movement centered in New England, the American Renaissance was inspired in part by a new focus on humanism as a way to move from Calvinism.Howe, Daniel Walker. What Hath God Wrought? The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007: 615. Literary nationalists at this time were calling for a movement that would develop a unique American literary style to distinguish American literature from British literature. Walter Channing in a November 1815 issue of the North American Review called for the people to form \\"a literature of our own\\", which was later echoed by other literary critics. Following this call, there was a wave of literary nationalism in America for much of the 1820s that saw writers such as Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, and James Fenimore Cooper rise to importance in American literature. This move toward expressing nationalism through literature is considered central to the emergence of the American Renaissance. Criticisms  There are many criticisms associated with the American Renaissance, and some critics question if it ever actually took place. One of the most prominent criticisms is that authors during this period are seen as simply taking styles and ideas from past movements and culture and reforming them into new, contemporary works. Some critics say that authors fail to address major political issues during this period, such as slavery, even as they had large influence on the writing of the time. There is also criticism that women authors and women's issues were generally left out of discussion and publication. The notion of an American Renaissance has been criticized for overemphasizing a small number of white male writers and artifacts of high culture.Buell, Lawrence. Emerson. Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2003: 145. William E. Cain noted the \\"extreme white male formation\\" of Matthiessen's list of authors and stated that by \\"devoting hundreds of pages of analysis and celebration to five white male authors, Matthiessen unwittingly prefigured in his book what later readers would dispute and labor to correct.\\"Cain, William E. F.O. Matthiessen and the Politics of Criticism. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1988: 168. Some critics argue that literature written by women during this period was not as popular as first thought, and that it took a distant second place in popularity to works written by men. Matthiessen and other scholars are even known to exclude women and minority authors, especially African Americans. Critics also argue that there is no separate style or genre, such as sentimental-domestic fiction, distinguished by gender. However, other critics point out that the most read authors of the time were women, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and Fanny Fern, and criticize Matthiessen for not including women in the original canon. The demographic exclusivity of the American Renaissance began eroding among scholars toward the end of the twentieth century. They have included Emily Dickinson in the canon; she started writing poetry in the late 1850s. Harriet Beecher Stowe‚Äôs Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin (1852) rose to a prominent reputation in the late 1970s. African-American literature, including slave narratives by such masters as Frederick Douglass, and early novels by William Wells Brown, has gained increasing recognition.Jarrett, Gene Andrew. A Companion to African American Literature. Chichester, U.K.; Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010: 103. Notable authors Most often associated with the American Renaissance movement are Ralph Waldo Emerson's Representative Men and Self-Reliance, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and The House of Seven Gables, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Henry David Thoreau's Walden, and Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. Most of the main writers associated with the American Renaissance were actually rather unknown during this time and had small followings. Other authors were later added to this list and found to have contributed to this movement. These include: Edgar Allan Poe, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and John Greenleaf Whittier among others.

It is not a book in the traditional sense, but more a collection of things to do, such as pat the fake fur of a rabbit on one page, feel a bit of sandpaper that stands for \\"daddy's scratchy face\\" on another, and look in a mirror on yet another. It was written and illustrated by Dorothy Kunhardt, who was a successful children's author when she created Pat the Bunny for her 3-year-old daughter, Edith. It was partly an experiment in using interactive elements in a book, which was unusual at the time. Reception and legacy Since its publication, Pat the Bunny has sold over 6 million copies, making it the number-6 all-time bestselling children's hardcover book, according to Publishers Weekly. Edith Kunhardt wrote three companions: Pat the Cat in 1984, Pat the Puppy in 1991, and Pat the Pony in 1997. The publisher, Random House, has developed an entire line of related products, and the company DIC in 2000 discussed creating a TV series based on the book. The book continues to be popular, appearing as eleventh best selling children's illustrated book for the week of June 15, 2006. Golden Press makes more than a quarter million copies a year. The book was endorsed by experts in child development for its \\"developmental features\\" and \\"sensory approach\\". In August 2004, Classic Media and Evergreen Concepts partnered to help promote the Pat the Bunny brand. On March 4, 2008, a DVD of the book was released with interactive materials included and an interview with Jean Kunhardt, the author's granddaughter. In 2011, Random House Children's Books released a \\"\\"pat the bunny\\"\\" app, inspired by the original book, for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch which received critical acclaim.\\"Review of Pat the Bunny by Random House Digital, Inc. on Appysmarts.com\\" There have been parodies of the book also, such as Pat the Politician, mocking contemporary political figures, and Pat the Yuppie, which includes activities like touching the sheepskin seatcovers of their new BMW and rubbing the exposed brick of their new condominium's wall. The proceeds from Pat the Bunny support I Am Your Child, a national public awareness campaign created by the Reiner Foundation to stress the importance of early brain development.

The founding members are Jim Weber, Eric Davidson, Bill Randt, and Matt Reber. Sam Brown replaced Bill Randt on drums in 1999. Early on their inspiration came from the Devil Dogs, Lazy Cowgirls, Union Carbide Productions, Didjits, and the Fluid. Music magazine Alternative Press has described their musical style, saying, \\"Not only have both prole-threat punk bashery and destructo-rock found fresh voices, they've been melded into a seamless new terror all its own.\\" The New Bomb Turks have released ten full-length LPs, two EPs, and over twenty singles, some of which contain songs not available elsewhere. Their early recordings appear on the Datapanik, Sympathy For The Record Industry, Get Hip and Bag of Hammers labels. Crypt Records signed the band and released !!Destroy-Oh-Boy!!, Information Highway Revisited, and Pissing Out The Poison. Then Epitaph Records signed them and released LPs Scared Straight, At Rope's End and Nightmare Scenario. Gearhead Records released their next album, The Night Before the Day the Earth Stood Still. The band also released three b-side and outtakes compilations: Pissing Out the Poison, The Big Combo, and Switchblade Tongues & Butterknife Brains. As of 2005, the New Bomb Turks have slowed down their touring and recording in order to pursue other interests. Guitarist Jim Weber, for example, is now a 10th and 11th grade English teacher at Hilliard Davidson High School while Eric Davidson is also the singer in Livids since forming the band with others in Brooklyn, New York, in early 2011. The band's name refers to the main character (Newbomb Turk) in the 1980 film The Hollywood Knights, played by Robert Wuhl.

First published in 1941, the book tells the story of a pair of mallards who decide to raise their family on an island in the lagoon in Boston Public Garden, a park in the center of Boston. Make Way for Ducklings won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for McCloskey's illustrations, executed in charcoal then lithographed on zinc plates. As of 2003, the book had sold over two million copies. The book's popularity led to the construction of a statue by Nancy Sch√∂n in the Public Garden of the mother duck and her eight ducklings, which is a popular destination for children and adults alike. In 1991, Barbara Bush gave a duplicate of this sculpture to Raisa Gorbachev as part of the START Treaty, and the work is displayed in Moscow's Novodevichy Park. The book is the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Praise for the book is still high over 70 years since its first publication, mainly for the enhancing illustrations and effective pacing. However, it has been criticized for having a loose plot. The book is popular worldwide.  Background  Make Way for Ducklings, published in 1941, was McCloskey's second book and was the winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained his motivation for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.  Plot  The route Mrs. Mallard takes from the Charles River to the Public Garden. Click on image for detail. The White House 2003 Christmas decoration using Make Way for Ducklings as the theme The story begins as two ducks (Mr. and Mrs. Mallard) fly over various potential locations in New England to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by the people on the boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day. Shortly thereafter, the Mallards molt, and will not be able to fly until their new feathers grow again, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what the rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as bicycles and other wheeled objects. One week later, Mrs. Mallard leads the ducklings ashore and straight to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive had yet to be constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic to make way for the ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep. Illustrations Illustrated with sepia drawings rather than the traditional black-and-white pictures found in most children's books of the day, the book, which received the 1942 Caldecott Medal for its illustrations, has continued to garner praise years after its first publishing. The drawings of Boston represent a duck's eye view of the city. Each of the individual ducklings is \\"bored, inquisitive, sleepy, or they are scratching, talking over their backs one to another, running to catch up with the line\\". Children identify with the ducklings because they behave as children do. The comforting message shows parents as caretakers, protectors, and teachers. According to fellow Caldecott winner Paul O. Zelinsky, \\"I realized that if the action in the drawings were to move from left to right, the ducks could not have been shown passing the Corner Book Shop, which is a wonderful detail in the story ... He clearly knew these streets very well.\\" \\"'Robert McCloskey's unusual and stunning pictures have long been a delight for their fun as well as their spirit of place.'-- The Horn Book\\"  Reaction  Make Way for Ducklings received the 1942 Caldecott Medal for its illustrations.  Sales  Make Way for Ducklings has been continuously in print since it was first published. As of 2003, the book had sold over two million copies. In September 2006 the hardcover edition of the book ranked #2,182 in sales at Amazon.com and #1,838 in sales at Barnes & Noble. The story has also been published in paperback and audiobook. When it was first released in 1941, Ellen Buell of The New York Times called the book \\"one of the merriest we have had in a long time\\", praising the understated comedic aspect of the procession down Beacon Street, as well as McCloskey's \\"fine large pictures\\" which simultaneously demonstrate \\"economy of line\\" and \\"wealth of detail\\". Viking publishing planned to release a 75th-anniversary edition of the classic in March 2016.Lodge, Sally. \\"Viking Makes Way for the 75th Anniversary of 'Ducklings'\\", Publishers Weekly, March 17, 2016  Critical commentary  One critic, Alice Fannin, says the \\"loosely plotted\\" story gives no true explanation for why Mr. Mallard leaves the island in the Charles River or why the Mallards did not simply stay on the lagoon island in the first place and avoid the bicyclists on the shore. However, McCloskey has stated himself that he thinks of himself as an artist who writes children's books and not vice versa. Fannin also finds the characterization lacking, that is, the Mallards represent \\"rather stereotypically concerned parents\\", often showing the same facial expressions and rarely showing expressiveness. Another critic has positively commented on McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique. McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces the reader to quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem to have found a home on page eleven. > 'Good,' said Mr. Mallard, delighted that at last Mrs. Mallard had found a > place that suited her. But ‚Äî (p. 11) Then, they encounter a sudden problem with the chosen location when Mrs. Mallard is nearly run over by a bicyclist on page thirteen.  Gender roles  Make Way for Ducklings was published in the 1940s. Many books of the time portray a male dominated society, a trend which Make Way for Ducklings does not follow. In context, the story takes place during wartime as fathers were being drafted and sent to Europe, requiring more social support for single parent families. McCloskey presented Mrs. Mallard as an \\"independent and nonsubmissive female character.\\" This strong portrayal has led one critic to label the book as \\"pre-feminist.\\" Surveys Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed Make Way for Ducklings as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" In 2012 it was ranked number six among the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" in a survey published by School Library Journal.  Cultural effects  bronze statue of the ducklings by Nancy Sch√∂n is a popular attraction in Boston Public Garden. A replica installed in Moscow was a gift from United States First Lady Barbara Bush to Soviet First Lady Raisa Gorbachev. The city of Boston, the setting of the book, has whole-heartedly embraced the story. In the Public Garden, where the Mallards eventually settled, a bronze statue has been erected of Mrs. Mallard and her eight ducklings. Since 1978, the city has hosted an annual Duckling Day parade each spring, with children and their parents dressed as ducklings. Part of the route retraces the path taken by Mrs. Mallard and her ducklings to get to the Public Garden. In 2000, schoolchildren from Canton, Massachusetts decided that the book was worthy of being the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and went to their state legislature to get a bill passed declaring it so. However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book. A statue similar to the one in the Boston Public Garden was erected in Novodevichy Park in Moscow as part of the START Treaty by Acton, Massachusetts landscape and construction company Capizzi & Co. Inc. on July 30, 1991. The individual statues were presented by United States First Lady Barbara Bush to Russian First Lady Raisa Gorbachev as a gift to the children of the Soviet Union.

Harding (born 1935) is an American philosopher of feminist and postcolonial theory, epistemology, research methodology, and philosophy of science. She taught for two decades at the University of Delaware before moving to the University of California, Los Angeles in 1996. She directed the UCLA Center for the Study of Women from 1996 to 2000, and co-edited Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society from 2000 to 2005. She is currently a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education and Gender Studies at UCLA and a Distinguished Affiliate Professor of Philosophy at Michigan State University. In 2013 she was awarded the John Desmond Bernal Prize by the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S). (Earlier recipients of this prize include Robert Merton, Thomas S. Kuhn, Mary Douglas, and Joseph Needham.) She has developed the research standard of ‚Äústrong objectivity,‚Äù and contributed to the articulation of standpoint methodology. This kind of research process starts off from questions that arise in the daily lives of people in oppressed groups. To answer such questions, it ‚Äústudies up‚Äù, examining the principles, practices and cultures of dominant institutions, from the design and management of which oppressed groups have been excluded. She has also contributed to the development of feminist, anti-racist, multicultural, and postcolonial studies of the natural and social sciences, asking the extent to which paradigms like feminist empiricism are useful for promoting to goals of feminist inquiry. She is the author or editor of many books and essays on these topics, and was one of the founders of the field of feminist epistemology. This work has been influential in the social sciences and in women/gender studies across the disciplines. It has helped to create new kinds of discussions about how best to relink scientific research to pro-democratic goals. She has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Amsterdam, the University of Costa Rica, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and the Asian Institute of Technology. She has been a consult to several United Nations organizations including the Pan American Health Organization, UNESCO, the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development, and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. Phi Beta Kappa selected her as a national lecturer in 2007. She has lectured at over 300 colleges, universities, and conferences, on five continents. During what is known now as the \\"Science Wars\\", she was part of a debate regarding the value-neutrality of the sciences. This aspect of her work has been criticized by the mathematicians Michael Sullivan,Sullivan, M.C. (1996) A Mathematician Reads Social Text, AMS Notices 43(10), 1127-1131. Mary Gray,Mary Gray, \\"Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny,\\" in Gila Hanna, ed., Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996. and Lenore Blum,Lenore Blum, \\"AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives,\\" in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M.

Education and career  Sandra Harding received her undergraduate degree from Douglass College of Rutgers University in 1956. After 12 years working as legal researcher, editor, and fifth-grade math teacher in New York City and Poughkeepsie, N.Y., she returned to graduate school and earned a doctorate from the Department of Philosophy at New York University in 1973. Her first university teaching job was at The Allen Center of the State University of New York at Albany, an experimental critical social sciences college which was ‚Äúdefunded‚Äù by the state of New York in 1976. She then joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Delaware, with a joint appointment to the Women's Studies Program. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1979, and to full Professor in 1986. From 1981 until she left Delaware in 1996, she held a Joint Appointment to the Department of Sociology. She was Director of the Women's Studies Program at Delaware 1985-91 and 1992-93. From 1994 to 1996 she was Adjunct Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at UCLA on a half-time basis. In 1996 she was appointed Director of the UCLA Center for the Study of Women, which is a research institute. She held that position until 2000. Meanwhile, since 1996 she has been a Professor in the Graduate Department of Education and the Department of Gender Studies at UCLA. In 2012 she was appointed Distinguished Professor of Education and Gender Studies. From 2000 to 2005 she also was co-editor of Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. She has held Visiting Professor appointments at the University of Amsterdam (1987), University of Costa Rica (1990), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH) (1987), and the Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok (1994). In 2011 she was appointed a Distinguished Affiliate Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Michigan State University, East Lansing. She has been a consultant to several United Nations organizations including the U.N. Commission on Science and Technology for Development, the Pan American Health Organization, UNESCO, and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. She was invited to co-edit a chapter of UNESCO's World Science Report 1996 on ‚ÄúThe Gender Dimension of Science and Technology:‚Äù This 56 page account was the first such attempt to bring gender issues in science and technology to such a global-scale and prestigious context. She was invited to contribute a chapter to UNESCO's World Social Science Report 2010 on ‚ÄúStandpoint Methodologies and Epistemologies: a Logic of Scientific Inquiry for People.‚Äù She has served on the editorial boards of numerous journals in the fields of philosophy, women's studies, science studies, social research methodology, and African philosophy. She has lectured at more than 300 colleges, universities, and conferences in North America as well as in Central America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Her books, essays and book chapters have been translated into dozens of languages and reprinted in hundreds of anthologies. In her 1986 book The Science Question in Feminism, Harding questioned why‚Äîbased on the pervasiveness of rape and torture metaphors for the scientific method in the writings of Francis Bacon and others‚ÄîNewton's laws could not be referred to as \\"Newton's rape manual\\" rather than \\"Newtonian mechanics\\". Harding later said she regretted the statement.Nemecek, S. (1997) The Furor Over Feminist Science, Scientific American 276(1), 99-100. This statement, among others, have caused Harding's work to be controversial within scholarly circles. During the ‚ÄúScience Wars‚Äù of the 1990s, her work became a main target of criticisms of feminist and sociological approaches to understanding how the natural sciences and their particular historical surrounding social orders (pro- and anti- democratic) have provided intellectual and political resources for each other. Her essay on ‚ÄúScience is ‚ÄòGood to Think With‚Äô‚Äù[Harding, Sandra. ‚ÄúScience is ‚ÄòGood to Think With‚Äô‚Äù in The Science Wars, ed. Andrew Ross.

Background and education The member of an old Lincolnshire family, Chaplin was born at Ryhall, Rutland, the second son of the Reverend Henry Chaplin, of Blankney, Lincolnshire, and his wife Carolina Horatia Ellice, daughter of William Ellice. His younger brother, Edward Chaplin, was also a politician. Chaplin was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a friend of the Prince of Wales. At the age of 21, he inherited substantial estates in Lincolnshire (including the family seat of Blankney Hall), Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. He was a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, and a leading member of the Turf.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/10800 Engagement to Lady Florence Paget Lady Florence Paget by Camille Silvy In 1864 Chaplin fell in love with and became engaged to Lady Florence, daughter of Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey and a celebrated beauty. The wedding was to be the society event of the year with the Prince of Wales one of many to offer his congratulations. However, during their engagement Florence had secretly fallen in love with Henry Rawdon-Hastings, 4th Marquess of Hastings. Just before her wedding, she had Chaplin take her to Marshall & Snelgrove's on Oxford Street to add to her wedding outfit. While Chaplin waited in the carriage outside, Florence walked straight through the shop and out to the other side, where Hastings waited for her in a carriage. Hastings and Florence were married on the same day. After the wedding, a reception was held in St James' Place before the newly married couple set off for their honeymoon at Donington Hall, Leicestershire whilst the scandal died down. Florence Paget informed Chaplin by letter the next day.Engagement to Lady Florence Paget at macla.co.uk In the 1867 Derby, Chaplin renewed his rivalry with Lord Hastings. Hastings wagered thousands of pounds against Chaplin's horse, Hermit.Thoroughbred Heritage ‚Äì Hermit Ten days before the race Hermit was injured and Chaplin was advised not to enter him. However, the injury was not as serious as first thought, and though not fully fit, Hermit entered the race and won it. Lord Hastings lost heavily and fell into severe debts. Adding to a drinking problem, Chaplin's great rival died in poverty the following year, aged 26.The 1867 Derby at macla.co.uk Political career Henry Chaplin by Arthur Stockdale Cope Chaplin first entered parliament at the 1868 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid-Lincolnshire. He represented this constituency until it was replaced under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In the 1885 general election he was returned to parliament for the new Sleaford division which he held until his defeat at the 1906 general election. Chaplin was sworn of the Privy Council in 1885 and filled the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Lord Salisbury's short ministry of 1885 to 1886. He became the first President of the Board of Agriculture in 1889, with a seat in the cabinet, and retained this post till 1892. In the Conservative cabinet of 1895 to 1900 he was President of the Local Government Board, and was responsible for the Agricultural Rates Act 1896. However, he was not included in the ministry after its reconstruction in 1900. Chaplin had always been an advocate of protectionism, being in this respect the most prominent inheritor of the views of Lord George Bentinck; and when in 1903 the tariff reform movement began under Chamberlain's leadership, he gave it his enthusiastic support, becoming a member of the Tariff Commission and one of the most strenuous advocates in the country of the new doctrines in opposition to free trade. After losing his seat at Sleaford in 1906, Chaplin was returned to the House of Commons at a by-election in May 1907 as member for Wimbledon. He held the seat until 1916, when he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Chaplin, of Saint Oswald's, Blankney, in the County of Lincoln. Agriculture Punch cartoon accompanying a satirical article on his receiving a deputation on the subject of the swine fever.Punch Vol. 102, 13 February 1892. Known as the \\"Squire of Blankney\\", Chaplin took an active interest in agricultural questions, as a popular and typical representative of the English \\"country gentleman\\" class. However, mounting debts forced him to sell the family seat of Blankney Hall to Lord Londesborough in 1887. Family In 1876 Chaplin married Lady Florence, daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 3rd Duke of Sutherland. They had one son, Eric, and two daughters, Edith and Florence. Lady Florence died in childbirth in 1881, giving birth to her youngest daughter, Florence. Lord Chaplin remained a widower until his death in May 1923, aged 82. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his son, Eric. Chaplin and Lady Florence's eldest daughter, the Hon. Edith, married Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry, and became a well-known society hostess. In 1926 she wrote a 400-page memoir of him.

Written intermittently between 1855 and 1876 while Hugo worked in exile on numerous other projects, the poems were published in three series in 1859, 1877, and 1883. Bearing witness to the unparalleled poetic talent evident in all Hugo's art, the L√©gende des Si√®cles is often considered the only true French epic and, according to Baudelaire's formulation, the only modern epic possible. The dreaming poet contemplates the \\"wall of the centuries,\\" indistinct and terrible, on which scenes of the past, present and future are drawn, and along which the whole long procession of humanity can be seen. The poems are depictions of these scenes, fleetingly perceived and interspersed with terrifying visions. Hugo sought neither historical accuracy nor exhaustiveness; rather, he concentrated on obscure figures, usually his own inventions, who incarnated and symbolized their eras. As he proclaims in the preface to the first series, \\"this is history, eavesdropped upon at the door of legend.\\" The poems, by turns lyrical, epic and satirical, form a view of the human experience, seeking less to summarize than to illustrate the history of humanity, and to bear witness to its long journey from the darkness into the light.  Origin  La L√©gende des Si√®cles was not originally conceived as the vast work it was to become. Its beginning, the original seed, was in a vague project entitled Petites Epop√©es (\\"Little Epics\\"), which features in the notes and jottings of Hugo from 1848, and which gives no indication of so vast an ambition. After Les Ch√¢timents and Les Contemplations, his editor, Hetzel, was perturbed by the submission of La Fin de Satan and Dieu, both of which were nearly complete. Seeing that Hugo was ready to proceed yet further down the metaphysical (or even eschatological) road mapped out by the final Contemplations, Hetzel became anxious at the probability of their failure with the public, and preferred the sound of the Petites Epop√©es which Hugo had mentioned, feeling they would be more in harmony with the spirit of the times. Even though these \\"epics\\" were still no more than sketches, in March 1857 Hetzel wrote to Hugo, rejecting Fin de Satan and Dieu, but accepting with enthusiasm the Petites Epop√©es. This new commission was nevertheless transformed by the influence of Hugo's latest ideas and most recent works, created with the same dash and fire and in a sort of magma of inspiration: a mixture of poesy, mysticism and philosophy which is characteristic of Hugo's first decade of exile. This inspiration normally led him to write a large number of poems, more or less brief, which would finally be published as components in projects which were constantly shifting and evolving. In this case Hugo integrated the little epics into his poetical system by casting them as the \\"human\\" panel in a triptych of which \\"God\\" and \\"Satan\\" were the wings, with the implication that they were merely sparse fragments stolen from a greater epic: the whole of human experience itself. On 11 September 1857 Hugo signed a contract with Hetzel, reserving the right to alter the project's title. Later, Hetzel pronounced himself willing to publish La Fin de Satan and Dieu; but Hugo, perhaps conscious of the difficulties of completing either to his satisfaction, had by that time thrown himself entirely into the new project. He began by taking the French Revolution as the turning point in human history, intending to use a poem entitled La R√©volution as a pivot around which La Piti√© Supr√™me or Le Verso de la page would revolve. More titles were written down, but some were discarded or greatly altered, and the section dealing with the 19th century coalesced as L'Oc√©an ‚Äî La R√©volution ‚Äî le Verso de la page ‚Äî la Piti√© Supr√™me ‚Äî Les Pauvres Gens ‚Äî L'√©pop√©e de l'√Çne. Hetzel followed this evolution with alarm, and, fearing that the great philosophical questions would turn these little epics into towering giants, endeavoured to temper Hugo's ardour. After a serious illness in the summer of 1858, Hugo tried to reassure Hetzel by writing in a more straightforwardly narrative vein (e.g. Le Petit Roi de Galice and Zim-Zizimi), and modified his plans‚Äîbut retained the general ambition, which he declared in a preface. He had hit on the idea of publishing in several instalments, to give himself more time and space within which to work. The title was not decided on until a month after the manuscript's submission. With his gift for phrases, Hugo came up with La L√©gende des Si√®cles. Petites √âpop√©es was kept as a subtitle.  First Series  La Conscience, illustration by Fran√ßois Chifflart The first series was published in two volumes on 26 September 1859 (see 1859 in poetry) in Brussels. In exile, Hugo dedicated it to his home country: :Livre, qu'un vent t'emporte :En France, o√π je suis n√© ! :L'arbre d√©racin√© :Donne sa feuille morte. The framing of the series is resolutely Biblical: opening with Eve (Le sacre de la femme) and closing on La trompette du jugement, the classical world is largely forgotten (the Roman Empire, for which Hugo had little admiration, is represented only by its decadence). Several poems dating from 1857‚Äì58 were set aside for a future continuation.  Contents  * Pr√©face * I.

Hors des temps (La trompette du )  New Series  Work on the second series began immediately after the first, but Hugo was soon busy with Les Mis√©rables and with completing La Fin de Satan and Dieu. In 1862, with the publication of Les Mis√©rables, Hugo reviewed his earlier plan and gathered together the poems already written: L'√Çne, Les Sept Merveilles du Monde (a recent one), La R√©volution, and La Piti√© Supr√™me. Again, he delayed work for the sake of novels (Les travailleurs de la mer and L'Homme Qui Rit). In 1870, a decisive moment came, when Hugo decided to keep La R√©volution for the future collection Les Quatre Vents de l'esprit, and to fuse together La L√©gende, Dieu and La Fin de Satan, according to the following plan: La Fin de Satan, first book ‚Äî L'Oc√©an ‚Äî Elciis ‚Äî La Vision de Dante ‚Äî Les Religions (from Dieu) ‚Äî La Piti√© Supr√™me. Current events in the 1870s, however, saw upheavals in Hugo's life, and he was once more greatly involved in politics. La Nouvelle S√©rie was finally published on 26 February 1877 (see 1877 in poetry), Hugo's sixty-fifth birthday. Most of the contents date from 1859 and 1875‚Äì1877, and the events of the 1870s make themselves felt: the Paris Commune, the fall of Napoleon III, and the beginnings of the Third Republic. The collection closes with the formidable Ab√Æme, a vertiginous dialogue between Man, Earth, Sun, and Stars, playing on the numberless steps leading to an infinity behind which stands God, and placing human beings, with all their pettiness, face to face with the Universe.

Ab√Æme  Last Series  The New Series had been advertised with the following message: ¬´ Le compl√©ment de la L√©gende des si√®cles sera prochainement publi√©, √† moins que la fin de l'auteur n'arrive avant la fin du livre. ¬ª (\\"The conclusion to the Legend will be published shortly, provided that it is not preceded by the conclusion to the author.\\") On 9 June 1883 the fifth and last tome of La L√©gende des Si√®cles was published with the subtitle s√©rie compl√©mentaire (see 1883 in poetry). Critics who claimed that the \\"anticlericalism\\" and \\"glibness\\" were evidence of the bitterness of age were mistaken: in fact, Hugo's cerebral edema of June 1878 had already essentially put an end to his work as a writer, and most of the contents dated from long before. It is probable, but not certain, that he had intended to write new poems. For example, La Vision de Dante (written in 1853) was initially intended for Ch√¢timents, and Les Quatre Jours d'Elciis (written in 1857) was bumped forward from both the First and the New Series, the prologue dating from perhaps 1880. This assemblage of poems with little narrative drive, alternating dark and bright visions, gives the impression of a contemplative and intemporal epilogue, very different from what came before.

No one is entirely sure how close this comes to Hugo's original vision. It is not impossible that Hugo, physically and intellectually enfeebled, and greatly affected by the death of Juliette Drouet, allowed himself to be overly influenced by friends and by the executors of his estate. The rearrangement, which tries to make things easier for the reader by alternating long and short poems, and poems with different moods, has the effect of erasing the internal logic; in particular, the references to current affairs that are found in the New Series are dispersed. Additionally, it introduces bizarreries of chronology: Greek mythology is depicted after Jesus Christ, and El Cid appears before Muhammad. Finally, it often gives the reader the erroneous impression that this final fusion was what Hugo originally intended, as though the original appearance in \\"series\\" were a historical accident. Nevertheless, most modern editions adopt this arrangement for the sake of simplicity.  Contents  * Pr√©face * La vision d'o√π est sorti ce livre * I. La Terre * II.

The book is dedicated to the island of Guernsey, where Hugo spent 15 years in exile.Victor Hugo in Guernsey Hugo uses the setting of a small island community to transmute seemingly mundane events into drama of the highest calibre. Les Travailleurs de la Mer is set just after the Napoleonic Wars and deals with the impact of the Industrial Revolution upon the island.Toilers of the Sea The story concerns a Guernseyman named Gilliatt, a social outcast who falls in love with Deruchette, the niece of a local shipowner, Mess Lethierry. When Lethierry's ship is wrecked on the Roches Douvres, a perilous reef, Deruchette promises to marry whoever can salvage the ship's steam engine. Gilliatt eagerly volunteers, and the story follows his physical trials and tribulations (which include a battle with an octopus), as well as the undeserved opprobrium of his neighbours. Plot summary La Durande (ink wash painting by author, 1866) Octopus that Gilliatt faces (ink wash painting by author, 1866) Gilliatt and the Octopus by Joseph Carlier A woman arrives in Guernsey, with her son Gilliat, and buys a house said to be haunted. The boy grows up, the woman dies. Gilliat becomes a good fisherman and sailor. People believe him to be a wizard. In Guernsey also lives Mess Lethierry ‚Äì a former sailor and owner of the first steamship of the island, the Durande ‚Äì with his niece Deruchette. One day, near Christmas, when going to church, she sees Gilliat on the road behind her and writes his name in the snow. He sees this and becomes obsessed with her gesture. In time he falls in love with her and goes to play the bagpipes near her house. Sieur Clubin, the trusted captain of Durande, sets up a plan to sink the ship on the Hanois reef and flee with a ship of Spanish smugglers, Tamaulipas. He gets in touch with Rantaine, a swindler who had stolen a large sum of money from Mess Lethierry many years ago. Clubin takes the money from Rantaine at gunpoint. In thick fog, Clubin sails for the Hanois reef from where he can easily swim to the shore, meet the smugglers, and disappear, giving the appearance of having drowned. Because of the fog he has mistakenly arrived at the Douvres reef, which is still halfway between Guernsey and France. Left alone on the ship, he is terrified, but he sees a cutter and leaps into the water to catch it. At that moment he is grabbed by the leg and is pulled down to the bottom. Everybody in Guernsey finds out about the shipwreck. Mess Lethierry is desperate to get the Durandes engine back. His niece declares she will marry the rescuer of the engine, and Mess Lethierry swears she will marry no other. Gilliat immediately takes up the mission, enduring hunger, thirst, and cold trying to free the engine from the wreck. In a battle with an octopus, he finds the skeleton of Clubin and the stolen money on the bottom of the sea. Eventually he succeeds in returning the engine to Lethierry, who is very pleased and ready to honour his promise. Gilliat appears in front of the people as the rescuer but he declines to marry Deruchette because he had seen her accepting a marriage proposal made by Ebenezer Caudry, the young priest recently arrived on the island. He arranges their hurried wedding and helps them run away on the sailing ship Cashmere. In the end, with all his dreams shattered, Gilliat decides to wait for the tide sitting on the Gild Holm'Ur chair (a rock in the sea) and drowns as he watches the Cashmere disappear on the horizon. Characters * Gilliatt: a fisherman * Mess Lethierry: owner of the ship Durande, the island's first steam ship * D√©ruchette: Mess Lethierry's young niece * Sieur Clubin: captain of the Durande * Ebenezer Caudray: young Anglican priest, recently arrived on the island Influence The novel is credited with introducing the Guern√©siais word for octopus (pieuvre) into the French language (standard French for octopus is poulpe).Pieuvre - Centre National des Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales Dedication The following dedication appears at the front of the book: ::Je d√©die ce livre au rocher d'hospitalit√© et de libert√©, √† ce coin de vieille terre normande o√π vit le noble petit peuple de la mer, √† l'√Æle de Guernesey, s√©v√®re et douce, mon asile actuel, mon tombeau probable. ::(I dedicate this book to the rock of hospitality and liberty, to that portion of old Norman ground inhabited by the noble little nation of the sea, to the island of Guernsey, severe yet kind, my present asylum, my probable tomb.) Publishing history The novel was first published in Brussels in 1866 (Hugo was in exile from France). An English translation quickly appeared in New York later that year, under the title The Toilers of the Sea. A UK edition followed in 1887, with Ward Lock publishing Sir G Campbell's translation under the title Workers of the Sea followed by an 1896 Routledge edition under the title Toilers of the Sea. Hugo had originally intended his essay L'Archipel de la Manche (The Archipelago of the [English] Channel) as an introduction to this novel, although it was not published until 1883, and the two have only been published together in the 20th century.L'Archipel de la Manche, Priaulx Library, Guernsey In 2002, Modern Library published an edition with a new translation by James Hogarth, which bills itself as \\"the first unabridged English edition of the novel\\".Toilers of the Sea Film adaptations There have been at least five film adaptations of the novel, including: * Toilers of the Sea (1914 film) ‚Äì director unknown (silent)Toilers of the Sea (1914), imdb.com * Toilers of the Sea (1915 film) ‚Äì director unknown (silent)Toilers of the Sea (1915), imdb.com * Toilers of the Sea (1923 film) ‚Äì director Roy William Neill (silent)Toilers of the Sea (1923), imdb.com * Toilers of the Sea (1936 film) ‚Äì director Selwyn JepsonToilers of the Sea (1936), imdb.com * Sea Devils (1953 film) ‚Äì director Raoul WalshSea Devils (1953), imdb.com ReferencesExternal links  Category:Novels by Victor Hugo Category:Novels set in the Channel Islands Category:Guernsey culture Category:1866 French novels Category:French novels adapted into films Category:Books about cephalopods Category:Nautical fiction ","title":"Toilers of the Sea"},{"id":"1496334","text":"The Man Who Laughs (also published under the title By Order of the King from its subtitle in French) is a novel by Victor Hugo, originally published in April 1869 under the French title L'Homme qui rit. It takes place in England in the 1680s and 1700s, during the reigns of James II and Queen Anne, respectively, and depicts England's royalty and aristocracy of the time as cruel and power-hungry. Hugo intended parallels between the England depicted and the France of Louis-Philippe and the R√©gence.Roman, Myriam. Preface to Le Livre de Poche Classiques edition, 2002, p16. The novel concerns the life of a young nobleman, Gwynplaine, disfigured as a child (on the orders of the king), who travels with his protector and companion the vagabond philosopher Ursus and the baby girl he rescues during a storm. The novel is famous for Gwynplaine's mutilated face, stuck in a permanent laugh. The book has inspired many artists, dramatists and film-makers.Maison Victor Hugo, Paris - press release for 2014 exhibition 'L‚Äô√¢me a-t-elle un visage?' accessed 26 November 2019. Background Hugo wrote The Man Who Laughs, or the Laughing Man, over a period of 15 months while he was living in the Channel Islands, having been exiled from his native France because of the controversial political content of his previous novels. Hugo's working title for this book was On the King's Command, but a friend suggested The Man Who Laughs. Despite an initially negative reception upon publication, The Man Who Laughs is argued to be one of Hugo's greatest works. In his speech to the Lords, Gwynplaine asserts: (Part 2, Book 8, Chapter VII) \\"I am a symbol. Oh, you all-powerful fools, open your eyes. I represent all. I embody humanity as its masters have made it\\". ¬´ Je suis un symbole. √î tout-puissants imb√©ciles que vous √™tes, ouvrez les yeux. J‚Äôincarne Tout. Je repr√©sente l‚Äôhumanit√© telle que ses ma√Ætres l‚Äôont faite. ¬ª from text in Wikisource accessed 26 November 2019. Making a parallel between the mutilation of one man and of human experience, Hugo touches on a recurrent theme in his work \\"la mis√®re\\", and criticizes both the nobility which in boredom resorts to violence and oppression and the passivity of the people, who submit to it and prefer laughter to struggle.Pascal Melka. Victor Hugo : un combat pour les opprim√©s : √©tude de son √©volution politique. La Compagnie litt√©raire, Paris, 2008. A few of Hugo's drawings can be linked with L‚ÄôHomme qui rit and its themes. For instance the lighthouses of Eddystone and the Casquets in Book II, Chapter XI in the first part, where the author contrasts three types of beacon or lighthouse ('Le phare des Casquets' and 'Le phare d'Eddystone' ‚Äì both 1866. Hugo also drew 'Le Lever ou la Duchesse Josiane' in quill and brown ink, for Book VII, Chapter IV (Satan) in part 2. Plot The novel is divided into two parts: La mer et la nuit (The sea and the night) and Par ordre du roi (On the king's command). Le phare des Casquets (Hugo) 1866 In late 17th-century England, a homeless boy named Gwynplaine rescues an infant girl during a snowstorm, her mother having frozen to death. They meet an itinerant carnival vendor who calls himself Ursus, and his pet wolf, Homo (whose name is a pun on the Latin saying \\"Homo homini lupus\\"). Gwynplaine's mouth has been mutilated into a perpetual grin; Ursus is initially horrified, then moved to pity, and he takes them in. 15 years later, Gwynplaine has grown into a strong young man, attractive except for his distorted visage. The girl, now named Dea, is blind, and has grown into a beautiful and innocent young woman. By touching his face, Dea concludes that Gwynplaine is perpetually happy. They fall in love. Ursus and his surrogate children earn a meagre living in the fairs of southern England. Gwynplaine keeps the lower half of his face concealed. In each town, Gwynplaine gives a stage performance in which the crowds are provoked to laughter when Gwynplaine reveals his grotesque face. The spoiled and jaded Duchess Josiana, the illegitimate daughter of King James II, is bored by the dull routine of court. Her fianc√©, David Dirry-Moir, to whom she has been engaged since infancy, tells Josiana that the only cure for her boredom is Gwynplaine. She attends one of Gwynplaine's performances, and is aroused by the combination of his virile grace and his facial deformity. Gwynplaine is aroused by Josiana's physical beauty and haughty demeanor. Later, an agent of the royal court, Barkilphedro, who wishes to humiliate and destroy Josiana by compelling her to marry the 'clown' Gwynplaine, arrives at the caravan and compels Gwynplaine to follow him. Gwynplaine is ushered to a dungeon in London, where a physician named Hardquannone is being tortured to death. Hardquannone recognizes Gwynplaine, and identifies him as the boy whose abduction and disfigurement Hardquannone arranged 23 years earlier. A flashback relates the doctor's story. During the reign of the despotic King James II, in 1685‚Äì1688, one of the King's enemies was Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie, Marquis of Corleone, who had fled to Switzerland. Upon the lord's death, the King arranged the abduction of his two-year-old son and legitimate heir, Fermain. The King sold Fermain to a band of wanderers called \\"Comprachicos\\", criminals who mutilate and disfigure children, and then force them to beg for alms or be exhibited as carnival freaks. Confirming the story is a message in a bottle recently brought to Queen Anne. The message is the final confession from the Comprachicos, written in the certainty that their ship was about to founder in a storm. It explains how they renamed the boy \\"Gwynplaine\\", and abandoned him in a snowstorm before setting to sea. David Dirry-Moir is the illegitimate son of Lord Linnaeus. Now that Fermain is known to be alive, the inheritance promised to David on the condition of his marriage to Josiana will instead go to Fermain. Gwynplaine is arrested and Barkilphedro lies to Ursus that Gwynplaine is dead. The frail Dea becomes ill with grief. The authorities condemn them to exile for illegally using a wolf in their shows. Josiana has Gwynplaine secretly brought to her so that she may seduce him. She is interrupted by the delivery of a pronouncement from the Queen, informing Josiana that David has been disinherited, and the Duchess is now commanded to marry Gwynplaine. Josiana rejects Gwynplaine as a lover, but dutifully agrees to marry him. Gwynplaine is instated as Lord Fermain Clancharlie, Marquis of Corleone, and permitted to sit in the House of Lords. When he addresses the peerage with a fiery speech against the gross inequality of the age, the other lords are provoked to laughter by Gwynplaine's clownish grin. David defends him and challenges a dozen Lords to duels, but he also challenges Gwynplaine whose speech had inadvertently condemned David's mother, who abandoned David's father to become the mistress of Charles II. Gwynplaine renounces his peerage and travels to find Ursus and Dea. He is nearly driven to suicide when he is unable to find them. Learning that they are to be deported, he locates their ship and reunites with them. Dea is ecstatic, but abruptly dies. Ursus faints. Gwynplaine, as though in a trance, walks across the deck while speaking to the dead Dea, and throws himself overboard. When Ursus recovers, he finds Homo sitting at the ship's rail, howling at the sea. Criticism Hugo's romantic novel The Man Who Laughs places its narrative in 17th-century England, where the relationships between the bourgeoisie and aristocracy are complicated by continual distancing from the lower class. According to Algernon Charles Swinburne, \\"it is a book to be rightly read, not by the lamplight of realism, but by the sunlight of his imagination reflected upon ours.\\" Hugo's protagonist, Gwynplaine (a physically transgressive figure, something of a monster), transgresses these societal spheres by being reinstated from the lower class into the aristocracy‚Äîa movement which enabled Hugo to critique construction of social identity based upon class status. Stallybrass and White's \\"The Sewer, the Gaze and the Contaminating Touch\\" addresses several of the class theories regarding narrative figures transgressing class boundaries. Gwynplaine specifically can be seen to be the supreme embodiment of Stallybrass and White's \\"rat\\" analysis, meaning Hugo's protagonist is, in essence, a sliding signifier. Adaptations=Film Film adaptations of The Man Who Laughs include: * The Man Who Laughs (1909 film), made in France by the Path√© film company and produced by Albert Capellani. No copies of this film are known to survive. * Das grinsende Gesicht (The Grinning Face) (1921), an Austrian (German language) 1921 silent film produced by Olympic Films, directed by Julius Herzka, with Franz H√∂bling in the leading role as Gwynplaine. This low- budget film is faithful to the novel, but simplifies and condenses the plot. * The Man Who Laughs (1928), an American silent film directed by Paul Leni and starring Conrad Veidt, Mary Philbin and Olga Baclanova. Veidt's appearance as Gwynplaine is cited as a key influence on the character design of the comic book villain the Joker.The Man Who Laughs: The Movie That Inspired Batman's Joker (Sort of) Turns 86 * Clair de Lune, a 1932 French film based on the 1921 play of the same name, directed by Henri Diamant-Berger. * The Man Who Laughs (1966) (L'uomo che ride), an Italian-French film, also in an English dubbed version titled He Who Laughs, made in Italy and directed by Sergio Corbucci. This version features elaborate colour photography, but a very low production budget. The main action is shifted to Italy and moved backwards in time, with the deformed protagonist meeting Lucrezia Borgia instead of Queen Anne. In this version, Gwynplaine is renamed Angelo (played by Jean Sorel). His disfigurement is represented as a single broad slash across his mouth, crude yet convincing. The story (which is attributed, in the movie credits, to the director, producer and others involved in making the film, but not to Victor Hugo) is a swashbuckler pitting the disfigured acrobat against the henchmen of the Borgias. At the end, Dea (actress Lina Sini) miraculously acquires her eyesight and Angelo undergoes surgery that completely reverses his disfigurement and renders him perfectly handsome. * L'homme qui rit (1971), a TV movie directed by Jean Kerchbron made and distributed in 1971. It is an adaptation of the novel in three episodes, starring Xavier Depraz as Ursus, Philippe Clay as Barkilphedro, Philippe Bouclet as the adult Gwynplaine and Delphine Desyeux as the adult Dea. Music was by Jean Wi√©ner. * The Man Who Laughs (2012). Originally released in Belgium, this French movie features G√©rard Depardieu as Ursus, Christa Theret as Dea and Marc-Andr√© Grondin as Gwynplaine.

Oelrichs's husband at this time was the actor John Barrymore, who agreed to play Gwynplaine and persuaded his sister Ethel Barrymore to portray Queen Anne. * In 2005, The Stolen Chair Theatre Company recreated the story as a \\"silent film for the stage\\". This drew equally from Hugo's novel, the 1927 Hollywood silent film, and from the creative minds of Stolen Chair. Stolen Chair's collectively created adaptation was staged as a live silent film, with stylized movement, original musical accompaniment, and projected intertitles. Gwynplaine was played by Jon Campbell and the cast included. It played in New York, was published in the book Playing with Cannons and was revived in 2013 by the same company. * In 2006, the story was adapted into a musical by Alexandr Tyumencev (composer) and Tatyana Ziryanova (Russian lyrics), entitled 'The Man Who Laughs' ('–ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Å–º–µ—ë—Ç—Å—è'). It was performed by the Seventh Morning Musical Theatre, opening November 6, 2006. * In 2013, another musical version in Hampton Roads, VA featured a blend of Jewish, Gypsy and Russian song styles. * In 2016, a musical adaptation titled The Grinning Man opened at the Bristol Old Vic, followed by a transfer to the Trafalgar Studios in London's West End from December 2017. * In 2018, a musical adaptation written by Frank Wildhorn debuted in South Korea and starred Park Hyo Shin, EXO's Suho, Super Junior's Kyuhyun and Park Kang Hyun. It won three awards including the Best Musical Award in the 2019 Korean Musical Awards. Comics * In May 1950, the Gilberton publishing company produced a comic-book adaptation of The Man Who Laughs as part of their prestigious Classics Illustrated series. This adaptation featured artwork by Alex A. Blum, much of it closely resembling the 1928 film (including the anachronistic Ferris wheel). The character of Gwynplaine is drawn as a handsome young man, quite normal except for two prominent creases at the sides of his mouth. As this comic book was intended for juvenile readers, there may have been an intentional editorial decision to minimise the appearance of Gwynplaine's disfigurement. A revised Classics Illustrated edition, with a more faithful script by Al Sundel, and a painted cover and new interior art by Norman Nodel, was issued in the spring of 1962. Nodel's artwork showed a Gwynplaine far more disfigured than the character's appearance in either the 1928 film or the 1950 Classics Illustrated edition. * Another 1950s version, by Claude-Henri Juillard, was published in the Ce Soir newspaper.Dossier de Presse: March 2014.

Artists and republished by Heavy Metal in 1994. This adaptation was intended for a mature audience and places more emphasis on the horrific elements of the story.

First published in 1826, it is a reworked version of an earlier short story of the same name published in the Hugo brothers' magazine Le Conservateur litt√©raire in 1820. The novel follows a friendship between the enslaved African prince of the title and a French military officer named Leopold D'Auverney during the tumultuous early years of the Haitian Revolution. Hugo later claimed that the story was to have been part of a collaborative work called Contes sous la Tente (Tales under a Tent), and that he had written it in 1818 (at the age of sixteen) in two weeks; the manuscript is however dated April 1819. Several translations into English exist. The first, a modified version with the title The Slave-King, was published in 1833. The only modern translation is by Chris Bongie and was published in 2004. Plot The story of Bug-Jargal begins several weeks before the Haitian Revolution, when Toussaint Louverture fights the colonial regime. D'Auverney, the nephew of a landed aristocrat with many slaves, is betrothed to Marie, his cousin. A slave, Pierrot, falls in love with Marie, but can not do anything because of the obvious racial and cultural barriers between them. However, Pierrot does save Marie from a crocodile, but soon finds himself thrown in prison for trying to protect another slave from his owner's wrath. D'Auverney befriends him, and not long before the Haitian Revolution, Pierrot warns the lovers to flee the island. They stay despite the warning, and the day of the wedding the slave revolution begins, and the white landowners see the rapid and violent dissolution of their society. Pierrot saves Marie from a slave attack and whisks her away, but D'Auverney, thinking that Pierrot had kidnapped his new wife for his own desires, wanders into a dark grotto. He is taken prisoner by the infamously violent slave leader Biassou. In the grotto the freed slaves force their captured white prisoners to kill each other in order to preserve their own skins. Pierrot luckily comes to the rescue of D'Auverney, who learns that Pierrot is really Bug-Jargal, the mystical leader of the slaves. Pierrot leads him to his wife, and dies protecting his friends.

See is the last novel by the French writer Victor Hugo. Published in 1874, eighty years after the bloody upheaval of the Paris Commune of the French Revolution, the novel concerns the Revolt in the Vend√©e and Chouannerie ‚Äì the counter-revolutionary revolts in 1793 during the French Revolution. It is divided into three parts, but not chronologically; each part tells a different story, offering a different view of historical general events. The action mainly takes place in Brittany and in Paris.  Plot  The year is 1793. In Brittany during the Royalist insurrection of the Chouannerie, a troop of \\"Blues\\" (soldiers of the French Republic) encounter in the bocage Michelle Fl√©chard, a peasant woman, and her three young children, who are fleeing from the conflict. She explains that her husband and parents have been killed in the peasant revolt that started the insurrection. The troop's commander, Sergeant Radoub, convinces them to look after the family. Meanwhile, at sea, a group of Royalist \\"Whites\\" are planning to land the Marquis de Lantenac, a Breton aristocrat whose leadership could transform the fortunes of the rebellion. While at sea, a sailor fails to properly secure his cannon, which rolls out of control and damages the ship. The sailor risks his life to secure the cannon and save their ship. Lantenac awards the man a medal for his bravery and then executes him (without trial) for failing in his duty.The first reference to \\"Loose Cannon\\" Their corvette is spotted by ships of the Republic. Lantenac slips away in a boat with one supporter, Halmalo, the brother of the executed sailor, and the corvette distracts the Republican ships by provoking a battle the damaged ship cannot win. The corvette is destroyed, but Lantenac lands safely in Brittany and sends Halmalo ahead as a messenger. Lantenac is hunted by the Blues, but is protected by a local beggar, to whom he gave alms in the past. He meets up with his supporters, and they immediately launch an attack on the Blues. Part of the troop with the family is captured. Lantenac orders them all to be shot, including Michelle. He takes the children with him as hostages. The beggar finds the bodies, and discovers that Michelle is still alive. He nurses her back to health. Lantenac's ruthless methods have turned the revolt into a major threat to the Republic. In Paris, Danton, Robespierre and Marat argue about the threat, while also sniping at each other. They promulgate a decree that all rebels and anyone who helps them will be executed. Cimourdain, a committed revolutionary and former priest, is deputed to carry out their orders in Brittany. He is also told to keep an eye on Gauvain, the commander of the Republican troops there, who is related to Lantenac and thought to be too lenient to rebels. Unknown to the revolutionary leaders, Cimourdain was Gauvain's childhood tutor, and thinks of him as a son. Lantenac has taken control of Dol-de- Bretagne, in order to secure a landing place for British troops to be sent to support the Royalists. Gauvain launches a surprise attack and uses deception to dislodge and disperse them. Forced to retreat, Lantenac is constantly kept from the coast by Gauvain. With British troops unavailable his supporters melt away. Eventually he and a last few fanatical followers are trapped in his castle. Meanwhile, Michelle has recovered and goes in search of her children. She wanders aimlessly, but eventually hears that they are being held hostage in Lantenac's castle. At the castle Sergeant Radoub, fighting with the besiegers, spots the children. He persuades Gauvain to let him lead an assault. He manages to break through the defences and kill several rebels, but with Halmalo's aid, Lantenac and a few survivors escape through a secret passage after setting fire to the building. As the fire takes hold, Michelle arrives, and sees that her children are trapped. Her hysterical cries of despair are heard by Lantenac. Struck with guilt, he returns through the passage to the castle and rescues the children, helped by Radoub. He then gives himself up. Gauvain knows that Cimourdain will guillotine Lantenac after a show trial. He visits him in prison, where Lantenac expresses his uncompromising conservative vision of society ordered by hierarchy, deference and duty. Gauvain insists that humane values transcend tradition. To prove it, he allows Lantenac to escape and then gives himself up to the tribunal that was convened to try him. Gauvain's forgiveness after Lantenac's courageous act contrasts with Lantenac's executing the sailor at the beginning of the novel. Gauvain is then tried for treason. The tribunal comprises Cimourdain, Radoub and Gauvain's deputy, Gu√©champ. Radoub votes to acquit, but the others vote to condemn Gauvain to be executed, with Cimourdain casting the deciding vote. Visited by Cimourdain in prison, Gauvain outlines his own vision of a future society with minimal government, no taxes, technological progress and sexual equality. The following morning he is executed by guillotine. At the same moment, Cimourdain shoots himself.  Writing and reception  Hugo makes clear where he himself stands‚Äîin favour of the revolutionaries‚Äîin several explicit comments and remarks made by the omniscient narrator. Nevertheless, the Royalist counter-revolutionaries are in no way villainous or despicable. Quite the contrary: Republicans and Royalists alike are depicted as idealistic and high-minded, completely devoted to their respective antagonistic causes (though, to be sure, ready to perform sundry cruel and ruthless acts perceived as necessary in the ongoing titanic struggle). Among the considerable cast of characters, there is hardly any on either side depicted as opportunistic, mercenary or cynical. However, while being fair to both Republicans and Monarchists, Hugo has been criticised for his portrayal of the Bretons, whom he describes as \\"savages\\" and as speaking \\"a dead language\\". A sympathetic portrait is however made of Michelle Fl√©chard, the young Breton mother, who is originally loyal to the king, but is \\"adopted\\" by a revolutionary battalion. Her children are later saved by the French royalist leader. Michelle Fl√©chard is a classical \\"civilian caught between parties\\". The former priest who is considered by some to be the novel's villain, Cimourdain, purportedly \\"made a deep impression on a young Georgian seminarian named Dzhugashvili, who was confined to his cell for reading Ninety-Three and later changed his name to Stalin\\", according to a biographer of Hugo.From the Hugo biographer Graham Robb's introduction to Frank Lee Benedict's English translation of Ninety- Three, Carol & Graf Publishers, New York, 1988. Herbert Butterfield expressed admiration for Ninety-Three in his essay The Historical Novel (1924), describing the book as \\"a striking example of the epic of national freedom\\".Herbert Butterfield, The Historical Novel Cambridge University Press,2012 (Reprint), (p.88). Ayn Rand greatly praised this book (and Hugo's writing in general), acknowledged it as a source of inspiration,Ayn Rand's introduction to the 1968 edition of The Fountainhead. and even wrote an introduction to one of its English-language editions which was later reprinted with edits as an essay in The Romantic Manifesto. Its influence can be especially discernible in the passages describing the Russian Civil War in Rand's We the Living‚Äîwhere, uncharacteristically for this staunchly anti- Communist writer, \\"Reds\\" as well as \\"Whites\\" are recognized for the sincerity of their convictions and presented as courageous and heroic.

Located at the top of Loch Shiel in the West Highlands of Scotland, the viaduct overlooks the Glenfinnan Monument and the waters of Loch Shiel. Construction Twelve of the viaduct's twenty-one arches View from a train on the viaduct The Glenfinnan Viaduct, however, was complete enough by October 1898 to be used to transport materials across the valley. It was built at a cost of . A long-established legend attached to the Glenfinnan Viaduct was that a horse had fallen into one of the piers during construction in 1898 or 1899. In 1987, Professor Roland Paxton failed to find evidence of a horse at Glenfinnan using a fisheye camera inserted into boreholes in the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, he investigated the Loch nan Uamh Viaduct by the same method but found the piers to be full of rubble. Using scanning technology in 2001, the remains of the horse and cart were found at Loch nan Uamh, within the large central pylon. Design The viaduct is built from mass concrete, and has 21 semicircular spans of . It is the longest concrete railway bridge in Scotland at , and crosses the River Finnan at a height of . The West Highland Line it carries is single track, and the viaduct is wide between the parapets. The viaduct is built on a curve of . The concrete used in the Glenfinnan Viaduct is mass concrete, which unlike reinforced concrete does not contain any metal reinforcement. It is formed by pouring concrete, typically using fine aggregate, into formwork, resulting in a material very strong in compression but weak in tension. Railway services The West Highland Line connects Fort William and Mallaig, and was a crucial artery for the local fishing industry and the highlands economy in general, which suffered enormously after the Highland Clearances of the 1800s. The line is used by passenger trains operated by ScotRail between Glasgow Queen Street and Mallaig, usually diesel multiple units. Additionally in the summer the heritage Jacobite steam train operates along the line. It is a popular tourist event in the area, and the viaduct is one of the major attractions of the line. Depiction The viaduct is commemorated on this Bank of Scotland ¬£10 note Glenfinnan Viaduct has been used as a location in several films and television series, including Ring of Bright Water, Charlotte Gray, Monarch of the Glen, Stone of Destiny and The Crown. After it appeared in four of the Harry Potter films, British Transport Police warned fans not to walk on the viaduct after a handful of near misses with trains had occurred. It is also featured in the 2018 videogame Forza Horizon 4. The Glenfinnan Viaduct features on some Scottish banknotes.

The novel recounts the thoughts of a man condemned to die. Victor Hugo wrote this novel to express his feelings that the death penalty should be abolished. Genesis Victor Hugo saw several times the spectacle of the guillotine and was angered at the spectacle that society can make of it. It was the day after crossing the \\"Place de l'Hotel de Ville\\" where an executioner was greasing the guillotine in anticipation of a scheduled execution that Hugo began writing The Last Day of a Condemned Man. He finished very quickly.‚Üë Achev√© en 3 semaines selon Victor Hugo racont√© par un t√©moin de sa vie, chapitre L ou en un mois et demi (14 novembre 1828 - 26 d√©cembre 1828) selon Roger Borderie (Notices sur le Dernier Jour d‚Äôun condamn√© - Gallimard 1970) The book was published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author's name. Three years later, on 15 March 1832, Hugo completed his story with a long preface and his signature. Plot summary A man who has been condemned to death by the guillotine in 19th-century France writes down his cogitations, feelings and fears while awaiting his execution. His writing traces his change in psyche vis-a-vis the world outside the prison cell throughout his imprisonment, and describes his life in prison, everything from what his cell looks like to the personality of the prison priest. He does not betray his name or what he has done to the reader, though he vaguely hints that he has killed someone; just a nameless, faceless, meaningless victim. Interestingly, the novel also contains a blueprint of Jean Valjean, the hero of Hugo's Les Miserables. As the Condemned is waiting to be executed he meets another condemned man who recounts his life story. The man tells him that he has was originally sent to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to save his sister's family. This, of course, is the same backstory that Hugo gives for Jean Valjean. At another point he tries to escape by conning a superstitious guard to give him his clothes. The guard almost does until common sense gets the better of him and he declines exchanging clothes with the Condemned. On the day that the Condemned is to be executed he sees his three-year-old daughter for the last time, but she no longer recognizes him, and she tells him that her father is dead. The novel ends just after he briefly but desperately begs for pardon and curses the people of his time, the people he hears outside, screaming impatiently for the spectacle of his decapitation.  Influence  Hugo's text was translated twice into English in 1840. The first translation was published by George William MacArthur Reynolds, author of penny blood novel The Mysteries of London (1844‚Äì48), as The Last Day of a Condemned. The second translation in 1840 was completed by Sir P. H. Fleetwood, titled The Last Days of a Condemned. Fleetwood also added his own preface to the book, outlining why it was important that British anti-capital punishment campaigners out to read it, whereas Reynolds did not add any substantive new material but reprinted Hugo's preface and provided a few footnotes which he signed as 'Trans.' Though The Last Day of a Condemned Man is lesser known than some of Hugo's other works, the novel had the distinction of being praised as \\"absolutely the most real and truthful of everything that Hugo wrote‚Äù by Fyodor Dostoevsky, who referenced it in both his letters and his novel, The Idiot. Furthermore, Dostoevsky pays tribute to the novel in the format of The Meek One, citing Hugo's novel as a means of justifying the \\"fantastic\\" idea of writing down a person's thoughts at a moment of distress.

The show aired on CTV from 1989 to 1994. The series ran for 96 episodes, produced by the Alliance Entertainment Corporation.  Plot  \\"E.N.G.\\" stands for electronic news-gathering. The show is led by Anne Hildebrandt (Sara Botsford), the senior executive producer of the news broadcasts on fictional Toronto television station, CTLS channel 10. Hildebrandt is bright, assertive and also having a clandestine affair with star cameraman Jake Antonelli (Mark Humphrey). Jake is younger and married to Martha with two children; after Jake and Martha divorce, son Jeff lives with Jake, while their daughter lives with her mother. Mike Fennell (Art Hindle) is the station's newly-appointed news director, taking a position Anne had been expecting to receive. Mike aims to improve newscast's ratings of the newscasts and his coverage philosophy is in obvious conflict with Anne's. Anne and Mike find common ground and later become romantically involved. Mike has a troubled teenage daughter named Carrie from his previous marriage; Carrie lives in Vancouver. Other members of the CTLS staff include Jane Oliver, the station's weathercaster; Seth Miller, who worries about being pushed into retirement due to his age; Kyle Copeland, the station's general manager who sometimes clashes with both Anne and Mike; Bobbi Katz, another camera person; J.C. Callahan, the station's alcoholic and cranky assignment editor, who later is left wheelchair-bound by an accident; Marge Atherton, the station's video editor, who is very motherly and offers co-workers advice, and a compassionate shoulder to lean on; Dan Watson, a smarmy senior reporter who occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. Janice Roberts, a news researcher, joins channel 10 the same day Mike does. Janice later commits suicide after becoming too emotionally involved in a story. Bruce Foreman is a devious and scheming assistant assignment editor; Eric \\"Mac\\" MacFarlane is the newscast's openly- gay floor manager; Terri Morgan, a scheming reporter who tends to be very cut- throat. Victor Garber has a recurring role as tycoon Adam Hirsch, who owned CTLS during the final three seasons. At the end of the series, Anne and Mike try to balance their personal and professional lives, when it is revealed that CTLS is going from a hard news format to a lifestyles format. Mike receives a new job offer in Japan, and invites Anne to go with him. After making peace with Jake, who urged her to have a life with Mike, Anne decides to accept his offer, although she would not be permitted to work, by Japanese law. In the final episode, \\"The Cutting Edge\\", Clarke Roberts (Janice's brother) dares Anne to get back in the trenches and help him with a hard news story. She does, finding how much she loves the excitement. She is offered a job at another news station, by the station owner (Simon MacCorkindale). After talking to Mike, they decide they want different things. Mike goes to Japan to begin his new job.

This is probably the species mentioned by Shakespeare in King Lear. *Golden samphire, Limbarda crithmoides is a coastal species with yellow flowers that grows across Eurasia. *Several species in the genus Salicornia, known as \\"marsh samphire\\" in Britain. * Blutaparon vermiculare, Central America, southeastern North America *Tecticornia, Australia *Sarcocornia, cosmopolitan. Etymology Originally \\"sampiere\\", a corruption of the French \\"Saint Pierre\\" (Saint Peter), samphire was named after the patron saint of fishermen because all of the original plants with its name grow in rocky salt-sprayed regions along the sea coast of northern Europe or in its coastal marsh areas. It is sometimes called rock samphire or seafennel. In North Wales, especially along the River Dee's marshes, it has always been known as sampkin. Also in Italy, along the Adriatic coast, there is a great heritage about rock samphire (or sea fennel) in local dishes. Following the construction of the Channel Tunnel, the nature reserve created on new land near Folkestone made from excavated rock was named \\"Samphire Hoe\\". Uses Fresh samphire from the River Loughor estuary for sale at Swansea Market Marsh samphire ashes were used to make soap and glass (hence its other old English name, \\"glasswort\\") as it was a source of sodium carbonate, also known as soda ash. In the 14th century glassmakers located their workshops near regions where this plant grew, since it was so closely linked to their trade. Many samphires are edible. In England the leaves were gathered early in the year and pickled or eaten in salads with oil and vinegar. Marsh samphire (Salicornia bigelovii) was investigated as a potential biodiesel source that can be grown in coastal areas where conventional crops cannot be grown. Rock Samphire is another kind of samphire, also called Seafennel. It is mentioned by Shakespeare in King Lear: This refers to the dangers involved in collecting rock samphire on sea cliffs. Also Aboriginal Australians have long used samphire as bush tucker, due to its abundance, flavour and nutritional value. It is high in Vitamin A and a good source of calcium and iron. Other Australians have recently discovered the potential of the species as a food plant and it has begun to appear on restaurant menus across the country.Native blackseed samphire , from Slow Food¬ÆÔ∏é in Australia There is a very well known kind of rock samphire even in Italy along the Adriatic coast.

C. Johnson & Son. The plastic bags and containers come in different sizes for use with different products. The brand offers sandwich bags, snack bags and other bags for various purposes.  History  A Ziploc bag In 1951, a company called Flexigrip, Inc. was formed to develop and market a plastic zipper, by the same name, based on a set of patents, which it had purchased, invented by Borge Madsen. The initial products for the Flexigrip and other plastic zippers (such as the sliderless zippers (toptite) that were developed by Flexigrip) were looseleaf binder inserts and flat briefcases. Thereafter, the marketing efforts were directed at packaging products in plastic zipper bags, which turned out to be the principal market for the Flexigrip, Inc. products. In 1961, Flexigrip, Inc. obtained from a Japanese company, Seisan Nippon Sha, who invented the Minigrip-type plastic zipper bag, exclusive manufacturing and selling rights for the United States, based on a series of plastic zipper Seisan patents. A company by the same name was formed to produce and market Minigrip bags. In or about 1964, Minigrip, Inc. negotiated an exclusive license for the grocery trade (supermarkets) with Dow Chemical Company for the Minigrip product. It turned out to be enormously successful. Box of 1 US gallon (3.7 L) Ziploc bags At that time, plastic bags were being produced in 25 countries at a line speed of 30 feet per minute, but none were being sold to consumers because they were too expensive to produce. Dow assigned one of their inventors, R. Douglas Behr, to develop a high-speed, efficient process. Having little prior experience in plastics, the task was daunting for Behr but he passed everyone in the world within a year. As he improved the process and increased line speeds to 60, then 90, then 150 and finally 300 feet per minute in 1972, he had to design new equipment. Some were patented and some were kept as trade secrets by Dow. Eventually, other research and production personnel, such as lab technician William Shrum and others, contributed to the process development, but Behr continued to be the leading researcher until he retired in 1993 as a senior associate scientist. At that time the research building was \\"Dedicated in Recognition of the Distinguished Career of R. Douglas Behr\\". In 1978, Minigrip was acquired by Signode, Inc. and became a subsidiary of that company. In 1986, Signode and Dow formed a company, namely Zippak, to develop zipper bags for food products. In 1987, ITW acquired Signode, and Minigrip became a subsidiary of ITW. In 1991, ITW acquired Dow's interest in Zippak so that Zippak became a fully owned subsidiary of ITW. Zippak produces plastic zippers for the food packaging market. From the time of inception till today, Flexigrip/Minigrip/Zippak/Dow/Dow Brands have obtained over 300 patents for plastic zippers, zipper bags, and methods and machinery of producing the same. In 1997, Dow Chemical sold the rights of DowBrands, which included Ziploc, to S. C. Johnson for between $1.3 and $1.7 billion.Christine Bittar. Brandweek. New York: October 15, 2001. Vol. 42, Iss. 38, p. 4 Zip-Pak developed Polypropylene compatible zippers in 2003. Among Ziploc and Zippak's competitors are Presto, a subsidiary of Reynolds, and Pactiv. In 1995, Hefty, one of Reynolds' holdings, came out with a sliding zipper bag.  Products  Ziploc has expanded their products to more than just sandwich bags. Ziploc products now vary from freezer bags to twist n' loc containers. They have expandable bottom bags which stand on their own. They also have big bags. These bags are used for non-food storage and are as big as 2 ft by 2.7 ft (0.61 m √ó 0.82 m). The zip n' steam bags are used to cook food in the microwave. The flexible totes made by Ziploc are used for non-food storage and are as big as . Recently, Ziploc has made an evolved line of sandwich and storage bags. All the bags in this line are made with 25% less plastic and are manufactured using wind power. The Ziploc Evolve sandwich bag was so successful that it was deemed the \\"Best in Show\\" at the 2010 Best New Product Awards in Canada.  Advertising  S. C. Johnson and Son uses written, online, interactive, and televised commercial advertising for their product Ziploc. The advertisements run in: Brazil, Germany, Thailand, The United States and many other countries. Ziploc's head of marketing is Scott Heim who handles their multimillion-dollar advertisement campaigns. In 2002, S. C. Johnson & Son launched its biggest campaign in history, a $50 million-plus campaign to launch a new line of disposable tableware/storage products to be marketed under the Ziploc brand name. S. C. Johnson tends to focus their campaigns in the direction of Television commercials. In the 2002 campaign, $35 million was devoted to a TV campaign. In 2015, they created an ad campaign with Tough Mudder to advertise towards mothers via an obstacle course.  Manufacturing  The manufacturing of Ziploc bags varies among different products. The Ziploc Evolve bag is made using 35% less plastic than traditional Ziploc bags and is manufactured using wind power, a cleaner renewable energy source. The Ziploc Evolve bag is also packaged in recycled paperboard, a technique used to increase the conservation of trees. The regulation Ziploc storage and freezer bag is made from polypropylene plastic resin.  Competition  Ziploc faces strong competition from such competitors as Glad, Hefty, and many privately owned, generic, store brand plastic bags and containers. As Jules Rose, chairman of Sloan's Supermarkets Inc. in New York City, states: \\"This is a highly competitive market with a lot of players and unusually strong private label sales.\\" In 1992, Ziploc was faced with sudden competition from the booming sales of arch-rival First Brands Corporation's Glad-Lock bag. Glad Lock bags jumped 13.1% in 12 weeks in the end of 1992, giving Glad-Lock an 18.4% share of the market compared to Ziploc's 43% share.Mcmurry, Scott. Wall Street Journal. (Eastern edition).

It is located near the River Slaney and just north of Wexford Harbour. Castlebridge is a rapidly expanding suburb of Wexford Town; its population has almost tripled in 20 years, increasing from 783 in 1996 to a population of 1,840 in 2016. History The namesake castle, that originally stood in the town, was dismantled to build buildings such as the Church of Ireland church, which is one of the oldest buildings in Castlebridge. The river that flows through Castlebridge is, contrary to popular belief, actually a canal that replaced the original river. It was dug out by hand to allow sailing cots that loaded up in the various docks of Castlebridge to get to Wexford Town more quickly. Guinness Book of Records Castlebridge is the founding place of the Guinness Book of World Records. On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. He became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (the former being correct). That evening at Castlebridge House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove popular. In 2019, Diageo and the Pattison Group, who own the rights to the Guinness Book of Records, were described as being \\"really taken\\" with Castlebridge House, which has been left derelict, with feasibility studies now in operation by Wexford County Council amid interest by Diageo and the Pattison Group to assess the damage and plan for its eventual restoration, which, in collaboration with Diageo and the Pattison Group, is hoped to become a tourist attraction for the home of the Guinness Book of Records. This was further emphasised by the commencement of the first annual Castlebridge Record Makers Family Fun Festival in 2019, with exhibits on the history of the book and its importance to Castlebridge. Public transport Wexford Bus operate an hourly service, route 877 \\"The Bridge Loop\\", to/from Wexford since February 2019 Mondays to Saturdays inclusive. Bus √âireann route 379 (Wexford - Gorey via Kilmuckridge and Courtown) serves Castlebridge on Mondays and Saturdays whereas route 380 (Wexford-Crossabeg-Wexford) serves Castlebridge on Fridays. Sport The centre of Castlebridge contains a 60x30 foot handball alley. The handball club has produced a number of county and Irish champions and members have competed at World Championships in the United States. Nearby, opposite the Old School (now Castlebridge Community Centre), is the local soccer club, Bridge Rovers FC. Patrick Breen, who lived in Castlebridge but was originally from Bannow in the south of the county, was the first Wexford person to become President of the Gaelic Athletic Association from 1924 until 1926. He was one of only two Wexford people who headed the Gaelic Athletic Association. He also founded the Irish Handball Council and the past pupils union of St. Peters College. He is buried in Castlebridge cemetery. Community Brick production in Castlebridge Community groups situated in the area include the Castlebridge Gospel Choir, which was founded in 2003. Local businesses include the Porter House, which was named 'Pub of the Year' in 2017, several fast food restaurants, a local Centra supermarket, a furniture shop, antiques store and post office.

The prototypical example of an abelian von Neumann algebra is the algebra L‚àû(X, Œº) for Œº a œÉ-finite measure on X realized as an algebra of operators on the Hilbert space L2(X, Œº) as follows: Each f ‚àà L‚àû(X, Œº) is identified with the multiplication operator : \\\\psi \\\\mapsto f \\\\psi. Of particular importance are the abelian von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces, particularly since they are completely classifiable by simple invariants. Though there is a theory for von Neumann algebras on non-separable Hilbert spaces (and indeed much of the general theory still holds in that case) the theory is considerably simpler for algebras on separable spaces and most applications to other areas of mathematics or physics only use separable Hilbert spaces. Note that if the measure spaces (X, Œº) is a standard measure space (that is X ‚àí N is a standard Borel space for some null set N and Œº is a œÉ-finite measure) then L2(X, Œº) is separable. Classification The relationship between commutative von Neumann algebras and measure spaces is analogous to that between commutative C*-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Every commutative von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is isomorphic to L‚àû(X) for some standard measure space (X, Œº) and conversely, for every standard measure space X, L‚àû(X) is a von Neumann algebra. This isomorphism as stated is an algebraic isomorphism. In fact we can state this more precisely as follows: Theorem. Any abelian von Neumann algebra of operators on a separable Hilbert space is *-isomorphic to exactly one of the following *\\\\ell^\\\\infty({1,2, \\\\ldots, n}), \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1 * \\\\ell^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbf{N}) * L^\\\\infty([0,1]) * L^\\\\infty([0,1] \\\\cup {1,2, \\\\ldots, n}), \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1 * L^\\\\infty([0,1] \\\\cup \\\\mathbf{N}). The isomorphism can be chosen to preserve the weak operator topology. In the above list, the interval [0,1] has Lebesgue measure and the sets {1, 2, ..., n} and N have counting measure. The unions are disjoint unions. This classification is essentially a variant of Maharam's classification theorem for separable measure algebras. The version of Maharam's classification theorem that is most useful involves a point realization of the equivalence, and is somewhat of a folk theorem. Although every standard measure space is isomorphic to one of the above and the list is exhaustive in this sense, there is a more canonical choice for the measure space in the case of abelian von Neumann algebras A: The set of all projectors is a \\\\sigma-complete Boolean algebra, that is a pointfree \\\\sigma-algebra. In the special case A=L^\\\\infty(X,\\\\mathfrak{A},\\\\mu) one recovers the abstract \\\\sigma-algebra \\\\mathfrak{A}/{A \\\\mid \\\\mu(A)=0}. This pointfree approach can be turned into a duality theorem analogue to Gelfand-duality between the category of abelian von Neumann algebras and the category of abstract \\\\sigma- algebras. : Let Œº and ŒΩ be non-atomic probability measures on standard Borel spaces X and Y respectively. Then there is a Œº null subset N of X, a ŒΩ null subset M of Y and a Borel isomorphism :: \\\\phi: X \\\\setminus N \\\\rightarrow Y \\\\setminus M, \\\\quad :which carries Œº into ŒΩ. Notice that in the above result, it is necessary to clip away sets of measure zero to make the result work. In the above theorem, the isomorphism is required to preserve the weak operator topology. As it turns out (and follows easily from the definitions), for algebras L‚àû(X, Œº), the following topologies agree on norm bounded sets: # The weak operator topology on L‚àû(X, Œº); # The ultraweak operator topology on L‚àû(X, Œº); # The topology of weak* convergence on L‚àû(X, Œº) considered as the dual space of L1(X, Œº). However, for an abelian von Neumann algebra A the realization of A as an algebra of operators on a separable Hilbert space is highly non-unique. The complete classification of the operator algebra realizations of A is given by spectral multiplicity theory and requires the use of direct integrals.  Spatial isomorphism  Using direct integral theory, it can be shown that the abelian von Neumann algebras of the form L‚àû(X, Œº) acting as operators on L2(X, Œº) are all maximal abelian. This means that they cannot be extended to properly larger abelian algebras. They are also referred to as Maximal abelian self-adjoint algebras (or M.A.S.A.s). Another phrase used to describe them is abelian von Neumann algebras of uniform multiplicity 1; this description makes sense only in relation to multiplicity theory described below. Von Neumann algebras A on H, B on K are spatially isomorphic (or unitarily isomorphic) if and only if there is a unitary operator U: H ‚Üí K such that : U A U^* = B. In particular spatially isomorphic von Neumann algebras are algebraically isomorphic. To describe the most general abelian von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space H up to spatial isomorphism, we need to refer the direct integral decomposition of H. The details of this decomposition are discussed in decomposition of abelian von Neumann algebras. In particular: Theorem Any abelian von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space H is spatially isomorphic to L‚àû(X, Œº) acting on : \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H(x) \\\\, d \\\\mu(x) for some measurable family of Hilbert spaces {Hx}x ‚àà X. Note that for abelian von Neumann algebras acting on such direct integral spaces, the equivalence of the weak operator topology, the ultraweak topology and the weak* topology on norm bounded sets still hold.  Point and spatial realization of automorphisms  Many problems in ergodic theory reduce to problems about automorphisms of abelian von Neumann algebras. In that regard, the following results are useful: Theorem., Chapter IV, Lemma 8.22, p. 275 Suppose Œº, ŒΩ are standard measures on X, Y respectively. Then any involutive isomorphism : \\\\Phi: L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\rightarrow L^\\\\infty(Y, u) which is weak*-bicontinuous corresponds to a point transformation in the following sense: There are Borel null subsets M of X and N of Y and a Borel isomorphism : \\\\eta: X \\\\setminus M \\\\rightarrow Y \\\\setminus N such that # Œ∑ carries the measure Œº into a measure Œº' on Y which is equivalent to ŒΩ in the sense that Œº' and ŒΩ have the same sets of measure zero; # Œ∑ realizes the transformation Œ¶, that is :: \\\\Phi (f) = f \\\\circ \\\\eta^{-1}. Note that in general we cannot expect Œ∑ to carry Œº into ŒΩ. The next result concerns unitary transformations which induce a weak*-bicontinuous isomorphism between abelian von Neumann algebras. Theorem., Chapter IV, Theorem 8.23, p. 277 Suppose Œº, ŒΩ are standard measures on X, Y and : H = \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H_x d \\\\mu(x), \\\\quad K = \\\\int_Y^\\\\oplus K_y d u(y) for measurable families of Hilbert spaces {Hx}x ‚àà X, {Ky}y ‚àà Y. If U : H ‚Üí K is a unitary such that : U \\\\, L^\\\\infty(X, \\\\mu) \\\\, U^* = L^\\\\infty(Y, u) then there is an almost everywhere defined Borel point transformation Œ∑ : X ‚Üí Y as in the previous theorem and a measurable family {Ux}x ‚àà X of unitary operators : U_x: H_x \\\\rightarrow K_{\\\\eta(x)} such that : U \\\\bigg(\\\\int_X^\\\\oplus \\\\psi_x d \\\\mu(x) \\\\bigg)= \\\\int_Y^\\\\oplus \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{d (\\\\mu \\\\circ \\\\eta^{-1})}{d u}(y)} \\\\ U_{\\\\eta^{-1}(y)} \\\\bigg(\\\\psi_{\\\\eta^{-1}(y)}\\\\bigg) d u(y), where the expression in square root sign is the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative of Œº Œ∑‚àí1 with respect to ŒΩ. The statement follows combining the theorem on point realization of automorphisms stated above with the theorem characterizing the algebra of diagonalizable operators stated in the article on direct integrals.

The foundation stallion was an Arabian/Appaloosa/Shetland pony cross. A breed registry was founded in 1954, and within 15 years had registered 12,500 ponies. Today, the Pony of the Americas Club is one of the largest and most active youth-oriented horse breed registries in the US. Although called ponies, POAs have the phenotype of a small horse, combining mainly Arabian and American Quarter Horse attributes. The registry is open, allowing blood from many other breeds, but has strict criteria for entry, including Appaloosa coloration, specified height and other physical characteristics. Although mainly bred for Western riding, the breed has been used for many other disciplines, including driving, endurance riding and some English disciplines. Breed characteristics Ponies are only registered with the Pony of the Americas club if they have Appaloosa coloring visible from , otherwise known as \\"loud\\" Appaloosa coloring. The coloration includes the typical leopard complex characteristics of mottling around the eyes, muzzle and genitalia, as well as visible white sclera of the eyes and striped hooves. Pinto coloration is not allowed, nor is ancestry from a breed noted for pinto coloring, such as the American Paint Horse. The facial profile of the POA is slightly concave. It is a muscular breed, with a deep chest and well-sloped shoulders. The breed averages high. Despite having the size and name \\"pony\\", the breed has the phenotype (physical characteristics) of a small horse of an American Quarter Horse/Arabian type, not a true pony breed. The Pony of the Americas Club will register the offspring of registered POAs, as well crosses with Connemaras, Galiceno ponies, Australian Stock Horses, Morgans and Thoroughbreds, and the original Appaloosa and Arabian breeds. These crosses are allowed into the registry as full members as long as they meet the physical breed requirements. Crosses with other breeds, including Quarter ponies, Shetland ponies, Anglo-Arabs, Spanish Mustangs and Welsh ponies, are accepted on an individual basis. History An Appaloosa, one of the founding breeds of the POA The POA was developed in the United States in the 1950s by Les Boomhower, a Shetland pony breeder in Iowa. The foundation stallion of the breed was an Arabian/Appaloosa/Shetland pony cross with Appaloosa markings named Black Hand. Boomhower appreciated the stallion's conformation and disposition and decided to use him to develop a new breed of Appaloosa-colored ponies. In 1954, Boomhower and a group of associations founded the Pony of the Americas Club, with Black Hand receiving the first registration number. A year later, twelve ponies and twenty-three members had been registered. The club's goal was to develop a medium-sized pony for older children and small adults, with the coloration of the Appaloosa, the refinement of the Arabian and the muscle and bone of an American Quarter Horse. Originally the height requirement called for ponies between ; in 1963 this was changed to a range of , and in 1985 a final change was made to height, raising the upper limit to . Over the first 15 years of its existence, the breed club registered 12,500 ponies. Between the founding of the breed club and the present, the early Shetland blood has been almost completely bred out, in order to maintain and improve the small stock horse look sought by the breed founders. The Pony of the Americas Club hosted its first national convention in 1988, and in 1990, the Club developed a Hall of Fame for its members and ponies. As of 2012, the Pony of the Americas Club has registered over 50,000 ponies. The Club has become one of the equine industry's largest youth-oriented breed registries, with over 2,000 members, and one of the most active, with over 40 affiliated chapters. Although originally developed mainly for Western riding and stock uses, it has also been seen competing in endurance riding, three-day eventing, show hunter, and driving. It jumps well, and can be used for dressage. Originally, breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle; adults could, however, show them in halter or driving classes. In 1973, the age limit for riders was raised to 18, and in 1987 it was decided that adults 19 and over could show horses two to four years old under saddle.

At the time of its completion in 1972, Jardine House was the tallest building in Hong Kong and in Asia. In 1980, the Hopewell Centre usurped the title of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The building is interconnected by the Central Elevated Walkway with buildings of Hongkong Land Limited like Exchange Square and the International Finance Centre. History 1st generation Jardine House in the 1900s. 2nd generation Jardine House in the 1930s. Previous Jardine Houses The first three generations of Jardine Houses were situated at 20 Pedder Street, at the corner of Des Voeux Road Central. The first Jardine House was probably built around 1841 after Jardine's successful bid for its lots on The Praya Central. In 1908, the second Jardine House was built. It was rebuilt in around 1956 as a 16-storey building.gwulo.com: Jardine House (3rd generation) [1957‚Äì1980] The building was sold by Jardines during the land acquisition exercise of the Landmark complex in Central and 20 Pedder Street is now occupied by the Wheelock House. New Jardine House Jardine House (first building from the right) is located in the central business district on Hong Kong Island, next to (from left to right) the BOC Tower, Cheung Kong Center and the HSBC Building. The new building was constructed on a piece of reclaimed land, under a lease term of 75 years, which was secured by Hongkong Land Limited at a record price of HK$258 million in 1970, payable interest free over a period of 10 years. In exchange, the Government agreed that no building directly to the north of Jardine House would ever be built to obstruct its views. As a result, the height of General Post Office building was capped at . Building costs were estimated at $120 million. Construction of the fifty-two-storey building took 16 months. Metal lettering from the Old Jardine House was salvaged and used in the lobby of the New Jardine House.  Design  The building is constructed with a metal frame, and a curtain wall with round windows. The thickness of the structural frame is reduced because of the shape of the windows. Unusually for a Jardine property, elevators were produced by Otis Elevator, while escalators were manufactured by Schindler Elevator. The circular design of the windows has earned the building the nickname, \\"The House of a Thousand Arseholes.\\" Tenants As of August 2019, notable tenants of the building include the following: * Appleby * Ashurst * British Airways * Clifford Chance * Dentons * Dechert * Norton Rose Fulbright * Slaughter and May * Watson Farley & Williams * Zhong Lun Law Firm In popular culture Jardine House was prominently displayed in the 1988 NBC television miniseries Noble House as the headquarters for Struan's in a subtle nod to James Clavell using Jardines as a model for Struan's. It also appeared in establishing shots in The Amsterdam Kill and The Mighty Peking Man (1977). The building was also featured in the 1978 episode titled \\"The Chinese Web\\" of The Amazing Spider Man TV series.

Bahlul became sultan of the dynasty on 19 April 1451 (855 AH).  Early life  Bahlul's grandfather, Malik Bahram Lodhi, a Pashtun tribal chief of Lodhi tribe. He later took service under the governor of Multan, Malik Mardan Daulat. Malik Bahram had a total of about five sons. His eldest son, Malik Sultan Shah Lodi, later served under the Sayyid dynasty ruler Khizr Khan and distinguished himself by killing in the battle later's worst enemy Mallu Iqbal Khan. He was rewarded with the title of Islam Khan and in 1419 appointed the governor of Sirhind. Bahlul, the son of Malik Kala, the younger brother of Malik Sultan was married to Malik Sultan's daughter. In his youth, Bahlul was involved in the trading of horses and once sold his finely bred horses to the Sayyid dynasty Sultan Mohammad Shah. As a payment he was granted a pargana and raised to the status of amir. After the death of Malik Sultan, he became the governor of Sirhind. He was allowed to add Lahore to his charge. Once, Sultan Muhammad Shah asked for his help when the Malwa Sultan Mahmud Shah I invaded his territory. Bahlul joined the imperial army with 20,000 mounted soldiers. By his cleverness, he was able to project himself as a victor over the army of the Malwa Sultan and Sultan Muhammad Shah conferred on him the title of Khan-i-Khanan. He also accepted Bahlul's occupation over a large part of Punjab. In 1443, Bahlul attacked Delhi but he did not succeed. During the reign of last Sayyid ruler Sultan Alam Shah, Bahlul again made another unsuccessful attempt to capture Delhi in 1447. Finally, when Alam Shah retired to Badaun in 1448, a minister of Alam Shah, Hamid Khan invited him to occupy the throne of Delhi. After the voluntary abdication of the throne by Alam Shah, Bahlul Shah ascended the throne of Delhi on 19 April 1451 and adopted the title of Bahlul Shah Ghazi. Alam Shah continued to live in Badaun till his death in July 1478.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.134-36, 139-142Mahajan, V.D.

His cousin and brother-in-law Malik Mahmud Khan alias Qutb-ud-din Khan (Governor of Samana) imprisoned Hamid Khan. In 1479, Sultan Bahlul Lodi defeated and annexed Sharqi dynasty based at Jaunpur. Bahlul did much to stop rebellions and uprisings in his territories, and extended his holdings over Gwalior, Jaunpur and upper Uttar Pradesh. Just like the previous Delhi Sultans, he kept Delhi the capital of his kingdom. In 1486, he appointed his son, Babrak Shah as viceroy of Jaunpur. In time, this proved to be problematic, as his second son, Nizam Khan (Sikandar Lodi) was named successor, and a power struggle ensued upon his death in July 1489 in the hands of Maharana Pratap.Sultan Bahlul Khan Lodi The Muntakhabu-‚Äôr≈´kh by Al-BadƒÅoni (16th-century historian), Packard Humanities Institute.

Hongkong Land has also redeveloped The Forum, the retail block at Exchange Square, into a 5-storey office block, which is wholly leased to Standard Chartered Bank. In early 2012, a new brand \\"LANDMARK\\" was launched covering the company's four most famous shopping destinations The Landmark, Alexandra House, Chater House and Prince's Building, which are linked by pedestrian bridges, part of the Central Elevated Walkway. It was accompanied by a new logo \\"L\\", representing LANDMARK and luxury retail. The company has also developed three luxury residential buildings on Hong Kong Island in recent years, namely Serenade, The Sail at Victoria and Ivy on Belcher's. In October 2006, Hongkong Land hosted the CENTRAL Rat Race for the first time in the heart of Central, which has since become an annual event.

The company has recently entered Nanjing, Hangzhou and Wuhan to develop residential/mixed-use properties. History=Founding Hongkong Land was formed on 2 March 1889 and was initially named The Hongkong Land Investment and Agency Company Limited. It was founded by two prominent businessmen in Hong Kong ‚Äî Sir Paul Chater and James Johnstone Keswick. Besides property, Chater was also known for his interests in brokerage and bullion while Keswick was Tai-pan of Jardine, Matheson and Company Limited. Chater had been lobbying for some time in government circles for a new reclamation project in the Victoria District in Central Hong Kong and the construction of a new Praya along the harbour front. Six days after the formation of Hongkong Land, he got his way. The reclaimed land was to yield an area of of building land some wide along a new waterfront road that came to be known as Chater Road. This \\"Central Reclamation\\" has since become a core element of Hong Kong's Central District, forming as it does the land between today's Des Voeux Road Central and Connaught Road Central, including Statue Square and Chater Road itself. The four-storey New Oriental Building was the first commercial building on the Central Reclamation built on Marine Lot 278 at No. 2 on the then newly formed Connaught Road and completed in 1898.Gwulo: New Oriental Building This building was demolished in the early 1960s and the site is today occupied by the AIA Central building. The Chater Road reclamation can thus be seen as the starting point for Hongkong Land's development of \\"Central\\" as Hong Kong's business district. Early years Following construction of The New Oriental Building, between June 1904 and December 1905, Central saw the completion of five major buildings that were Hong Kong's first 'skyscrapers'. These included the Alexandra Building in 1904, which was built on the location of today's Alexandra House. By 1941 the company possessed 13 major properties in Central. The most valuable among them were Marina House, Alexandra Building, Holland House, Queen's Building and Prince's Building. Hongkong Land ceased business for three years and eight months during the Second World War. But when the company reclaimed its office buildings in September 1945, they were all in good structural condition. The first post-war project came in 1947, adding three more floors to the five- storey Marina House. Then came the redevelopment of 11 and 13 Queen's Road Central into the nine-storey Edinburgh House, which was completed in 1950. These buildings stood on the sites of today's Edinburgh Tower and York House. At the same time, three old buildings on a triangular site formed by Des Voeux Road, Chater Road and Ice House Street ‚Äî Alexandra Building, Royal Building and Chung Tin Building ‚Äî were demolished to make way for the 13-storey Alexandra House. 1960s and 1970s By the mid-1960s Hongkong Land owned nine major office blocks as well as the shopping complex in Prince's Building and The Mandarin Hotel. These were connected by the first pedestrian bridge. Since then, Hongkong Land's buildings have been linked to one another, forming a network of commercial buildings. During the 1970s, the company began investing in international markets, building a portfolio of properties in Australia, Hawaii, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Perhaps the biggest feat of Group Chief Executive Vernon Robert's leadership during this period was the construction of the Connaught Centre. On 1 June 1970, the company paid a then world-record price of HK$258 million at public auction for an important new central reclamation site. On completion in 1973, the 52-level, Connaught Centre was Hong Kong's largest and most advanced office block. It was renamed Jardine House on 1 January 1989. Redevelopment during the 1970s of Hongkong Land's \\"Central\\" portfolio began with the demolition of Alexandra House and the construction of what was to be the third building to bear that name on the site. The new 36-level project, which was finished in 1976, and was joined to Prince's Building, Swire House, The Mandarin Hotel and Connaught Centre by overhead walkways. Today, it forms the hub of a footbridge network connecting Hongkong Land's commercial portfolio. Hongkong Land developed residential properties in mid-levels, including May Tower in 1974 and Branksome in 1976. The company also acquired a large tract of land in Pok Fu Lam and started construction of the massive Chi Fu Fa Yuen complex. This consisted of 20 towers with 4,258 flats, along with a shopping centre, restaurants and recreational facilities.Chan, Chi-kau, Johnnie Casire, \\"Community development and management of private sector housing estates in Hong Kong\\" , University of Hong Kong, August 1995 1980s and 1990s The 1980s saw Hongkong Land diversify from its usual property interests, as it bought significant shareholdings in Hong Kong Telephone Company Ltd and Hong Kong Electric Holdings Ltd. In 1982, Hongkong Land acquired the last major site available in Central with a bid of HK$4.7 billion and began construction of the first phase of Exchange Square. It was the largest commercial complex in the territory at the time and the most technologically sophisticated. The year 1982 saw the property market in Hong Kong plunge dramatically, and in the following two years rentals halved. This was a period of financial difficulty for Hongkong Land as it looked to reorganise itself and reduce its debt burden through asset disposals and restructuring measures. Hongkong Land sold its international properties as well as its non-core assets in Hong Kong, including its interests in Hong Kong Telephone and Hong Kong Electric. But its core assets in the heart of Central were left untouched. In 1984 the property market began to look up again and in late 1985 Hongkong Land completed and opened the first phase of its new flagship property, One and Two Exchange Square. In 1988, the final third phase of Exchange Square was completed and The Forum was opened. The Landmark, another major focal point for Central, was completed in two phases in 1980 and 1983. It comprised two 47-level office blocks, Gloucester Tower and Edinburgh Tower, and a large five-level shopping podium. During the 1990s, Hongkong Land continued to enhance its core commercial office portfolio in Hong Kong, while beginning to look at investment opportunities in other Asian cities. In Hong Kong, Central office space supply increased substantially in late 1990s and in 1997 the company launched the redevelopment of Swire House, now named Chater House, as a world class building in the heart of Central. In Singapore, the company began construction of One Raffles Link, an office building in the centre of the city that was an early example of sustainable construction. The building was completed in 2000.

Sinai  Charnel House at Saint Catherine's Monastery, Mount Sinai Charnel house in √âvora Skulls in a charnel house Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai is famous for having a working charnel house. Saint Catherine's was founded by Justinian in the early 6th century, on the site of an older monastery founded about 313 AD and named for Helena of Constantinople. The monastery comprises the whole Autonomous Church of Sinai, under the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The site lies at the foot of Mount Sinai where Christians believe Moses received the Ten Commandments.Holy Bible NIV: Exodus 24 Since the Sinai is an inhospitable place, the brethren of St. Catherine's have struggled to eke out a subsistence-level existence. The difficulty in establishing a large cemetery in the rocky ground notwithstanding, relics are also gathered for temporal and spiritual reasons: a reminder to the monks of their impending death and fate in the hereafter. The Archbishop of Saint Catherine's is commonly the Abbot as well. After death, he is afforded the dignity of a special niche within the \\"Skull-House\\".  North America  A charnel house is also a structure commonly seen in some Native American societies of the Eastern United States. Major examples are the Hopewell cultures and Mississippian cultures. These houses were used specifically for mortuary services and, although they required many more resources to build and maintain than a crypt, they were widely used. They offered privacy and shelter as well as enough workspace for mortuary proceedings. These proceedings included cremation (in the included crematorium) as well as defleshing of the body before the cremation. Once the houses had served their purpose, they were burned to the ground and covered by earth, creating a sort of burial mound. Anthropologist William F. Romain in Mysteries of the Hopewell notes that these charnel houses were built in the form of a square, and their diagonals could be aligned to the direction of maximum and minimum moon-sets both north and south.  England  Charnel houses do not appear to have been common in England. The earliest reference found to a charnel house was in the parish of St Mary-at-Hill in London, during the sixteenth century. Few other charnel houses are attested in the seventeenth century, usually within overcrowded urban contexts.cf. N.J.G.

Biography Hatch was born Provine Hatch Jr., in Sledge, Mississippi. He learned to play the harmonica from his father. Hearing blues and gospel music, Hatch knew he wanted to make music for a living. When he was 14 years old, his family moved to Helena, Arkansas, and the blues scene there caught his attention. Hatch joined the Navy in 1943. After his tour of duty, he relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1946. He worked for a cartage company for two years and then founded his own cartage business and married. In the early 1950s, Hatch began jamming in blues clubs in Kansas City. He closed his business in 1954 and took a job with Hallmark Cards. In 1955, he formed and fronted his own band, playing on the weekends and a few nights a week. This group continued to perform for more than 20 years. By the late 1950s, Hatch's harmonica style became influenced by Chicago blues players such as Little Walter, Snooky Pryor and Junior Wells. A performance by Hatch was recorded by German exchange students in 1971, and these recordings were released on the album The Little Hatchet Band, but its distribution was limited to Germany and Belgium. Hatch retired from Hallmark in 1986. His band, Little Hatch and the House Rockers, was hired as the house band of the Grand Emporium Saloon in Kansas City. A cassette tape of his blues performances at the Grand Emporium was released in 1988. In 1993, the Modern Blues label released Well, All Right!, his first nationally distributed album. In 1997, Chad Kassem opened Blue Heaven Studios and founded the APO label. Kassem had befriended Hatch in the mid-1980s and asked him to be his first signed recording artist. The album Goin' Back was released in 2000, followed by Rock with Me Baby in 2003. From 1999 to 2001, Hatch occasionally toured other parts of the United States and twice toured Europe. He settled in Kansas City and performed locally, frequently playing at BB's Lawnside Bar-B-Q and other venues. Hatch died in El Dorado Springs, Missouri, in January 2003.

The idea behind Pax Syriana is that Syria (as it existed during the Ottoman Empire and as it was later partitioned into), through diplomacy and military strength, could secure a role for the United States by its being a necessary ally to ensure peace in Lebanon. Origin (World War I) Former CIA officer Robert Baer has said \\"Syriana\\" is a think tank term and \\"a metaphor that the Middle East is made up of countries with false borders\\", referring to the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement \\"where the Europeans were sitting down and redrawing the borders.\\" According to Baer, since the First World War, the term has referred to the strategy of dividing existing states in such a manner as to ensure future infighting, thus necessitating a strategic role of a third set of nations, as arms suppliers and peace brokers. Later references A later 1976 reference was published in Time magazine in 1976, referring to Syrian efforts to impose a truce during the early years of the Lebanese Civil War. It has recently been used to refer to the period between 1990 and 2005 when there was reduced conflict within Lebanon, usually attributed to Syrian hegemony and military domination in the region. It may be used with emphasis on the relative calm following suppression of the Lebanese Civil War, or on suggestions of Syria's having intentions for annexing or otherwise pacifying Lebanon. Syrian Lebanese war, 1976 On July 4, 1986, Syrian troops entered West Beirut for the first time since being expelled during the 1982 Israeli invasion. Approximately 500 Syrian troops, working with the Lebanese Army and police, cleared roadblocks, closed militia offices, and collected weapons. In mid-February 1987, however, a new round of fighting broke out in West Beirut, this time between Druze and Shia militias, both of which were regarded as Syrian allies. The combat was described by witnesses as being of unrivaled intensity in twelve years of war, with the militiamen using formations of Soviet-made T-54 tanks that Syria had supplied to both sides. Five days of combat caused an estimated 700 casualties and set much of West Beirut aflame.The Library of Congress, Syria : A Country Study Syria acted decisively to stop the chaos in West Beirut, and it seized the opportunity to reimpose its hegemony over the areas in Lebanon from which it had been evicted by Israel in 1982. On February 22, 1987, it dispatched 7,500 troops, configured in two brigades and a battalion, from eastern Lebanon. The Syrian troops, most of whom were veteran commandos, closed down some seventy militia offices, rounded up and arrested militia leaders, confiscated arms caches, deployed troops along the major roads and at Beirut International Airport, established checkpoints, and sent squads on patrol in the streets. The Syrian Army did not shy away from violence in its effort to restore order to the Lebanese capital. In the first two days of its police operation, Syrian troops shot some fifteen Lebanese of various militias. Then on February 24 a dozen trucks full of Syrian commandos entered the Basta neighborhood, a Shia stronghold, and attacked the Fathallah barracks, the headquarters of the Hezbollah organization. There, Syrian troops killed eighteen Hezbollah militants. In mid-April the Syrian Army deployed troops south of Beirut. Approximately 100 Syrian commandos, fighting alongside soldiers of the Lebanese Army's Sixth Brigade, occupied key positions along the strategic coastal highway linking Beirut with southern Lebanon and took control of the bridge over the Awali River, near Sidon. By mid-1987 the Syrian Army appeared to have settled into Beirut for a protracted stay. Lebanon's anomie was regarded by Syrian officials as an unacceptable risk to Syrian security. The government of Syria appeared prepared to occupy Beirut permanently, if necessary. The senior Syrian military commander in Lebanon, Brigadier General Ghazi Kanaan, said that militia rule of Lebanon had ended and that the Syrian intervention was \\"open-ended,\\" implying that Syria would occupy West Beirut indefinitely. Meanwhile, Syrian officials indicated that thousands of additional Syrian troops would probably be sent to Beirut to ensure stability. Kanaan declared that Syria would take full responsibility for the security of foreign embassies in West Beirut, and he invited foreign missions to return. Kanaan also promised that Syria would expend all possible efforts to secure the release of Western hostages held by Lebanese terrorists. Other usage The name of the 2005 film Syriana was apparently inspired by Pax Syriana and the term Syriana as used by Washington thinktanks as per former CIA operative Robert Baer. According to the film's publicity materials, \\"Syriana\\" was \\"a very real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East.\\" In an online discussion with The Washington Post in November 2005, Syriana director Stephen Gaghan said he saw Syriana as \\"a great word that could stand for man's perpetual hope of remaking any geographic region to suit his own needs.\\" See also *History of Syria *History of Lebanon *UN Security Council Resolution 1559 *Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act *Syrian occupation of Lebanon *Petroleum politics References Category:Modern history of Syria Category:20th century in Lebanon Category:Latin political words and phrases Syriana Category:20th century in international relations ","title":"Pax Syriana"},{"id":"1496483","text":"Jean Armand Charlemagne (born Bourget (Seine) 30 November 1753 ‚Äì died Paris 6 March 1838) was a French dramatic author.

Norlane is bordered in the south by Cowies Creek, in the north by Cox Road, in the west by Thompson Road and in the east by Station Street. It is about 7 km from the Geelong central business district and approximately 70 km from the state capital, Melbourne. It is about one kilometre from the shore of Corio Bay. At the 2016 Census, Norlane had a population of 8,306.  History  The suburb of Norlane was named after Norman Lane, a local serviceman from the district, who died working on the Thai-Burma Railway in 1943, after being captured in Singapore. Norlane post office opened on 17 December 1945 as development of the suburb began. Norlane West post office opened on 13 October 1958. With the enormous demand for housing in the early 1950s, people resorted to living in small dwellings, tents and partially-completed buildings. The Housing Commission of Victoria provided accommodation for families unable to rent or to afford the purchase of their own home. In 1947 the government Housing Commission began its house-building program in Norlane, and when its program was completed in 1976, there were 2,464 Commission houses available for low- income renters. Much of the housing was for employees at the nearby Ford Motor Company, International Harvester, Shell, Pilkington Glass, Henderson's Springs and Pivot Phosphate factories. Workers seeking employment (among them wartime migrants building new lives) flocked to Geelong to take up jobs, and the Victorian Government responded through its Housing Commission, by buying up broad acres north of the Ford plant and building homes by the hundreds. A number of the houses built in Norlane were prefabricated units imported from the Netherlands and France. In a decade, Norlane was transformed from paddocks to busy working class suburbia. By 1960, the urban landscape of streets, roads, crescents, courts and boulevards seen today had extended as far as Corio Village. For Geelong, it was an exciting time. The suburb contains one site listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, the Ford Motor Company Complex on the Princes Highway (Melbourne Road).\\"Ford Motor Company Complex (H2305)\\". Victorian Heritage Register. Heritage Victoria. Retrieved 2014-03-23. Demographics A 1925 view of the area that became Norlane. The Princes Highway (Melbourne Road), near Cowies Creek, in 1957. The Ford Motor Company factory is visible in the background. In the 2001 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing, the population of the Norlane census area was 8,628 people, in an area of 5.1 square kilometres. Females outnumbered males, with 4,436 females and 4,192 males as of 2001. Some 24% of the population of Norlane were born outside of Australia. The predominant age group in Norlane is 40 ‚Äì 49 years. The three most common forms of dwelling were (in decreasing order): a separate house, a flat or apartment, and a semi- detached house.Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing, accessed 31 January 2007 Residents enjoy generous land parcels, ample backyards with single story weatherboard housing built during the 1960s on 600 to 800 square metres blocks, progressively brick based sud-division buildings and double story dwellings on approximately 300 square metre lots are beginning to become more common, with higher rise especially where views of the peninsula from a higher rise viewpoint are applicable. In August 2010 the median sale price of houses in the area is $184,500 up 15% from the previous year but generally raising by a modest 10% per year on average. 2002 saw a 38.9% growth in real estate value. Given the socio-economic status of the suburb, there is a high demand for rental accommodation in Norlane, with an expected rental return of $180 to $220 per week for a three-bedroom house. In 2018 saw a median 3 bedroom house price rise to approximately $350,000 with 2017-2018 period jumping over 20%. Rental yield is approximately 4% depending on quality of the property. Two bedroom unit saw a jump to $283,000 with rental yield of just over 5%. A majority of residents of are employed (in decreasing order) in engineering (6.83%), management and commerce (2.2%) and food, hospitality and personal services industries (1.5%). Norlane has several churches. In 2001, the five strongest religious affiliations in the area were (in descending order): Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, Presbyterian and Uniting. Facilities Affordable housing close to shopping, transport and Geelong's largest employers make Norlane a popular suburb. Norlane's Waterworld boasts 2 25m indoor heated swimming pools, spa, gymnasium, two water slides, diving pool, outdoor children's pools and a splash-pad. Water World is located at Cox Road on the northern border of the suburb. Labuan Square shopping centre opened in 1954. but has since been largely superseded by the Corio Shopping Centre. Labuan Square, and other smaller shopping precincts around Norlane provide residents convenience within walking distance. Norlane Hotel on the Princes Highway is the largest local gambling venue and its bistro offers reasonably-priced food. Additionally, there is the Norlane RSL Sub-Branch situated at 29 Rose Avenue. Bunnings opened a store on Princes Highway in early 2013. There are three nearby boat ramps: Corio Bay Boat Club, Grammar School Lagoon Boat Ramp and St Helens Boat Ramp. There are seven parks covering nearly 9% of the total area, with ovals and facilities for skating and ball games.  Schools  A number of primary schools opened in Norlane between 1955 and 1962, and Norlane High School in 1959. Norlane Primary School in Thrush Street closed in 2004 and became a private Islamic college - Isik College. That closed several years later and the buildings were demolished in 2013. Norlane High School closed in 2012 and was demolished two years later. Primary and secondary students are now catered for by Northern Bay P-12 College, a multi-campus college which was founded in 2011 as a result of a merger of nine former state school (Corio West PS, Norlane High School, Flinders Peak SC, Corio South PS, Norlane West PS, Corio Bay PS, North Shore PS, Rosewall PS, and Corio PS).

Originally bred to pull carriages, they are used today primarily as show ponies. The breed does not have its own stud book, but shares one with the Hackney horse in all countries that have an official Hackney Stud Book Registry.  History  The Hackney Pony was originally developed by Christopher Wilson. He used Sir George, a Hackney stallion foaled in 1866, to breed with Fell Pony mares, and then interbred the offspring to make a fixed type of pony. He desired to create not a miniaturized horse, but rather a true pony with such characteristics. Extracting the large trot and other characteristics of the hackney horse and applying them to this true type of pony, he was successful in creating the form which was desired. This is one case of an entire type of breed that is formed in a controlled, private environment. In addition to the mixing of Fell ponies and Hackney horses, the Hackney Pony probably also has much Welsh Pony blood. First known as Wilson Ponies, they were usually kept out all year, wintering in the inhospitable Fells with little food or care. This developed the breed's great toughness and endurance. By the 1880s the breed was established, and was very much liked for its great trotting ability and class. The breed was used in Great Britain as carriage horses and were also imported into the United States. They were considered to be very stylish to drive during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when automobiles were still uncommon. After horses were replaced by cars as a primary means of transportation, Hackney ponies, along with many other horse breeds, were deemed unable to contribute to society and declined considerably. After World War II, however, the Hackney pony developed into primarily a show pony, and remain being bred for that purpose today. Thus their drastic decline in numbers and plight toward extinction came to an end, and the breed was popularized once again. Many Hackney pony breeders today continue to develop a quality, refined pony. In the United States, Hackney ponies have also had considerable influence on the American version of the Shetland pony. They were crossbred with Shetlands to produce the American Shetland show pony of today, a type which displays many of the refined characteristics of the Hackney pony. The Hackney has also influenced the miniature horse, adding refinement and action.  Characteristics  A Hackney harness pony  General appearance  The Hackney pony may not be above and usually range between 12 and 14 hh. It should have true pony characteristics, and should not be a scaled down version of the Hackney Horse. The pony should have a small pony head, carried high, with alert and pricked ears and large, intelligent eyes. The neck should be muscular, arched, and carried proudly. Hackney ponies should have powerful shoulders, a compact back, and a light frame. The legs are strong with good joints, but the bone is usually fine. The feet are very hard, and are usually allowed to grow long in the toe to accentuate the action of the pony. The tail is often set and is carried high. They usually have even more exaggerated action than the Hackney horse, knees rising as high as possible and hocks coming right under the body. The action should be fluid, spectacular, and energetic.  Colors  Hackney ponies may be black, bay (which includes brown), or chestnut. Bay is by far the most common color, but black is also relatively common. Chestnuts, on the other hand, are extremely rare; their color is usually particularly light, and chestnut ponies often possess flaxen manes and tails. Many hackneys also have some white markings. Due to the sabino gene, common in the breed, the Hackney Pony may have white markings on its body as well as on its legs and head. The sabino gene (possibly a gene complex), is generally unpredictable, so breeding solely for body white marks can be difficult.  Temperament  The Hackney Pony also has a reputation for being tenacious and fearless, qualities that are seen in top-tier show ponies. They are very brave, alert, and active, and possess great stamina. Generally, they have pony character. Hackneys have a reputation for being friendly toward humans, and are suitable for both show and as companion animals.  Show Types  An example of a road pony showing under saddle. In the show ring, the Hackney pony is most commonly seen being driven in harness. They are also shown under saddle, usually as road ponies, and in hand as weanlings or yearlings. The Hackney pony division recognizes six categories of harness exhibition: Hackney Pony (cob tail), Harness Pony, Hackney Roadster, Park Pleasure Driving, Show Pleasure Driving, and Country Pleasure Driving.USEF Rule Book, Hackney pony division Their world's championship is the Kentucky State Fair World's Championship Horse Show in Louisville, Kentucky, and their national championship is the American Royal in Kansas City, Missouri. Most classes require both a ‚ÄúPark Trot,‚Äù executed in a highly collected manner and then exhibitors are given the command, ‚ÄúShow your pony,‚Äù which permits an increase in speed to exhibit each pony to its best advantage. Excessive speed is undesirable and is penalized.  Hackney roadster  Hackney roadsters, or Road ponies, like roadsters, are shown to a two-wheel bike, or sulky. The driver always wears racing silks, usually with their barn represented by the colors of the silks. Road ponies are judged upon their action when trotting, as well as their speed, conformation, and temperament. In addition to being shown with a bike, road ponies are shown under saddle by junior exhibitors or hooked to a four-wheel wagon. Wagon classes are relatively new but growing in popularity; the World's Championship Horse Show offered a wagon class for the first time in 2006.  Hackney (cobtail) ponies  A Hackney cobtail pony. In the Cobtail pony division, ponies are shown with a tightly braided mane and appear to have a docked tail (though usually created only by trimming the tail short, not actual docking). They are generally taller, for any height of pony is permitted to show in the division as long as it is still a pony, not exceeding 14.2 hands.  Harness ponies  Harness ponies are perhaps the most elegant and beautiful of the hackney ponies. Whereas speed is a major factor among road ponies, harness ponies should be more collected, exhibiting a very animated and airy trot. A Hackney must be smaller to show in the harness pony division, because it is required that the pony be or under. They are shown to a four-wheel viceroy and possess a full mane and tail. The typical apparel for driving harness ponies is a suit for men, and a dress or other formal wear for women.  Pleasure ponies  There are also three pleasure driving classes for the breed, Park Pleasure, Show Pleasure, and Country Pleasure. There are no height requirements except that the Hackney be a pony, and the pony can have a long or docked tail. Pleasure ponies are shown to a two-wheeled cart, and the driver usually wears more casual dress. They are shown at a road gait, pleasure trot, and flat walk. Temperament is a more primary factor for judges; the pleasure pony should indeed be a pleasure to drive.  Other types  Some Hackney ponies are shown in one or two pairs in harness, though classes which are designated for this are fairly rare.

He is the current performance coach for A-League club Adelaide United. Club career=Europe He featured for FC Twente in the 1993‚Äì94 season as a substitute but could only string together three games before deciding to sign for VVV-Venlo of the Eerste Divisie in the following season. After two successful seasons playing for VVV where he scored 34 goals, he joined Roda JC in 1996 and impressed with 13 goals back in the top-flight, and also scored as Roda JC won the 1997 KNVB Cup Final. Sibon moved to Ajax Amsterdam in 1997 but was frustrated and hampered by a lack of first team action, having been relegated to the bench by the likes of Wamberto, Shota Arveladze, Georgi Kinkladze and crowd favourite Brian Laudrup. An offer by English Premiership club Sheffield Wednesday prompted Sibon to transfer to the Yorkshire club in 1999 for the price of ¬£2 million. Joining him at Sheffield Wednesday were Dutch international Wim Jonk and the Belgian Gilles De Bilde. After spending four seasons with Sheffield Wednesday, where he scored 43 goals overall for the club and was the club's highest goal scorer for three consecutive seasons, also winning two consecutive player of the year awards, he decided to return to the Eredivisie and joined SC Heerenveen in 2002. He featured for Heerenveen in 38 matches and scored 19 goals in two seasons before signing for PSV in 2004. He won the Dutch Eredivise title in 2004‚Äì05, contending with Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Robert for a first team spot. In July 2006 he joined Bundesliga side N√ºrnberg on a free transfer. He left the club one year later, signing a two-year contract with his old team Heerenveen. Australia Sibon left the Netherlands in May 2010, when he signed with Australian A-League club Melbourne Heart for their inaugural season, coached by fellow Dutchman John van 't Schip. He quickly cemented his position in the starting line-up, playing mainly in a playmaker role, but still managing to show his skills as a striker by scoring seven goals, Melbourne Heart's second top-scorer for the season. He became a fan favourite for his often-dangerous free-kicks, including a goal from a stunning 20-metre curling free kick, during the second ever Melbourne Derby. In the week before the Heart's final game of the season, Sibon announced he would not be continuing his career with the club. He was told he would not be offered a contract renewal, likely to his disappointment, after having stated earlier in the month that he wanted to spend another year in Melbourne. Back to Europe On 27 June 2011, it was announced Sibon had signed with his former team SC Heerenveen thus beginning his third stint at the club. The final match of his career was the May 2012 defeat by Feyenoord which curiously sealed Europa League football for Heerenveen. International career In the summer of 2008, Sibon was named in the Netherlands squad for the Beijing Olympics. He scored a 93rd-minute equaliser in the 2‚Äì2 draw against the United States and the winning penalty in the 73rd minute against Japan. This placed him amongst 18 players who scored two goals or more in the tournament.

Louis Vuitton store at the base of the northeastern corner of the Landmark, at the intersection of Des Voeux Road and Pedder Street. Landmark is a commercial complex owned by Hongkong Land in Central, Hong Kong. The complex consists of three office towers, namely Gloucester Tower, Edinburgh Tower and York House. Its retail podium, Landmark Atrium, forms the core component of the shopping mall LANDMARK. The Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel is located in the lower floors of Edinburgh Tower, and it is directly linked to the retail floors of Landmark Atrium. History It is partly built on the site of the former Hong Kong Hotel, which was in its day the best known hotel on Hong Kong Island. In the 1970s, Hongkong Land started the development of the Landmark under its Central Redevelopment Scheme. The first phase of the project was completed in the late 1970s and the whole project was completed in 1983. When the development was completed in 1983, the development consisted of a series of levels of shops surrounding a large central atrium with two office towers on top, known as Edinburgh Tower and Gloucester Tower respectively, and an annex building, known as the Landmark East. In 2003, Part of Edinburgh Tower was converted into The Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel, a boutique hotel. Recent development In 2002, Hongkong Land announced a 1 billion dollar plan - The Landmark Scheme - to renovate The Landmark. The whole scheme included extending the existing shopping atrium to 3/F and 4/F of the building, introducing a department store Harvey Nichols and a hotel The Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and the redevelopment of The Landmark East into a new 14-floor office tower named York House. The scheme was completed in October 2006 with the opening of York House. To expand and upgrade the Landmark's retail offerings, architects Aedas and Kohn Pedersen Fox carved out areas in the existing retail atrium for several two-story flagship stores and added two new retail floors. A wall of folded glass panels envelopes the retail podium. In early 2012, Hongkong Land launched a new brand \\"LANDMARK\\" for its retail portfolio in Central, covering its four interconnected shopping arcades at The Landmark, Alexandra House, Chater House and Prince's Building. The retail complex of the Landmark was subsequently branded as LANDMARK ATRIUM. At the same time, The Landmark (the complex) itself was renamed as Landmark.

They are known commonly as samphires, glassworts, or saltworts. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is most diverse in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.  Description  The species of Sarcocornia are perennial herbs, subshrubs or shrubs. They are taking an erect or prostrate, creeping form. The new stems are fleshy and divided into joint-like segments. Older stems are woody and not segmented. The oppositely arranged leaves are borne on fleshy, knobby petioles, their base decurrent and connate (thus forming the segments), the blades forming small, triangular tips with narrow scarious margin. Sarcocornia pacifica, inflorescences The terminal or lateral inflorescences are spike-like, made up of joint-like segments with tiny paired cymes emerging from the joints. Each cyme consists of three (rarely five) flowers completely embedded between the bract and immersed in the fleshy tissue of the axis. The flowers of a cyme are arranged in a transverse row, the central flower separating the lateral flowers, with tissue of the axis between them. The hermaphrodite or unisexual flowers are more or less radially symmetric, with a perianth of three or four fleshy tepals connate nearly to the apex, one or two stamens, and an ovary with two or three stigmas. The perianth is persistent in fruit. The fruit wall (pericarp) is membranous. The vertical seed is ellipsoid, with light brown, membranous, hairy seed coat, the hairs can be strongly curved, hooked, or conic, straight or slightly curved. The seed contains no perisperm (feeding tissue). The basic chromosome number is x=9. The species are diploid (18 chromosomes), tetraploid (36), hexaploid (54), or octoploid (72).  Distribution and habitat  Sarcocornia is distributed worldwide, especially in warm-temperate regions with mediterranean climate, and to some extent in the subtropics. The distribution area covers North and South America, Europe (Mediterranean basin and Atlantic coasts with mild winters), southern Africa, and Australia. These halophytic plants often occur in wet saline habitat types, and occasionally in dry saline soils. They can be found in habitats such as estuaries, salt marshes, tidal flats, seacliffs, salt pans, and saline sediment in seasonal desert waterways. An exception is Sarcocornia xerophila, growing in semidesert on quartz soils with low salinity.  Phylogenetics  Sarcocornia/Salicornia began to evolve during the Mid Miocene from ancestors in Eurasia, developing four phylogenetic lineages: the first was the Eurasian Sarcocornia clade, further diversifying into the American Sarcocornia clade, then the Salicornia clade, and the South African/Australian Sarcocornia clade. As Salicornia (comprising all annual, more frost tolerant species) has evolved within Sarcocornia, the genus Sarcocornia is paraphyletic. The prostrate, mat-forming growth seems to have evolved several times independently. It is probably advantageous in habitats with prolonged flooding, high tidal movement and frost.  Systematics  Sarcocornia fruticosa Sarcocornia perennis Sarcocornia neei Sarcocornia quinqueflora The genus Sarcocornia was first described in 1978 by A J Scott, thus separating the perennial species from the closely related annual Salicornia, additionally containing some species formerly belonging to Arthrocnemum. The type species is Sarcocornia perennis. The taxonomy of the genus has long been unclear. Study of the plants themselves is difficult because only fresh specimens can be used in the clear differentiation of taxa; many useful characters are not present in dry herbarium specimens. Many sources accept the genus, but some authors continue to question its validity. Molecular genetic studies revealed, that Sarcocornia/Salicornia form a monophyletic group, and Sarcocornia is paraphyletic. There are between 25 and 30 species in the genus, forming three clades. The center of diversity lies in southern Africa (Cape Floristic Region). * Eurasian Sarcocornia clade: Until 2009, just Sarcocornia fruticosa and Sarcocornia perennis were known here, since then, six new species have been described: ** Sarcocornia alpini (Lag.)

The firm was founded as The Life Insurance Company of Virginia in 1871. In 1986, Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance, which became Aon plc in 1987. In 1996, Life of Virginia was sold to GE Capital. In May 2004, Genworth Financial was formed out of various insurance businesses of General Electric in the largest IPO of that year. Genworth Financial is incorporated in Virginia. Genworth Financial has three segments: Retirement & Protection, US Mortgage Insurance, and International. Products and services include life and long-term care insurance, mortgage insurance, and annuities. Company history A.G. McIlwaine was the company‚Äôs first president. Begun by two dozen Petersburg investors, the Life Insurance Company of Virginia offered its first policies to local customers before expanding to Richmond, Virginia. Under general agent F.W. Chamberlayne, the Richmond Department attracted a large number of new clients. Within the first decade, the client base expanded beyond the South. As the Life Insurance Company of Virginia grew, the headquarters were moved to Richmond, Virginia. By the turn of the twentieth century, the company offered products through different divisions,. The ‚ÄúOrdinary Division‚Äù of the company offered whole life annuity options and related products, the ‚ÄúIntermediate Division‚Äù offered term life products, endowment policies, and limited payment policies, and an industrial division offered inexpensive products. Colloquially known as ‚ÄúLife of Virginia‚Äù, the company expanded its portfolio in the 20th century. Beginning with its first annuities business written in 1928, the company grew to include different mortgage insurance, lifestyle protection, and long-term care products and options. Over the following decades, the company has undergone several major acquisitions, beginning in 1986 when Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance for $557 million, which became AON Corporation the following year. In 1995, almost a decade after the acquisition, GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric, announced its plan to buy most of AON Corporation‚Äôs life insurance business, including Life of Virginia. Under GE Capital, Life of Virginia became a part of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., before becoming GE Capital Assurance Company. The company was incorporated as Genworth Financial, Inc. on October 23, 2003, formed out of several GE Capital insurance companies. On May 25, 2004, Genworth became a publicly traded company in the largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2004. GE sold its remaining stake in the company in 2006 for an estimated $2.8 billion. In 2007, another GE Capital insurance company, First Colony Life Insurance Company, merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Assurance Company, one of the entities within Genworth Financial, Inc, also in 2007, Sun Life Financial bought the Employee Benefits Group (EBG) of Genworth Financial, putting Sun Life Financial on the top market for Employee Benefits programs. As of December 31, 2011, Genworth Financial, Inc. had more than 15 million customers in more than 25 countries. In 2009, Genworth held an IPO for its Canadian subsidiary, Genworth MI Canada, on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising $850 million. On April 1, 2013, Genworth announced the completion of a legal entity reorganization, with the result being the creation of a new ultimate holding company. This restructuring separated the U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries from the overall firm. On October 24, 2016, China Oceanwide Holdings Group agreed to buy Genworth Financial Inc. for $2.7 billion. As of August 2020, the deal remains pending. In May 2020, National Australia Bank has terminated its deal to acquire insurance for homebuyers from Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia. The industry is vulnerable specifically to the anticipated increase of mortgage borrowers that are unable to reimburse their loan because of work cuts, with Genworth taking a $181.8 million write-down this month of expectation of further mortgages going wrong. On 30 June 2020, Genworth Financial , Inc. has confirmed that it is going ahead with proposals to resolve its short-term commitments and debt responsibilities, while China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. (Oceanwide) is finalizing the investment strategy for Genworth 's takeover. In July 2020, Genworth Financial , Inc. has confirmed the retirement of Kelly L. Groh as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

On March 14, 2016, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation and the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association reached an agreement in principle to recover US$219 million. The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and certain senior executives made false and misleading statements about Genworth's long-term care insurance business and the company's financial statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014.

The club committee became increasingly alarmist with arguments to redevelop, including the assertion in 1978 that the building was a fire safety hazard; that, in November 1979, it made inflated claims that it would cost HK$25 million to renovate, and eventually won the day.

Iglesias is best remembered as a leading supporter of statehood for Puerto Rico, and as the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in the U.S. Congress from 1933 to 1939. Biography=Early years Santiago Iglesias was born in A Coru√±a, Galicia, Spain, where he attended the common schools, and was apprenticed as a cabinet maker. At a young age he stowed away on a ship which landed in Cuba. There he organized workers and, beginning in 1889 was secretary of the Workingmen Trades Circle in Havana. Iglesias subsequently moved to Puerto Rico, and was the founder and editor of three labor papers: * Porvenir Social (from 1898 to 1900) * Union Obrera (from 1903 to 1906) * Justicia (from 1914 to 1925) He was a very active labor organizer in Puerto Rico and was often arrested and jailed for his activities, and was considered American Federation of Labor (AFL) president Samuel Gompers's ally on the island. In fact, Gompers appointed him general organizer of the American Federation of Labor for the districts of Puerto Rico and Cuba in 1901. In 1915, he founded the Puerto Rico's Socialist Party, a pro-statehood, pro-labor party (not to be confused with the avowedly Marxist and pro-independence Puerto Rican Socialist Party founded in the 1970s). His Socialist Party, unlike its namesake, did elect its candidates to elective office during many elections. He also served as secretary of the Pan-American Federation of Labor from 1925 to 1933. In 1936, he was wounded during an assassination attempt by Puerto Rican Nationalist Party partisans. After losing a race in 1908 against Tulio Larr√≠naga for Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate seat in the United States Congress, Iglesias was elected as a Coalitionist Resident Commissioner on November 8, 1932, and was reelected in 1936 for the term ending January 3, 1941. He served in the 73rd, 74th, 75th, and 76th Congresses, from March 4, 1933 until his death. Member of the Senate of Puerto Rico Iglesias served as a member of the first Senate of Puerto Rico in 1917, and reelected several times, until his election to Congress in 1932. He pushed for many social reforms, many of which did become law, either as part of the PDP's reform agenda in the 1940s or as part of the Constitution of Puerto Rico in 1952. Resident Commissioner in the U.S. House of Representatives Iglesias unsuccessfully pushed for legislation to enable Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor, a concept that did not become law until 1947. He was able to have Puerto Rico included in many New Deal assistance programs, including road construction, the Bankhead-Jones Act that enabled agricultural experimentation, the fight against malaria and the Jones Act exclusion regarding the taxation of shipping between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports. In Congress, he served on the Insular Affairs, Agriculture, and Labor committees. Personal life Santiago Iglesias in his later years. Married to Justa Pastora Bocanegra in 1902, he had three sons and eight daughters, including labor activist America Iglesias Thatcher, career military officer Edward Iglesias, and the late Manuel Francisco Iglesias, distinguished Air Force Captain and Lead Crew Radar Office of the B-29s during World War II. Death and legacy Iglesias died in office in Washington, D.C. on December 5, 1939 and his body was returned home to Puerto Rico, where it lay in state at the Capitol. Some 200,000 people were said to have filed past the casket and 50,000 are said to have gridlocked the streets of Old San Juan during his funeral. Iglesias's body was interred in a tomb at Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Early in 1943, a Liberty Ship was named for him.

Important characters are succulent, often articulated stems, strongly reduced leaves, and flowers aggregated in thick, dense spike-shaped thyrses. These halophytic plants are distributed worldwide. Allenrolfea occidentalis Halocnemum strobilaceum Kalidium caspicum Sarcocornia perennis  Description  The Salicornioideae are annual or perennial herbs, subshrubs, or low shrubs. Their stems are glabrous and often apparently jointed. The alternate or opposite leaves are fleshy, glabrous, often basally connate and stem-clasping (thus forming the joints), with missing or short free leaf blades. The spike-shaped inflorescences consist of alternate or opposite bracts, these are often connate and stem-clasping, sometimes free. In the axil of each bract, there are one to five (rarely to twelve) flowers, free or sometimes fused to each other, to the bract, and to the inflorescence axis. The flowers are usually bisexual (the lateral flowers may be unisexual). The 2-5-lobed perianth consists of two to five connate tepals. There are one or two stamens and an ovary with mostly two stigmas. In fruiting phase, the perianth remains membranous or becomes spongy, crustaceous, or horny. The fruit wall (pericarp) may be membranous, fleshy, chartaceous, crustaceous, woody, or horny. The seed is disc-shaped, lenticular, ovoid or wedge-shaped. Its surface may be smooth, papillose, reticulate, tuberculate or longitudinally ribbed. The embryo is curved, half-annular or horseshoe-shaped, rarely only slightly curved. In most genera, the seed contains copious perisperm, but a feeding tissue is missing in Salicornia and Sarcocornia.  Photosynthesis pathway  The majority of the Salicornieae species are C3-plants. There is only one species that has developed C4-photosynthesis, Tecticornia indica (syn. Halosarcia indica).  Distribution and Evolution  Plants from the Salicornioideae are found around the world. All are halophytes, growing in coastal or inland saline habitats. The Salicornioideae originated in Eurasia about 38-28 million years ago, during the Late Eocene/Early Oligocene, and radiated rapidly into its major lineages. Kalidium, the Halocnemum/Halostachys-lineage, Halopeplis, and the Allenrolfea/Heterostachys-lineage were branching off early. Later developed the Arthrocnemum/Microcnemum-lineage, the Halosarcia-lineage (with Halosarcia, Pachycornia, Tecticornia, Sclerostegia, Tegicornia), and the Salicornia/Sarcocornia-lineage. Already in the Middle Miocene, about 19-14 million years ago, all major lineages were present.  Systematics  The taxon was first published in 1849 by Alfred Moquin-Tandon as a tribe Salicornieae within the family Chenopodiaceae. In 1934, Oskar Eberhard Ulbrich raised the taxon to subfamily level and named it Salicornioideae (in: A. Engler & K. Prantl (eds.): Die nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien, ed. 2, Vol. 16c). The family Chenopodiaceae is now included in Amaranthaceae s.l. Phylogenetic research supports the monophyly of the subfamily. According to Kadereit et al. (2006), it comprises just one tribe, the Salicornieae. Traditionally two tribes had been distinguished, Halopeplideae and Salicornieae, but these are not monophyletic. * Tribus Salicornieae: with 11 genera and about 110 species: ** Allenrolfea Kuntze, with 3 species in North and South America. ** Arthrocnemum Moq., with 2-3 species, from Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region, to western tropical Africa and Macaronesia. ** Halocnemum M.Bieb., with 2 species, from Southern Europe and North Africa to Asia. ** Halopeplis Bunge ex Ung.-Sternb., with 3 species, from the Mediterranean basin and North Africa to Southwest Asia and Central Asia. ** Halostachys C.A.Mey. ex Schrenk, with only one species: *** Halostachys belangeriana in Central and Southwest Asia and southeastern Europe ** Heterostachys Ung.-Sternb.: with 2 species in Central and South America ** Kalidium Moq.

First published in 1993, its success has led to twenty five sequels as of 2019. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 2001, starring Morgan Freeman as Cross. Plot Summary Washington, D.C. homicide investigator and forensic psychologist Alex Cross investigates the brutal murders of two black prostitutes and an infant. Then, at an exclusive private school, math teacher Gary Soneji kidnaps Maggie Rose Dunne and Michael Goldberg. Cross is pulled off the murder case to investigate the kidnapping instead. Angry because he feels everyone cares more about two rich white children than three dead black people, he meets Jezzie Flannagan, the head of the children's Secret Service detail. At an old farmhouse, Soneji buries the children alive in a specially made coffin. Angered by FBI agent Roger Graham's contemptuous comments about him on TV, Soneji later impersonates a reporter and kills Graham. Meanwhile, Cross, his partner John Sampson and the FBI search Soneji's apartment, discovering his obsession with kidnappings, particularly that of the Lindbergh baby, and his desire to become a world-famous criminal. Some time later, Michael Goldberg's corpse is discovered, and the Dunnes receive a telegram demanding $10 million. Cross, Sampson and the FBI investigate, and Cross begins an affair with Jezzie Flannagan. He is ordered to deliver the money to Walt Disney World in Orlando, wondering how Soneji knows about his involvement. A man takes him on a plane, flying to a small island and taking the money, but never delivering Maggie Rose. At the old farmhouse, police officers find the empty graves where the children were held. Soneji returns to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where it is revealed he has a wife and a daughter. In Washington DC, Soneji, dressed as a public utility employee, murders a teacher from the private school. Cross and Sampson are sent to the scene and, seeing the way he mutilated the body, quickly realize that Soneji is also behind the killings they investigated before and after the kidnapping. In the murdered prostitutes' neighborhood, an elderly woman recalls a man going door to door selling heating systems. They soon find out that a man named Gary Murphy works for the company, and put observation on his family home in Wilmington, but Soneji manages to escape. A day later, he walks into a McDonald's and holds several people hostage. Soneji is almost killed, but Cross saves him, as he believes Soneji knows where Maggie is. The criminal promises Cross will regret saving his life. The trial of Gary Soneji/Murphy lasts eleven months. Cross hypnotizes him several times, learning he seems to have a split personality; Gary Murphy, his everyday persona, is a gentle family man, while Gary Soneji is a vicious sociopath. Despite the defense's best effort at an insanity plea, Soneji is imprisoned. Meanwhile, Cross learns that someone was following Soneji and knew about the kidnapping. Cross suspects Mike Devine and Charley Chakely, the Secret Service agents in charge of protecting Maggie Rose and Michael when they were kidnapped. He meets with Soneji, who confirms he may have been followed. He did not make the connection until he recognized the man at his trial: Mike Devine. Cross meets with the FBI, who have believed for some time that Devine and Chakely took the ransom money, hiring and later murdering the pilot from Florida. Cross also learns that none other than Jezzie Flannagan masterminded the kidnapping using her lover, Devine, as a pawn. Around the same time, Soneji escapes from prison and goes to Washington, where he tortures Devine to find out where the ransom money is. After retrieving the money, he kills Devine. Cross takes Flannagan on a Caribbean getaway, and confronts her about her actions. She explains that Devine and Chakely noticed Soneji driving by the Goldberg house, and followed him. The ransom was her idea, and they removed Maggie Rose after Michael died accidentally. Flannagan is arrested based on a recording Sampson made of the conversation, and Maggie Rose is found with a family in South America, where she had been living for the past two years. Shortly after this, Soneji attacks Cross at his Washington home, attempting to kill his grandmother and children. Losing the fight, Soneji is hunted through the capital and eventually cornered on Pennsylvania Avenue, where he takes two children hostage. Soneji is about to shoot Cross, but Sampson shoots Soneji first, wounding him. Some time later, Charley Chakely and Jezzie Flannagan are executed for their crimes, while Soneji is locked up in a mental institution. He writes a last taunting letter to Cross and bribes a guard to leave it on Cross' windshield. Disturbed but unwilling to let Soneji disrupt his life any further, Cross returns home to spend time with his family. Characters Alex Cross: An African-American forensic psychologist as well as a detective, described as good-looking and well-built. He is often referred to as \\"Doctor Detective\\". Despite being very dedicated to his job, he manages to be a devoted father to his two children. His wife, Maria, was killed in a shooting before the novel begins and he is romantically involved with Jezzie Flannagan before he finds out her role in Maggie Rose's disappearance. Jezzie Flannagan: Before the kidnapping of Maggie Rose and Michael Goldberg, she held an esteemed position in the Secret Service‚Äîthe first woman ever to hold the position. She is described as very beautiful, though she confides in Alex that she wishes she'd been born plain so she wouldn't have to face as much sexism in her workplace. As a white woman romantically involved with Alex (an African-American man), she faces racism, though she handles it better than Alex does. Both her parents were alcoholics, and her father committed suicide. She names them as \\"smart failures\\", or brilliant people who never made anything of their lives. When Alex confronts her about her betrayal, she admits that she approached him at first strictly to get information on what the cops knew, but that she later fell in love with him and his children. Gary Murphy/Soneji: As a boy, he was physically and sexually abused by his father and stepmother, which caused him to develop a split personality. Gary Murphy is a normal, all-American father and husband, while Gary Soneji is a cold-blooded predator who fantasizes about kidnapping and burying a baby alive at twelve and orchestrates the kidnapping of Maggie Rose and Michael Goldberg. He has an obsession with being famous, and wants to be the most feared criminal in America. In other media=Film A film adaptation of the same name was released on April 6, 2001, starring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross, Monica Potter as Jezzie Flannagan, and Michael Wincott as Gary Soneji. The adaptation makes substantial changes to the plot, omitting much of Soneji's background and his split personality, as well as changing the identity of the kidnapped children's parents and many characters' eventual fate.

The role was played by Robert Armstrong in the 1933 films and by Jack Black in the 2005 remake. Denham's function in the story is to initiate the action by bringing the characters to Skull Island, where they encounter the giant beast Kong. Denham then brings Kong to New York City to put him on display as entertainment, but he escapes and rampages through the city. Characterization The original Denham was based on Merian C. Cooper, creator of King Kong;Goldner, Orville and George E. Turner, The Making of King Kong, Ballantine Books, 1975 both were brave men of action who made names for themselves filming nature footage in the most dangerous of territories. In some ways, Denham's travels in King Kong match the move that Cooper made when he shifted from documentary filming to narrative storytelling. While bold and willing to take risks, the original Denham is honest, putting his people in danger but never asking more of them than he does of himself. In The Son of Kong, he shows great remorse for what he has done and sorrow at the loss of Kong. 2005 remake In the 2005 remake, Denham is much less sympathetic and more devious; characterized as a con artist willing to lie, steal, and cheat to get his film made, whatever the harm this causes anyone else. He cares for people only insomuch as they are of use to him, and has no respect for human (or any other kind of) life. He buys the starving Ann a meal only because he wants her for his film. After vowing to donate the proceeds of the film to the family of a colleague killed by Skull Island natives, Denham repeats the same eulogy for his cameraman Herb, killed later on by a Venatosaurus because Denham cared more for the camera's safety than Herb's. Incarnations Both incarnations of Denham are prepared to face all odds to make their films, going as far as to travel to the undiscovered Skull Island just to film on location, and showing absurd bravery in getting the footage they need in the face of extreme danger. In the 1933 version, Denham usually handles the camera himself, explaining that other cameramen cannot film large animals, as they are too frightened of being attacked. Similarly, in the 2005 version, he confidently films a herd of Brontosaurus while his lead actor panics. Biography=1933 films As a film director, Denham had had some success, but he had always been told his films would be even more profitable if he had a love interest present in the film. For that reason, he tries to get an actress to accompany him on his next documentary, but no agent will send him anyone due to the risks involved. Even his usual agent Weston could not supply him with anyone. Eventually, he discovers Ann Darrow on the streets. She is at first concerned about Denham's advances, but Denham reassures her that the job will involve no \\"funny business\\". Denham had obtained a map of Skull Island and opted to produce his next film there. He had heard of the legend of the god or spirit Kong, and set out to make a film about it, believing the legend must have some basis in fact. He is, however, very secretive of the nature of the film and their destination, keeping it from his crew until the ship is well on its way to Skull Island. Upon reaching the island, Denham attempted to establish peaceful relations with the natives, learning the native word for \\"friend\\". He was not particularly successful in this attempt. After the natives captured Ann and delivered her to Kong, Denham accompanied Jack Driscoll and other crew members in a rescue mission. While searching, Denham and his team encountered various dinosaurs, with Denham being the first man to recognize the beasts for what they were. After surviving various attacks, Denham decided to switch his plan from producing a film to capturing Kong and sailing him to New York City. Denham expected this to be a very profitable idea. After Kong escaped and rampaged through New York City, the creature kidnapped Ann once again but was killed by airplanes. Upon observing the creature's corpse, Denham famously rejected the assertion that the planes had killed him. \\"'it wasn't the airplanes, It was beauty killed the Beast.\\" , he said. As portrayed in The Son of Kong, the aftermath of the Kong debacle was not good for Denham. He was bombarded with lawsuits to such a degree that within a month he was almost bankrupt. Eventually, he is approached by Captain Englehorn, his old friend who had captained the ship that originally went to Skull Island. He, too, is having financial difficulties and they decide to skip town together and start fresh somewhere else. After travelling around a while, they come to an island where Denham discovers a beautiful young woman, named Hilda, singing for the locals. While he is instantly attracted to Hilda, he soon has a new purpose, as he gets word from a man named Hellstrom (the same man who provided him with the map of Skull Island) that there was treasure on the island. Hellstrom is lying in an attempt to get away after having caused the death of Hilda's father, but Denham and Englehorn believe him and set out to return to Skull Island. Following a mutiny, Denham, Hilda, Englehorn, Hellstrom and Charlie the Chinese cook find themselves on the island, where the natives are (obviously) none too happy to see them and drive them away. Landing on a different part of the island, Denham discovers another giant ape (much smaller this time), who appears to be Kong's son. Denham and Hilda befriend the ape, who helps them through several difficulties. Eventually, Denham does find treasure on the island, but also realizes that it is sinking into the ocean. A desperate escape is made, but \\"Little Kong\\" is drowned while rescuing Denham. It was Denham's intention to split the fortune four ways (Denham, Hilda, Englehorn and Charlie), but Hilda convinces him that three ways is just fine, indicating that she is throwing her fortunes in with Denham for the long haul. 2005 remake In the 2005 film, Denham is a two-bit film director on the verge of bankruptcy and treated with derision by every studio in New York, despite having delivered to them some stunning natural wildlife footage. He and his devoted assistant, Preston, obsessively searched for an actress to cast in his new project, eventually discovering Ann Darrow. Just as in the original, she first believes Denham is searching for a prostitute, but Denham convinces her the job will involve no \\"funny business\\". Denham had obtained a map of Skull Island and opted to produce his next film there. This means abandoning plans to film on set, which had lost him his studio's favor. They decide to take what footage he has and sell it as stock footage to other studios. This drives Denham to steal the equipment necessary to make it to the island. However, he has misinformed his crew that they were heading to Singapore, and only admits the truth to screenwriter Jack Driscoll, who is still working on the screenplay as they set off. Upon reaching the island, Denham unsuccessfully attempts to establish peaceful relations with the natives by giving a native child a candy bar. The natives attack, two crew members are killed, and this ends up driving Denham and crew back to their ship. That night, Ann is captured by the natives and delivered to Kong. Upon returning to the island, Denham is the first of the crew, besides Ann, to see Kong. Denham, Driscoll, and other crew members set off in a rescue mission. He films the first dinosaur attack on camera and films the death of a crew member in the swamp in the extended cut (though this was by accident: he was running the camera to see if it still worked, and the last crewman out of the swamp happened to be killed in its line-of-sight). He survives the attack by a Ferrucutus in the extended cut (in which no one dies, but during which some are injured), the manic Brontosaurus stampede, the swamp journey of the extended cut, and the log chasm and insect pit, during which time he loses all of the footage he had been making, causing a brief period of berserker-like fury as he lashes out at the attacking bugs, this being what keeps him alive. After surviving the insect pit, Denham decides to switch his plan from producing a film to capturing Kong and sailing him to New York City after his camera is destroyed in the incident with Kong and the log. He persuades Englehorn to use the remaining chloroform to capture Kong, reminding him that they capture live animals. He expects to make a fortune showing off Kong, and makes conflicting promises to crew on how he will divide it. Kong eventually escapes and rampages through New York City, captures Ann and is eventually killed by airplanes. Upon reaching Kong's body, Denham is heard to say that \\"It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.\\" The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island, published the same year, elaborates that Denham escapes lawsuits by blaming Kong's rampage on the company that made the chrome steel chains which failed to contain him. Denham returns to Skull Island to lead a scientific expedition in 1935, along with seven successive expeditions for the next decade, escaping before the island is finally swallowed up by the sea. Kong: King of Skull Island Authorized by the Merian C. Cooper estate, Kong: King of Skull Island is a prequel/sequel novel to D.W. Lovelace's novelization of the 1933 movie, thus requiring it to completely ignore the existence of the film The Son of Kong (the novel had slipped into the public domain decades earlier, but the films had not). The story features Skull Island still in existence in 1957, and also adds Denham having a wife and a son, whom he was forced to abandon in order to escape the Kong-related lawsuits and criminal charges. The novel's central character is Denham's son, Vincent, and Carl himself is in the story only at the beginning and near the end. The novel adds some detail to Denham's life, such as his year of birth (1896). MusicalCarl Denham's Giant Monsters In Frank J. Dello Stritto's 2019 novel, Carl Denham's Giant Monsters, an aged Denham is living in seclusion on Kotok, a small island in Indonesia. Two tourists stumble on him, and over the next two years, Denham relates his life story before, during and after Kong. As a young man, among his adventures are travelling the Amazon with Professor Challenger, and Theodore Roosevelt, and working as a newspaper reporter covering the Scopes Monkey Trial. After Kong, he was forced into hiding to evade US jurisdiction, but did travel with Carl Maia and his team to the Amazon's Black Lagoon, and to the Himalayas with Tom Friend and John Rollason in search of the Yeti. The tale ends with him embarking on one last adventure. Real-world history=Casting In his review of the 2005 remake, film critic Roger Ebert remarked that Armstrong's performance was reminiscent of filmmaker Cecil B. de Mille, while Jack Black was reminiscent of Orson Welles. Ebert also noted that Black was criticized by other critics for being \\"not precisely hero material\\", but Ebert defended that casting decision, saying Denham was a director who did not need \\"big muscles\\".Ebert, Roger, \\"King Kong\\", Chicago Sun-Times, December 13, 2005.

It is ball-shaped and typically half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Winter white hamster include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Winter white dwarf hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not usually happen as animals maintained as pets are generally housed indoors and exposed to artificial light that prevents the recognition of short winter daylengths. In the wild, they originate from the wheat fields of Kazakhstan, the meadows of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria. Winter white dwarf hamsters are common as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater variance in their coats than those found in the wild. They reproduce often‚Äîmore so than Syrian hamsters, and as they have no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce some numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males. The winter white is known to be one of the most tameable types of hamsters. Naming The hamster has no fully accepted common name, Winter white dwarf hamster and Russian dwarf hamster are among the most often used. Confusion arises because of their physical similarity to the Campbell's dwarf hamster, consequently the name Djungarian hamster and Russian dwarf can refer to both Winter white and Campbell's dwarf hamsters. The term \\"Winter white\\" derives from the fact that in the wild the hamster changes its fur colour to white for the winter months, this camouflages the hamster and reduces predation when snow is on the ground. Campbell's dwarf hamsters do not change fur colour during the winter and can only be described as being \\"winter white\\" erroneously.http://dwarfhamsterhome.com/russian-dwarf-hamster/ The binomial name for the hamster is Phodopus sungorus. The hamster was first described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 as a mouse.Sungorus Pallas 1773 (p. 703) . Quoted in:. Ross 1998 (p. 1, synonymy of the species) The name sungorus derives from the geographic region Dzungaria.Steinlechner 1998, DJUNGARIAN HAMSTER AND/OR SIBERIAN HAMSTER: WHO IS WHO?, European Pineal Society NEWS (p. 8). In 1778, Pallas renamed the hamster to Mouse songarus.Peter Simon Pallas 1778 quadrupedum species novae e ordine glirium p. 269 Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 1, synonymy of the species) In 1912 Ned Hollister ordered the \\"Mouse songarus\\" to the genus Phodopus.Ned Hollister 1912 New mammals from the highlands of Siberia Quoted in:. Ross 1998 (p. 1, synonymy of the species) A. I. Argiropulo, in 1933, changed the name to priority sungorusArgiropulo 1933rd Quoted in:. Ross 1998 (p. 1, synonymy of the species) and determined the hamster as a subspecies of Campbell's dwarf hamster called Phodopus sungorus sungorus.Argiropulo 1933 (p. 136). Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 6, \\"Remarks \\"). Today Winter white dwarf hamsters and Campbell's dwarf hamsters are considered separate species with the Winter white officially known as Phodopus sungorus. Physical description Normal colourationPearl colourationSapphire colourationThe coat of the Winter white hamster is less woolly than that of Campbell's dwarf hamster, and apart from the normal colouring, they can be coloured sapphire, sapphire pearl, or normal pearl. The head length of the Winter white hamster is 70‚Äì90 mm, the length of the tail is 5‚Äì15 mm, and the hind legs are 11‚Äì15 mm.Winogradow und Argiropulo 1941. Zitiert in: Ross 1998 (S. 1, ‚ÄûGeneral Characters‚Äú)Krylzow und Schubin 1964. Zitiert in: Ross 1998 (S. 1, ‚ÄûGeneral Characters‚Äú). The body weight changes dramatically throughout the year. It is at its lowest during the winter.Bartness & Wade, 1985. Photoperiodic control of seasonal body weight cycles in hamsters (Abstract) In males, the body weight ranges from , and in females, . In human care, they are slightly heavier. The average lifespan of the Winter white hamster is one to three years in captivity, though they can live longer. In the wild, they are known to live as little as one year.The Dwarf Hamster: A Guide to Selection, Housing, Care, Nutrition, Behaviour, Health, Breeding, Species and Colours (About Pets) In summer, the fur of the Winter white hamster on the back changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or sometimes pale brown with a tint.How to Care for Your Dwarf Hamster (Your first...series) The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter.Figala und Mitarbeiter 1973 (Abstract). Die Angaben beziehen sich auf unter nat√ºrlichen Bedingungen gehaltene Hamster. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. Dissertation Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 1, Diagnosis, General Characters \\" The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white. Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 1, \\"Context and Content\\" of the genre, \\"Diagnosis \\" The bright coat the bottom extends to the shoulders, flanks, and hips in three arches upward. It is distinguished from the darker fur on the top of the existing black-brown hair, three curved line. Apart from the typical colouration, Winter white hamsters can also be coloured pearl, sapphire, sapphire pearl, and marbled. Other colorations are available, but these are strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell's dwarf hamsters. Some of these colorations are mandarin, blue, argente, yellow blue fawn, camel, brown, cream, merle, and umbrous. In the winter, the fur is more dense. They sometimes have a grey tint on their heads.Pallas 1773rd Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 1, General Characters \\"). More than 10% of the hamsters kept in the first winter develop the summer coat. In the second winter, only a few change into the winter coat and winter colour is less pronounced. The moulting in the winter fur starts in October or November and is completed in December, while the summer coat begins in January or February and is completed in March or early April. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint. Moulting both run jobs on the head and the back of the spine to the sides, the legs and the underside. Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 1-2, \\" form \\") The hairs grow longer in the summer, to about ten millimetres long. The pigmentation of hair is controlled by the hormone prolactin and colour genetics. Day length can be less than 14 hours to initiate the change to winter coat, though it is possible they may be able to sense a directional change in photoperiod length, such as in one experiment that demonstrated a transition from 16 hours of light to 14 hours initiates a change to the winter coat.Niklowitz P., Lerchi A., Nieschlag, E. 1994. Photoperiodic responses in Djungarian Hamsters (Phodopus sungorus): Importance of Light History for Pineal and Serum Melatonin Profiles. Biology of Reproduction. 51: 714-724. The change to the winter coat can be triggered in the summer by the short day lengths. The change occurs back to the summer coat in the autumn, when the length of the days change again. At internal temperatures hamsters in captivity start later with the changes. The winter colour is less pronounced in them. The eyes of the Winter white hamster are black, unless it is albino in which case they are red. In the wild Peter Simon Pallas named the hamster in 1773 as Mouse sungorus. In the wild, the hamster's fur changes colour in the winter. This adaptation helps them to evade predators in the snow-covered steppes. The hamster digs tunnels one metre deep leading to ground burrows where they can sleep, raise their young and hide from predators. The weasel is one of the hamster's main predators. Most of these burrows have six entrances. In the summer, the burrows are lined with moss. To keep the burrow warm in the winter, the hamster closes all but one entrance and lines the burrows with animal fur or wool that it finds. The temperature inside the burrow is usually . The hamsters sometimes live in the semideserts in Central Asia.Boris Stepanovich Yudin, Lijana Ivanova Galkina, Antonina Fedorovna Potapkina 1979 Quoted in Ross 1998 (p. 5, \\"Ecology \\"). They also live in the dry steppes and wheat or alfalfa fields, as well as on small fields in the forests of the region around Minusinsk.M. N. Meier 1967 Peculiarities of the reproduction and development of‚Äò‚ÄòPhodopus‚Äô‚Äô sungorus Pallasof different geographic populations] Volume 46 Russian Cited In: Ross 1998 (p. 5, \\"Ecology\\"). The figures refer to the area of Minusinsk. The fur on the hamster's feet protect the feet from the cold ground in the cold climates in the wild. The population density is highly varied. In 1968, the first four examples of the hamster were caught in Western Siberia and brought to the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Pet ownership The hamsters are often found on the pet market in Europe, Japan, and North America. Care of the hamster is similar to all other species of Phodopus. The hamsters, along with most rodents, are prone to tumours. They can also receive injury in the cheek pouch by sharp objects damaging the fragile inner lining. Other health problems include bite wounds, broken teeth, constipation, dehydration, dental malocclusion, diarrhea, and ear problems.Dwarf Hamsters: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, and Behavior (Barron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals) The hamster is easy to tame. In addition to natural colourings in the wild (\\"ruddy\\" or \\"agouti\\"), the hamsters in captivity occur in a variety of different colors. They are prone to diabetes so when in captivity you should always watch their sugar intake. Avoid foods such as corn, cherries, bananas and grapes, in large amounts because they are high in sugar. The hamsters should be fed dry food and fruits and vegetables. When being fed fruits and vegetables make sure that for every fruit that there is a vegetable to balance out the sugar intake. Breeding Winter white hamsters reproduce at a faster rate than Syrian hamsters. Phodopus species are able to become pregnant again on the same day that they have given birth. This can all happen within a 36-day period. This is done as a survival strategy to produce large numbers of offspring in a short period of time. This places tremendous demands on the mother. Research suggests biparental care in Campbell's hamsters (P. campbelli) but not in winter white hamsters (P. sungorus).Research by Dr. Katherine Wynne-Edwards at Queen's University, Ontario, Canada Frequent fighting can occur between the pups and as soon as they are weaned from their mother, they are separated from her. Most of the dwarf hamsters grow to 3 to 4\\" long. Hamsters maintained indoors that get artificial illumination during autumn and winter are likely to breed all year round, whereas in the wild and in animals maintained in captivity but under entirely natural light-dark cycles, breeding is restricted to the long days of spring and summer. During the breeding time, the hamster may become aggressive. After mating, the female may want to attack the male to protect her babies. The male usually hides in holes or caves to escape the vicious bite of the female.Sandra Honey: Dwarf hamsters. Biology. Attitude. Breeding. 2nd Edition. Nature and animal-Verlag, M√ºnster 2005, The hamster's estrous cycle lasts four days; every four days, the female may accept the male back to breed again. This usually occurs when the darkness of the evening sets in. If male and female hamsters are not housed together from a young age, determining if the female is willing to breed with the male is difficult. Hybrids Of the five species kept commonly as pets, only Campbell's dwarf hamster and winter white hamsters are able to interbreed and produce live hybrid offspring. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health and reproduction problems. In addition, the widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem, resulting in only mongrels. Hybridizing causes each litter to become smaller and the young begin to form congenital problems. Conservation status This hamster is listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population and distribution size are large, and no major or widespread threats to the species are known. Population numbers in the wild are not recorded.https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/17037/115139908  References External links * Category:Phodopus Category:Rodents of Asia Category:Mammals described in 1773 Category:Mammals of Siberia Category:Taxa named by Peter Simon Pallas ","title":"Winter white dwarf hamster"},{"id":"1496577","text":"Hawkwoman is the name of several fictional superheroines all owned by DC Comics and existing in that company's DC Universe. They are partners, and sometimes spouses or lovers, of the various versions of Hawkman, and share many features with the character Hawkgirl. The first version appeared in The Brave and the Bold #34 (Feb/Mar 1961). Fictional character biography=Shayera HolSharon Parker Years before the events told in the Invasion story arc, Fel Andar, a hybrid Human-Thanagarian spy, was sent to Earth to infiltrate among humans. Eventually he met and married an Earth woman, Sharon Parker, who would soon give birth to Charley Parker, later known as the Golden Eagle. Costume worn by Sharon Parker. Art by Jan Duursema. When Charley was four years old, Thanagar called Andar to active duty, so he joined the Justice League International claiming to be Carter and Shiera Hall's son Carter Hall, Jr. Andar never told the Thanagarian Empire about Charley, so he mindwiped Sharon, forcing her to take the identity of Hawkwoman Sharon Hall, wife of Carter Hall Jr. When Sharon learned about the masquerade she exposed the truth to J'onn J'onzz and Maxwell Lord. Confronted by both, Andar escaped back to Thanagar and Sharon perished. Shayera Thal Shayera Thal II is the illegitimate daughter of Shayera Thal I and Andar Pul, Thanagar's Administrator of Protection and close friend of Shayera I's father Thal Provis. Andar Pul had seduced the then 13-year-old Shayera I and her pregnancy became a political scandal that threatened to put her father's political activities to a hold. As a result, Shayera II was abandoned in Downside by her mother shortly after her birth. When she was ten, she first met Wingman ensign Katar Hol during his first mission to the Thanagarian ghettos. Her mother was killed in a terrorist bombing. When Shayera lost her Downside guardian as a result of a police action she was sent to an orphanage in the High Towers. Here she was found and adopted by Thal Provis, whose grief over the loss of his own daughter, had led him to find and reclaim his granddaughter. She was unaware Provis was really her grandfather until much later. As a young woman, Shayera became a Wingmen and eventually meets Katar Hol again. She helped him stop Byth's drug smuggling. In the early 1990s, Thanagarian policemen partners Katar Hol and Shayera Thal arrived on Earth (following an attempted Thanagarian invasion of Earth) with the mission to capture the Thanagarian shapeshifting criminal Byth. They were part of a force which used the hawk as their symbol, and also had a winged, gravity-defying harness. Together they fought crime on Earth and corruption on Thanagar for some time, eventually falling in love and deciding to remain on Earth and build a life there rather than return to their homeworld. Then came the events of Zero Hour where Katar was merged with Carter and Shiera Hall in a new Hawkman version, who was then possessed by a creature from the red known as the Hawk Avatar. Fundamentally changed, he swore off his relationship with Shayera, and she retired from superhero work to become a cop in Detroit. The \\"new\\" Hawkman adventured for a brief time before going insane and being banished into limbo. Shortly after that, Kendra Saunders became the new Hawkgirl, and Carter Hall, the original Hawkman, was resurrected. Shayera met them during her final battle against Byth when the three Hawks, aided by Animal Man, defeated the Thanagarian criminal for good. In the Rann-Thanagar War miniseries, Shayera Thal reappeared as a reinstated soldier of the Thanagarian Army, last seen fighting with the invasion force of Polara. She considered reborn Hawkman Carter Hall and Hawkgirl Kendra Saunders friends of Thanagar, but grew angry with their ally Adam Strange blaming Rannian science for the destruction of her birth world. Despite this, she reluctantly served alongside him as a comrade-in-arms during the war. Shayera was betrayed and murdered by Tamaranean Queen Komand'r. Her body was sent on a trajectory into Thanagar's sun, Polaris, the heroes' resting place in Thanagarian tradition.Rann-Thanagar War #5 (November 2005) Following DC's 2011 relaunch, Shayera Thal is revealed as the princess of Thanagar and the former lover of Katar Hol. Initially, she is depicted as a villain, after erroneously believing her lover Katar Hol has killed her brother, Emperor Corsar, vowing vengeance upon him.Savage Hawkman #0 But after it is discovered that Corsar survived and was manipulating the situation Shayera betrays him and saves Katar's life, seemingly sacrificing her own for it,Savage Hawkman #16 although, it is later revealed that she survived.Justice League vol 2, #14 Other versions *In Alex Ross's Silver Age-toned Justice, Shayera Hol is a member of the Justice League and co-director of the Midway City Museum, alongside her husband. She also appears in Secret Origins and Liberty and Justice. *Shayera and Katar are featured in the Elseworlds three- part series Legend of the Hawkman (2000). The story takes place in the Earth- One timeline, some time after The Brave and the Bold #34. She is shown wanting to return home to Thanagar while Katar has grown accustomed to life on Earth. Although this mini-series was never labelled as an Elseworlds project when originally published, it is now accepted as being one, with this story clearly based on the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkwoman during the pre- Crisis on Infinite Earths era. *In JLA: The Nail and JLA: Another Nail, Hawkwoman is a member of a much-hated Justice League, and remains so even after her husband's death by Amazo. In Another Nail, she appears to be close friends with Zatanna. She has forgiven Oliver Queen (in Amazo's body) after he admits feeling responsible for getting Katar killed, and mentions that her husband was proud to call Oliver a \\"comrade... and a friend.\\" Her role as the sole Hawk with League membership is much like her animated counterpart in the Justice League animated series. *In Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, the Hawks tried to return to Thanagar to flee from Lex Luthor's military dictatorship, only to crash in the rain forests of Costa Rica. They decided to remain in hiding. They gave birth to a son and daughter, giving them natural wings. Katar and Shayera were killed in a military strike ordered by Lex Luthor, embracing each other in their final moments. The children were brought up in the jungle ever since. They were bent on revenge against Lex. As Hawkboy, the son ultimately kills Lex with Batman's permission, since he understands what he has been through. *The Silver Age Hawks made a cameo appearance in Adventures in the DC Universe 80-Page Giant as Chronos II travels across space and time. He witnesses them in a battle against the Manhawks. * Katar and Shayera Hol appear in JLA/Avengers due to time distortions caused by Krona. * Shayera appears in JLA: Created Equal, now calling herself \\"Hawk\\" after her husband died in the Fall. * Shayera appears in issue #9 of the All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold comics. Much like their Silver Age counterparts, she and Katar are married and very much in love. * Shayera appears in Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl as a member of the Justice Society. * Shayera is featured with Katar in Scooby-Doo! Team- Up #33. She resembles her counterpart from the DC Animated Universe. Like Shiera Hall and similarly with her DCAU counterpart, Shayera is a reincarnation of Chay-Ara, and have been reborn as Lady Celia and Cinnamon. In other media=Television Hawkwoman (right) as she appeared in Young Justice. A hybridization of the Shayera Hol and Shayera Thal versions of Hawkwoman appears in Young Justice, voiced by Zehra Fazal. She and Hawkman are members of the Justice League. She makes minor appearances in the episodes \\"Fireworks\\", \\"Revelation\\", \\"Failsafe\\", and \\"Agendas\\". In the episode \\"Auld Acquaintance\\", she and the Justice League fell under the Light's control and forced to attack the planet Rimbor alongside five other Leaguers.

It can be used for commercial, independent, and amateur multicasts. Unlike traditional IP Multicast, peercasting can facilitate on-demand content delivery. Operation Peercasting usually works by having peers automatically relay a stream to other peers. The P2P overlay network helps peers find a relay for a specified stream to connect to. This method suffers from poor quality of service during times when relays disconnect or peers need to switch to a different relay, referred to as \\"churn\\". Another solution used is minute swarming, wherein a live stream is broken up into minute length files that are swarmed via P2P software such as BitTorrent, Coral, or Dijjer. However, this suffers from excessive overhead for the formation of a new swarm every minute. A new technique is to stripe a live stream into multiple substreams, akin to RAID striping. Forward error correction and timing information is applied to these substreams such that the original stream can be reformed using at least all but one of the substreams (fountain codes are an efficient way to make and combine the substreams). In turn, these streams are relayed using the first method. Another solution is to permit clients to connect to a new relay and resume streaming from where they left off by their old relay. Relays would retain a back buffer to permit clients to resume streaming from anywhere within the range of said buffer. This would essentially be an extension to the Icecast protocol.

Life and work  He was born at Mainvilliers, Eure-et- Loir. His father, Pierre Jacques Michel Chasles (1754‚Äì1826), was a member of the Convention, and was one of those who voted the death of Louis XVI. He brought up his son according to the principles of Rousseau's Emile, and the boy, after a regime of outdoor life, followed by some years classical study, was apprenticed to a printer, so that he might make acquaintance with manual labor. His master was involved in one of the plots of 1815, and Philar√®te suffered two months imprisonment. On his release he was sent to London, where he worked for the printer Abraham John Valpy on editions of classical authors. He wrote articles for the English reviews, and on his return to France did much to popularize the study of English authors. He was also one of the earliest to draw attention in France to Scandinavian and Russian literature. He contributed to the Revue des deux mondes, until he had a violent quarrel, terminating in a lawsuit, with Fran√ßois Buloz, who won his case. He became librarian of the Biblioth√®que Mazarine, and from 1841 was professor of comparative literature at the Coll√®ge de France.

Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material, which leads to a softened region near the FSW tool. While the tool is traversed along the joint line, it mechanically intermixes the two pieces of metal, and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure, which is applied by the tool, much like joining clay, or dough. It was primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength. FSW is capable of joining aluminium alloys, copper alloys, titanium alloys, mild steel, stainless steel and magnesium alloys. More recently, it was successfully used in welding of polymers. In addition, joining of dissimilar metals such as aluminium to magnesium alloys has been recently achieved by FSW. Application of FSW can be found in modern shipbuilding, trains, and aerospace applications. It was invented and experimentally proven at The Welding Institute (TWI) in the UK in December 1991. TWI held patents on the process, the first being the most descriptive.Thomas, WM; Nicholas, ED; Needham, JC; Murch, MG;Temple-Smith, P;Dawes, CJ.Friction-stir butt welding, GB Patent No. 9125978.8, International patent application No. PCT/GB92/02203, (1991) Principle of operation Two discrete metal workpieces butted together, along with the tool (with a probe) The progress of the tool through the joint, also showing the weld zone and the region affected by the tool shoulder A rotating cylindrical tool with a profiled probe is fed into a butt joint between two clamped workpieces, until the shoulder, which has a larger diameter than the pin, touches the surface of the workpieces. The probe is slightly shorter than the weld depth required, with the tool shoulder riding atop the work surface. After a short dwell time, the tool is moved forward along the joint line at the pre-set welding speed. Frictional heat is generated between the wear-resistant tool and the work pieces. This heat, along with that generated by the mechanical mixing process and the adiabatic heat within the material, cause the stirred materials to soften without melting. As the tool is moved forward, a special profile on the probe forces plasticised material from the leading face to the rear, where the high forces assist in a forged consolidation of the weld. This process of the tool traversing along the weld line in a plasticised tubular shaft of metal results in severe solid-state deformation involving dynamic recrystallization of the base material. Micro-structural features The solid-state nature of the FSW process, combined with its unusual tool shape and asymmetric speed profile, results in a highly characteristic micro-structure. The micro- structure can be broken up into the following zones: * The stir zone (also known as the dynamically recrystallised zone) is a region of heavily deformed material that roughly corresponds to the location of the pin during welding. The grains within the stir zone are roughly equiaxed and often an order of magnitude smaller than the grains in the parent material. A unique feature of the stir zone is the common occurrence of several concentric rings, which has been referred to as an \\"onion-ring\\" structure. The precise origin of these rings has not been firmly established, although variations in particle number density, grain size and texture have all been suggested. * The flow arm zone is on the upper surface of the weld and consists of material that is dragged by the shoulder from the retreating side of the weld, around the rear of the tool, and deposited on the advancing side. * The thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) occurs on either side of the stir zone. In this region the strain and temperature are lower and the effect of welding on the micro-structure is correspondingly smaller. Unlike the stir zone, the micro-structure is recognizably that of the parent material, albeit significantly deformed and rotated. Although the term TMAZ technically refers to the entire deformed region, it is often used to describe any region not already covered by the terms stir zone and flow arm. * The heat-affected zone (HAZ) is common to all welding processes. As indicated by the name, this region is subjected to a thermal cycle but is not deformed during welding. The temperatures are lower than those in the TMAZ but may still have a significant effect if the micro- structure is thermally unstable. In fact, in age-hardened aluminum alloys this region commonly exhibits the poorest mechanical properties. Advantages and limitations The solid-state nature of FSW leads to several advantages over fusion welding methods, as problems associated with cooling from the liquid phase are avoided. Issues such as porosity, solute redistribution, solidification cracking and liquation cracking do not arise during FSW. In general, FSW has been found to produce a low concentration of defects and is very tolerant to variations in parameters and materials. Nevertheless, FSW is associated with a number of unique defects if it isn't done properly. Insufficient weld temperatures, due to low rotational speeds or high traverse speeds, for example, mean that the weld material is unable to accommodate the extensive deformation during welding. This may result in long, tunnel-like defects running along the weld, which may occur on the surface or subsurface. Low temperatures may also limit the forging action of the tool and so reduce the continuity of the bond between the material from each side of the weld. The light contact between the material has given rise to the name \\"kissing bond\\". This defect is particularly worrying, since it is very difficult to detect using nondestructive methods such as X-ray or ultrasonic testing. If the pin is not long enough or the tool rises out of the plate, then the interface at the bottom of the weld may not be disrupted and forged by the tool, resulting in a lack-of-penetration defect. This is essentially a notch in the material, which can be a potential source of fatigue cracks. A number of potential advantages of FSW over conventional fusion-welding processes have been identified: * Good mechanical properties in the as-welded condition. * Improved safety due to the absence of toxic fumes or the spatter of molten material. * No consumables ‚Äî A threaded pin made of conventional tool steel, e.g., hardened H13, can weld over of aluminium, and no filler or gas shield is required for aluminium. * Easily automated on simple milling machines ‚Äî lower setup costs and less training. * Can operate in all positions (horizontal, vertical, etc.), as there is no weld pool. * Generally good weld appearance and minimal thickness under/over-matching, thus reducing the need for expensive machining after welding. * Can use thinner materials with same joint strength. * Low environmental impact. * General performance and cost benefits from switching from fusion to friction. However, some disadvantages of the process have been identified: * Exit hole left when tool is withdrawn. * Large down forces required with heavy-duty clamping necessary to hold the plates together. * Less flexible than manual and arc processes (difficulties with thickness variations and non-linear welds). * Often slower traverse rate than some fusion welding techniques, although this may be offset if fewer welding passes are required. Important welding parameters=Tool design Advanced friction stir welding and processing tools by MegaStir shown upside down The design of the toolBy Rajiv S. Mishra, Murray W. Mahoney: Friction stir welding and processing, ASM International . is a critical factor, as a good tool can improve both the quality of the weld and the maximal possible welding speed. It is desirable that the tool material be sufficiently strong, tough, and hard wearing at the welding temperature. Further, it should have a good oxidation resistance and a low thermal conductivity to minimise heat loss and thermal damage to the machinery further up the drive train. Hot-worked tool steel such as AISI H13 has proven perfectly acceptable for welding aluminium alloys within thickness ranges of 0.5‚Äì50 mm but more advanced tool materials are necessary for more demanding applications such as highly abrasive metal matrix composites or higher-melting-point materials such as steel or titanium. Improvements in tool design have been shown to cause substantial improvements in productivity and quality. TWI has developed tools specifically designed to increase the penetration depth and thus increasing the plate thicknesses that can be successfully welded. An example is the \\"whorl\\" design that uses a tapered pin with re-entrant features or a variable- pitch thread to improve the downwards flow of material. Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three tapering, threaded re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non- cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding. The majority of tools have a concave shoulder profile, which acts as an escape volume for the material displaced by the pin, prevents material from extruding out of the sides of the shoulder and maintains downwards pressure and hence good forging of the material behind the tool. The Triflute tool uses an alternative system with a series of concentric grooves machined into the surface, which are intended to produce additional movement of material in the upper layers of the weld. Widespread commercial applications of friction stir welding process for steels and other hard alloys such as titanium alloys will require the development of cost-effective and durable tools. Material selection, design and cost are important considerations in the search for commercially useful tools for the welding of hard materials. Work is continuing to better understand the effects of tool material's composition, structure, properties and geometry on their performance, durability and cost.  Tool rotation and traverse speeds  There are two tool speeds to be considered in friction-stir welding; how fast the tool rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex, but in general, it can be said that increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld, it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold, then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break. Excessively high heat input, on the other hand, may be detrimental to the final properties of the weld. Theoretically, this could even result in defects due to the liquation of low-melting-point phases (similar to liquation cracking in fusion welds). These competing demands lead onto the concept of a \\"processing window\\": the range of processing parameters viz. tool rotation and traverse speed, that will produce a good quality weld. Within this window the resulting weld will have a sufficiently high heat input to ensure adequate material plasticity but not so high that the weld properties are excessively deteriorated. Tool tilt and plunge depth A drawing showing the plunge depth and tilt of the tool. The tool is moving to the left. The plunge depth is defined as the depth of the lowest point of the shoulder below the surface of the welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2‚Äì4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable-load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement, while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate. Welding forces During welding, a number of forces will act on the tool: * A downwards force is necessary to maintain the position of the tool at or below the material surface. Some friction-stir welding machines operate under load control, but in many cases the vertical position of the tool is preset, and so the load will vary during welding. * The traverse force acts parallel to the tool motion and is positive in the traverse direction. Since this force arises as a result of the resistance of the material to the motion of the tool, it might be expected that this force will decrease as the temperature of the material around the tool is increased. * The lateral force may act perpendicular to the tool traverse direction and is defined here as positive towards the advancing side of the weld. * Torque is required to rotate the tool, the amount of which will depend on the down force and friction coefficient (sliding friction) and/or the flow strength of the material in the surrounding region (stiction). In order to prevent tool fracture and to minimize excessive wear and tear on the tool and associated machinery, the welding cycle is modified so that the forces acting on the tool are as low as possible, and abrupt changes are avoided. In order to find the best combination of welding parameters, it is likely that a compromise must be reached, since the conditions that favour low forces (e.g. high heat input, low travel speeds) may be undesirable from the point of view of productivity and weld properties. Flow of material Early work on the mode of material flow around the tool used inserts of a different alloy, which had a different contrast to the normal material when viewed through a microscope, in an effort to determine where material was moved as the tool passed. The data was interpreted as representing a form of in-situ extrusion, where the tool, backing plate and cold base material form the \\"extrusion chamber\\", through which the hot, plasticised material is forced. In this model the rotation of the tool draws little or no material around the front of the probe; instead, the material parts in front of the pin and passes down either side. After the material has passed the probe, the side pressure exerted by the \\"die\\" forces the material back together, and consolidation of the join occurs, as the rear of the tool shoulder passes overhead and the large down force forges the material. More recently, an alternative theory has been advanced that advocates considerable material movement in certain locations. This theory holds that some material does rotate around the probe, for at least one rotation, and it is this material movement that produces the \\"onion-ring\\" structure in the stir zone. The researchers used a combination of thin copper strip inserts and a \\"frozen pin\\" technique, where the tool is rapidly stopped in place. They suggested that material motion occurs by two processes: # Material on the advancing side of a weld enters into a zone that rotates and advances with the profiled probe. This material was very highly deformed and sloughs off behind the pin to form arc-shaped features when viewed from above (i.e. down the tool axis). It was noted that the copper entered the rotational zone around the pin, where it was broken up into fragments. These fragments were only found in the arc-shaped features of material behind the tool. # The lighter material came from the retreating side in front of the pin and was dragged around to the rear of the tool and filled in the gaps between the arcs of advancing side material. This material did not rotate around the pin, and the lower level of deformation resulted in a larger grain size. The primary advantage of this explanation is that it provides a plausible explanation for the production of the onion-ring structure. The marker technique for friction stir welding provides data on the initial and final positions of the marker in the welded material. The flow of material is then reconstructed from these positions. Detailed material flow field during friction stir welding can also be calculated from theoretical considerations based on fundamental scientific principles. Material flow calculations are routinely used in numerous engineering applications. Calculation of material flow fields in friction stir welding can be undertaken both using comprehensive numerical simulations or simple but insightful analytical equations. The comprehensive models for the calculation of material flow fields also provide important information such as geometry of the stir zone and the torque on the tool. The numerical simulations have shown the ability to correctly predict the results from marker experiments and the stir zone geometry observed in friction stir welding experiments. Generation and flow of heat For any welding process, it is, in general, desirable to increase the travel speed and minimise the heat input, as this will increase productivity and possibly reduce the impact of welding on the mechanical properties of the weld. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the temperature around the tool is sufficiently high to permit adequate material flow and prevent flaws or tool damage. When the traverse speed is increased, for a given heat input, there is less time for heat to conduct ahead of the tool, and the thermal gradients are larger. At some point the speed will be so high that the material ahead of the tool will be too cold, and the flow stress too high, to permit adequate material movement, resulting in flaws or tool fracture. If the \\"hot zone\\" is too large, then there is scope to increase the traverse speed and hence productivity. The welding cycle can be split into several stages, during which the heat flow and thermal profile will be different: * Dwell. The material is preheated by a stationary, rotating tool to achieve a sufficient temperature ahead of the tool to allow the traverse. This period may also include the plunge of the tool into the workpiece. * Transient heating. When the tool begins to move, there will be a transient period where the heat production and temperature around the tool will alter in a complex manner until an essentially steady state is reached. * Pseudo steady state. Although fluctuations in heat generation will occur, the thermal field around the tool remains effectively constant, at least on the macroscopic scale. * Post steady state. Near the end of the weld, heat may \\"reflect\\" from the end of the plate, leading to additional heating around the tool. Heat generation during friction-stir welding arises from two main sources: friction at the surface of the tool and the deformation of the material around the tool. The heat generation is often assumed to occur predominantly under the shoulder, due to its greater surface area, and to be equal to the power required to overcome the contact forces between the tool and the workpiece. The contact condition under the shoulder can be described by sliding friction, using a friction coefficient Œº and interfacial pressure P, or sticking friction, based on the interfacial shear strength at an appropriate temperature and strain rate. Mathematical approximations for the total heat generated by the tool shoulder Qtotal have been developed using both sliding and sticking friction models: :Q_\\\\text{total} = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\pi P \\\\mu \\\\omega \\\\left(R_\\\\text{shoulder}^3 - R_\\\\text{pin}^3\\\\right), (sliding) :Q_\\\\text{total} = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\pi \\\\tau \\\\omega \\\\left(R_\\\\text{shoulder}^3 - R_\\\\text{pin}^3\\\\right), (sticking) where œâ is the angular velocity of the tool, Rshoulder is the radius of the tool shoulder, and Rpin is that of the pin. Several other equations have been proposed to account for factors such as the pin, but the general approach remains the same. A major difficulty in applying these equations is determining suitable values for the friction coefficient or the interfacial shear stress. The conditions under the tool are both extreme and very difficult to measure. To date, these parameters have been used as \\"fitting parameters\\", where the model works back from measured thermal data to obtain a reasonable simulated thermal field. While this approach is useful for creating process models to predict, for example, residual stresses, it is less useful for providing insights into the process itself.

Joining of Aluminium 3D Printing Material FSW is proven able to be used as one of the methods to join the metal 3D printing materials. By using proper FSW tools and correct parameter setting a sound and defect-free weld can be produced in order to joint the metal 3D printing materials. Besides, the FSW tools must be harder than the materials that need to weld. The most important parameters in FSW are the rotation of probe, traverse speed, spindle tilt angle and target depth. The weld joint efficiency of FSW on the 3D printing metal can reach up to 83.3% compared to its base materials strength.

Career In mid-1972 the band grew out of a line-up of ex-members of blues/jazz/rock band Delivery, Pip Pyle (drums, who had since played with Gong), Phil Miller (guitar, who had joined Matching Mole), and Phil's brother Steve Miller (Wurlitzer electric piano, who had joined Caravan). Replacing Roy Babbington on bass was Richard Sinclair (who played with Steve Miller in Caravan). This line-up moved away from the blues idiom of the early Delivery towards pieces based on riffs in odd time signatures and protracted melodies associated with the Canterbury style. The band played a few live shows between July and September that year, and gained their first record contract with Virgin Records with the 'Sinclair cousins'...as Steve Miller was replaced by Dave Sinclair (Hammond organ, also from Matching Mole and Caravan), the band soon changed their name to Hatfield and the North. Delivery reunited for a BBC session in November 1972 with Steve Miller, Phil Miller, Lol Coxhill, Roy Babbington (bass), Pip Pyle, and Richard Sinclair on vocals. (Steve Miller went on to release a couple of duo albums with Coxhill in 1973/74.) Dave Sinclair left in January 1973, shortly after the band's appearance (with Robert Wyatt on guest vocals) on the French TV programme Rockenstock, and was replaced by Dave Stewart (from Egg) before the band's first recordings were made. The band recorded two albums, Hatfield and the North (1974) and The Rotters' Club (1975). Backing vocals on the two albums were sung by The Northettes: Amanda Parsons, Barbara Gaskin and Ann Rosenthal. On the autumn 1974 \\"Crisis Tour\\", which Hatfield co-headlined with Kevin Coyne, the opening act was a duo of Steve Miller and Lol Coxhill (also previously of Delivery) and Coxhill usually guested with Hatfield on the jamming sections of \\"Mumps\\". After disbanding, Dave Stewart formed National Health with Alan Gowen from Gilgamesh; Phil Miller was a member throughout the band's existence, and Pyle joined in 1977. (Richard Sinclair also sat in on a couple of gigs and a BBC radio session that year.) Hatfield and the North and Gilgamesh had played a couple of shows together in late 1973, including a joint \\"double quartet\\" set, in some ways the prototype for National Health. Miller, Stewart, Pyle and Sinclair also worked together in various combinations on other projects. The name of the band was inspired by the road signage on the main A1 road heading north from London, where the a succession of signs referred to the first major town, and the overall direction, as 'A1 Hatfield & the North'. This style of sign from the 1970s has now been replaced by a slightly different variant, as shown in the current picture to the right. Reunions and archival releases Hatfield and the North took their name from the road signs out of London (such as that formerly at the junction outside the Odeon cinema in Barnet) directing motorists toward the A1 or A1(M) ‚Äî the old Great North Road ‚Äî which runs north through Hatfield to Edinburgh; this is one such sign, although \\"Hatfield and the North\\" has now been replaced by \\"The NORTH, Hatfield\\". In March 1990, the group reformed to record a TV show with Phil Miller, Richard Sinclair and Pip Pyle joined by Sophia Domancich (keyboards, Pyle's then-girlfriend and bandmate in Equip'Out). In January 2005, the band reformed again with Alex Maguire (from Pip Pyle's Bash!) on keyboards and toured between 2005 and 2006 (notable appearances included a short Japanese tour in late 2005, and the BajaProg and NEARfest festivals in North America). On a small number of European dates in June 2005, Mark Fletcher (from Miller's In Cahoots band) reinforced the band while Pyle was recuperating from a back operation and only played on part of each gig. Pyle died in August 2006 after travelling back from a Hatfield show in Groningen. Following Pyle's death, Hatfield played two previously booked gigs with Mark Fletcher on drums, including the Canterbury Festival in October 2006. In 2005/2006, the band released two archival collections, Hatwise Choice: Archive Recordings 1973-1975, Volume 1 and Hattitude: Archive Recordings 1973-1975, Volume 2, featuring the classic Miller/Pyle/Sinclair/Stewart line-up, distributed by the UK label Burning Shed. Both releases contained a mixture of BBC radio sessions and live recordings, along with the odd demo, which are still available on CD and support the musicians and family of Pip Pyle. In 2007, Cuneiform Records re- released two albums by Steve Miller and Lol Coxhill with bonus material including 20 minutes of material by the proto-Hatfield and the North line-up of Delivery playing \\"God Song\\", \\"Bossa Nochance/Big Jobs\\", and \\"Betty\\" (a variation on some of the Sinclair bass riffs that also produced Hatfield's \\"Rifferama\\"). Jonathan Coe's 2001 novel The Rotters' Club takes its title from the band's second album. The novel also mentions them several times. Saint Etienne also reference the band in the track \\"Popmaster\\" on their 2017 album Home Counties.

His first album, Paddy on the Road, was recorded by Dominic Behan in 1969 and has long been out of print. In addition to Moore's guitar and voice, Prosperous featured musicians Andy Irvine (mandolin, mouth organ), Liam √ìg O'Flynn (uilleann pipes, tin whistle) and D√≥nal Lunny (guitar, bouzouki). These four musicians later gave themselves the name Planxty, making this album something of the first Planxty album in all but name. Other musicians included Kevin Conneff (later of The Chieftains) on bodhr√°n, Clive Collins on fiddle, and Dave Bland on concertina. The album takes its name from the house and town of Prosperous, County Kildare, where it was recorded by producer Bill Leader in the summer of 1971. The house (featured on the front cover of the album) is owned by Dr Andrew Rynne, surgeon and medical practitioner and founder of Clane General Hospital in Co Kildare. The majority of the songs on the album are traditional, with the exception of \\"James Connolly\\" by established folk singer Patrick Galvin, \\"Tribute to Woody\\" (about Woody Guthrie) by Bob Dylan (originally titled \\"Song to Woody\\"), \\"The Ludlow Massacre\\", by Guthrie, \\"A Letter to Syracuse\\" by English folksingers Dave Cartwright and Bill Caddick, and \\"I Wish I Was in England\\", an early composition by Moore, who would go on to establish himself as a significant songwriter of Irish music.

Avildsen and starring Morgan Freeman. Lean on Me is loosely based on the story of Joe Louis Clark, a real life inner city high school principal in Paterson, New Jersey, whose school is at risk of being taken over by the New Jersey state government unless students improve their test scores on the New Jersey Minimum Basic Skills Test. This film's title refers to the 1972 Bill Withers song of the same name, for which the song is used in the film. Parts of the film, including the elementary school scenes, were filmed in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. Plot By 1987, the once successful Eastside High School in Paterson, New Jersey, has deteriorated due to drugs and crime. The majority of students cannot pass basic skills testing, and even the teachers are not safe from gang violence. Mayor Bottman (Alan North) learns that the school will be turned over to state administration unless 75% of the students can pass the minimum basic skills test. He consults with school superintendent Dr. Frank Napier (Robert Guillaume), who suggests the school hire elementary school principal Joe Clark, aka \\"Crazy Joe\\" (Morgan Freeman), a former teacher at Eastside High, as the new principal. Reluctantly, the mayor hires Clark. Clark's immediate radical changes include expelling 300 students identified as drug dealers or abusers and troublemakers, instituting programs to improve school spirit including painting over graffiti-covered walls, and requiring students to learn the school song, and be punished if they cannot sing it on demand. When one of the expelled students is found beating up another student, Clark orders the doors of the school chained shut during school hours since security doors cannot be purchased. Some parents react strongly to these measures, including Leonna Barrett (Lynne Thigpen), mother of one of the expelled students, who presses the mayor to oust Clark. Clark's radicalism causes him to come into conflict with members of the faculty, particularly English teacher Mr. Darnell (Michael Beach), whom Clark suspends for picking up a piece of trash during a recital of the school song, and choir teacher Mrs. Elliot (Robin Bartlett), whom Clark fires for being insubordinate after he cancels a pre-planned choral event, the school's upcoming annual Lincoln Center concert. Napier sets Clark straight over these incidents and lectures him to start being a team player. His actions begin to have a positive effect on his students. Thomas Sams (Jermaine 'Huggy' Hopkins), a student expelled for crack use, pleads to be allowed to return to school and gradually reforms. Clark also reunites one of his old elementary students, Kaneesha Carter (Karen Malina White), with her estranged mother. Unfortunately, a practice basic skills test fails to garner enough passing students. Clark confronts his staff for their failure to educate their students and to prepare them for the world. He institutes a tutorial program to strengthen academic skills and encourages remedial reading courses on Saturdays which parents may attend alongside their children. When the minimum basic skills test is finally assessed, the students are much better prepared and filled with a sense of self-worth. Before the results can arrive, the fire chief raids the school and discovers the chained doors. Clark is arrested for violating fire safety codes. That evening, the students gather at the meeting of the Paterson Board of Education, where school board member Leona Barrett is leading the call for Clark's removal. The students demand that Clark be released from jail and retained as principal. The mayor has Clark released from jail to urge the children to return home for their own safety. He is then interrupted by assistant principal Ms. Levias who reports that more than 75% of the students have passed the basic skills test. He announces the results over his megaphone. As a result, the school's current administration remains intact, and Clark is allowed to keep his job as principal, as he cheerfully informs the mayor to tell the state to \\"go to hell\\". The students break into their school song in celebration and the film ends with the senior students graduating high school and Clark handing them their diplomas.

The museum consists of open-air and indoor permanent exhibitions of many famous tanks and armored vehicles from throughout the 20th and 21st centuries (between 1917 and the present day). It is also known to house and display many unique and one-of-a-kind military vehicles, such as the Nazi German Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank, Troyanov's Object 279 Kotin heavy tank, the Karl- Ger√§t heavy self-propelled artillery, and the Object 120 Su-152 \\"Taran\\" tank destroyer, amongst other single or limited-production prototypes from the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.  About  The Kubinka Tank Museum is located on a historically \\"classified\\" Red Army armor testing facility. Most of its displays in the museum were derived from the research collection of the still- functioning Kubinka armour testing and proving ground. Most Cold War-era Western tanks (from the USA or Western Europe) were war trophies from the Middle East, Africa, Vietnam and Latin America, which were all sent to the armour testing facility at Kubinka to study and focus on any strengths and weaknesses. Due to its secretive history as well as its close relationship with the military, the museum is still staffed entirely by Russian Army personnel today. As belonging to an official military unit, the staff of the museum wears a special sleeve insignia on their uniform.http://paris1814.com/tankmuseum/kubinka Since 2014, the museum has been a part of the Patriot military theme park.http://tankmuseum.ru/patriot- park/  Admission and visitor restrictions  As of 2017 access into museum is available for all visitors. The entrance fee is 300-500 rubles, depending on the site (separately). Guided tours in English are more expensive, starting at 4500 rubles for each site. Access for children under the age of six is free. Permission to film and record videos is included into the entrance free. Foreign citizens are highly recommended to have a copy of their passport to enter the museum, as well as the original. Weapons and alcohol are prohibited; at the entrances, inspections are carried out by security staff with the help of metal detectors.  Exhibits  The museum hosts a wide variety of tanks and armored vehicles developed and used throughout the 20th century by the Soviets, Germans and many other nations. Around 60% of the exhibits are Soviet-era vehicles, with the most recent display being the Object 172, the prototype of the T-72 MBT. Apart from that, the only remaining Panzer VIII Maus and a captured British tank of First World War-vintage (used by the White Russian forces during the Russian Civil War) ‚Äì along with several different Hungarian, Polish, Japanese, British and American vehicles ‚Äì are on display as well.  Access  Located in the outskirt of Moscow, Kubinka is easily accessible by suburban train from Belorussky railway station, Moscow. Until the recent times, the complex network of local trains and the lack of ads in English made it difficult to take the right train without the knowledge of the Russian language. Since 2016 The Kubinka Tank Museum has 2 sites 12 km. each by each. Since 2017 the shuttle bus is available during the official celebrations or the special events only (as Army forum or International Army Games, but not Tank troop day). A taxi can take you to the entrance points, then you have to change into a service microbus and follow the objects you need. Without knowledge of the Russian language, this is difficult to do, it is better to use the services of an English-speaking guide.  World War II History  Kubinka was a top-secret armour testing range and proving ground from before World War II. All new tanks from Russian research and design bureaus and facilities and factories had to be first tested here. Also, Nazi German tanks and armoured fighting vehicles that were either captured by Soviet troops or transferred by the US and the UK were tested in Kubinka. Before Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, some German tanks and AFVs were sold to the Soviet Union and these were also tested at Kubinka. Some of these tanks included the Panzer I light tank, the Panzer II light tank and the Panzer III medium tank, which were all carefully studied and evaluated by the Soviet Union. After 1941, several captured tanks and AFVs of Nazi Germany (like the Panzer IV medium tank, the Jagdpanzer IV tank destroyer, the Sturmgesch√ºtz III and Sturmgesch√ºtz IV assault guns/tank destroyers and the Elefant heavy tank destroyer, amongst others), including half-tracks, were evaluated here as well. Rare kinds or prototypes of German armour and combat vehicles that fell into Soviet capture were also taken to Kubinka and tested before being put on display; such vehicles include a large mine-roller vehicle, an 88mm anti-tank self-propelled gun carriage and two-most notably, the 188-ton Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank and the 60 cm Karl-Ger√§t super-heavy self-propelled howitzer. A few captured Tiger I heavy tanks were brought to the testing and proving grounds at Kubinka in 1943 to be subjected to firing tests so as to gauge its armour protection level and field or develop weapons that would knock out the tank. From the tests, it was determined that the most effective weapon against the tank's thick armour was the Soviet 85 mm 52-K Model 1939 anti-aircraft gun, which could penetrate the Tiger I's frontal armour (100 mm thick) within the range of 1000 metres. Several Tiger II heavy tanks were also captured by the Soviet Union and were brought to Kubinka for further evaluations in 1944. In 1945 the Soviet Union also tested captured Japanese tanks that were seized after the rapid Soviet invasion of Manchuria, South Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, northern China and northern Korea. (These include the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, the Type 4 Ke-Nu light tank, the Type 2 Ka-Mi amphibious light tank (which has all of its pontoons and flotation devices fitted), and the Type 95 Ri-Ki crane vehicle (a combat engineering vehicle), amongst other types.) Besides captured Axis tanks and AFVs, the USSR also tested several Western Allied armour and military vehicles supplied to it under the auspices of the Lend-Lease military assistance program started by the United States. Such vehicles include the US M3 Stuart, M3 Lee/Grant, M4 Sherman, and also British ones, such as the Matilda II, Churchill and Valentine tanks.  Cold War History  Two armored cars, a French Panhard AML-90 (left) and a South African Eland-90 (right) on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum. Soviet tank technology was chiefly concentrated at the Kubinka Force Technology Center, which provided a series of technical evaluations and testing and relevant information to the national defense system to facilitate potential or future tank designs. Today, the Kubinka Tank Museum exhibits more than 50 tanks and other armored fighting vehicles procured from abroad during the Cold War. Some of these vehicles are as follows: * An M24 Chaffee light tank of the French colonial armies and participated in the First Indochina War between 1946 and 1954. During the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the Viet Minh captured at least three French M24 Chaffees and sent a few of them to the Soviet Union after the war. However, the USSR was sent at least two Chaffees by the USA prior to the end of WWII as part of the American Lend-Lease program, which were supposedly evaluated at Kubinka and still remains on display there. * A M41 Walker Bulldog light tank was sent to the Kubinka Force Technology Center during the early 1960s or early 1970s. Most sources state it was one of five captured by Cuba in 1961 during the Bay of Pigs Invasion; however, this M41 may have also been one of several hundred captured by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) during the Vietnam War and sent to the USSR following the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. * Some M48 Patton medium tanks are also on display there. Some of these were captured by Syrian troops in Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War and were later sent to the Soviet Union for evaluation. One of the M48 Patton tanks on display (formerly Israeli) is fitted with \\"Blazer\\" ERA (explosive reactive armour), while others were captured by the PAVN during the Vietnam War. * An M60 Patton main battle tank (MBT) was also captured by Syria from Israel in 1982 and donated to the Soviet Union, which proceeded to analyse the latest types of ammunition and weaponry on the tank. The few other M60 Patton tanks at the museum were captured by Egypt (also from Israel) in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and by Iraq in the 1980s (which captured theirs from Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War) and inspected by Soviet military officers. One IDF (Israel Defence Forces) M60 Patton was captured in 1973 in the Sinai by the Egyptian Army and was flown to the Soviet Union after some negotiations with Egyptian government. One of the first M60 Pattons that fell into the hands of the USSR during the Cold War came from Iran, from where a disgruntled army officer reportedly defected to the USSR in the stolen vehicle. * Former American M26 Pershing and M46 Patton medium tanks, which were captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) during the Korean War, are on display as well and were sent for testing and evaluations at the Kubinka Force Technology Centre after the war ended in 1953. One of these tanks can still be seen at the museum. * Several M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) were captured by North Vietnam during the Vietnam War and were also sent to the Kubinka Force Technology Centre for careful studies and evaluations. Other M113 APCs might have been acquired from Somalia (which, before the 1970s, was an ally of the USSR). * Several British Centurion MBTs are displayed at the museum. A British Army Centurion Mk.III was captured during the Korean War (most likely by Chinese PVA forces) and sent to the USSR. It has been theorised that at least one South African Olifant Mk1A, a variant of the Centurion Mk. V, was also transferred to Kubinka after being captured by Angolan and Cuban troops during Operation Packer in the Angolan Civil War/South African Border War. Israeli Centurions captured by Egypt during the Yom Kippur War were also sent to and evaluated at Kubinka. * A British Conqueror heavy tank is also on display at the museum. This tank was donated to the Kubinka Tank Museum by the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in the UK to the Soviet Union in exchange for a Soviet IS-2 heavy tank in 1988 (the exchange was allegedly conducted in the then-divided city of Berlin). * A former Iranian Army Chieftain Mk.5 MBT and an FV101 Scorpion light tank were sent to the Soviet Union by Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. * An IDF M51 Super Sherman medium tank was captured by either Egypt or Syria and was sent to the Soviet Union and is on display at the museum. * A French AMX-13/75 light tank that was received from Algeria after the Algerian War during the 1950s and the 1960s. *Two French Panhard AML armoured reconnaissance vehicles and their South African counterpart, an Eland. * A Swedish Prototype Stridsvagn 103 (S-Tank) amphibious main battle tank is also on display at the museum, one of over two dozen given away by the Swedish government to museums around the world after the Strv 103 was officially withdrawn from Swedish military service in 1996.

Biography Bernstein obtained his B.A. from Columbia University in 1924. Among many other responsibilities in the 1950s and 1960s, it fell to Bernstein and his colleague, Lewis Jordan, to make up the next day's front page of the Times. His colleagues often saved his drafts on particularly newsworthy days.

However, under pressure from President John F. Kennedy, publisher Orvil Dryfoos ordered that the story be toned down, and the headline reduced to one column. Bernstein and Jordan were both infuriated, even after Dryfoos personally explained his decision to them.

He founded a pioneering publishing company called Broadside Press in 1965, which published many leading African-American writers, among them Melvin Tolson, Sonia Sanchez, Audre Lorde, Gwendolyn Brooks, Etheridge Knight, Margaret Walker, and others. Randall's most famous poem is \\"The Ballad of Birmingham,\\" written in response to the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, in which four girls were killed. Randall's poetry is characterized by simplicity, realism, and what one critic has called the \\"liberation aesthetic.\\"Waters, Mark V. \\"Dudley Randall and the Liberation Aesthetic: Confronting the Politics of 'Blackness'\\".

Other well-known poems of his include \\"A Poet is not a Jukebox\\", \\"Booker T. and W.E.B.\\", and \\"The Profile on the Pillow\\". Life Dudley Randall was born on January 14, 1914, in Washington, D.C.,Modern American Poetry. the son of Arthur George Clyde (a Congregational Minister) and Ada Viola (Bradley) Randall (a teacher). Randall was the third of five children, including James, Arthur, Esther, and Phillip. His family moved to Detroit in 1920, and he married Ruby Hands in 1935, and soon after had a daughter, Phyllis Ada. This marriage dissolved, and Randall married Mildred Pinckney in 1942, but this marriage did not last either. In 1957, he married Vivian Spencer. Randall developed an interest in poetry at a young age. In 1927, at the age of 13, his first published poem, a sonnet, appeared in the Detroit Free Press. The sonnet won the first prize of one dollar on the \\"Young Poets Page.\\" Early inspiration stemmed from Randall's father taking him and his brothers to hear prominent African American writers and artists speak, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Walter Francis White, James Weldon Johnson, and others. After graduating from Eastern High School in 1930,\\"Dudley Randall\\", Poets.org. he worked in a foundry of the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan, from 1932 to 1937. He also worked as a clerk at a post office in Detroit from 1938 to 1943 and served in the military during World War II. He was working at a post office while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1949. Randall then completed his master's degree in Library Science at the University of Michigan in 1951. He worked as a librarian at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, and later at Morgan State College in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1956, he returned to Detroit to work at the Wayne County Federated Library System as head of the reference interlibrary loan department. From 1969 to 1976 Randall was a reference librarian at the University of Detroit (now the University of Detroit Mercy), and served also as the University's Poet-in- Residence. In his honor, the Dudley Randall Poet-in-Residence Award was established in 1971 and is still an annual event at the University as the Dudley Randall Poetry Contest.  Work  In 1966, Broadside Press published Poem Counterpoem, authored by Randall with Margaret Danner, founder of Boone House, a black cultural center in Detroit where they both read their work. In the words of R. Baxter Miller, \\"Perhaps the first of its kind, the volume contains ten poems each by Danner and Randall. The poems are alternated to form a kind of double commentary on the subjects they address in common. Replete with allusions to social and intellectual history, the verses stress nurture and growth. In 'The Ballad of Birmingham' Randall establishes racial progress as a kind of blossoming, as he recounts the incident.\\"R. Baxter Miller, \\"Dudley Randall\\", in DLB, vol. 41, Afro-American Poets since 1955, eds. Trudier Harris and Thadious M. Davis, 1985, pp. 265‚Äì273. Randall's next publication was Cities Burning (1968), a group of thirteen poems, in response to a riot in Detroit. Another fourteen poems appeared in Love You (1970), followed by More to Remember (1971) and After the Killing (1973). Naomi Long Madgett writes: \\"His interest in Russia, apparent in his translations of poems by Aleksander Pushkin ('I Loved You Once,' After the Killing) and Konstantin Simonov ('My Native Land' and 'Wait for Me' in A Litany of Friends), was heightened by a visit to the Soviet Union in 1966. His identification with Africa, enhanced by his association with poet Margaret Esse Danner from 1962 to 1964 and study in Ghana in 1970, is evident in such poems as \\"African Suite\\" (After the Killing).\\"Naomi Long Madgett, \\"Dudley Randall's Life and Career\\", Modern American Poetry. Randall received many awards throughout his career, including: ‚Ä¢ 1962 and 1966: the Wayne State Tompkins Award for poetry and for poetry and fiction ‚Ä¢ 1973: Kuumba Liberation Award ‚Ä¢ 1975: Plaque as Distinguished Alumnus from the University of Michigan ‚Ä¢ 1977: International Black Writers' Conference Award ‚Ä¢ 1981: Creative Artist Award in Literature, Michigan Council for the Arts In 1981, Randall was named Poet Laureate of the City of Detroit by Mayor Coleman Young. Randall died on August 5, 2000, aged 86, in Southfield, Michigan. In May 2001, the University of Detroit Mercy's McNichols Campus Library was designated a national Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA (now the Association of Library Trustees, Advocates, Friends and Foundations) and UDM's Dudley Randall Center for Print Culture was named in his honor. The Dudley Randall Poetry Prize is awarded to a University of Detroit Mercy student each year. On January 12, 2014, the centennial of Dudley Randall's birth was celebrated at the University of Detroit Mercy Library. Detroit Poet Laureate Naomi Long Madgett spoke about her friendship and collaborations with Randall. Poet and professor Dr. Gloria House read selections of Dudley Randall's poetry. Poet Albert M. Ward and former Dudley Randall Poetry contest winners Deonte Osayande and Lori Allan read their work.  Broadside Press  Randall was the publisher of Broadside Press from 1965 until 1977, when he sold the press to the Alexander Crummell Memorial Center, although he continued to serve as a consultant. The press began because Randall wanted to establish a copyright on two poems that Jerry Moore was setting to music, \\"Ballad of Birmingham\\" and \\"Dressed All in Pink.\\" Broadside Press took off in 1965 when, during the Writer's Conference at Fisk University, Randall saw Margaret Walker practicing her recitation of a poem about Malcolm X she was going to perform. When Randall commented on the quantity of poems being published about Malcolm, Margaret Burroughs suggested the idea of an anthology. Randall and Burroughs communicated their intentions to edit a book of poetry on Malcolm X at the conference, and their fellow poets and publishers responded enthusiastically, some even refusing to be paid for their work.Randall, Dudley. \\"Broadside Press: A Personal Chronicle.\\" In Floyd B.

Web. October 28, 2015. In 1966, Randall and Margaret Danner, fellow poet and founder of Boone House, published their work Poem Counterpoem through Broadside Press. In May of the same year, Randall attended a conference where he received permission to publish work from Robert Hayden, Melvin B. Tolson, and Margaret Walker in a Broadside series. Randall also received permission from Gwendolyn Brooks to publish her poem ‚ÄúWe Real Cool.‚Äù Broadside Press published poetry almost exclusively, with more than 400 poets represented and more than 100 books and recordings released. The press has the distinction of being one of the most important literary avenues of the Black Arts Movement, as well as presenting older black poets (such as Gwendolyn Brooks) and emerging voices (including Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez) to new readers. Although Broadside Press went into decline in 1976 due to overworked staff, it still exists to this day.ya Salaam, Kaluma. \\"Historical Overview of The Black Arts Movement\\". Modern American Poetry Site. Dept. of English, University of Illinois. n.d. Web. October 28, 2015.  Connection to the Black Arts Movement  As editor of the Broadside Press, Randall was an important part of the Black Arts Movement (BAM). The aesthetic counterpart of the political drive inherent in the Black Power movement, BAM rejected assimilation in favor of artistic and political freedom. Part of the movements doctrine was a belief in the necessity of militant armed self-defense and the beauty and goodness of Blackness. The movement's origin is usually traced to March 1965 when, two months after the assassination of Malcolm X, LeRoi Jones (who later changed his name to Amiri Baraka) moved to Harlem. It was Baraka who coined the phrase \\"Black Arts\\". The movement had three major forces: the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), the Nation of Islam, and the US organization (the ‚Äúus‚Äù used in opposition to \\"them\\"). BAM poets were known for an innovative use of language, particularly focusing on orality and the use of Black English, music, and performance for a full-bodied, authentic‚Äúblack experience‚Äù that rejected white literary standards. Although Randall was a proponent of the freedom BAM offered black poets, particularly up-and-coming artists, he was not afraid to question what he saw as inherent paradoxes within the movement. For Randall, both the overtly militant aesthetic and the desire to purify poetry of white characteristics were restrictive to the expression of black artistry. Randall viewed himself as the ‚Äúguardian of a poetic space out of which black poets may create without restriction.\\" Randall's interpretation of BAM values are evident in his work. In ‚ÄúA Different Image‚Äù the speaker declares that the current political landscape demands that African Americans \\"create / a different image; / re-animate the mask\\" (3‚Äì6). Because African Americans will still be wearing a mask, the final line of the stanza does not imply that African Americans will be able to show their genuine selves during the Civil Rights Movement, but that the movement requires the image they project to the world to be different than the one they had been showing. The final stanza shows the pride typical of BAM poetry: \\"Replace / the leer / of the minstrel's burnt-cork face / with a proud, serene / and classic bronze of Benin‚Äù (8‚Äì12). Thus, African Americans must replace their current image of a weak servant with one of a calm and self-respecting African. As shown in the first stanza, this image may not be entirely genuine, but it will further the desegregation cause of the Civil Rights Movement. ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Birmingham‚Äù may help inspire militant action, but it certainly shows the destruction caused by the opposition to the Civil Rights Movement. In the poem, a mother sends her daughter not to the marches but to a church that she believes will be safe. However, the church is bombed (a historical event) and the mother ‚Äúclawed through bits of glass and brick, / Then lifted out a shoe. / ‚ÄúO, here's the shoe my baby wore, / But, baby, where are you?‚Äù (29‚Äì32). Published six years after the actual bombing, this poem would remind readers of the pain and death caused by the necessary turmoil of the Civil Rights Movement. In popular culture In the third episode (\\"Kyle\\") of the NBC television drama This is Us, one of the main characters is renamed \\"Randall\\" in explicit tribute to Dudley Randall (who is referred to as the favorite poet of Kyle/Randall's biological father). While the specific tenor of Randall's work is not discussed onscreen, his characteristic themes of black identity are relevant to the character's identity as a black child with white adoptive parents. A copy of Randall's Poem, Counterpoem (actually written together with co-author Margaret Danner) becomes a plot point, and is glimpsed in this and other episodes. A line attributed to the collection, but actually from Randall's poem \\"Splendid Against the Night,\\" is quoted by two characters in the seventh episode (\\"The Best Washing Machine in the World\\").

Unlike the Triton series, the OASYS uses a custom Linux operating system that was designed to be arbitrarily expandable via software updates, with its functionality limited only by the PC-like hardware. OASYS was a software implementation of the research project that ultimately resulted in the OASYS PCI, a DSP card which offered multiple synthesis engines. The original OASYS keyboard concept had to be scrapped because of excessive production costs and limitations of then-current technology. Production of the OASYS was officially discontinued in April 2009. Korg sold just over 3000 units worldwide.karma-lab.com The final software update was released on November 24, 2009. In 2011, Korg Kronos, a successor of Korg OASYS, was introduced at that year's NAMM Show.  Features  The standard Oasys comes with hardware similar to many personal computers: * 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 CPU * 40GB hard disk drive * 1GB DDR RAM, user-expandable to 2GB * 10.4\\" LCD touch screen It features Korg's OASYS (acronym for Open Architecture SYnthesis Studio) technology, which allows multiple synthesis engines to be used simultaneously. The OASYS also includes second-generation KARMA technology (with the first generation having first appeared in the Korg KARMA). It has either a 76 key synth-action, or 88 key hammer-action keyboard.  Options  EXB-DI (Digital interface board) The optional EXB-DI adds 8 channels of ADAT Optical format 24-bit 48 kHz digital output, as well as a word clock input. The EXB-DI was first made available for the Korg Triton Studio keyboard and Triton Rack module - on these units only 6 outputs are available via ADAT. Bar a few early models of the Oasys, the EXB-DI is user installable.  Synthesis engines  As of November 24, 2009 the latest version of the OASYS OS is 1.3.3a, featuring the following synthesis engines: # HD-1: A PCM synthesizer, with 628 MB of preloaded samples and Wave Sequencing. # EXs: A sample library that works by itself or with other engines. EXs-1 is a set of instruments and EXs-2 is a grand piano. # AL-1: A 96-note polyphonic virtual analog synthesizer (84 notes in previous versions of the OS) # CX-3: A modeled tonewheel organ based on the current CX-3 # STR-1: A plucked string physical model # LAC-1: Optional bundle (originally $249.00, but now available for free) including two virtual analog synthesizers, the PolysixEX and MS-20EX, which are updated models of the vintage Korg Polysix and Korg MS20. The LAC-1 is available as a free upgrade, but has to be requested by the current owner of the OASYS from Korg. # MOD-7: Optional (originally $249.00, but now available for free) that Combines Variable Phase Modulation (VPM), waveshaping, ring modulation, PCM sample playback, and subtractive synthesis in a patchable, semi-modular synthesizer. The MOD-7 is available as a free upgrade, but has to be requested by the current owner of the OASYS from Korg.  HD-1  HD-1 Program = The HD-1 is a sample+synthesis engine with a two \\"oscillator\\" structure. In addition to the two \\"oscillators,\\" an HD-1 Program contains a Vector Envelope, Common LFO (per-program as opposed to per-voice, similar to the modulation LFOs in some early polyphonic analog synths), two common key tracking generators, KARMA settings, and effects. = HD-1 Oscillator = Each \\"oscillator\\" consists of a sample playback oscillator, dual multimode filter, nonlinear \\"drive\\" and low boost section, amp, and pan. The sample playback oscillator has four velocity zones, each of which can play a mono or stereo sample or a Wave Sequence. Velocity zones can overlap or crossfade. Korg claims very low aliasing distortion, due to the use of band limited interpolation. = Wave Sequencing = Wave Sequences were first introduced on Korg's Wavestation synthesizer, released in 1990. Wave Sequences allow a single note to play through a list of samples, one after the other, with or without crossfades, with other associated parameters changing for each sample, as listed below. This can create smooth, evolving timbres, or rhythmic effects. Internally, Wave Sequences are implemented by using two voices; voice A plays the first sample, voice B plays the second sample, voice A plays the third sample, and so on. Other synthesizers have featured concepts which are similar in some aspects, such as PPG, Waldorf, and Access Virus wavetables, Synclavier resynthesis, and Ensoniq Transwaves and Hyperwaves (see the Ensoniq TS 10). In the lists below, features new to the OASYS (in comparison to the Wavestation) are noted. OASYS Wave Sequences include, for each step: * The sample to play (mono or stereo) * Sample start offset * Reverse on/off * The length of the step, in milliseconds or rhythmic value * The crossfade time into the next step, in milliseconds * Crossfade fade-in shape (256 steps, from log to exp) * Crossfade fade-out shape (as above) * Volume * Transpose and fine-tune * Two modulation (\\"AMS\\") value outputs, to control any assignable parameters of the synthesizer in the rest of the Program (e.g. filter cutoff or resonance, LFO speeds, etc.) And, for the sequence as a whole: * Time/Tempo mode (determines whether step durations will be in milliseconds or rhythmic values) * Run on/off (enables and disables programmed durations and crossfades altogether; modulation from other sources can control the sequence directly) * Key sync on/off (determines whether each note's Wave Sequence runs independently, or whether all notes sync together for lock-step rhythms) * Swing and swing resolution * Quantize Triggers on/off (adjusts note start times to match current KARMA/Sequence) * Start step and start step modulation * End step * Loop start, end, and direction (forwards, backwards/forwards, backwards) * Loop repeats * Note-on advance (increments the start step for each played note) * Position modulation (sweeps through the sequence manually) * Duration modulation (changes the step durations)  Differences from the Wavestation  Additions to the original Wavestation implementation include time/tempo modes, sample-locked tempo sync, constant-time crossfades in tempo mode, fade-in and fade-out shapes, swing, trigger quantization and key sync, note advance, real-time duration modulation, control of reverse and sample start point per step, and modulation outputs.  EXs  EXs is a Korg acronym for \\"EXpansion Sample\\". They are sample sounds that come pre-loaded with OASYS. EXs-1 is a sample library with acoustic instruments including guitars, brass, piano, strings, beside others. EXs-2 is a grand piano sampled in each key with 4 velocity levels plus damper. The 1G RAM of OASYS only permits to load 1 EXs at a time, but the user can expand it to have both working at the same time.  EXs3  EXs3 ($149) includes over 700 MB of brass and woodwind samples, perfect for orchestral and pop productions. Recorded using world-class instruments and players, the collection features piccolo, flute, alto flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, oboe, English horn, bassoon, contrabassoon, soprano sax, alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax, trumpet, piccolo trumpet, cornet, flugelhorn, trombone, French horn, bass tuba, contrabass tuba, dual-trumpets, dual-trombones, and brass ensemble. Designed to be richly expressive, the samples include multiple dynamics, straight and vibrato versions, breathy and overblown tones, legato, staccato, trills, flutter, growl, sforzando, glissando up/down, falls, doits, voice, breath, attack elements, grace notes, and key noise elements. 128 Programs and 64 Combinations take full advantage of the new sounds.  EXi  EXi is a Korg acronym for \\"EXpansion Instrument\\". It refers to all OASYS synth models other than the HD-1, including the AL-1, CX-3, etc. = EXi Program = This is the Program structure for playing EXi. It is similar to that of the HD-1, but differs slightly in a few ways, such as: * Allows selection of any two EXi for layering or splitting * Adds a \\"Common\\" step sequencer, shared by all voices in the Program * Adds audio input selection for each of the two EXi (currently used by MS-20EX and MOD-7) * Adds transposition for each EXi = AL-1 = Virtual analog synth engine. * Two main oscillators with analog- style FM and sync ** Korg claims proprietary anti-aliasing technology, for no audible aliasing over standard 88-note range, with sync (but with drive and ring-mod off) ** Waveforms: Saw, Pulse, Saw/Pulse, Double Saw, Detuned Saw 1, Detuned Saw 2, Triangle, Square/Triangle ** Wave Morph and Pulse Width/Phase/Detune * Sub-oscillator * Audio input * Noise generator with saturation and dedicated filter * Ring modulation (Ring Mod, AM, Rectify, Clip) * Mixer provides modulatable volume and filter A/B pan for osc 1, osc 2, sub osc/audio input, noise generator, and ring mod * Per-voice, modulatable Drive (nonlinear distortion) and Low Boost (low EQ) * Dual resonant multimode filters, including \\"multifilter\\" ** Multifilter provides two separate sets of gain controls for LB, HP, BP, and dry signals, with modulatable crossfade between the two sets * 4 EGs * 4 LFOs * 2 \\"AMS Mixers\\" (modulation signal processors) * Per-voice step sequencer = CX-3 = A modeled tonewheel organ based on Korg's dedicated CX-3 organ keyboard. This organ mimics and in many ways enhances the sound of the Hammond organ and Leslie speaker with amplifier simulation and other enhancements. = STR-1 = A plucked string physical model that allows you to pluck, strike, scrape, or otherwise \\"excite\\" the string with 16 different \\"pluck\\" types, noise, or any of the onboard or RAM-based PCM waveforms. = LAC-1 = The optional LAC-1 Legacy Analog Collection($249.00) EXi adds the MS-20EX and PolysixEX virtual analog synthesizers. * MS-20EX Runs in demo mode until activated. * PolysixEX Runs in demo mode until activated. = MOD-7 = The MOD-7 ($249.00) includes six oscillators which combine simultaneous VPM (aka FM), Waveshaping, and ring modulation, plus a PCM oscillator, noise generator, audio input, two multi- mode filters, three 2-in/1-out mixers, and an input main mixer ‚Äì with a patch panel for routing them together. Note: The MOD-7 and PolysixEX/MS-20EX plug- ins are only available from www.korguser.net. Owners must register their Oasys at the site in order to purchase them.

Political career Degetau returned to Puerto Rico, and was one of the four commissioners sent by Puerto Rico under Luis Mu√±oz Rivera to petition Spain for autonomy in 1895. The petition was denied but a colonial-civil government was imposed by the U.S. Congress three years later as a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He settled in San Juan, Puerto Rico and continued to practice law. Degetau was a member of the municipal council of San Juan in 1897, and mayor of San Juan in 1898. He was deputy to the Spanish Cortes Generales of 1898. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he was appointed by the military governor General Guy Vernor Henry as the Secretary of the Interior in the first cabinet formed under American rule in Puerto Rico, in 1899. He was appointed by General Henry's successor, General George W. Davis, as a member of the Insular Board of Charities. Resident Commissioner Federico Degetau's former home in Aibonito, now a museum Degetau became a member of the Insular Republican Party, which was founded in 1899. He was the first vice president of the municipal council of San Juan in 1899 and 1900, and was president of the Board of Education of San Juan in 1900 and 1901. He was elected as a Puerto Rican Republican to the Resident Commissioner post in 1900, and reelected in 1902. He served from March 4, 1901 until March 3, 1905, in the Fifty-sixth, Fifty-seventh, and Fifty-eighth Congresses. In a lecture delivered in 1902 to the Columbian University, today George Washington University, Degetau summarized his political ideals on the status of Puerto Rico: > The Porto Rican People have clearly understood that by its geographical > position, as well as by its history, the Island is, in fact, an integral > part of the American Union. For this reason the political parties of the > Island inscribed in their respective platforms the unanimous aspiration of > the people to become and organized territory, with the certainty of soon > being admitted as a State of the American Union. While serving Congress, Degetau was a member of the Committee on Insular Affairs, and submitted a bill to grant United States citizenship to Puerto Rico residents, which failed. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1904, and resumed the practice of law. Before leaving office as Resident Commissioner Degetau gave a Speech to the House of Representatives where, in addition to pleading for United States citizenship for Puerto Ricans, a matter he viewed would be resolved in the courts, he asserted his loyalty to the Constitution: United States Supreme Court:Gonzales v. Williams In 1905, after traveling through Europe where he purchased a collection of paintings, Degetau moved to Puerto Rico and established his residence in the town of Aibonito where he managed a coffee plantation. Letter written by Isabel Gonzalez to Federico Degetau in April 1904 In 1902, the United States Treasury Department issued new immigration guidelines that changed the immigration status of all Puerto Ricans. Isabel Gonz√°lez, a young, but pregnant, single Puerto Rican woman was traveling aboard the S.S. Philadelphia when the new immigration guidelines took effect and she was detained at Ellis Island as an \\"alien\\" and \\"burden\\" to the state. She lost her appeals in the Board hearings and took her case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, on August 30 of that year, Federico Degetau, unaware of the Gonzalez situation, wrote to the U. S. Secretary of State in protest of the new rules subjecting Puerto Ricans to immigration laws. His protest was forwarded to the U.S. Treasury Department. Degetau then contacted Le Barbier and Parker, who informed him that they planned to appeal Gonz√°lez's case to the U.S. Supreme Court.Journal of American Ethnic History Once Isabel lost her administrative appeal, switching tactics and focusing instead on the \\"public charge\\" issue, she decided to argue that all Puerto Ricans were citizens of the United States and as such should not be detained, treated as aliens, or denied entry into the United States. Plaza Federico Degetau in Ponce Degetau saw in the Isabel Gonz√°lez case, the perfect \\"test case\\" for challenging the new immigration guidelines because now it would not be about whether immigration inspectors, following guidelines suffused with concepts of race and gender, deemed Isabel Gonzalez and her family desirable, but about settling the status of all the native islanders living in Puerto Rico at the time it was annexed by the United States four years earlier. By February 16, 1903, Frederic Ren√© Coudert, Jr., an international-law attorney from New York who launched the Downes v. Bidwell case for clients protesting tariffs levied on goods shipped between Puerto Rico and the United States, joined Paul Fuller, Charles E. LeBarbier and Federico Degetau in the Gonzalez case as collaborators. The groundbreaking case, which became known as Gonzales v. Williams, was argued in the U.S. Supreme Court on December 4 and 7, 1903 and was presided by Chief Justice Melville Weston Fuller. The case sparked the administrative, legal, and media discussions about the status of Puerto Ricans. It also questioned the issues of immigration and U.S. doctrines in the treatment of U.S. citizens, chiefly women and people of color (dark-skinned). Gonz√°lez and her lawyers moved among the legal realms, aided by shared languages of race, gender, and morality, while Williams and his lawyers, focused on what he considered were failed parents, rearing children outside moral, economically self-sufficient homes. Gonz√°lez, who was out on bond, secretly married her fianc√© and thus became \\"a citizen of this country through marriage,\\" and acquired the right to remain stateside. She could have ended her appeal but instead she decided to press her claim that all Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. On January 4, 1904, the Court determined that under the immigration laws Gonz√°lez was not an alien, and therefore could not be denied entry into New York. The court, however, declined to declare that she was a U.S. citizen. The question of the citizenship status of the inhabitants of the new island territories remained confusing, ambiguous, and contested. Puerto Ricans, instead, came to be known as something in between: \\"noncitizen nationals.\\" Literary work As an author, he wrote El secreto de la domadora in 1885, El fondo del aljibe in 1886, ¬°Qu√© Quijote!, Cuentos para el camino in 1894, Juventud in 1895, and La Injuria in 1893. Death Degetau died in Santurce, Puerto Rico, at the age of 51, and was interred in the Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Honors * The people of the municipality of Ponce named the larger of the two squares the city's central plaza, Plaza Degetau, in his honor. * Degetau is also honored at Ponce's Park of Illustrious Ponce Citizens.Politics.

Together with Ramon Mar√≠n, Degetau is the only honoree to be honored in more than one field at that park. * In 1977 the United States Congress passed an Act to designate the new Federal building in San Juan, the \\"Federico Degetau Federal Building\\". Following its enactment, the main building of the federal government in Puerto Rico bears his name.Public Law 95-325, July 1978, 92 Stat. 397. Aftermath Degetau had no children and he wrote a will to establish a foundation whereby his widow and a friend would receive an usufruct in life of half of his property and the other half would be destined to \\"an institution of culture in this Island of Puerto Rico, as a library, museum\\". The beneficiaries of the trustees and beneficiaries of the trust soon became engaged in litigation.S√°nchez Gonz√°lez v. Registrador, 106 D.P.R. 361 (1977). The failure of the Degetau trust to achieve its objective was caused in part because the U.S. institution known as a \\"foundation\\" did not exist in the Puerto Rican civil code.Luis F. S√°nchez Vilella, \\"El Fideicomiso Puertorrique√±o V: Las vicisitudes del Fideicomiso de Don Federico Degetau\\". Revista Jur√≠dica del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, Vol. 38, No. 2; May 1977. As a result, Degetau's will was never firmly established, and the corpus was almost completely lost. In 2004, the Municipality of Aibonito attempted to demolish the home of Federico Degetau in order to make room for further development. In response,.the Patronato del Archivo Hist√≥rico of Aibonito and other organization in the community including the Puerto Rico Bar Association passed a resolution against the attempted demolition in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and urged the government to take action.Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, Resoluci√≥n, August 4, 2007. In 2010, the legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico passed a law designating Degetau's home and farm in Aibonito a historic site and ordered the preservation of the house known as Quinta Rosacruz.Law No. 102 of 2010. The Federico Degetau Trust thus materialized with the help of private and government funding.

She married Frederick Hornibrook on 3 May 1920, after which she was Ettie Hornibrook. They had no children and later separated. She died in 1936, and was buried in the Cook Islands. Life She was born in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia, but she was raised in Wellington, New Zealand from 1884. After leaving school, she became a shorthand typist for commissions of inquiry and later the Supreme Court (now the High Court, not to be confused with the present Supreme Court). Biographers believe this job gave her a wide range of experiences on social issues. She was later a reporter, businessperson, writer and a campaigner on sexually transmitted infections. After founding a volunteer nursing group during World War I, the New Zealand Volunteer Sisterhood, Rout was made aware of the prevalence of STI among servicemen. By 1917, the New Zealand Army had made free distribution of her safe sex kit compulsory. It was for her work inspecting brothels in Paris and in the Somme, that she was decorated by the French. In 1917 she and several other New Zealand nurses were Mentioned in Despatches by General Sir Archibald Murray. In New Zealand, her exploits were considered such that her name, on pain of a ¬£100 fine, could not be published. However, her activities could be published.

She was born at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Lorain, Ohio, a blue-collar city on Lake Erie, 27 miles west of Cleveland. The Robinson Prize is named for her.  Career  While a part-time sportswriter and student, she was assigned to cover a Southview High School football game at George Daniel Field in Lorain but barred from using the pressbox because female sportswriters were not permitted. The reason cited was the bad language used by visiting coaches, though female members of the school board were admitted. The bar was lifted a week later after The Journal, her employer, created a fuss. She served as the first president of ACES, stepping down in 2001, and was succeeded by John Early McIntyre. Robinson worked for the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service, based at Newsday on Long Island, until the paper was sold to Cablevision in 2008. The service closed in 2009. She freelanced for the On Campus program of ABC News for a year and is currently the acting Long Island regional editor for Patch.com, part of AOL. She has a language-related blog, Words at Work. ACES grew from several streams, from a report of the American Society of Newspaper Editors citing dissatisfaction among copy editors, to gatherings of copy editors led by Dorothy Wilson and Beryl Adcock and such academic leaders as Bill Cloud, and industry executives, such as Bob Mong and Merv Aubespin. The professional journalism organization offers advice, collegiality and training, including an annual national conference that has become well known in the newspaper industry for its focus on its valuable workshops.

Description  These are herbs, subshrubs, shrubs and some trees. Stems and leaves are often succulent. The ovary contains a spiral embryo. In most genera, scarious wings develop at the outside of the fruiting perianth, allowing for dispersal by the wind (anemochory). In tribe Caroxyleae, the stamens have vesiculose anther appendages, discolor with anthers, that probably play a role for insect pollination. In tribe Salsoleae the anther appendages are absent or small and inconspicuous.  Distribution  The area with most species (center of diversity) are the deserts and semideserts of Central-Asia and the Middle East. Distribution of the subfamily extends to the Mediterranean, to Middle-Europe, north and south Africa, and Australia, some species have also been introduced to America. Many species grow in dry habitats (xerophytes) or tolerate salty soils (halophytes), some are ruderals.  Photosynthesis pathway  Salsoloideae are plants (with a few exceptions in tribe Salsoleae). Tribe Caroxyleae is exclusively of the NAD- malic enzyme subtype. Most Salsoleae also use the NADP-malic enzyme.  Taxonomy  Climacoptera turcomanica, in fruit Cornulaca monacantha Halothamnus subaphyllus, in fruit Saxaul, Haloxylon ammodendron Hammada griffithii, in fruit Kali tragus The type genus of subfamily Salsoloideae is Salsola L. According to recent research, the former classification did not reflect the phylogenetic relationship, so that the subfamily had to be reclassified; it is now split in two tribes, Caroxyleae and Salsoleae (in the strict sense).

She was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1999 who represented the riding of London Centre. She served as a member of cabinet in the government of Bob Rae. She works as a consultant and mediator. Background In 1968, Boyd graduated from Glendon College with a Bachelor of Arts in English and history. From 1968 to 1973, she worked as an assistant to the president of York University. In 1975-76, she helped the York University Faculty Members win their first union contract. She subsequently worked as an executive director of the London Battered Women's Advocacy Clinic, and served two terms as president of the London Status of Women Action Group. She is widely known as a feminist. Boyd works as an environmental business consultant and mediator. Politics In 1985, Boyd was the NDP candidate in London North in the provincial election of 1985, but finished third against incumbent Liberal Ron Van Horne. She ran in London Centre in the 1987 election, and lost to sitting Premier David Peterson by almost 9,000 votes. She campaigned as a federal New Democrat in the 1988 general election, finished third behind Liberal Joe Fontana and Progressive Conservative Jim Jepson in London East. Boyd sought a rematch against Peterson in the 1990 provincial election. This time she won, defeating the Premier by more than 8,000 votes. It was almost unheard of for a provincial premier to be defeated in his own riding, and the size of Boyd's victory was all the more surprising. The NDP won the election, and the new Premier, Bob Rae, appointed her as Minister of Education on October 1, 1990. When fellow cabinet member Anne Swarbrick resigned due to health issues, Boyd took over responsibility for Women's Issues on September 11, 1991. Boyd launched a high-profile campaign against domestic abuse in the same year. She was transferred to the Ministry of Community and Social Services on October 15, 1991 when Zanana Akande resigned due to a conflict of interest. Boyd was promoted to Attorney General of Ontario on February 3, 1993, the first woman to hold that position as well as the first non-lawyer. In this capacity she was responsible for the Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act (Bill 167), that would have provided same-sex couples with rights and obligations mostly equal to those of opposite-sex common law couples. The bill failed on a free vote when twelve NDP members voted with the opposition parties against the bill. The bill's failure was a personal disappointment for Boyd, who had invested considerable effort in promoting its passage. The Progressive Conservative Party, who voted unanimously against Bill 167, formed government after the next election and ultimately passed similar legislation five years later when required by the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in M v H. Boyd also approved a highly controversial plea-bargain deal that allowed serial killer Karla Homolka to receive a 12-year prison sentence in return for testimony which led to the conviction of Homolka's then-husband, Paul Bernardo. The deal was criticized in much of the Canadian media, and many questioned Boyd's judgment in the matter. At the time the extent of Homolka's personal involvement in Bernardo's crimes was not known. Boyd remained as Attorney General until the Rae government was defeated in the 1995 election. She was one of seventeen NDP MPPs to successfully retain their seats in that election, defeating PC candidate Patrick McGuinness by 1,732 votes. Boyd remained a high-profile MPP, serving as the NDP's Health Critic from 1997-99. The London Centre riding was eliminated by redistribution in 1996. Boyd ran against fellow incumbent Dianne Cunningham of the Progressive Conservative Party in London North Centre, and lost by just over 1,700 votes. Cabinet positions=Electoral record (Federal)=London East=Electoral record (provincial)=London NorthLondon CentreLondon North Centre=After politics In 2000, she was appointed as chair to the Task Force on the Health Effects of Woman Abuse. It was convened in response to the problem of domestic violence against women. Later that year the task force produced a report with 29 recommendations. The key conclusion was that doctors should begin screening female patients as young as 12 years old for signs of abuse. In December 2003, it came to light that religious tribunals had some legal basis under the Arbitration Act. Some argued that this interpretation allowed for Muslim Sharia law to be applied in settling family disputes. In the spring of 2004, the issue flared up even more with some claiming that the use of Sharia law tribunals was infringing on the rights of Muslim women. In the summer of 2004, Premier Dalton McGuinty asked Boyd to investigate the issue. In December 2004, she released a report that found no evidence of complaints with regards to faith-based arbitration. She concluded that no changes to the act were needed with respect to religious tribunals. She made 46 recommendations for changes to the Arbitration Act primarily dealing with arbitrator training and clarifying the roles and responsibilities of tribunals. In 2005, in response to public opinion, McGuinty ignored Boyd's main conclusion and tabled changes to the act under the Family Statute Law Amendment Act. While incorporating many of Boyd's recommendations, the act specifically removed any legal status for the arbitration of custodial and marital disputes by religious tribunals. The act mandated that all family law arbitrations in Ontario be conducted only in accordance with Canadian law. Some critics argued that this was a missed opportunity to incorporate aspects of Islamic law into the Canadian judicial system.

A version 2.0 for the Standalone & DSP edition that will be SHOUTcast v2 compatible is planned for the future. Altacast plugin for RadioDJ will no longer function with new versions of RadioDJv2 - Altacast is not supported by the developer of RadioDJ due to legal issues. Features Altacast is supported on Windows. It will run in conjunction with various media players compatible with Winamp plugins, such as AIMP, JetAudio, KMPlayer, MediaMonkey, MusicBee and foobar2000, as well as a standalone encoder. Altacast Standalone & DSP can stream to Icecast and SHOUTcast servers in Ogg Vorbis and Ogg FLAC out-of-the-box. MP3, AAC and AAC+ support can be added via the LAME encoder (lame_enc.dll), FAAC encoder (libFAAC.dll), and CT-aacPlus encoder (enc_aacplus.dll obtainable from Winamp 5.61) respectively. Adjustable settings for each encoder include bitrate (for MP3, AAC+, Ogg Vorbis), quality (for AAC, Ogg Vorbis), sample rate (22050 Hz or 44100 Hz) and channels (Parametric Stereo is available for AAC+ up till 56kbps). SHOUTcast v2 is currently not officially supported in Altacast Standalone & DSP. However, it is possible to connect to stream ID no. 1 of a SHOUTcast v2 server in legacy (v1) mode. As a temporary workaround, the SHOUTcast DSP 1.9.2 plugin for Winamp-compatible media players may be used to broadcast to alternate mount points (e.g. stream ID no. 2). SHOUTcast v2 and Opus support is available in v1.4 onwards in the plugin. Reception In 2007 Oddcast was used in a document from the Department of Audio Communication of the Technical University of Berlin as part of description to set up an internet radio broadcast system. Use of edcast for a similar purpose was described in a 2010 article in the PCWorld magazine. A 2016 thesis for Oulu University of Applied Sciences has described the used of Altacast in the implementation of an internet radio station while the for a 2018 article in the Linux Journal recommended it as a compatible source client for Microsoft Windows in setting up a freeware internet radio station using Liquidsoap, icecast and open standards. Acad√©mie d'Orl√©ans-Tours has used web radio (internet radio) for broadcasts for students and the use of edcast subsequently altacast in the system has been described.

Maximal compact subgroups play an important role in the classification of Lie groups and especially semi-simple Lie groups. Maximal compact subgroups of Lie groups are not in general unique, but are unique up to conjugation ‚Äì they are essentially unique. Example An example would be the subgroup O(2), the orthogonal group, inside the general linear group GL(2, R). A related example is the circle group SO(2) inside SL(2, R). Evidently SO(2) inside GL(2, R) is compact and not maximal. The non-uniqueness of these examples can be seen as any inner product has an associated orthogonal group, and the essential uniqueness corresponds to the essential uniqueness of the inner product. Definition A maximal compact subgroup is a maximal subgroup amongst compact subgroups ‚Äì a maximal (compact subgroup) ‚Äì rather than being (alternate possible reading) a maximal subgroup that happens to be compact; which would probably be called a compact (maximal subgroup), but in any case is not the intended meaning (and in fact maximal proper subgroups are not in general compact). Existence and uniqueness The Cartan-Iwasawa-Malcev theorem asserts that every connected Lie group (and indeed every connected locally compact group) admits maximal compact subgroups and that they are all conjugate to one another. For a semisimple Lie group uniqueness is a consequence of the Cartan fixed point theorem, which asserts that if a compact group acts by isometries on a complete simply connected negatively curved Riemannian manifold then it has a fixed point. Maximal compact subgroups of connected Lie groups are usually not unique, but they are unique up to conjugation, meaning that given two maximal compact subgroups K and L, there is an element g ‚àà G such thatNote that this element g is not unique ‚Äì any element in the same coset gK would do as well. gKg‚àí1 = L. Hence a maximal compact subgroup is essentially unique, and people often speak of \\"the\\" maximal compact subgroup. For the example of the general linear group GL(n, R), this corresponds to the fact that any inner product on Rn defines a (compact) orthogonal group (its isometry group) ‚Äì and that it admits an orthonormal basis: the change of basis defines the conjugating element conjugating the isometry group to the classical orthogonal group O(n, R). Proofs For a real semisimple Lie group, Cartan's proof of the existence and uniqueness of a maximal compact subgroup can be found in and . and discuss the extension to connected Lie groups and connected locally compact groups. For semisimple groups, existence is a consequence of the existence of a compact real form of the noncompact semisimple Lie group and the corresponding Cartan decomposition. The proof of uniqueness relies on the fact that the corresponding Riemannian symmetric space G/K has negative curvature and Cartan's fixed point theorem. showed that the derivative of the exponential map at any point of G/K satisfies d exp X ‚â• X. This implies that G/K is a Hadamard space, i.e. a complete metric space satisfying a weakened form of the parallelogram rule in a Euclidean space. Uniqueness can then be deduced from the Bruhat-Tits fixed point theorem. Indeed, any bounded closed set in a Hadamard space is contained in a unique smallest closed ball, the center of which is called its circumcenter. In particular a compact group acting by isometries must fix the circumcenter of each of its orbits. Proof of uniqueness for semisimple groups also related the general problem for semisimple groups to the case of GL(n, R). The corresponding symmetric space is the space of positive symmetric matrices. A direct proof of uniqueness relying on elementary properties of this space is given in . Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a real semisimple Lie algebra with Cartan involution œÉ. Thus the fixed point subgroup of œÉ is the maximal compact subgroup K and there is an eigenspace decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{p},} where \\\\mathfrak{k}, the Lie algebra of K, is the +1 eigenspace. The Cartan decomposition gives :\\\\displaystyle{G=K\\\\cdot \\\\exp \\\\mathfrak{p} = K\\\\cdot P = P\\\\cdot K.} If B is the Killing form on \\\\mathfrak{g} given by B(X,Y) = Tr (ad X)(ad Y), then :\\\\displaystyle{(X,Y)_\\\\sigma=-B(X,\\\\sigma(Y))} is a real inner product on \\\\mathfrak{g}. Under the adjoint representation, K is the subgroup of G that preserves this inner product. If H is another compact subgroup of G, then averaging the inner product over H with respect to the Haar measure gives an inner product invariant under H. The operators Ad p with p in P are positive symmetric operators. This new inner produst can be written as :(S\\\\cdot X,Y)_\\\\sigma, where S is a positive symmetric operator on \\\\mathfrak{g} such that Ad(h)tS Ad h = S for h in H (with the transposes computed with respect to the inner product). Moreover, for x in G, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathrm{Ad}\\\\, \\\\sigma(x)=(\\\\mathrm{Ad}\\\\,(x)^{-1})^t.} So for h in H, :\\\\displaystyle{S\\\\circ \\\\mathrm{Ad}(\\\\sigma(h))= \\\\mathrm{Ad}(h)\\\\circ S.} For X in \\\\mathfrak{p} define :\\\\displaystyle{f(e^X)=\\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Ad}(e^X) S.} If ei is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for S with Sei = Œªi ei, then :\\\\displaystyle{f(e^X)=\\\\sum \\\\lambda_i (\\\\mathrm{Ad}(e^X)e_i,e_i)_\\\\sigma \\\\ge (\\\\min \\\\lambda_i)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\,e^{\\\\mathrm{ad}\\\\,X},} so that f is strictly positive and tends to ‚àû as X tends to ‚àû. In fact this norm is equivalent to the operator norm on the symmetric operators ad X and each non-zero eigenvalue occurs with its negative, since i ad X is a skew-adjoint operator on the compact real form \\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus i\\\\mathfrak{p}. So f has a global minimum at Y say. This minimum is unique, because if Z were another then :\\\\displaystyle{e^Z=e^{Y/2} e^X e^{Y/2},} where X in \\\\mathfrak{p} is defined by the Cartan decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{e^{Z/2}e^{-Y/2}=k\\\\cdot e^{X/2}.} If fi is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of ad X with corresponding real eigenvalues Œºi, then :\\\\displaystyle{g(t)= f(e^{Y/2} e^{tX} e^{Y/2})= \\\\sum e^{\\\\mu_i t} \\\\Ad(e^{Y/2})f_i\\\\^2_\\\\sigma.} Since the right hand side is a positive combination of exponentials, the real-valued function g is strictly convex if X ‚â† 0, so has a unique minimum. On the other hand, it has local minima at t = 0 and t = 1, hence X = 0 and p = exp Y is the unique global minimum. By construction f(x) = f(œÉ(h)xh‚àí1) for h in H, so that p = œÉ(h)ph‚àí1 for h in H. Hence œÉ(h)= php‚àí1. Consequently, if g = exp Y/2, gHg‚àí1 is fixed by œÉ and therefore lies in K. Applications=Representation theory Maximal compact subgroups play a basic role in the representation theory when G is not compact. In that case a maximal compact subgroup K is a compact Lie group (since a closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group), for which the theory is easier. The operations relating the representation theories of G and K are restricting representations from G to K, and inducing representations from K to G, and these are quite well understood; their theory includes that of spherical functions. Topology The algebraic topology of the Lie groups is also largely carried by a maximal compact subgroup K. To be precise, a connected Lie group is a topological product (though not a group theoretic product) of a maximal compact K and a Euclidean space ‚Äì G = K √ó Rd ‚Äì thus in particular K is a deformation retract of G, and is homotopy equivalent, and thus they have the same homotopy groups. Indeed, the inclusion K \\\\hookrightarrow G and the deformation retraction G \\\\twoheadrightarrow K are homotopy equivalences. For the general linear group, this decomposition is the QR decomposition, and the deformation retraction is the Gram-Schmidt process. For a general semisimple Lie group, the decomposition is the Iwasawa decomposition of G as G = KAN in which K occurs in a product with a contractible subgroup AN.

Examples include the major scale or minor scale; e.g., in C major: C D E F G A B C‚Äîand in the relative minor, A minor, natural minor: A B C D E F G A; the melodic minor scale, A B C D E FGA ascending, A G F E D C B A descending; the harmonic minor scale, A B C D E F GA; and a scale variously known as the Byzantine, and Hungarian,The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London, 2001) scale, C D E F G A B C. Indian classical theory postulates seventy-two seven-tone scale types, collectively called thaat, whereas others postulate twelve or ten (depending on the theorist) seven-tone scale types. Several heptatonic scales in Western, Roman, Spanish, Hungarian, and Greek music can be analyzed as juxtapositions of tetrachords.Dupr√©, Marcel (1962). Cours Complet d'Improvisation a l'Orgue, v.2, p. 35, trans. John Fenstermaker. Paris: Alphonse Leduc. ASIN: B0006CNH8E. All heptatonic scales have all intervals present in their interval vector analysis,Hanson, Howard. (1960) Harmonic Materials of Modern Music, p. 362 ff. New York: Appleton-Century- Crofts. LOC 58-8138. and thus all heptatonic scales are both hemitonic and tritonic. There is a special affinity for heptatonic scales in the Western key signature system. Diatonic scale A diatonic scale is any seven-note scale constructed sequentially using only whole tones and half tones, repeating at the octave, having a tonal center, and comprising only one tritone interval between any two scale members, which ensures that the half tone intervals are as far apart as possible. In Western music, there are seven such scales, and they are commonly known as the modes of the major scale (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian). Melodic minor scale Melodic minor scale (ascending) on A In traditional classical theory, the melodic minor scale has two forms, as noted above, an ascending form and a descending form. Although each of these forms of itself comprises seven pitches, together they comprise nine, which might seem to call into question the scale's status as a heptatonic scale. In certain twentieth-century music, however, it became common systematically to use the ascending form for both ascending and descending passages. Such a use has been notably ascribed to the works of B√©la Bart√≥k and to bop and post-bop jazz practice. The traditional descending form of the melodic minor scale is equivalent to the natural minor scale in both pitch collection (which is diatonic) and tonal center. Harmonic minor scale Harmonic minor scale on A The harmonic minor scale is so called because in tonal music of the common practice period (from approximately 1600 to approximately 1900) chords or harmonies are derived from it more than from the natural minor scale or the melodic minor scale. The augmented second between its sixth degree and its raised seventh degree (the \\"leading tone\\"), traditionally considered undesirable in melodic progression, is avoided by placing these pitches in different voices in adjacent chords, as in this progression: F A D, F G B, F A C (ii¬∞b‚ÄìV7d‚Äìiv in C minor). The A in the middle voice does not ascend to B, and the B in the upper voice does not descend to A. Heptatonia prima and secunda The names heptatonia prima and heptatonia secunda apply to various seven-note scales that can be formed using tones and semitones, but without two semi-tones in succession. (Some are more theoretical.) They are: Heptatonia prima Beginning on keynote A and working up the notes of the 'natural minor' scale (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A), the seven modes are: Aeolian mode C * Aeolian mode (natural minor) t-s-t-t-s- t-t Locrian mode C * Locrian mode s-t-t-s-t-t-t Ionian mode C * Ionian mode (major) t-t-s-t-t-t-s Dorian mode C * Dorian mode t-s-t-t-t-s-t Phrygian mode C * Phrygian mode s-t-t-t-s-t-t Lydian mode C * Lydian mode t-t-t-s-t-t-s Mixolydian mode C. * Mixolydian mode t-t-s-t-t-s-t Heptatonia secunda While the diatonic modes have two and three tones between each semitone, the heptatonia secunda modes have one and four. These are sometimes called modes of the melodic ascending minor since that is the most commonly used scale of this type, but other modes can be produced by starting on the different scale notes in turn. Thus starting on keynote A as above and following the notes of the ascending melodic minor (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) yields these seven modes: Ascending melodic minor scale on A * 'Melodic ascending minor' t-s-t-t-t-t-s * 'Phrygian raised sixth' s-t-t-t-t-s-t combines the Phrygian flat second and Dorian raised sixth * 'Lydian raised fifth' t-t-t-t-s-t-s combines the Lydian fourth with a raised fifth Acoustic scale on C. * 'Acoustic' or 'Lydian Dominant' Scale t-t-t-s-t-s-t So-called because it is close to the scale built on natural overtones and combines Lydian raised fourth with Mixolydian (Dominant) flat seventh * 'Major minor' scale t-t-s-t-s-t-t Like natural minor (aeolian) but with a major third Half diminished scale on C * 'Half diminished scale' or 'Locrian sharp 2' scale t-s-t-s-t-t-t This is like the Locrian with a raised second Altered scale on C * 'Altered scale' s-t-s-t-t-t-t Like Locrian with diminished fourth These modes are more awkward to use than those of the diatonic scales due to the four tones in a row yielding augmented intervals on one hand while the one tone between two semitones gives rise to diminished intervals on the other. For example, the last two modes listed above both have 'Locrian' diminished triads built on their tonics, giving them unstable tonality, while the third mode not only has an augmented fourth a la the Lydian mode but also an augmented fifth making the dominant and subdominant essentially unusable.  Heptatonia tertia  Neapolitan major scale on C The last group of seven-note tone/semitone scales is heptatonia tertia, and consists of scales with two adjacent semitones‚Äîwhich amounts to a whole-tone scale, but with an additional note somewhere in its sequence, e.g., B C D E F G A. One such example is the Neapolitan major scale.  Other heptatonic scales  Hungarian Gypsy scale If the interval of the augmented second is used, many other scales become possible. These include Gypsy I-II- III-IV-V-VI-VII Hungarian I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII The scales are symmetrical about the tonic and dominant respectively and the names are sometimes used interchangeably. Phrygian dominant scale Phrygian major or dominant harmonic minor I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII This differs from the Phrygian in having a major third. It may also be considered built on the dominant of the harmonic minor scale. Enigmatic scale on C Verdi's Scala Enigmatica I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII i.e. G A B C D E F, which is similar to the heptonia tertia mentioned above, differing only in that the second degree here is flattened. Melakarta Melakarta is a South Indian classical method of organizing Raagas based on their unique heptatonic scales. The postulated number of melakarta derives from arithmetical calculation and not from Carnatic practice, which uses far fewer scale forms. Seven-pitch melakarta are considered subsets of a twelve- pitch scale roughly analogous to the Western chromatic scale. The first and fifth melakarta tones, corresponding to the first and eighth chromatic tones, are invariable in inflection, and the fourth melakarta tone, corresponding to the sixth or seventh chromatic tone, is allowed one of two inflections only, a natural (shuddah) position and a raised (tivra) position. The second and third melakarta tones can be picked from the 4 chromatic tones (second through fifth), and similarly for the sixth and seventh. Thus the number of possible forms is equal to twice the square of the number of ways a two-membered subset can be extracted from a four-membered set: : 2\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{4!}{2!\\\\cdot2!}\\\\right)^2 = 2\\\\cdot6^2 =72 Thaat Hindustani heptatonic theory additionally stipulates that the second, third, sixth and seventh degrees of heptatonic scale forms (septak) are also allowed only two inflections each, in this case, one natural position, and one lowered (komal) position. Arithmetically this produces 25, or thirty-two, possibilities, but Hindustani theory, in contradistinction to Carnatic theory, excludes scale forms not commonly used. Chinese Gongche notation Gongche notation heptatonic scale gives a do, re, mi, (between fa and fa), sol, la, (between ti and ti) heptatonic scale.

Famous examples include the whole tone scale, C D E F G A C; the augmented scale, C D E G A B C; the Prometheus scale, C D E F A B C; and the blues scale, C E F G G B C. A hexatonic scale can also be formed by stacking perfect fifths. This results in a diatonic scale with one note removed (for example, A C D E F G). Whole tone scale The whole tone scale is a series of whole tones. It has two non-enharmonically equivalent positions: C D E F G A C and D E F G A B D. It is primarily associated with the French impressionist composer Claude Debussy, who used it in such pieces of his as Voiles and Le vent dans la plaine, both from his first book of piano Pr√©ludes. This whole-tone scale has appeared occasionally and sporadically in jazz at least since Bix Beiderbecke's impressionistic piano piece In a Mist. Bop pianist Thelonious Monk often interpolated whole-tone scale flourishes into his improvisations and compositions. Whole tone scale . Mode-based hexatonic scale The major hexatonic scale is made from a major scale and removing the seventh note, e.g., C D E F G A C. It can also be made from superimposing mutually exclusive triads, e.g., C E G and D F A. Similarly, the minor hexatonic scale is made from a minor scale and removing the sixth note, e.g., C D E F G B C. Irish and Scottish and many other folk traditions use six note scales. They can be easily described by the addition of two triads a tone apart, e.g., Am and G in \\"Shady Grove\\", or omitting the fourth or sixth from the seven-note diatonic scale. Augmented scale The augmented scale, also known in jazz theory as the symmetrical augmented scale,Workman, Josh. Advanced: \\"Secrets of the symmetrical augmented scale\\", Guitar Player 41.7 (July 2007): p108(2). is so called because it can be thought of as an interlocking combination of two augmented triads an augmented second or minor third apart: C E G and E G B. It may also be called the \\"minor-third half-step scale\\" due to the series of intervals produced. Augmented scale . It made one of its most celebrated early appearances in Franz Liszt's Faust Symphony (Eine Faust Symphonie).

Guitar Player 41.7 (July 2007): p108(2). It is also prevalent in 20th century compositions by Alberto Ginastera, Almeida Prado, B√©la Bart√≥k, Milton Babbitt, and Arnold Schoenberg, by saxophonists John Coltrane and Oliver Nelson in the late 50s and early 60s, and bandleader Michael Brecker. Alternating E major and C minor triads form the augmented scale in the opening bars of the Finale in Shostakovich's Second Piano Trio. Prometheus scale The Prometheus scale is so called because of its prominent use in Alexander Scriabin's symphonic poem Prometheus: The Poem of Fire. Scriabin himself called this set of pitches, voiced as the simultaneity (in ascending order) C F B E A D the \\"mystic chord\\". Others have referred to it as the \\"Promethean chord\\".

Some of the rebels were condemned to death, others forced into exile to the United States and as far as Australia. G√©rin-Lajoie wrote the song, about the pain of exile, while taking his classical exams at the S√©minaire de Nicolet. The song has become a patriotic anthem for certain groups of Canadians who have at a point in their history experienced the pain of exile. In addition to those exiled following the Lower Canada Rebellion, it has come to hold particular importance for the rebels of the Upper Canada Rebellion, and for the Acadians, who suffered mass deportation from their homeland in the Great Upheaval between 1755 and 1763. The Acadian version is known as \\"Un Acadien errant.\\" Origins Accounts of the origins of this song vary. In Souvenirs de coll√®ge, Antoine G√©rin-Lajoie writes that he based his verse on an existing folk tune: In that publication the song was titled \\"Le Proscrit\\" and the tune said to be \\"Au bord d'un clair ruisseau.\\" The melody is from the French Canadian folk tune \\"J'ai fait une ma√Ætresse\\" (of which \\"Si tu te mets anguille\\" is also a variation). The musical form is \\"AABB\\" or double-binary, with the A phrase repeated before moving to the B phrase, which is also repeated. The musical form is reflected in the lyrics as follows: 'A' phrase, with repeat: 'B' phrase, with repeat: The rise in the tune on the first line of the B phrase is inverted on the repeat (at the point of \\"en pleurant\\"), to make the phrase period, and thus provide closure to the AABB form. Paul Robeson performed a bilingual version under the title \\"Le Canadien Errant\\" and recorded it in the 1950s.http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/links/discography.html This version was included in his 1969 East German compilation album Amerikanische Ballade; the album was released posthumously in the United States in 1977 as American Balladeer.http://www.discogs.com/Paul-Robeson-American- Balladeer/release/2542803 American audiences were introduced to the song in 1963 with French-language performances by Ian & Sylvia. They included \\"Un Canadien errant\\" on their debut 1962 album Ian & Sylvia. They gave it further prominence at the Newport Folk Festival as recorded on the 1996 album Ian & Sylvia Live at Newport. In the 1969 film, My Side of the Mountain, the folk singer and musicologist Theodore Bikel sang the first part of \\"Un Canadien Errant\\" and then played a bit of it on a \\"homemade\\" reed flute. The melody refrained throughout the film. Leonard Cohen recorded \\"Un Canadien errant\\" as \\"The Lost Canadian\\" on his 1979 Recent Songs album. His own song \\"The Faith\\", on his 2004 album Dear Heather, is based on the same melody. American folk duo John & Mary included an arrangement by Mary Ramsey on their 1991 album Victory Gardens. Canadian folk rock duo Whitehorse recorded \\"Un Canadien errant\\" and included it on their 2013 covers album The Road to Massey Hall https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIjoByUJbPQ. A version performed by the duo is featured on the soundtrack to One Week, a 2008 film starring Joshua Jackson. The song also made an appearance as the location music for Canada in the Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego video game (1996). History Ernest Gagnon in Chansons populaires du Canada (Quebec City 1865) says \\"the original tune was \\"J'ai fait une ma√Ætresse,\\" of which the words of the variant \\"Si tu te mets anguille\\" are (somewhat altered) fragments.' Gagnon's analysis is considered definitive. An Acadian variation appeared in 1844 as \\"Un Acadien Errant\\", sung to the Gregorian tune \\"Ave Maris Stella\\". Otherwise, to a few (and especially to expatriate Canadians), the original song remains a patriotic song; to all, it is a poignant recollection of French Canadian history.

One day, sad and thoughtful, Seated on the river‚Äôs bank To the fleeing current He spoke these words: ‚ÄúIf you should see my home My sad unhappy land Go, say to all my friends That I remember them \\"O days once so full of charm You are all gone away And my homeland, alas! I'll not see her again \\"No, but with my last breath O my dear Canada! My sad gaze Will go to you.\\" English version This is the 1927 English version by John Murray Gibbon. Only the first verse preserves the ABAB rhyme pattern of the original French; thereafter it varies. It is singable but sacrifices much accuracy and arguably emotional depth in the translation. Note that the use of the word 'lad' here means a young adult man, as was common in the time period. Once a Canadian lad, Exiled from hearth and home, Wandered, alone and sad, Through alien lands unknown. Down by a rushing stream, Thoughtful and sad one day, He watched the water pass And to it he did say: \\"If you should reach my land, My most unhappy land, Please speak to all my friends So they will understand. Tell them how much I wish That I could be once more In my beloved land That I will see no more. \\"My own beloved land I'll not forget till death, And I will speak of her With my last dying breath. My own beloved land I'll not forget till death, And I will speak of her With my last dying breath.\\" References ;Notes ;Citations ;Bibliography  Category:1842 songs Category:Lower Canada Rebellion Category:Quebecois patriotic songs Un Canadien errant Category:Works about human migration Category:Canadian patriotic songs ","title":"Un Canadien errant"},{"id":"1496752","text":"is a Japanese musician, bass guitarist, and record producer.

Quest also maintains collaborative agreements with various hospitals and clinics across the globe. As of 2020 the company had approximately 47,000 employees, and generated more than $7.7 billion in revenue in 2019. The company offers access to diagnostic testing services for cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, neurological disorders, COVID-19 and employment and court ordered drug testing. History Franconia, Virginia  1960‚Äì1995  Originally founded as Metropolitan Pathology Laboratory, Inc., in 1967 by Paul A. Brown, MD, the clinical laboratory underwent a variety of name changes. In 1969, the company's name changed to MetPath, Inc. with headquarters in Teaneck, New Jersey. By 1982, MetPath was acquired by what was then known as Corning Glass Works, and subsequently renamed Corning Clinical Laboratories.  1996‚Äì2000  On December 31, 1996, Quest Diagnostics became an independent company as a spin-off from Corning. Kenneth Freeman was appointed as CEO during this transition. Over the next year, Quest acquired a clinical laboratory division of Branford, CT‚Äìbased Diagnostic Medical Laboratory, Inc. (DML). Two years later in 1999, Quest added SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories to their subsidiaries; which includes a joint venture ownership with CompuNet Clinical Laboratory.  2001‚Äì2015  Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Quest Diagnostics, at the World Economic Forum in 2017 From May 2004 to April 2012, Surya Mohapatra served as the company's President and CEO. In 2007 Quest acquired diagnostic testing equipment company AmeriPath. In response to Mohapatra's resignation after eight years with Quest, former Philips Healthcare CEO Stephen Rusckowski was appointed. Under Rusckowski, Quest Diagnostics teamed up with central New England's largest health care system, UMass Memorial Health Care, to purchase its clinical outreach laboratory.  2016‚Äìpresent  In 2016, Quest collaborated with Safeway to bring testing services to twelve stores of its stores in California, Maryland, Virginia, Texas and Colorado. By the end of 2017, Quest, in partnership with Walmart, incorporated laboratory testing in about 15 of their locations in Texas and Florida. In May 2018, the company announced it will become an in-network laboratory provider to UnitedHealthcare starting in 2019, providing access to 48 million plan members. In September 2018, Quest moved its headquarters from Madison, where it was located since 2007, to Secaucus, New Jersey. In November 2018, Quest launched QuestDirect, a consumer-initiated testing service that allows patients to order health and wellness lab testing from home. In March 2020, the company launched a COVID-19 testing service. As of July 2020, Quest has performed more than 9.2 million COVID-19 molecular tests and 2.8 million serology tests.

Controversies Quest Diagnostics set a record in April 2009 when it paid $302 million to the government to settle a Medicare fraud case alleging the company sold faulty medical testing kits. It was the largest qui tam (whistleblower) settlement paid by a medical lab for manufacturing and distributing a faulty product. In May 2011, Quest paid $241 million to the state of California to settle a False Claims Act case that alleged the company had overcharged Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, and provided illegal kickbacks as incentives for healthcare providers to use Quest labs. In 2018, Quest Diagnostics was among a number of US based labs linked to inaccuracies of over 200 women's cervical smear tests for CervicalCheck, Ireland's national screening programme. On June 3, 2019 Quest announced that American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA), a billing collections service provider, had informed Quest Diagnostics that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA‚Äôs system containing personal information AMCA received from various entities, including from Quest. AMCA provides billing collections services to Optum360, which in turn is a Quest contractor. In June of 2019, a debt collector, Retrieval- Masters Credit Bureaus Inc. (doing business as American Medical Collection Agency), went bankrupt after a data breach that exposed credit card data and other details of millions of Quest Diagnostics patients. The breach was noticed after many of the credit cards in the debt collector's database were used for fraudulent online purchases.

Its target readers are boys between the ages of 6 and 18. The magazine‚Äòs headquarters are in Irving, Texas. Boys' Life is published in two demographic editions. Both editions often had the same cover, but are tuned to the target audience through the inclusion of 16‚Äì20 pages of unique content per edition. The first edition is suitable for the youngest members of Cub Scouting, the 6-to-10-year-old Cub Scouts and first-year Webelos Scouts. The second edition is appropriate for 11-to-18-year-old boys, which includes second-year Webelos through 18-year-old Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts and Venturers. If the subscription was obtained through registration in the Boy Scouts of America program, the publisher selects the appropriate edition based on the scout's age. In June 2007, Boys' Life garnered four Distinguished Achievement Awards conferred by the Association of Educational Publishers (AEP), including Periodical of the Year. The magazine's mascot is Pedro the Mailburro, who answers readers' letters and is the subject of a comic strip. In 2018, the BSA announced a pending title change to reflect the addition of girls to Scouts BSA, the renamed program that now accepts scouts of both genders. , that title change has not yet occurred. History Norman Rockwell's first Boys' Life cover, 1913 In 1911, George S. Barton, of Somerville, Massachusetts, founded and published the first edition of Boys' Life magazine. It was edited by 18-year old Joe Lane of Providence, Rhode Island. He called it Boys' and Boy Scouts' Magazine. At that time there were three major competing Scouting organizations: the American Boy Scouts, New England Boy Scouts, and Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Five thousand copies were printed of the first issue of Barton's Boys' Life, published on January 1, 1911. The more widely accepted first edition is the version published on March 1, 1911. With this issue, the magazine was expanded from eight to 48 pages, the page size was reduced, and a two-color cover was added. In 1912, the Boy Scouts of America purchased the magazine, and made it an official BSA magazine. BSA paid $6,000, $1 per subscriber, for the magazine. Content Boys' Life, September 1919 Often, the version of Boys' Life geared towards older boys features buying guides for products such as cars, MP3 players, digital cameras, sunglasses, and more. Boys' Life had in 2005 a monthly feature called \\"BL's Get Fit Guide\\". Each month highlighted a different aspect of physical health, such as diet, exercise, and drugs. Each month the magazine also features an unusual Boy Scout trip that most Scouts do not normally do. These trips range from a Philmont Scout Ranch adventure to a white water rafting trip. In both versions, Boys' Life features a video game section, which, in addition to new video game reviews, contains cheats for a video game monthly. They also contain technology updates, as well as book reviews. Content includes Special Features, Adventure Stories, Bank Street Classics, Entertainment, Environmental Issues, History, Sports, and Codemaster. Comics have included Bible Stories, Pedro, Pee Wee Harris, Scouts in Action, Rupert the Invincible, The Tracy Twins (created by Dik Browne), Dink & Duff, Tiger Cubs, Webelos Woody, Norby, and John Christopher's The Tripods trilogy. Boys' Life contracted with the Johnstone and Cushing art agency to produce much of its early cartooning content. Feature columns include Electronics, Entertainment, Fast Facts, History, Hitchin' Rack With Pedro the Mailburro, Think and Grin (jokes page), Science, Scouting Around, and Sports. Two columns, Hobby Hows and Collecting, featured Scouts' own personal hobby tips and collections; Scouts were invited to submit stories for these columns and received $10 if they were chosen for publication. Pedro Pedro is a fictional burro created as a mascot for the magazine. Pedro first appeared in 1947 according to an account in the magazine for June 1961 in which he appeared on the cover. Pedro's official function is \\"mailburro,\\" and for years, he appeared at the beginning of the letters to the editor column. A short paragraph detailing Pedro's latest \\"adventure\\" was decorated with a cartoon version of the beast by cartoonist Reamer Keller. In every issue since 1989, Boys' Life included a column \\"written\\" by Pedro that later evolved into a department known as \\"Hitchin' Rack\\". Scouts could write a letter addressed to Pedro, and mail it to Irving, Texas, where the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and Boys' Life magazine were headquartered. Responses would be published in the following edition of the magazine. Through his column, Pedro has given advice on camping gear, camping skills, and how to solve problems within with camping, fishing, backpacking, cooking, etc. The second cartoon was called \\"The Pedro Patrol\\". In this comic, Pedro and a group of Boy Scouts taught the readers scouting skills. The comic was discontinued and replaced with \\"The Wacky Adventures of Pedro.\\" This is a comics section in the magazine, drawn lately by Tom Eagan, then drawn by Tom Eaton, and starting in January 2016, Stephen Gilpin.

Casta√±o and his brothers Fidel and Vicente founded the ACCU (and its previous incarnations) after their father was kidnapped and killed by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), in association with other enemies or victims of the guerrillas. The ACCU later became one of the founding members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).  First years  Carlos Casta√±o Gil was the youngest son of the family Casta√±o Gil, which mainly raised livestock. Like his brothers, he experienced firsthand the murder of his father and Jesus Casta√±o. Led by his older brother Fidel, he became a member of self-defense groups, which were among the first of their kind. He was introduced to Medellin Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar by his brother Fidel, and their friendship became close. Casta√±o received combat training from his brother, from army officers and employees of the paramilitary group as well as from the Israeli mercenary Yair Klein. Casta√±o opposed financing paramilitary groups through drug trafficking. The friendship between the Casta√±o brothers and Pablo Escobar broke when the latter sent assassins against the Casta√±o while being detained inside his personal prison \\"La Catedral\\". Casta√±o and his brothers then became founders of the group \\"Los Pepes\\" (an acronym for \\"people persecuted by Pablo Escobar\\"). During this time Carlos was known by the aliases of \\"the Phantom\\" or \\"the Kid\\". Contacts between Los Pepes and the Colombian National Police Search Bloc allegedly resulted in Escobar's demise and killing. Two months after the death of Escobar, Fidel Casta√±o was killed in a battle against the EPL guerrilla. However, it is believed that Carlos may have had a role in Fidel's death in retaliation for the alleged rape and murder (or possible suicide) of Rumalda Casta√±o, a woman alleged to have been a lover of both brothers. After Fidel's death, Carlos Casta√±o assumed leadership of AUC, a paramilitary federation. AUC leader In a 1996 interview with writer Robin Kirk, later published in More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs and America's War in Colombia (PublicAffairs: New York, 2003), Casta√±o acknowledged that the men under his command committed \\"excesses\\", but defended them as necessary in Colombia's conflict. \\"Look, the guerrillas hide themselves within the civilian population, they manipulate the population\\". In a September 1997 interview in El Tiempo newspaper, Casta√±o admitted responsibility for the Mapirip√°n massacre.US Department of State, Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Washington DC, 1998. In 1997, Casta√±o later founded an umbrella organization of paramilitaries operating in Colombia known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). The AUC demobilized in 2006 admitting to several brutal murders to the Colombian population. The AUC was accused by human rights organizations of committing atrocities, and it has openly admitted to its involvement in the drug trade. The AUC was listed by the US Department of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. AUC was disbanded after then Colombian President Alvaro Uribe V√©lez reached a peace agreement with reduced terms for its members. Casta√±o was convicted in absentia of the murder of journalist Jaime Garz√≥n, and sentenced to 38 years in prison. Accusations of narcotrafficking On September 24, 2002, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against Casta√±o which accused him of trafficking over 17 tons of cocaine into the United States. Casta√±o announced that he would give himself up for trial in the United States and would accept his participation in numerous crimes, though he resented his being personally linked to the drug trade. Casta√±o had become isolated from the organization according to some observers, as he seemed to become relatively critical of the AUC's increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and was more willing to compromise with the Colombian Government. Allegedly this caused some AUC commanders to turn their backs on him. Casta√±o stated on Colombian television in 2000 that 70 percent of AUC funds came from narcotrafficking. Disappearance and death Casta√±o was killed on April 16, 2004. Acting AUC commanders claimed initially that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters. Other sources within the group and among its dissident factions claimed that he and his men were captured and tortured before being killed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother Vicente Casta√±o and Diego Murillo AKA \\"Don Berna\\"), who had become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Colombian investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Casta√±o's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources alleged that the bodies of Casta√±o and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive. The possible death of the AUC co-founder remained in the air and was the subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the rumours, dating from June 1, 2004, stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the AFP agency that Casta√±o may have been spirited away to either Israel or Egypt, via Panama, allegedly with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced and the parties allegedly involved separately denied their participation. Sources from the AUC and other local militant factions continued to dispute the exact whereabouts of Carlos Casta√±o. His personal and financial connections between narcotraffickers and other sectors of society could have allowed for their possible collaboration in his conspicuous disappearance or murder. Despite these claims, the truth regarding Casta√±o's exact condition remained unknown. On August 23, 2006, Colombia's Attorney General publicly ordered the capture of his brother Vicente Casta√±o and seven other individuals, accusing them of being involved in Carlos Casta√±o's apparent death. Alleged witnesses to the crime stated that Casta√±o's body was apparently dismembered and incinerated.El Tiempo. \\"Fiscal√≠a orden√≥ captura de Jos√© Vicente Casta√±o por la muerte de su hermano Carlos\\".

There he met Ellen King; they married in 1951. In 1956, Tallman and his wife accepted teaching jobs in the English department at the University of British Columbia, helped Earle Birney and Roy Daniells to organize the creative writing department.

It was in the Tallman home that Jack Spicer gave some of his now legendary lectures.See Peter Gizzi Two years later, they held another poetry conference in Berkeley, California. Tallman was sometimes criticized for turning the Vancouver poetry circle into a California branch plant. Tallman embraced the Black Mountain school approach to poetry, but also showed the influence of the Beats, the New American Poets and the Language Poets. Among the Canadian poets he is said to have influenced are bill bissett, Stan Persky and Howard White. Selected bibliography * The Poetics of the New American Poetry New York: Grove, 1973.

The stamens have anthers with only one lobe (locule) and two pollen sacs. Many species show C4-photosynthesis pathway. The center of diversity lies in Central America, Mexico and the dry forests and thorn bush savannas of South America.  Systematics  The subfamily Gomphrenoideae was first published in 1893 by Hans Schinz (in: Engler und Prantl (Eds.): Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien vol. 3, 1a, p. 97). According to phylogenetic research by Sanchez Del-Pino (2009), the subfamily Gomphrenoideae Schinz is regarded as a monophyletic taxon with 19 genera and about 300-400 species. The traditional classification with two tribes (Gomphreneae and Pseudoplantageae) does not reflect the phylogenetic relationship in this group. Three clades can be recognized.: Iresinoids * Irenella Suess., with only one species: ** Irenella chrysotricha Suess., in rain forests of Ecuador. Phylogenetically, it falls within Iresine. * Iresine P.Browne (Syn.: Dicraurus Hook. f.): with about 45 species in North and South America. * Woehleria Griseb.: with only one species ** Woehleria serpyllifolia Griseb., on mountain coasts of Cuba. Phylogenetically, it falls within Iresine. This is the sister clade of the two other clades. Alternantheroids * Alternanthera Forssk. (Syn.: Brandesia Mart.): with about 100-200 species, mainly in America, also in Africa and Australia. * Pedersenia Holub: with about 10 species in tropical America. * Tidestromia Standl.: with about 6 species in deserts of southern North America. carbon fixation evolved independently in the genera Alternathera, which also contains and ‚Äì intermediate species, and Tidestromia. Gomphrenoids * Blutaparon Raf. (Syn.: Philoxerus R.Br.): with about 5 species at shores of North and Middle America, West Africa, Micronesia and Japan, for example: ** Blutaparon rigidum * Froelichia Moench: with about 12 species in America. * Froelichiella R.E.Fr., with only one species: ** Froelichiella grisea R.E.Fr. in Bras√≠lia. * Gomphrena L. (Syn.: Bragantia Vand.): with about 90 species in America and about 30 species in Australia. This genus is polyphyletic, so taxonomical changes have to be expected. ** Gomphrena pulchella ** Gomphrena decumbens ** Gomphrena globosa * Gossypianthus Hook.: with 2 species in southern North America. * Guilleminea Kunth (Syn.: Brayulinea Small) * Hebanthe Mart.: with about 7 species in tropical America. * Hebanthodes Pedersen, with only one species: ** Hebanthodes peruviana Pedersen in Peru. * Lithophila Sw., with 2 species on Galapagos and the Caribic * Pfaffia Mart.: with about 35 species in tropical America. * Pseudogomphrena R.E.Fr.,with only one species: ** Pseudogomphrena scandens R.E.Fr. in Bras√≠lia. * Pseudoplantago Suess.: with one species in Venezuela and one in Argentina. * Quaternella Pedersen: with 3 species in Bras√≠lia. * Xerosiphon Turcz.: with about 2 species in Bras√≠lia. One large clade within this group, containing the genera Froelichia, Guilleminea, Blutaparon, some Gomphrena species, and probably Gossypianthus and Lithophila, has acquired the carbon fixation pathway. Some of these species occur at unusually high altitudes in the Andes, in cooler conditions than their relatives.

The town lies on the coast of the Port Phillip bay between the towns of Portarlington and St Leonards. Indented Head's population fluctuates throughout the year, increasing drastically during the summer months, and is very much seasonal. Its beaches attract keen fisherman, boaters and families to the area. It is appreciated by locals and tourists for its quiet and isolated nature. History=Early European exploration Indented Head was named by the explorer Matthew Flinders in April 1802 when he observed the shape of the Bellarine Peninsula coastline from the summit of Arthurs Seat, across Port Phillip. , entry for 27 April 1802 For many years the name Indented Head was applied to the whole of the Bellarine Peninsula. Flinders was at that time in the process of completing the first circumnavigation of Australia, undertaken between December 1801 and June 1803, making a detailed survey of the coastline for the British government, sailing aboard . The Batman expedition encounters local Wathaurong (Aboriginal) people and William Buckley The historical monument marking where John Batman landed at Indented Head in 1835.In 1835, the Tasmanian colonist John Batman set up his base camp for the land speculation company Port Phillip Association at Indented Head while he returned to Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) to collect his family and additional provisions. He left the small base camp in the care of his ex- convict servants William Todd and Gumm, and 5 Aboriginal members of his party named Bullett, Bungett, Old Bull, Pigeon and Joe the Marine.James Boyce (2011) 1835: the Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc., Melbourne, pp.68-69. Some of these Aboriginal people had been brought from Sydney to Tasmania by Batman, who employed them in his bounty hunting 'roving parties' rounding up Tasmanian Aboriginal people in the island's north-east in the late 1820s.Henry Reynolds, (1995) Fate of a Free People: A Radical Re- examination of the Tasmanian Wars, Penguin, Melbourne, p.78Bill Gammage, (2011) The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines Made Australia, Allen & Unwin, Sydney, p.40 The escaped convict William Buckley made contact with the men at Batman's camp in July 1835. Buckley had been living with the local Wathaurong people for over thirty years since his escape from an early settlement near Sorrento in 1803. Large numbers of local Aboriginal people frequented the small campsite, and Todd's diary records what must have been a fascinating intercultural exchange including extensive 'Corrobboring', singing, and shared hunting parties, although Todd himself generally did not participate.James Boyce (2011) 1835: the Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc., Melbourne, p.69 On 3 August 1835, after the small camp's imported food supplies ran low, Todd recorded, \\"We have commenced eating Roots the same as the Natives do\\" - these were murnong or Yam Daisy roots (Microseris lanceolata) which were a staple of the Wathaurong dietJames Boyce (2011) 1835: the Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc., Melbourne, p.95 and would have been collected in large quantities by local women. A monument marks the place (now in Batman Park) where Batman was believed to have landed. Twentieth Century until today Camping grounds were established along the Indented Head foreshore during the 1920s but it was many years before a permanent population was established, the Post Office opening in 1947. The wreck of the Ozone in 2006 The area is still a popular family holiday destination and facilities include a sailing club, a boat ramp, jetty, and numerous sandy beaches. The shoreline also hosts a number of historical boat sheds. The retired Port Phillip paddle steamer, Ozone, was sunk at Indented Head in 1925 to form a breakwater. The wreck remains a distinctive landmark visible offshore from the main beach. One of the Ozone's anchors has also been incorporated into a monument located on the cliff-top beside the Taylor Reserve camping ground. The 1970s and 1980s saw an increase in construction of holiday homes, and a larger permanent population. The Harvey estate began construction in 2007, and has been the largest housing development to date within Indented Head. In late 2008 a new Post Office and General Store was constructed on The Esplanade, the only business operating in Indented Head.

The Sant Nirankari Mission identifies itself as \\"neither a new religion nor a sect of any existing religion, but an all-embracing spiritual movement dedicated to human welfare by helping seekers realize God through the grace of a living true master (Satguru) \\", inspiring them to live as dutiful global citizens. The Mission was founded in 1929 by Baba Buta Singh Ji, who started to show the path of knowing and becoming aware of One Formless Almighty God and this is how Sant Nirankari Mission and Satguru tradition began. The Mission has more than 3000 centers and millions of followers across the world. Satguru Mata Sudiksha Ji is the sixth spiritual head of the Mission since 17 July 2018. History The Nirankari Mission formally began when Baba Avtar Singh Ji met Baba Buta Singh Ji to receive God-knowledge and joined him in taking the light of spiritual awareness to the masses. The master and his disciple travelled far and wide to disseminate the truth and purpose of life rendering gradual momentum to the movement. In 1943, Baba Buta Singh passed on the holy baton and responsibilities of the mission to Baba Avtar Singh Ji. Baba Avtar Singh Ji left no stone unturned in uplifting of mankind through dissemination of the divine word. He faced opposition from different fronts in carrying out his missionary obligations, but he remained moulded and welded to the Truth. During his lifetime itself he took a decision to revert from the Satguru to an ordinary devotee and passed on the leadership of the mission to Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji and became an example to others as a true devotee. Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji had a multi-dimensional vision. With widespread expansion of mission, he not only introduced many organizational reforms but also proposed a code of conduct for all the missionaries. Quite predictably, this voice of truth was resisted by a few and Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji fell to their bullets in 1980. Naturally, everyone lamented and condemned this act and their patience and tolerance was under severe stress. It was only for the successor of Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji, His son Baba Hardev Singh Ji who came to their rescue. He put aside his own worldly sentiments and consoled every follower of the Mission to face the tragedy boldly with faith on God's will, without any feeling of vengeance. Baba Hardev Singh Ji Maharaj convinced the world that with its spiritual base the Sant Nirankari Mission's message finds relevance to the needs of the people of every walk of life. He carried forward the expansion of the mission in India and abroad while propelling the social welfare activities of the mission with full enthusiasm. In 2016, Satguru Mata Savinder Hardev Ji, succeeded Baba Hardev Singh Ji Maharaj as the Spiritual Head of the Mission.https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/india/sant-nirankari- mission-former-head-mata-savinder-kaur-passed-away-467441.html In 2018, she declared Mata Sudiksha Savinder Hardev Ji as the spiritual leader, days before she succumbed to her deteriorating health. Ideology The Sant Nirankari Mission aims at self-realization through God-realization. Human being has been described as superior to all other species created by God. It is the human being alone who has been bestowed with intellect that enables him to distinguish between the eternal Truth and the transient existence, reality and non-reality, desirable and the undesirable. For this, however, one must be familiar with what is true, real and desirable. Ordinarily we find everything surrounding us, occurring in day-to-day life and everything we do as true, real and a matter of fact. But looking at all this carefully, we shall find that these realities are not ever-lasting or eternally constant. They change with the change of time, place and person. What we need, therefore, is the Ultimate Truth, the Ultimate Reality, infinite and eternal, beyond time, beyond birth and death, beyond places ‚Äì the same everywhere, and beyond all identities ‚Äì the same for everyone, irrespective of one's caste, colour, race, religion or nationality etc.http://www.theindiapost.com/religion/sant- nirankari-mission-and-its-ideology/ And this Ultimate Truth, Ultimate Reality; this supreme, eternal and infinite entity is God. In His formless existence, it is He who was there when nothing existed, He is there when everything exists and He shall be there when there will be nothing ‚Äì animate or inanimate. Hence the principal aim of human life is to know this formless, attribute-less omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent God.Sarhadi B(2000). Introjection. Sant Nirankari Mandal Regd. This is what we are living for. Once it is accomplished and God gets associated with our thoughts, words and actions, we know what is true, real and desirable. Therefore, one must link the mind with God all the time at all places and in all circumstances. This makes life meaningful, joyous, and content. This leads to a state of complete harmony and makes life happy here and earns the bliss that is eternal, hereafter.Singh A(1999). A Unique Mission. Sant Nirankari Mandal Regd. The devotees of the Mission practice spirituality through regular congregations held at various centres of the Mission. An annual congregation called Sant Nirankari Samagam is also held at Sant Nirankari Spiritual Complex, Samalkhahttps://wego.here.com/india/ganaur-sub-district/religious-place/sant- nirankari-spiritual-complex--356jx7ps- df50c4a4565c010dad6aeff2642e9ac1?x=ep‚Ü¶=29.17746,77.02966,15,normal where lakhs of devotees gather to share their thoughts on spirituality. Avtar Bani The Avtar Bani outlines the key philosophy of the Sant Nirankari Mission. Named after its author, Nirankari Baba Avtar Singh Ji, it was first published under the title of 'Avtar Bani' in 1957. Its complete version was, however, published in 1965 as 'Sampuran Avtar Bani'. Originally written in 376 Punjabi verses, with some stanzas were in Urdu and Sindhi, Sampuran Avtar Bani explains the message of the Mission in all its aspects. Even though not worshipped as a holy religious book, every devotee values it for its practical and easy-to-understand messages. Sampuran Avtar Bani has already been published in Gurumukhi, Devnagari, Urdu and Roman scripts. It has also been translated and published in and published in English (prose) and, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Nepali, Marathi, Garhwali, Haryanavi, Sindhi and Telugu (all verses). The Sampuran Hardev Bani, authored by Baba Hardev Singh Ji, was published in 2017. Written in Hindi, the Sampuran Hardev Bani contains 301 verses. Nirankari Museum The Nirankari Museum was inaugurated by fourth satguru of the Mission, Baba Hardev Singh Ji, on 22 February 2005. The museum is located within the Sant Nirankari Sarovar Complex in New Delhi. It depicts the history and key teachings of the Mission through audio-visuals and pictures. Nirankari Sant Samagam The Nirankari Sant Samagam, which is a term used to describe a large scale spiritual gathering, is held on over 1400 acres of Sant Nirankari Spiritual Complex land at Samalkha, Haryana, India. It is one of the highlights in the annual diary of every member of the Mission where they congregate once a year in perfect harmony and with great enthusiasm. The Samagam is truly and unique occasion where people from various cultures, faiths, backgrounds and walks of life get together and join in prayer and remembrance of one Formless God who is known as Nirankar. There are 1,000's of Sevadal units (Selfless Volunteers) from all over the world who engage in selfless service at this occasion and work tirelessly throughout the course of the year in order to manage the noble work of the Mission. This further promotes the feeling of community contribution and service by engaging youth and the elders alike.  Community Contributions  The mission has been contributing to social welfare and community development through its social welfare department, as also through Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation (SNCF). The underlying principle here is to heal, enrich and empower the world, by serving with humility. The Mission operates many schools, colleges and other educational institutions in various cities of India. Along with this, vocational institutes for youth have been set-up for up-skilling. Youth empowerment and women empowerment programs are also organized regularly. In the realm of health, the mission has organized various health check-up camps, eye check-up camps and has rendered medical assistance to disabled and elderly. Blood Donation camps have been organized for almost about 3 decades now and this journey is on-going. Even during the extremely trying times of COVID-19 pandemic; the mission organized many safe and well-controlled blood donation camps in various parts of India. The devotees of the Mission are also involved in tree plantation drives and cleanliness drives along with providing relief and rehabilitation to natural calamity affected brothers and sisters. All these efforts of selfless service are done by the volunteers of the Mission, who form a disciplined group in the form of Sant Nirankari Sewadal (SNSD), established in 1956. The Mission is also coming up with Sant Nirankari Health City (SNHC), a huge super specialty hospital in North Delhi, India to cater to the comprehensive wellness and health of the community.http://www.theindiapost.com/religion/sant-nirankari-mission-and-its- ideology/ References=References from Sant Nirankari Mandal website=External links * *Foundation website Category:Organizations established in 1929 Category:Religious organisations based in India Category:Spiritual organizations Category:1929 establishments in India ","title":"Sant Nirankari Mission"},{"id":"1496804","text":"Hidden personality is the part of the personality that is determined by unconscious processes. Sigmund Freud and Carl Rogers theorised that people have a 'hidden' personality of which they are not aware. Although both theories are developed through years of clinical experience, they are based on very different assumptions. It is argued that Rogers' theory is to be preferred over the Freudian model because it is more in tune with findings of contemporary scientific research.  Sigmund Freud  The basic assumption of Freud's psychoanalytic view of the person is an energy system in which all mental processes are considered to be energy flows, which can flow freely or can get sidetracked or dammed up. Freud argues that the goal of all behaviour is the reduction of tension through the release of energy, which produces pleasure. People function in accordance with hedonistic principles, seeking unbridled gratification of all desires. The endless pursuit of pleasure is, however, in conflict with society and civilization, as the uncontrolled satisfaction of pleasure is not accepted. In Freud's view, humans are primarily driven by sexual and aggressive instincts. Sexual and aggressive energy prevented from expression in a more direct way are converted to cultural activities such as art and science. Energy used for cultural purposes is, however, no longer available to sexual purposes and Freud concludes that the price of civilization is misery, the forfeit of happiness and a sense of guilt. Freud's theory of personality is based on the idea that much of human behaviour is determined by forces outside awareness. The relation between the person and society is controlled by primitive urges buried deep within ourselves, forming the basis of the hidden self. Freud argues that much of our psychic energy is devoted either to finding acceptable expressions of unconscious ideas or to keeping them unconscious. Freud constructed his concept of the unconscious from analysis of slips of the tongue, dreams, neuroses, psychoses, works of art and rituals. In psychoanalytic theory, mental life is divided into three levels of awareness. The largest portion of the mind is formed by the unconscious system and only a very small part by the conscious. The preconscious-system stands like a partition screen between the unconscious-system and consciousness. The conscious mind is like the tip of an iceberg, with its greatest part ‚Äì the unconscious ‚Äì submerged. Psychoanalytic theory is fundamentally a motivational theory of human behaviour and Freud claimed that \\"psychoanalysis aims at and achieves nothing more than the discovery of the unconscious in mental life\\".  Carl Rogers  Humanist psychologist Carl Rogers opposed psychoanalytic personality theory as he was dissatisfied with the 'dehumanising nature' of this school of thought. The central tenet of humanistic psychology is that people have drives that lead them to engage in activities resulting in personal satisfaction and a contribution to society: the actualising tendency. This tendency is present in all organisms and can be defined as the motivation present in every life form to develop its potentials to the fullest extent. Humanistic psychology is based on an optimistic view of human nature and the direction of people's movement is basically towards self-actualisation. Some might criticise Rogers as being a naive optimist and point out the violent history of humanity. Rogers defends his view by referring to the fact that his theory is based on more than twenty-five years of experience in psychotherapy. A person's identity is formed through a series of personal experiences, which reflect how the individual is perceived by both him or herself and the outside world ‚Äì the phenomenological field. Individuals also have experiences of which they are unaware and the phenomenological field contains both conscious and unconscious perceptions. The concept of the self is, according to Rogers, however, primarily conscious. The most important determinants of behaviour are those that are conscious or are capable of becoming conscious. Rogers argues that a notion of the self that includes a reference to the unconscious (as with Freud) cannot be studied objectively as it can not be directly known. Rogerian personality theory distinguishes between two personalities. The real self is created through the actualising tendency, it is the self that one can become. The demands of society, however, do not always support the actualising tendency and we are forced to live under conditions that are out of step with our tendencies. The ideal self is the ideal created through the demands of society. Rogers does not see it as something to strive for (that is the real self) but an ideal imposed on us we can never fully reach. Rogers' view of 'hidden' personality relates to the person one could be given the right circumstances within society. For an individual to be truly happy and for self-actualisation to be realised, the public and hidden selves must be as similar as possible. Rogers believed that when all aspects of a person's life, surroundings and thoughts are in harmony, thus the ideal state of congruence is reached.  Carl Jung  Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist who became one of the most famous and influential psychological thinkers and innovators of all time. Early in his career, Jung studied with Sigmund Freud and was thought to possibly succeed Freud as the leading promoter of Freud's brand of psychoanalysis. Later in his career Jung's thinking diverged significantly from Freudian psychology in ways that are directly relevant to the concept of the inferior function. Jung viewed human personality from a broad perspective, so his system for understanding individual differences and similarities is complex. Jung saw the human psyche as containing everything necessary to grow, adapt, and heal itself. He believed that people were capable of directing their own personality development and benefiting from both positive and negative life experiences (Quenk 2002). In his studies, Carl Jung divided the psyche into the unconscious and the conscious minds. Freud viewed the unconscious as containing the Id, the Superego and the Ego, whereas Jung developed a different model. He described the unconscious as consisting of two major components: the Personal Unconscious and the Collective Unconscious (Quenk 2002). Jung looked at all behavior including neurotic symptoms as ways of stimulating an individual's growth toward completion. He was interested in personality development as it occurred over the life span and saw it as an ongoing process.  Personal Unconscious  The Personal Unconscious, as conceived by Jung, encompasses the totality of what Freud recognized as \\"the unconscious\\" and corresponds to what most of us intuitively associate with the term \\"unconscious mind.\\" It contains those elements of our own unique life experience which have been forgotten, ignored, repressed, suppressed or otherwise blocked from consciousness. Some of these elements can be easily recalled into consciousness at will, while others may be more difficult to access or retrieve. In simpler terms, the Personal Unconscious are the thoughts, ideas, emotions, and other mental phenomena acquired and repressed during one's lifetime.  The Collective Unconscious  Many philosophers have advanced the theory that the human mind is a \\"blank slate,\\" capable of being molded by our upbringing, which includes social experiences. In working with patients, Carl Jung observed the development of repeated themes in different people's artwork, dreams and fantasies. Yet he noticed that many of these themes had no relation to and could not have originated from any connection to the person's own individual life experiences. Jung concluded that, in addition to our Personal Unconscious, we each possess a deeper aspect of the unconscious. It was in identifying this second unconscious region that Jung's model differentiated itself from Freud's. Naming it the Collective Unconscious, Jung theorized that this region contained psychological elements not developed during the course of our own lives, but passed on through our common evolutionary history to all members of our species. There are shared, fundamental elements that make up the Collective Unconscious and generate a limiting framework around which our psychic material organizes. He referred to those as Archetypes. Archetypes are the fundamental elements of the collective unconscious. Jung, states that every human being is born with a psyche that expects to engage, influence, and to undergo certain life milestones. For instance, our psyches have evolved to expect us to be born, to expect us to have parents, to expect us to encounter particular types of other people and creatures with which we share the earth, to expect us to have children, and to expect us to eventually die. These fundamental psychological expectations have become embodied, Jung claimed, in a common set of basic tendencies in the unconscious that predispose us to generate particular ideas, concepts and imagery related to them. These tendencies are the Archetypes.  Foundations of Personality  Freud and Roger's theory of personality are based on some very different assumptions. Their concept of human nature and the role of rationality in human motivation are diametrically opposed. Although both theories include a hidden personality, both concepts are very different in that for Freud it is our natural state, while for Rogers it is the self- created by the demands of society.  Human Nature  Freud theorised that people have an unconscious mind that would, if permitted, manifest itself in incest, murder and other activities which are considered crimes in contemporary society. Freud believes that neuroticism is a result of tensions caused by suppression of our unconscious drives, which are fundamentally aggressive towards others. Rogers agrees that we may behave aggressive and violent at times, but at such times we are neurotic and are not functioning as fully developed human beings. Rogers reverses Freud's concept of neuroticism and thinks that what Freud has construed as our natural state of being is actually unnatural and unhealthy behaviour. For Rogers, the core of our nature is essentially positive and aligned towards self-actualisation, while for Freud, we solely are driven by sexual and aggressive instincts. Recent research support Rogers' point of view as it has shown that people with an optimistic style of thought tend to cope more effectively with stress than do people who have a pessimistic style.  Reason in Human Behaviour  Revolutions in the history of science have one common feature: they deconstruct our convictions about our own self-importance. Copernicus moved our home from centre of the universe to its periphery, Darwin relegated us to descent from an animal world and Freud discovered the unconscious and deconstructed the myth of a fully rational mind. In Freud's view, human beings are basically irrational and the unconscious mind is alogical. We are forever driven by irrational, practically uncontrollable unconscious instincts that are the ultimate cause of all activity. Rogers sees human beings as basically rational and behaviour is controlled through reason. Rationality and the actualising tendency are inseparably connected in Rogers' basic image of personality. Human behaviour is, according to Rogers: \\"exquisitely rational, moving with subtle and ordered complexity toward the goals the organism is endeavouring to achieve\\". The natural course of the actualising tendency is, however, often blocked by psychosocial conditions. When this happens, people become estranged from their true nature and may behave irrationally through anti-social and destructive behaviour.  Hidden Personalities  The Freudian concept of the unconscious mind was never experimentally verified by him and remained a theoretical construct. Critical questions about what is available to immediate observation and what occurs unconsciously could never be fully answered by Freud as he did not possess any of the current day technological possibilities. Through contemporary cognitive science, it has been discovered that most of our thought actually is unconscious, not in the Freudian sense of being repressed, but in the sense that it operates beneath the level of cognitive awareness, inaccessible to consciousness and operating too fast to focus on. Unconscious processing goes on in the mind of humans, not because we have to filter out threatening stimuli and impulses, but because many cognitive operations go on without conscious participation. The brain operates in this way in order not to flood the conscious part of the mind with impressions. The unconscious is a type of process, a way of constructing perception, memories and other kinds of cognition, not a portion of the mind. This view agrees with Roger's concept of the unconscious, who theorised that the unconscious is only a part of the phenomenological field and does not control our personality. Aside from Freud and Roger's views on the hidden personality there is a simplified idea of stress. When our hidden personality emerges it is also referred to as out-of-character episodes. These are essential to our general well-being as well as helping to continue our own personal growth and development. When a hidden personality emerges it's also called being 'in the grip'. This refers to the times when the inferior function is being showcased. This happens when we are low on energy and under great stress. Stress is defined as any external or internal event that lessens or depletes one's mental and physical well being. Stress is a necessary and sufficient stimulus for bringing out our hidden personality. Unconscious contents are charged with energy that must be discharged in order for a person to function comfortably and with minimal tension and distress. One of the most powerful and universal ways human beings deal with being unacknowledged, unconscious thoughts and feelings is through projection. Because the inferior function is appropriately understood as an unconscious process that is subject to the mechanism of projection. Projection involves attributing to others an unacknowledged, unconscious part of ourselves- something that lies outside our conscious awareness. What we project onto others can be negative or it can be positive. In Jung's psychology, projection often accounts for our initial attraction to or rejection of others. A person may be a ready \\"host\\" for one or more aspects of our own unconscious, and it's a way our psyche regulates itself. Equilibrium is maintained when people eliminate their contradictory ideas or feelings (Quenk 2002). We are all capable of using our tertiary and inferior functions when a particular task requires them. Jung suggested that we all have instincts that pushes us to grow toward completion, or to become the best possible version of ourselves. This goal is called individualization, a state of self-awareness or self-actualization we strive for and hardly ever achieve. Jung saw the lifelong quest of individualism as more important than focusing on an unattainable end point.

Heym products during this time consisted of cuckoo clocks, slide rules, spinning wheels, among various other products. Heym built a new factory in M√ºnnerstadt/ Lower Franconia, Germany in 1952 and transferred manufacturing to this site. Their first cold hammer forging machine ‚ÄúAklett‚Äù was purchased in 1960. Rolf Heym took over management of the company in 1963 until his death in 1972. At that time Elisabeth Heym assumed management of the company and began acquisition of new foreign markets. In 1988 Oskar W. Zurfl√ºh of Zurich assumed management of the company. The company was transferred to J√ºrgen Nierich, Munich, HEYM Jagdwaffenfabrik GmbH & Co. KG in 1992.

Much of his writing has focused on the culture of Asia, particularly that of China and 20th-century Japan. He was the Paul W. Williams Professor of Human Rights and Journalism at Bard College from 2003 to 2017. Early life and education Buruma was born and raised in The Hague, Netherlands. His father, Sytze Leonard \\"Leo\\" Buruma, was a Dutch lawyer and the son of a Mennonite minister, and his mother, Gwendolyn Margaret \\"Wendy\\" Schlesinger, a Briton of German-Jewish descent.https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/book/their-promised-land-my- grandparents-in-love-and-warhttps://www.enotes.com/topics/ian-buruma He went to study at Leiden University in 1971, and obtained a Candidate degree in Chinese literature and History in 1975.

Ghomeshi was acquitted in 2016 of one count of choking and four counts of sexual assault, after over 20 women complained either to the police or in the media. The publication of the essay was controversial, in part, because Ghomeshi wrote that the allegations against him were \\"inaccurate\\". In an interview with Slate magazine, Buruma defended his decision to publish, and denied that the article was misleading because it had failed to mention that Ghomeshi had been required to issue an apology to one of the victims as part of the terms of a case against him. He also denied that the title, \\"Reflections from a Hashtag\\", was dismissive of the #MeToo movement; stated that the movement has resulted in \\"undesirable consequences\\"; and said: \\"I‚Äôm no judge of the rights and wrongs of every allegation. ...

He is best known as the drummer and co-founding member of the rock band Weezer, with whom he has recorded thirteen studio albums. In addition to his work in Weezer, Wilson also fronts his own band, The Special Goodness. Career=Early life Patrick Wilson was born in Buffalo, New York on February 1, 1969, and raised in nearby Clarence.Luerssen D., John. Rivers' Edge: The Weezer Story. ECW Press, 2004, p. 47 He was introduced to music very early on in his life, making his first musical purchase of Barry Manilow's 1976 album This One's for You. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday he went to his first concert, seeing Van Halen. As a result, he was inspired to start taking drum lessons. By his senior year at Clarence High School, Wilson and his friend Greg Czarnecki began teaching the instrument, eventually amassing over 30 students.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 48 After graduating from high school in 1987, Wilson attended a local college briefly, dropping out after one semester. He commented, \\"College is such bunk. Too much politics and jockeying for favor. I just couldn't do it. College is great if you want to learn, but that's not what college is about, it's about making your professor happy and getting good grades and getting into IBM. Any place that says that they're only accepting college graduates is not a place I'm very interested in being.\\" Growing tired of the local music scene, and at the urging of friend Patrick Finn, Wilson at the age of 21 moved to Los Angeles.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 49 Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, he joined the short-lived band Bush (not Gavin Rossdale's Bush) While in Bush, Wilson met future Weezer bass player Matt Sharp, with whom he developed a friendship.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 50 Eventually by the spring of 1991, Wilson started a band with Patrick Finn, Matt Sharp, and later Jason Cropper called Sixty Wrong Sausages.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 51 Meanwhile, Wilson was also in another band with future Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo called Fuzz, which dissolved within three months.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 54 \\"By the time I had met Matt Sharp, and we were trying to figure out something to do. We had a lot of passion and interested in certain kinds of music, but we didn't know how that was going to translate into what we were going to do. So we met Rivers ‚Äì 'He's got an 8-track, let's get with him' ‚Äì and we convinced him to move into this apartment with us. Rivers was just starting to write songs and he asked me to play drums on a song for him. That turned into a band called Fuzz, with this girl bass player. That was pretty cool, but it had to die.\\"Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 55 In the summer of 1991, Sharp moved north to Berkeley to pursue what Karl Koch called, \\"some sorta symphonic keyboard sequencing music.\\"Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 56 Other members of the band moved to separate apartments.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 58 During this time, Wilson performed in a number of different bands, such as The Dum Dums and United Dirt.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 57 Eventually Cuomo, Wilson, and Cropper would reunite in a band called Sixty Wrong Sausages with Patrick Finn.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 59 Matt Sharp would later replace Finn.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 60 During this time, Wilson and Cuomo embarked on the \\"50 song project\\" in which they would dedicate themselves to writing 50 new songs.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 61 Out of this project, future Weezer songs would be created such as \\"Undone‚ÄîThe Sweater Song,\\" \\"My Name Is Jonas,\\" \\"Lullaby For Wayne,\\" and \\"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here.\\" In January 1992, Sharp reconnected with his former bandmates Cuomo, Wilson, and Cropper, and Wilson showed him material from his and Cuomo's \\"50 song project.\\"Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 62 Sharp was pleased with the material and returned to Los Angeles to join the band, consisting of Rivers Cuomo, Patrick Wilson, and Jason Cropper, now under the name Weezer. With Weezer In addition to his drum duties, Wilson has three song co- writing credits on Weezer songs ‚Äì \\"The World has Turned and Left Me Here,\\" \\"Surf Wax America,\\" \\"My Name is Jonas\\" ‚Äì and solo writing credits on \\"Automatic\\" and \\"In the Mall.\\" He also has lead vocal/lead guitar duties on \\"Automatic.\\" However, Rivers Cuomo and Pat Wilson have written far more songs collaboratively including \\"Lemonade\\" (released on Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo) and \\"Lullaby For Wayne\\" (released on the deluxe version of The Blue Album). In the past, Wilson's amusing stunts on skateboards, scooters, and bicycles have been video taped and released on Weezer's official website. Some of these videos can be seen on Weezer's DVD, Video Capture Device, released in 2004. Wilson can be seen playing guitar for Weezer when they play acoustic versions of songs on tour; in 2005 during the Foozer tour (with Foo Fighters), Wilson played lead guitar and sang for the song \\"Photograph,\\" which was always followed by him leading a cover of Blur's \\"Song 2.\\" Wilson wrote and performed lead vocals/guitars on \\"Automatic,\\" on Weezer's third self-titled album. The song was remixed by LA Riots for the video game Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. Wilson also sang lead vocals on Red Album b-sides \\"Life's What You Make It\\" (a Talk Talk cover), a cover of \\"Love My Way\\" by The Psychedelic Furs, and lead vocals in parts of Weezer's cover of Gary Numan's \\"Are 'Friends' Electric?,\\" which he had sung live with Weezer in 2005. On Weezer's 2008 Troublemaker tour, Wilson played drums and sang lead vocals first on a three part lead vocal with Scott Shriner and Rivers Cuomo on \\"My Name is Jonas\\"; sang lead vocals and played lead guitar on \\"Automatic\\" and covers of Nirvana's \\"Sliver,\\" Oasis's \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory),\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Time\\"; and played drums and sings back-up vocals on \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived.\\" On Weezer's 2009 tour supporting Blink 182, Josh Freese played drums for Weezer while Wilson played guitar for 90% of their set. Rivers Cuomo insisted that he wanted to be more interactive and mobile on stage, so Wilson took up his responsibility of guitar and only played drums on songs that didn't require multiple guitar parts. Other projects Wilson records and performs with his own band, The Special Goodness, for which he writes songs, performs vocals, and plays the majority of the instruments. The band has released several albums, and Wilson himself has made songs available on his website in the past. Almost immediately after Weezer's initial success, Wilson played drums on The Rentals' first record Return of the Rentals but never toured with the band. Wilson and Weezer guitarist Brian Bell collaborated on a cover of the Velvet Underground song \\"Heroin\\" for the 2006 film Factory Girl. Additionally, Wilson and Bell were given small roles in the film as John Cale and Lou Reed, respectively. Wilson has been an Executive Producer for the No Agenda podcast.

Earlier in his career, Wilson taught philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles. Career Wilson is noted within the library and information science communities for his work on the philosophical underpinnings of bibliographic control, that is, the ways in which knowledge is organized and the relationships between different documents and pieces of knowledge. He also did work on what he called \\"cognitive authority,\\" which is the study of how people gain reputation and the authority of possessing knowledge in the eyes of other people. He is the subject of an oral history. Wilson was the winner of the 2001 American Society for Information Science and Technology Award of Merit. In his acceptance remarks, Wilson commented: So for me information science and technology has been a fascinating combination of engineering, an odd kind of materials science and social epistemology. Social epistemology with a focus on textual objects and with an eye on the actual and possible roles of information systems is a productive approach to our field.

The EMD Dash 2 is a line of diesel-electric locomotives introduced by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division (EMD) on January 1, 1972. Designations of these models were those of the former models with \\"-2\\" added (e.g., the SD40 was replaced by the SD40-2). They retained the basic specifications of the earlier models in terms of power output and most other features, but introduced a number of improvements to the locomotives' internal systems, specifically the electrical systems. These were intended to improve availability, efficiency, and ease of maintenance. One major improvement was a modularized electrical control cabinet, allowing maintenance by unit replacement and the use of common parts. These concepts were first tested on the DDA40X. Changes Minor externally visible changes common across the whole line include the following: * Modified trucks with damping struts. Four- axle trucks have damping struts on two diagonally opposite corners. Six-axle trucks have them on the center axle. * Six axle trucks with all traction motors pointing towards the center. This improves the truck's factor of adhesion but also increases each truck's overall length. The locomotive's frame was lengthened as a consequence. These were the HT-C trucks which were employed for the next 20 years. The older Flexicoil C trucks remained a seldom-selected option. * Engine water level sight glass on the rear upper right-hand side of the long hood. * Battery boxes in front of the cab have bolted down covers, rather than hinged. * Equipped with both high and low positions for rear classification lights, one set being blanked. * Cab roof extends slightly beyond the cab rear to accommodate the larger electrical cabinet. Models The Dash 2 line was highly successful. The models offered included the following: * GP38-2 * GP38-2W * GP39-2 * GP40-2 * GP40-2L(W) * GP40-2W * GP40P-2 * SD38-2 * SD40-2 * SD40-2F * SD40-2W * SD40T-2 * SD40-2S * SD45-2 * SD45T-2 * SDP40F * F40PH * F40PH-2 * F40PHM-2 * F40PH-2C Rebuilds In addition, many other earlier locomotives were rebuilt to Dash 2 standards by numerous locomotive rebuilders and railroad shops. Among the most popular rebuilds are SD40, SD45, SD40T-2 and SD45T-2 into the functional equivalent of an SD40-2, although the frame, carbody and trucks remain the same as on the \\"donor\\" locomotive. In many cases, the rebuilds are identified as, for example, an SD40-3 or an SD40M-2, or an equivalent distinguishing identification. In some cases, the locomotive is identified simply as an SD40-2, although it is clear through physical examination that it is a rebuild. Once so rebuilt, the locomotive enters the owner's fleet as if it were a true SD40-2, arguably the most versatile and reliable diesel-electric locomotive of its time, if not all-time. Although not as popular as the SD40-2 rebuilds, GP40s, GP39/SD39s and GP38/SD38s have also been rebuilt to the equivalent of GP40-2s, GP39-2/SD39-2s and GP38-2/SD38-2s, so significant were the reliability and serviceability advantages of the Dash 2 line. Subsequent models Models subsequent to the Dash 2 line, for example SD50, SD60 and SD70, et al., incorporated Dash 2 improvements at the outset. In this context, the model suffix -2 is only applicable to the 40 Series, although -2 has been applied to certain variations of the later models.

The special premiered on ABC on December 10, 1976. Three years later, it was also aired on TV Asahi in Japan on December 24, 1979 under the Japanese dub title Ëµ§Èºª„ÅÆ„Éà„Éä„Ç´„Ç§ „É´„Éâ„É´„ÉïÁâ©Ë™û (Akahananotonakai Rudorufu Monogatari). Plot Just after many hours of delivering Christmas presents from around the world (the events depicted in the last scenes of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer), Santa Claus receives a letter from his friend Father Time asking for help to find Happy the Baby New Year before midnight (\\"the 12th bong\\") on New Year's Eve or else it will be December 31 forever. Santa sends Rudolph out to find him due to the snowstorm currently happening outside. An evil giant vulture named Eon the Terrible is supposed to live for exactly one Eon after which he will turn into ice and snow and disintegrate. As his particular Eon will end January 1 of the New Year, he plans to kidnap Happy to keep the year from ending and stop time, thus preventing his predestined death. General Ticker (a military clock) and the great Quarter-Past-Five, or Quart for short (a camel with a clock in his hump), bring Rudolph to Father Time's castle beyond the Sands of Time. Father Time speculates that Happy, who ran away due to his big ears being laughed at when they were first seen by Nanny Nine O'Clock, is hiding out in the \\"Archipelago of Last Years\\" where the Old Years retire and rule over an island styled to resemble the year over which they ruled. When Rudolph is attacked by Eon on the ocean while en route to the Archipelagos, he is saved by Big Ben (a sperm whale with a clock attached to his tail) who transports Rudolph across the ocean. Upon arrival in the Archipelagos, Rudolph first travels to the island belonging to a caveman named O.M. (short for One Million B.C.). O.M. inhabits an island anachronistically inhabited with friendly dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. As Rudolph and his friends search for Happy (who left after his hat accidentally fell off saving a baby Pterodactylus and revealing his big ears, causing the dinosaurs to laugh), they repeatedly encounter Eon. After other off-screen visits to the islands of 4000 B.C., 1492, 1893, and 1965 have been completed without success, Rudolph and O.M. head for the island of 1023 (pronounced \\"10-2-3\\"), belonging to a Scottish knight with a long beard named Sir 1023 whose island is filled with medieval trappings along with several fairy tale and Mother Goose characters. Meanwhile, Happy manages to befriend the Three Bears, but becomes saddened when he removes his hat and exposing his big ears to them, causing him to leave again despite Baby Bear begging him not to go. The group then travels to the island of 1776, which reflects Colonial America and is ruled over by \\"Sev\\" (AKA 1776) who resembles Benjamin Franklin. Following Happy's seeming rejection on the Island of 1776 following the daily parade, Eon kidnaps him and takes him to his lair on the Island of No-Name which is said to be located \\"due north of the North Pole\\". The group now leaves the Archipelego in pursuit. Catching up to Eon, they attempt to rescue Happy. However, Eon (upon being awakened by the sound of O.M. tumbling) thwarts them by sending an avalanche down on the group and trapping them inside giant snowballs. Managing to melt his way free using his nose, Rudolph climbs up to Eon's nest where he finds Happy, who refuses to leave. Rudolph shows Happy his nose and tells him his own story of being bullied because of his nonconformity before asking Happy to let him see his ears. Happy does so, and Rudolph, like everyone else before him, laughs at the sight. Happy once again gets upset, but Rudolph explains that the sight of Happy's ears had made him feel so wonderful that he had to laugh out loud, just like it had done with everyone else. With this declaration, Happy shouts out with joy, but causes Eon to awaken. Rudolph quickly tells Happy to take off his hat and leave it off for good. At the sight of Happy's large ears, Eon bursts into uncontrollable laughter which sends him tumbling down the side of the mountain and into the three remaining snowballs, freeing O.M., 1023, and Sev. Rudolph realizes that Eon is now so full of warmth and happiness that it would be impossible for him to turn to ice and snow. With Santa's help, they return to Father Time's castle with Happy just in time for the beginning of the new year before the 12th bong, which is designated \\"19-Wonderful\\". After the celebration, everyone wishes Happy a happy new year. Rudolph proclaims to the viewers that \\"it may be shiny, too.\\" Archipelago of Last Years Map of the Archipelago of Last Years When the old year has been retired, they settle on an island in the Archipelago of Last Years where time remains still on that island. Among the islands of the Archipelago of Last Years are: * 1,000,000 BC Island: Represented as a prehistoric, anachronistic island that consists of dinosaurs, other prehistoric creatures, and cavepeople living together. O.M. lives here. * 4,000 BC Island: Rudolph mentions that all its inhabitants wanted to do was build pyramids. * 1023 Island: Represented as a medieval island filled with fairy tale characters. The year 1023 is said in Father Time's narration to be when all the well-known fairy tales and nursery rhymes actually happened. Sir 1023 lives here. * 1492 Island: Rudolph mentions that the people on that island were too busy discovering things to talk to Rudolph and O.M. * 1776 Island: Represented as a Colonial American island that celebrates American Independence Day on a daily basis with none of the revolutionary war. 1776 (Sev) lives here. * 1893 Island: Rudolph mentions that the inhabitants have never heard of Happy. 1893 was indeed an unhappy time as a major economic depression called the Panic of 1893 hit the United States that year. * 1965 Island: Rudolph stated that island was \\"too noisy\\" to search for Happy. Among the noisy world events of 1965 included Beatlemania (and other British Invasion-related hysteria) and growing opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War.

It is the administrative centre of Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality.Municipal Demarcation Board : Municipal Profiles 2003 : Contacts Retrieved 15 April 2010  History  When diamonds were discovered in the Vaal River in the 1870s the former Transvaal Government established a settlement on the banks of the river in 1870, in an attempt to control and alleviate land disputes over diamond discoveries further down the Vaal River. This town was established on the farm Zoutpansdrift (salt pan drift) and named Christiana, after the only daughter of President Pretorius of the old Transvaal. The first residential stands were sold in 1870. Two years later diamonds were discovered in the gravel of the Vaal River close by and the inevitable manic rush followed. As usual the initial rush petered with the diamonds. In 1997, diamonds were rediscovered along the banks of a farm on the Free State side of Christiana. This led to a new diamond rush and diggings that continue to this day.  Economy  The town contains one of the biggest diggers' bells ever to exist in the world. The bell is currently under water in the Vaal River as it once sank and ended in the drowning of several diggers. There were a few attempts to get the diggers' bell out, as it is said that there are diamonds still in it, but it was in vain as it is surrounded by too much mud Christiana is one of the corners of the \\"Maize Rectangle\\", with the mainstay of the economy being the production of maize, potatoes, onions, sorghum, groundnuts and beef. The main farmers in the area are the de Beer's and Callender-Easby's. South Africa's top horse stud, Callaho Warmblood Sport Horses, can be found near Christiana. Christiana is well known for its water sports along the Vaal River, as well as the Diamond Diggers Festival (Delwers Fees) that occurs annually. Other tourist attractions include the Diggers' Diamond Museum (authentic digging equipment and old photographs pay tribute to the town's diamond industry) and San Bushman rock art (excellent examples can be viewed 6 km out of town on the Farm Stowlands) and Stows Kopje (prehistoric rock engravings which are a provincial heritage site).

It links Shing Sai Road in Kennedy Town to the west and Harcourt Road in Admiralty to the east. Location The road consists of two adjoining sections, namely Connaught Road Central () and Connaught Road West (). Connaught Road Central runs the length of Central, parallel to the north shore. It runs from approximately Admiralty in the east, where it connects Harcourt Road at the junction with Murray Road. The road ends west on Tai Street, where it becomes Connaught Road West. Connaught Road West runs towards the Kennedy Town and Pok Fu Lam areas in the west. For most of the stretch, Connaught Road West runs beneath the Connaught Road West Flyover, (Route 4). It is the main thoroughfare to the entrance of the Western Harbour Tunnel and beyond to Shek Tong Tsui, where it merges with Des Voeux Road West. History This road was once a waterfront promenade with boats docked against the northern side of the road. In 1889, the north shore of Victoria City was under extensive reclamation. In 1890, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn visited Hong Kong, when Francis Fleming, the then acting governor announced a new road to be constructed in front of the old \\"Bowring Praya\\"(present day Des Voeux Road ). This newly constructed road was then named Connaught Road, after the prince. A statue of the Duke once also occupied the junction of Pedder Street. Connaught Road West was lined with many piers in the past. Rice wholesalers gathered there owing to its proximity to the shore. Due to reclamation of the harbour, the entire length of Connaught Road has now become landlocked.

A solar vehicle is an electric vehicle powered completely or significantly by direct solar energy. Usually, photovoltaic (PV) cells contained in solar panels convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy. The term \\"solar vehicle\\" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's propulsion. Solar power may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions. Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and solar boats are available commercially. Land=Solar cars Solar cars depend on PV cells to convert sunlight into electricity to drive electric motors. Unlike solar thermal energy which converts solar energy to heat, PV cells directly convert the sun into electricity. For example, the recently launched Hyundai Solar Car, which has solar panels mounted on the rooftop of the car. The PV panels on the car would generate electricity to charge the batteries in the car. The design of a solar car is severely limited by the amount of energy input into the car. Solar cars are built for solar car races and also for public use List of prototype solar- powered cars. Even the best solar cells can only collect limited power and energy over the area of a car's surface. This limits solar cars to ultralight composite bodies to save weight. Solar cars lack the safety and convenience features of conventional vehicles. The first solar family car was built in 2013 by students in the Netherlands.Solar Team Eindhoven wins Crunchie in San Francisco This vehicle is capable of 550 miles on one charge during sunlight. It weighs 850 pounds and has a 1.5kw solar array. Solar vehicles must be light and efficient. 3,000 pound or even 2,000 pound vehicles are less practical. Stella Lux, the predecessor to Stella, broke a record with a 932 mile single charge range. The Dutch are trying to commercialize this technology. During racing Stella Lux is capable of 700 miles during daylight. At 45 mph Stella Lux has infinite range. This is again due to high efficiency including a Coefficient of drag of .16. The average family who never drive more than 200 miles a day would never need to charge from the mains. They would only plug in if they wanted to return energy to the grid. Solar cars are often fitted with gauges and/or wireless telemetry, to carefully monitor the car's energy consumption, solar energy capture and other parameters. Wireless telemetry is typically preferred as it frees the driver to concentrate on driving, which can be dangerous in such a small, lightweight car. The Solar Electric Vehicle system was designed and engineered as an easy to install (2 to 3 hours) integrated accessory system with a custom molded low profile solar module, supplemental battery pack and a proven charge controlling system. As an alternative, a battery-powered electric vehicle may use a solar array to recharge; the array may be connected to the general electrical distribution grid. Solar buses Solar buses are propulsed by solar energy, all or part of which is collected from stationary solar panel installations. The Tindo bus is a 100% solar bus that operates as free public transport service in Adelaide City as an initiative of the City Council. Bus services which use electric buses that are partially powered by solar panels installed on the bus roof, intended to reduce energy consumption and to prolong the life cycle of the rechargeable battery of the electric bus, have been put in place in China. Solar buses are to be distinguished from conventional buses in which electric functions of the bus such as lighting, heating or air-conditioning, but not the propulsion itself, are fed by solar energy. Such systems are more widespread as they allow bus companies to meet specific regulations, for example the anti-idling laws that are in force in several of the US states, and can be retrofitted to existing vehicle batteries without changing the conventional engine. Single-track vehicles Solar bicycle in Wolfurt, Vorarlberg, Austria (2020) The first solar \\"cars\\" were actually tricycles or Quadracycles built with bicycle technology. These were called solarmobiles at the first solar race, the Tour de Sol in Switzerland in 1985. With 72 participants, half used solar power exclusively while the other half used solar-human-powered hybrids. A few true solar bicycles were built, either with a large solar roof, a small rear panel, or a trailer with a solar panel. Later more practical solar bicycles were built with foldable panels to be set up only during parking. Even later the panels were left at home, feeding into the electric mains, and the bicycles charged from the mains. Today highly developed electric bicycles are available and these use so little power that it costs little to buy the equivalent amount of solar electricity. The \\"solar\\" has evolved from actual hardware to an indirect accounting system. The same system also works for electric motorcycles, which were also first developed for the Tour de Sol. Applications The Venturi Astrolab in 2006 was the world's first commercial electro-solar hybrid car, and was originally due to be released in January 2008. In May 2007 a partnership of Canadian companies led by Hymotion altered a Toyota Prius to use solar cells to generate up to 240 watts of electrical power in full sunshine. This is reported as permitting up to 15 km extra range on a sunny summer day while using only the electric motors. An inventor from Michigan, USA built a street legal, licensed, insured, solar charged electric scooter in 2005. It had a top speed controlled at a bit over 30 mph, and used fold-out solar panels to charge the batteries while parked. Nuna 3 PV powered car Auxiliary power Photovoltaic modules are used commercially as auxiliary power units on passenger cars in order to ventilate the car, reducing the temperature of the passenger compartment while it is parked in the sun. Vehicles such as the 2010 Prius, Aptera 2, Audi A8, and Mazda 929 have had solar sunroof options for ventilation purposes. The area of photovoltaic modules required to power a car with conventional design is too large to be carried on board. A prototype car and trailer has been built Solar Taxi. According to the website, it is capable of 100 km/day using 6m2 of standard crystalline silicon cells. Electricity is stored using a nickel/salt battery. A stationary system such as a rooftop solar panel, however, can be used to charge conventional electric vehicles. It is also possible to use solar panels to extend the range of a hybrid or electric car, as incorporated in the Fisker Karma, available as an option on the Chevy Volt, on the hood and roof of \\"Destiny 2000\\" modifications of Pontiac Fieros, Italdesign Quaranta, Free Drive EV Solar Bug, and numerous other electric vehicles, both concept and production. In May 2007 a partnership of Canadian companies led by Hymotion added PV cells to a Toyota Prius to extend the range.Hymotion modified Prius using solar power accessed 14 September 2007 SEV claims 20 miles per day from their combined 215W module mounted on the car roof and an additional 3kWh battery. On 9 June 2008, the German and French Presidents announced a plan to offer a credit of 6-8g/km of CO2 emissions for cars fitted with technologies \\"not yet taken into consideration during the standard measuring cycle of the emissions of a car\\".http://www.elysee.fr/download/?mode=press&filename;=09.06_emissions_from_cars_version_anglaise.pdfaccessed This has given rise to speculation that photovoltaic panels might be widely adopted on autos in the near futureaccessed 28 September 2008 It is also technically possible to use photovoltaic technology, (specifically thermophotovoltaic (TPV) technology) to provide motive power for a car. Fuel is used to heat an emitter. The infrared radiation generated is converted to electricity by a low band gap PV cell (e.g. GaSb). A prototype TPV hybrid car was even built. The \\"Viking 29\\"Use of a Thermophotovoltaic Generator in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle, Seal et al., Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington University Bellingham, Washington 98225 was the World‚Äôs first thermophotovoltaic (TPV) powered automobile, designed and built by the Vehicle Research Institute (VRI) at Western Washington University. Efficiency would need to be increased and cost decreased to make TPV competitive with fuel cells or internal combustion engines. Personal rapid transit JPods PRT concept with photovoltaic panels above guideways Several personal rapid transit (PRT) concepts incorporate photovoltaic panels. Rail Railways presents a low rolling resistance option that would be beneficial for planned journeys and stops. PV panels were tested as APUs on Italian rolling stock under EU project.PVTRAIN. Direct feed to a DC grids avoids losses through DC to AC conversion. DC grids are only to be found in electric powered transport: railways, trams and trolleybuses. Conversion of DC from PV panels to grid alternating current (AC) was estimated to cause around 3% of the electricity being wasted. PVTrain concluded that the most interest for PV in rail transport was on freight cars where on board electrical power would allow new functionality: * GPS or other positioning devices, so as to improve its use in fleet management and efficiency. * Electric locks, a video monitor and remote control system for cars with sliding doors, so as to reduce the risk of robbery for valuable goods. * ABS brakes, which would raise the maximum velocity of freight cars to 160 km/h, improving productivity. The Kismaros ‚Äì Kir√°lyr√©t narrow-gauge line near Budapest has built a solar powered railcar called 'Vili'. With a maximum speed of 25 km/h, 'Vili' is driven by two 7 kW motors capable of regenerative braking and powered by 9.9m2 of PV panels. Electricity is stored in on-board batteries. In addition to on-board solar panels, there is the possibility to use stationary (off-board) panels to generate electricity specifically for use in transport. A few pilot projects have also been built in the framework of the \\"Heliotram\\" project, such as the tram depots in Hannover Leinhausen and Geneva (Bachet de Pesay). The 150 kWp Geneva site injected 600 V DC directly into the tram/trolleybus electricity network provided about 1% of the electricity used by the Geneva transport network at its opening in 1999. On December 16, 2017 a fully solar-powered train was launched in New South Wales, Australia. The train is powered using onboard solar panels and onboard rechargeable batteries. It holds a capacity for 100 seated passenger for a 3 km journey. Recently Imperial College London and the environmental charity 10:10 have announced the Renewable Traction Power project to investigate using track-side solar panels to power trains. Meanwhile, Indian railways announced their intention to use on board PV to run air conditioning systems in railway coaches. Also, Indian Railways announced it is to conduct a trial run by the end of May 2016. It hopes that an average of 90,800 liters of diesel per train will be saved on an annual basis, which in turn results in reduction of 239 tonnes of CO2. Water PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar-powered boat and the first ever solar electric vehicle to circumnavigate the globe (in 2012). Solar powered boats have mainly been limited to rivers and canals, but in 2007 an experimental 14m catamaran, the Sun21 sailed the Atlantic from Seville to Miami, and from there to New York. It was the first crossing of the Atlantic powered only by solar. Japan's biggest shipping line Nippon Yusen KK and Nippon Oil Corporation said solar panels capable of generating 40 kilowatts of electricity would be placed on top of a 60,213 ton car carrier ship to be used by Toyota Motor Corporation. In 2010, the T√ªranor PlanetSolar, a 30 metre long, 15.2 metre wide catamaran yacht powered by 470 square metres of solar panels, was unveiled. It is, so far, the largest solar-powered boat ever built.\\"PlanetSolar News.\\"PlanetSolar. In 2012, PlanetSolar became the first ever solar electric vehicle to circumnavigate the globe. Various demonstration systems have been made. Curiously, none yet takes advantage of the huge power gain that water cooling would bring. The low power density of current solar panels limits the use of solar propelled vessels, however boats that use sails (which do not generate electricity unlike combustion engines) rely on battery power for electrical appliances (such as refrigeration, lighting and communications). Here solar panels have become popular for recharging batteries as they do not create noise, require fuel and often can be seamlessly added to existing deck space. Air Swiss solar-powered aircraft Solar Impulse completed a circumnavigation of the world in 2016. Gossamer Penguin Solar ships can refer to solar powered airships or hybrid airships. There is considerable military interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); solar power would enable these to stay aloft for months, becoming a much cheaper means of doing some tasks done today by satellites. In September 2007, the first successful flight for 48h under constant power of a UAV was reported. BBC News: Solar plane flies into the night accessed 10 September 07 This is likely to be the first commercial use for photovoltaics in flight.

A Communications satellite contains multiple radio transmitters which operate continually during its life. It would be uneconomic to operate such a vehicle (which may be on-orbit for years) from primary batteries or fuel cells, and refuelling in orbit is not practical. Solar power is not generally used to adjust the satellite's position, however, and the useful life of a communications satellite will be limited by the on-board station-keeping fuel supply. Solar propelled spacecraft A few spacecraft operating within the orbit of Mars have used solar power as an energy source for their propulsion system. All current solar powered spacecraft use solar panels in conjunction with electric propulsion, typically ion drives as this gives a very high exhaust velocity, and reduces the propellant over that of a rocket by more than a factor of ten. Since propellant is usually the biggest mass on many spacecraft, this reduces launch costs. Other proposals for solar spacecraft include solar thermal heating of propellant, typically hydrogen or sometimes water is proposed. An electrodynamic tether can be used to change a satellite's orientation or adjust its orbit. Another concept for solar propulsion in space is the light sail; this doesn't require conversion of light to electrical energy, instead relying directly on the tiny but persistent radiation pressure of light. Planetary exploration Perhaps the most successful solar-propelled vehicles have been the \\"rovers\\" used to explore surfaces of the Moon and Mars. The 1977 Lunokhod programme and the 1997 Mars Pathfinder used solar power to propel remote controlled vehicles. The operating life of these rovers far exceeded the limits of endurance that would have been imposed, had they been operated on conventional fuels. Electric vehicle with solar assist A Swiss project, called \\"Solartaxi\\", has circumnavigated the world. This is the first time in history an electric vehicle (not self sufficient solar vehicle) has gone around the world, covering 50000 km in 18 months and crossing 40 countries. It is a road-worthy electric vehicle hauling a trailer with solar panels, carrying a 6 m¬≤ sized solar array. The Solartaxi has Zebra batteries, which permit a range of 400 km without recharging. The car can also run for 200 km without the trailer. Its maximum speed is 90 km/h. The car weighs 500 kg and the trailer weighs 200 kg. According to initiator and tour director Louis Palmer, the car in mass production could be produced for 16000 Euro. Solartaxi has toured the World from July 2007 till December 2008 to show that solutions to stop global warming are available and to encourage people in pursuing alternatives to fossil fuel. Palmer suggests the most economical location for solar panels for an electric car is on building rooftops though, likening it to putting money into a bank in one location and withdrawing it in another. Louis Palmer standing in the Solartaxi. Solar Electrical Vehicles is adding convex solar cells to the roof of hybrid electric vehicles. Plug-in hybrid and solar vehicles An interesting variant of the electric vehicle is the triple hybrid vehicle‚Äîthe PHEV that has solar panels as well to assist. The 2010 Toyota Prius model has an option to mount solar panels on the roof. They power a ventilation system while parked to help provide cooling. There are many applications of photovoltaics in transport either for motive power or as auxiliary power units, particularly where fuel, maintenance, emissions or noise requirements preclude internal combustion engines or fuel cells. Due to the limited area available on each vehicle either speed or range or both are limited when used for motive power. PV used for auxiliary power on a yacht Limitations There are limits to using photovoltaic (PV) cells for vehicles: * Power density: Power from a solar array is limited by the size of the vehicle and area that can be exposed to sunlight. This can also be overcome by adding a flatbed and connecting it to the car and this gives more area for panels for powering the car. While energy can be accumulated in batteries to lower peak demand on the array and provide operation in sunless conditions, the battery adds weight and cost to the vehicle. The power limit can be mitigated by use of conventional electric cars supplied by solar (or other) power, recharging from the electrical grid. * Cost: While sunlight is free, the creation of PV cells to capture that sunlight is expensive. Costs for solar panels are steadily declining (22% cost reduction per doubling of production volume). * Design considerations: Even though sunlight has no lifespan, PV cells do. The lifetime of a solar module is approximately 30 years.http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/adv_tech/photovol/ppr_81-85/Reliab%20Res%20toward%2030-yr%20PV%20Mod%20-%20Kobe84.pdf Standard photovoltaics often come with a warranty of 90% (from nominal power) after 10 years and 80% after 25 years. Mobile applications are unlikely to require lifetimes as long as building integrated PV and solar parks. Current PV panels are mostly designed for stationary installations. However, to be successful in mobile applications, PV panels need to be designed to withstand vibrations. Also, solar panels, especially those incorporating glass, have significant weight. In order for its addition to be of value, a solar panel must provide energy equivalent to or greater than the energy consumed to propel its weight.

Elevation is usually constructed as viaducts, typically a long pier bridge. Technically, the entire highway is a single bridge. Yan'an Elevated Road in Shanghai, China  Reason to construct  Elevated highways are more expensive to build than at-grade highways, and are usually only used where there is some combination of the following on the desired route: * difficulty controlling access at grade, for example where it would be very disruptive or expensive to eliminate existing crossings at grade * at grade construction would not allow for optimal traffic flow, for example due to hilly terrain or existing crossings * budget or time to eliminate impeding structures is high, due to acquisition costs, demolition costs, or environmental factors; for example: ** right of way through an urban area, where private property would have to be purchased or condemned, and might have to be litigated ** hills that are costly to level or carve a path through ** protected wetlands where foundations and paving may cause unacceptable environmental damage, or mitigation would be long and expensive * a safety issue at grade, for example, where there are many pedestrians or wildlife  Alternatives  Alternatives to elevated highways are: * At grade uncontrolled highways, but these often have safety or traffic flow issues * At grade controlled access highways, which may have the issues listed earlier in this article * At grade controlled access highways with grade-separated crossings, which may mitigate some or all of the issues listed earlier in the article, at less expense than a fully elevated highway * Tunnels, which have similar advantages to elevated highways, but are significantly more expensive to build. Other advantages to tunnels are that they do not occupy as much valuable real estate (since they can be built on at the surface), cause less noise pollution, may cause less long-term environmental damage, and protect travellers from surface weather. * Below-grade open cuts, which are typically less costly to maintain, but often (though not always) more expensive to build  History = Railway predecessors  Early engineering for elevated highways owes much to early elevated railway design, which preceded them. Elevated highways were first used to: * create free traffic flow * prevent accidents in busy cities * provide some of the first regional connections between nearby cities, in early arterial traffic plans In the late 19th century and early 20th century, railways and streetcars had frequent accidents where they traversed through population centers. These lead to the first \\"death avenues\\", such as 11th Avenue in New York City. Aside from safety, carts and pedestrians crossing trains' paths slowed service.Staff. \\"State may regulate tracks in 11th Ave.; Court Denies Right of City to Disturb New York Central in Use of the Street.\\", The New York Times, May 20, 1911. Accessed August 7, 2009. \\"...the way had been opened through the decision for settling the so-called 'Death Avenue' problem\\". In addition, it became difficult to lay down rail lines, as the construction process was disruptive to normal traffic flow. The existing street grid also made it difficult to lay some railroad lines, as the trains required a wide turn radius. This led to the first elevated railways in the late 19th century. The elevated rails, being grade- separated, prevented almost all pedestrian/vehicle accidents, and could allow track bends above existing structures. Their construction could still be disruptive, but was usually less so, as pier construction to support their elevated structures did not necessarily close an entire roadway or long stretches of roadway for an extended period. However, conversion from at grade railways to elevated (or below ground) did not always take place, and many lines continued to be at grade in urban areas well into the 20th century.  Dawn of the automobile  Concurrently, the increase of automobile and truck traffic early in the 20th century exacerbated many of the safety and free flow issues the railways already presented - and in fact, created additional hazards with railways. The increase in traffic also meant that for the first time, there was a need to develop new and improved roads between cities. By the 1920s, truck traffic in warehouse and dock areas was high enough that there was frequent congestion and frequent accidents. In 1924, New York City began looking for ways to relieve the problems of the combination of trucks, cars, trains, and pedestrians on 11th Avenue, which had been known as Death Avenue even before the advent of the car and truck. The mayor, the Manhattan borough president, the police commissioner, the Port Authority, the New York Central Railroad (owner of the West Side Line whose tracks were on 11th Avenue), and others worked on various plans to take the railroad and passenger cars off the street, eliminating the major conflicts that led to injury, death, property damage, traffic jams, and delays in service. The Miller Highway, named after its chief proponent, Borough President Julius Miller, was constructed in sections, primarily from 1929 through 1937, and became the world's first elevated, controlled access highway. After an interruption for World War II, several extensions were built from 1947 to 1951, under the leadership of urban planner Robert Moses, primarily connecting it to his other projects, such as the Henry Hudson Parkway and Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. The Miller Highway influenced many other subsequent projects, such as Boston's Central Artery and the Pulaski Skyway, and Moses' own Gowanus Parkway. At the start the 20th century, New York and New Jersey state officials realized that car traffic on ferries was increasing beyond the ability of the then-current ferry system. Planning for the Holland Tunnel started in 1919, and it was constructed from 1922 to 1927. As construction started, New Jersey began planning traffic flows between the tunnel and nearby cities. The legislature passed a bill to extend existing highway Route 1 east through Newark and Jersey City. Due to local opposition to having new highways disrupt local traffic patterns, the engineers elected to use a viaduct, which became the Pulaski Skyway for the eastern portions of the new route (until close to the entrance of the tunnel). It opened in 1933. Like the Miller Highway, it included left lane exits and entrances, narrow lanes, and local surface lanes underneath the highway. The Miller Highway, through immature design and resulting problems, became a case study for highway engineering improvements. Engineering of paving, exit orientation, turn radius, drainage, curb height, ramp length, speed optimization, shoulders, maintenance procedures, noise abatement, and minimizing the \\"highway wall\\" effect that could divide communities, were all improved in the 1940s through 1970s, partially by examining the deficiencies of this early elevated highway.  The Interstate system  Interstate 81 in Syracuse, New York State In the mid-1930s, US Federal Highway legislation allocated budget for surveying and planning of roads, including \\"superhighways\\", across the nation, and ordered the chief of the Bureau of Public Roads to report findings and recommendations. The report, submitted in 1939, included a master plan, which recommended that urban highways be \\"depressed or elevated\\". In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt submitted a follow-on report, Interregional Highways, which contained illustrations of the depressed and elevated designs. The elevated illustration,http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/fairbank12a.cfm reminiscent of the Miller Highway and some of its descendants, featured partial left lane ramps, a highway running across the width a populated boulevard, almost building-to-building, a local traffic lanes underneath the highway. The report also includes a picture of the then-recently constructed Gowanus Parkway, and noted how it was thought to have been an appropriate placement that had a minimal effect on the community. (This was later disputed, and the Gowanus is also a case study for how elevated highways divide neighborhoods and contribute to urban blight.) The phrase Interregional Highways gave way to Interstate Highways in a Congressional bill in 1944, and included $125 million for urban highways. The lead agency, the Federal Public Roads Administration (PRA) worked with state engineer associations to develop planning and design criteria. The PRA's leaders, especially Thomas H. MacDonald and Herbert S. Fairbank, were especially concerned about urban highways. Design standards were issued, with some opposition, which were significant improvements over existing designs. For example, minimum lane width of 12 feet and with a median of at least 4 feet (later standards would increase median sizing), minimal overpass heights were set at 14 feet, recommendations to acquire right of way sufficient for proper ramps of 3¬∞ great or less, right-side exit only and only to arterial connections. The Interstate standards have set the pace in the United States for optimal highway design, including those of elevated highways.  Today  Route 5 Shuto Expressway in Tokyo, Japan Elevated expressways are now common around the world, particularly in the central urban areas where traffic volumes and urban densities are high such as cities in the Americas, East and Southeast Asia. Entire networks of elevated expressways exist in the central areas of cities such as Manila, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Osaka, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Wuhan.

Biography=Early life Chater was born Khachik Pogose Astwachatoor () in Calcutta, British India, one of thirteen offspring of Armenian parents Miriam and Chater Paul Chater. His father was a member of the Indian civil service. Chater was orphaned at the age of seven, and he gained entry into the La Martiniere College in Calcutta on a scholarship. In 1864, he moved to Hong Kong from Calcutta and lived with the family of his sister Anna and sister's husband, Armenian Jordan Paul Jordan. Career alt=Full-length sepia portrait of distinguished gentleman with sideburns, wearing a 3-piece suit; body slight left-tilt In the early days in Hong Kong, he was an assistant at the Bank of Hindustan, China and Japan. Later, with the aid of the Sassoon family, he set up business as an exchange broker, resigned from the bank, and traded gold bullion and land on his own account. He took sea-bed soundings at night in a sampan and was thus instrumental in plotting the reclamation of Victoria Harbour. He is credited with a pivotal role in the colonial government's success in acquiring lands then held by the military, at a cost of two million pounds sterling. In 1868, he and Sir Hormusjee Naorojee Mody formed brokerage company Chater & Mody, a largely successful business partnership in Hong Kong, although the firm's Hong Kong Milling Company (aka Rennie's Mill) failed in 1908 and resulted in the suicide of Albert Rennie. In 1886, he helped Patrick Manson establish Dairy Farm, and he entered the Legislative Council that same year, taking the place of F.D. Sassoon. Also in 1886 Chater established Kowloon Wharf and Godown, predecessor of The Wharf (Holdings). In 1889, he established Hongkong Land with James Johnstone Keswick. Hong Kong Land commenced the land reclamation project under the Praya Reclamation Scheme in 1890. Persuaded by the suggestion of temporary councillor Bendyshe Layton that Hong Kong should have electricity, they secretly acquired an old graveyard in Wan Chai, where they built one of the earliest power stations in the world. In 1890, the Hongkong Electric Company went into production. Chater was enthusiastic in two sports: He played for the Hong Kong Cricket Club 1st XI, and was a thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast. He reportedly never missed the weekly races at the Happy Valley Racecourse in 60 years. He set up the Chater Stable in Hong Kong in 1872 that won many races at Happy Valley. The Hong Kong Champions & Chater Cup, the Group One third leg of the Hong Kong Triple Crown, is named in his honour. In 1896, Chater joined government ranks when he was appointed to the Executive Council of Hong Kong, and served there until 1926, the year of his death. He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade in person from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. In 1901, Chater constructed a very fine home with imported European marble at 1, Conduit Road, Hong Kong which he named 'Marble Hall'. Therein, he housed his collection of fine porcelain. To commemorate the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902, Chater presented a statue in bronze of the King to Hong Kong, executed by George Edward Wade and unveiled at Statue Square in 1907. In 1904, Chater single-handedly financed the construction of St. Andrew's Church. Some titles and positions held by Chater: * Master of the Perseverance Lodge 1873 * Steward at the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club * chairman of the board of Stewards of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club (1892‚Äì1926) * Senior Justice of the Peace in Hong Kong * District Grand Master of Hong Kong and South China (1881‚Äì1909) * Director of Dairy Farm Co.

In 1924/25, Chater made the single biggest donation to any institution or organisation whilst still alive, donating 1.1 million Rupees to his alma mater, the desperately struggling La Martiniere College, thus allowing it to avoid certain closure. To honour his contribution to the school, Sir Paul Chater's name was included in the school prayer. Legacy alt=Angled view of a large 2-storey building in Indian style architecture La Martiniere Boys School, Kolkata Chater died in 1926, and bequeathed Marble Hall and its entire contents, including his unique collection of porcelain and paintings, to Hong Kong. The remainder of his estate went to the Armenian Church of the Holy Nazareth in Calcutta, which runs a home for Armenian elderly, named The Sir Catchick Paul Chater Home. He was interred at the Hong Kong Cemetery. Chater's wife lived in Marble Hall as a life tenant until her death in 1935. Ownership then passed to the government. It became \\"Admiralty House\\" ‚Äì the official residence of the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and was commandeered by Japanese during their occupation. It accidentally burned down in 1946, and the government buildings occupied the site since its demolition in 1953. Government residences named 'Chater Hall Flats' are today located on the site of Marble Hall. Chater amassed a large collection of historical pictures and engravings relating to China which he gifted to the colony. The Chater Collection was subject to a work by its curator, James Orange, in 1924, at which time the collection stood at 430 items. Its backbone was the collection of Wyndham Law of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, and included oil paintings, watercolours, sketches, prints and photographs, most of which are based on landscape scenes of the South China trading ports in the 18th and 19th centuries, and of British activities in China. The Chater Collection was dispersed and largely destroyed during the Japanese occupation, and only 94 pieces (now an important part of the collection of the Hong Kong Museum of Art) are known to have survived. Chater's nephew (Anna's son) Gregory Paul Jordan was instrumental in developing medical services and education in Hong Kong and in the founding of the University of Hong Kong. He was its second vice-chancellor. On the occasion of Paul Chater's 171 birthday a bust of Paul Chater was unveiled at the La Martiniere Boys School, Kolkata. * Chater Garden * Chater House * Chater Road * Catchick Street * Peking Road was named Chater Street until 1909, when it was renamed to avoid confusion with Chater Road.

The Caste system The different branches of Christianity in India still engage in these societal practices with regards to the caste system, along with all its customs and norms, to varying degrees depending on the particular sect. Within the three major Christian branches in India, there were historically and are currently different levels of caste acceptance. The Roman Catholic Church is said to sometimes develop a more culturally consistent view, treating the caste system as part of the Indian social structure and, for much of its history in India; similarly the Syrian Orthodox Churches have sometimes responded in like fashion, except it has tended to collectively act as one caste within the caste system instead of maintaining different castes within their churches. Other major factors affecting dalit Christians and other Christians within India in regard to caste statutes are the regional variances in maintaining the caste system. Rural communities are said to hold more strongly to the caste system than the urban communities and Roman Catholics are the majority of Christians in these communities. The urban areas tend to have the least pressure to maintain caste classes and Protestant churches are aid to be best represented in this background. After conversion, people in India lose any privileges they had in their former caste, while those in lower castes often gain more opportunities.

Reservation Reservation is available to Dalits who follow Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism, but Dalit Christians and Muslims are not protected as castes under Indian Reservation policy.Should Dalit Christians get reservation? Rediff.com, February 11, 2005.Dalit Christians: SC or not? The Indian constitution in 1950 abolished untouchability, converting those castes to scheduled castes and tribes: in doing so it also provided a system of affirmative action (called the Reservation Policy) whereby 22.5 percent of all government and semi government jobs including seats in Parliament and state legislatures were reserved for those in those castes; the law also set aside space for admission to schools and colleges. In 1980 the constitutional policy was extended to cover the rest of the 3,743 backward castes in the country. But Christians who claim to belong to no caste are not included in the quotas, meaning those Dalits who convert to Christianity are no longer part of the affirmative action program run by the government. Dalit Christians have now appealed to the government to extend the benefits of reservation policy to Dalit Christians in order to improve their employment opportunities. In 2008, a study commissioned by the National Commission for Minorities suggested extension of reservation to Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians. According to the study, Indian Muslims and Christians should be brought under the ambit of the constitutional safeguards.‚ÄùSC status for Dalit Muslims, Dalit Christians favoured The Hindu, Apr 05, 2008.

The G. G. Allen Steam Station scrubber (North Carolina) Flue- gas desulfurization (FGD) is a set of technologies used to remove sulfur dioxide () from exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants, and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes such as waste incineration. Methods Since stringent environmental regulations limiting SO2 emissions have been enacted in many countries, is being removed from flue gases by a variety of methods. Common methods used: *Wet scrubbing using a slurry of alkaline sorbent, usually limestone or lime, or seawater to scrub gases; *Spray-dry scrubbing using similar sorbent slurries; *Wet sulfuric acid process recovering sulfur in the form of commercial quality sulfuric acid; *SNOX Flue gas desulfurization removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases; *Dry sorbent injection systems that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions.https://www.nol- tec.com/products/dry-sorbent-injection-dsi/ For a typical coal-fired power station, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) may remove 90 percent or more of the in the flue gases. History Methods of removing sulfur dioxide from boiler and furnace exhaust gases have been studied for over 150 years. Early ideas for flue gas desulfurization were established in England around 1850. With the construction of large-scale power plants in England in the 1920s, the problems associated with large volumes of from a single site began to concern the public. The emissions problem did not receive much attention until 1929, when the House of Lords upheld the claim of a landowner against the Barton Electricity Works of the Manchester Corporation for damages to his land resulting from emissions. Shortly thereafter, a press campaign was launched against the erection of power plants within the confines of London. This outcry led to the imposition of controls on all such power plants. The first major FGD unit at a utility was installed in 1931 at Battersea Power Station, owned by London Power Company. In 1935, an FGD system similar to that installed at Battersea went into service at Swansea Power Station. The third major FGD system was installed in 1938 at Fulham Power Station. These three early large-scale FGD installations were suspended during World War II, because the characteristic white vapour plumes would have aided location by enemy aircraft. The FGD plant at Battersea was recommissioned after the war and, together with FGD plant at the new Bankside B power station opposite the City of London, operated until the stations closed in 1983 and 1981 respectively. Large-scale FGD units did not reappear at utilities until the 1970s, where most of the installations occurred in the United States and Japan. In 1970, the U.S. Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA). The law authorized development of federal regulations in the United States covering emissions from both stationary (industrial) and mobile sources, which were subsequently published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1977, Congress amended the law to require more stringent controls on air emissions. In response to the CAA requirements, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) authorized the formation of the PTC 40 Standards Committee in 1978. This committee first convened in 1979 with the purpose of developing a standardized \\"procedure for conducting and reporting performance tests of FGD systems and reporting the results in terms of the following categories: (a) emissions reduction, (b) consumable and utilities, (c) waste and by-product characterization and amount.\\"ASME, 2017, \\"Flue Gas Desulfurization Units\\", ASME PTC 40-2017 The first code draft was approved by ASME in 1990 and adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1991. The PTC 40-1991 Standard was available for public use for those units affected by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In 2006, the PTC 40 Committee reconvened following EPA publication of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005. In 2017, the revised PTC 40 Standard was published. This revised standard (PTC 40-2017) covers Dry and Regenerable FGD systems and provides a more detailed Uncertainty Analysis section. This standard is currently in use today by companies around the world. As of June 1973, there were 42 FGD units in operation, 36 in Japan and 6 in the United States, ranging in capacity from 5 MW to 250 MW.Beychok, Milton R., Coping With SO2, Chemical Engineering/Deskbook Issue, 21 October 1974 As of around 1999 and 2000, FGD units were being used in 27 countries, and there were 678 FGD units operating at a total power plant capacity of about 229 gigawatts. About 45% of the FGD capacity was in the U.S., 24% in Germany, 11% in Japan, and 20% in various other countries. Approximately 79% of the units, representing about 199 gigawatts of capacity, were using lime or limestone wet scrubbing. About 18% (or 25 gigawatts) utilized spray-dry scrubbers or sorbent injection systems.Nolan, Paul S., Flue Gas Desulfurization Technologies for Coal-Fired Power Plants, The Babcock & Wilcox Company, U.S., presented by Michael X.

If a scrubber system is not functioning probably (and the IMO procedures for such malfunctions are not adhered to), port States can sanction the ship. The United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea also bestows port States with a right to regulate (and even ban) the use of open loop scrubber systems within ports and internal waters.Jesper Jarl Fan√∏ (2019). Enforcing International Maritime Legislation on Air Pollution through UNCLOS. Hart Publishing. Sulfuric acid mist formation Fossil fuels such as coal and oil can contain a significant amount of sulfur. When fossil fuels are burned, about 95 percent or more of the sulfur is generally converted to sulfur dioxide (). Such conversion happens under normal conditions of temperature and of oxygen present in the flue gas. However, there are circumstances under which such reaction may not occur. can further oxidize into sulfur trioxide () when excess oxygen is present and gas temperatures are sufficiently high. At about 800 ¬∞C, formation of is favored. Another way that can be formed is through catalysis by metals in the fuel. Such reaction is particularly true for heavy fuel oil, where a significant amount of vanadium is present. In whatever way is formed, it does not behave like in that it forms a liquid aerosol known as sulfuric acid () mist that is very difficult to remove. Generally, about 1% of the sulfur dioxide will be converted to . Sulfuric acid mist is often the cause of the blue haze that often appears as the flue gas plume dissipates. Increasingly, this problem is being addressed by the use of wet electrostatic precipitators.  FGD chemistry = Basic principles  Most FGD systems employ two stages: one for fly ash removal and the other for removal. Attempts have been made to remove both the fly ash and in one scrubbing vessel. However, these systems experienced severe maintenance problems and low removal efficiency. In wet scrubbing systems, the flue gas normally passes first through a fly ash removal device, either an electrostatic precipitator or a baghouse, and then into the -absorber. However, in dry injection or spray drying operations, the is first reacted with the lime, and then the flue gas passes through a particulate control device. Another important design consideration associated with wet FGD systems is that the flue gas exiting the absorber is saturated with water and still contains some . These gases are highly corrosive to any downstream equipment such as fans, ducts, and stacks. Two methods that may minimize corrosion are: (1) reheating the gases to above their dew point, or (2) using materials of construction and designs that allow equipment to withstand the corrosive conditions. Both alternatives are expensive. Engineers determine which method to use on a site-by-site basis.  Scrubbing with an alkali solid or solution  Schematic design of the absorber of an FGD is an acid gas, and, therefore, the typical sorbent slurries or other materials used to remove the from the flue gases are alkaline. The reaction taking place in wet scrubbing using a (limestone) slurry produces calcium sulfite () and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as: : + ‚Üí + When wet scrubbing with a Ca(OH)2 (hydrated lime) slurry, the reaction also produces CaSO3 (calcium sulfite) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as: :Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ SO2 ‚Üí CaSO3 \\\\+ H2O When wet scrubbing with a Mg(OH)2 (magnesium hydroxide) slurry, the reaction produces MgSO3 (magnesium sulfite) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as: :Mg(OH)2 \\\\+ SO2 ‚Üí MgSO3 \\\\+ H2O To partially offset the cost of the FGD installation, some designs, particularly dry sorbent injection systems, further oxidize the CaSO3 (calcium sulfite) to produce marketable CaSO4-2H2O (gypsum) that can be of high enough quality to use in wallboard and other products. The process by which this synthetic gypsum is created is also known as forced oxidation: :CaSO3 \\\\+ 2H2O + ¬ΩO2 ‚Üí CaSO4 ¬∑ 2H2O A natural alkaline usable to absorb SO2 is seawater. The is absorbed in the water, and when oxygen is added reacts to form sulfate ions SO4\\\\- and free H+. The surplus of H+ is offset by the carbonates in seawater pushing the carbonate equilibrium to release gas: :SO2 \\\\+ H2O + ¬ΩO2 ‚Üí SO42‚àí \\\\+ 2H+ :HCO3‚àí \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí H2O + CO2 In industry caustic (NaOH) is often used to scrub , producing sodium sulfite: :2NaOH + SO2 ‚Üí Na2SO3 \\\\+ H2O = Types of wet scrubbers used in FGD = To promote maximum gas‚Äìliquid surface area and residence time, a number of wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray towers, venturis, plate towers, and mobile packed beds. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow concurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently with respect to the liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent removal than other absorber designs. FGD scrubbers produce a scaling wastewater that requires treatment to meet U.S. federal discharge regulations. However, technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high- efficiency treatment of FGD wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters. Venturi-rod scrubbers A venturi scrubber is a converging/diverging section of duct. The converging section accelerates the gas stream to high velocity. When the liquid stream is injected at the throat, which is the point of maximum velocity, the turbulence caused by the high gas velocity atomizes the liquid into small droplets, which creates the surface area necessary for mass transfer to take place. The higher the pressure drop in the venturi, the smaller the droplets and the higher the surface area. The penalty is in power consumption. For simultaneous removal of and fly ash, venturi scrubbers can be used. In fact, many of the industrial sodium-based throwaway systems are venturi scrubbers originally designed to remove particulate matter. These units were slightly modified to inject a sodium- based scrubbing liquor. Although removal of both particles and in one vessel can be economic, the problems of high pressure drops and finding a scrubbing medium to remove heavy loadings of fly ash must be considered. However, in cases where the particle concentration is low, such as from oil-fired units, it can be more effective to remove particulate and simultaneously. Packed bed scrubbers A packed scrubber consists of a tower with packing material inside. This packing material can be in the shape of saddles, rings, or some highly specialized shapes designed to maximize the contact area between the dirty gas and liquid. Packed towers typically operate at much lower pressure drops than venturi scrubbers and are therefore cheaper to operate. They also typically offer higher removal efficiency. The drawback is that they have a greater tendency to plug up if particles are present in excess in the exhaust air stream. Spray towers A spray tower is the simplest type of scrubber. It consists of a tower with spray nozzles, which generate the droplets for surface contact. Spray towers are typically used when circulating a slurry (see below). The high speed of a venturi would cause erosion problems, while a packed tower would plug up if it tried to circulate a slurry. Counter-current packed towers are infrequently used because they have a tendency to become plugged by collected particles or to scale when lime or limestone scrubbing slurries are used. = Scrubbing reagent = As explained above, alkaline sorbents are used for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO2. Depending on the application, the two most important are lime and sodium hydroxide (also known as caustic soda). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda. The problem is that it results in a slurry being circulated through the scrubber instead of a solution. This makes it harder on the equipment. A spray tower is typically used for this application. The use of lime results in a slurry of calcium sulfite (CaSO3) that must be disposed of. Fortunately, calcium sulfite can be oxidized to produce by-product gypsum (CaSO4 ¬∑ 2H2O) which is marketable for use in the building products industry. Caustic soda is limited to smaller combustion units because it is more expensive than lime, but it has the advantage that it forms a solution rather than a slurry. This makes it easier to operate. It produces a \\"spent caustic\\" solution of sodium sulfite/bisulfite (depending on the pH), or sodium sulfate that must be disposed of. This is not a problem in a kraft pulp mill for example, where this can be a source of makeup chemicals to the recovery cycle.  Scrubbing with sodium sulfite solution  It is possible to scrub sulfur dioxide by using a cold solution of sodium sulfite; this forms a sodium hydrogen sulfite solution. By heating this solution it is possible to reverse the reaction to form sulfur dioxide and the sodium sulfite solution. Since the sodium sulfite solution is not consumed, it is called a regenerative treatment. The application of this reaction is also known as the Wellman‚ÄìLord process. In some ways this can be thought of as being similar to the reversible liquid‚Äìliquid extraction of an inert gas such as xenon or radon (or some other solute which does not undergo a chemical change during the extraction) from water to another phase. While a chemical change does occur during the extraction of the sulfur dioxide from the gas mixture, it is the case that the extraction equilibrium is shifted by changing the temperature rather than by the use of a chemical reagent.  Gas phase oxidation followed by reaction with ammonia  A new, emerging flue gas desulfurization technology has been described by the IAEA.IAEA Factsheet about pilot plant in Poland. It is a radiation technology where an intense beam of electrons is fired into the flue gas at the same time as ammonia is added to the gas. The Chendu power plant in China started up such a flue gas desulfurization unit on a 100 MW scale in 1998. The Pomorzany power plant in Poland also started up a similar sized unit in 2003 and that plant removes both sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Both plants are reported to be operating successfully.Section of IAEA 2003 Annual Report However, the accelerator design principles and manufacturing quality need further improvement for continuous operation in industrial conditions. No radioactivity is required or created in the process. The electron beam is generated by a device similar to the electron gun in a TV set. This device is called an accelerator. This is an example of a radiation chemistry process where the physical effects of radiation are used to process a substance. The action of the electron beam is to promote the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur(VI) compounds. The ammonia reacts with the sulfur compounds thus formed to produce ammonium sulfate, which can be used as a nitrogenous fertilizer. In addition, it can be used to lower the nitrogen oxide content of the flue gas. This method has attained industrial plant scale.Industrial Plant for Flue Gas Treatment with High Power Electron Accelerator by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland. Facts and statistics :The information in this section was obtained from a US EPA published fact sheet. Flue gas desulfurization scrubbers have been applied to combustion units firing coal and oil that range in size from 5 MW to 1500 MW. Scottish Power are spending ¬£400 million installing FGD at Longannet power station, which has a capacity of over 2 GW. Dry scrubbers and spray scrubbers have generally been applied to units smaller than 300 MW. FGD has been fitted by RWE npower at Aberthaw Power Station in south Wales using the seawater process and works successfully on the 1580MW plant. Approximately 85% of the flue gas desulfurization units installed in the US are wet scrubbers, 12% are spray dry systems, and 3% are dry injection systems. The highest removal efficiencies (greater than 90%) are achieved by wet scrubbers and the lowest (less than 80%) by dry scrubbers. However, the newer designs for dry scrubbers are capable of achieving efficiencies in the order of 90%. In spray drying and dry injection systems, the flue gas must first be cooled to about 10‚Äì20 ¬∞C above adiabatic saturation to avoid wet solids deposition on downstream equipment and plugging of baghouses. The capital, operating and maintenance costs per short ton of removed (in 2001 US dollars) are: *For wet scrubbers larger than 400 MW, the cost is $200 to $500 per ton *For wet scrubbers smaller than 400 MW, the cost is $500 to $5,000 per ton *For spray dry scrubbers larger than 200 MW, the cost is $150 to $300 per ton *For spray dry scrubbers smaller than 200 MW, the cost is $500 to $4,000 per ton  Alternative methods of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions An alternative to removing sulfur from the flue gases after burning is to remove the sulfur from the fuel before or during combustion. Hydrodesulfurization of fuel has been used for treating fuel oils before use. Fluidized bed combustion adds lime to the fuel during combustion. The lime reacts with the SO2 to form sulfates which become part of the ash. This elemental sulfur is then separated and finally recovered at the end of the process for further usage in, for example, agricultural products. Safety is one of the greatest benefits of this method, as the whole process takes place at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. This method has been developed by Paqell, a joint venture between Shell Global Solutions and Paques.

He also endowed the Cobbett Medal for services to chamber music. Walter Cobbett was born in 1847 in Blackheath, England. He became an active supporter of music, and commissioned numerous works of chamber music from emerging and leading British composers of his time, including chamber works by Benjamin Britten, Frank Bridge, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax, and Eugene Goossens. His two-volume encyclopedia of chamber music, published in 1929, is still considered the most comprehensive work on the subject today. His insightful, wry and occasionally caustic style makes for enlightening and delightful reading. An innovative industrialist and astute businessman, Cobbett was cofounder of Scandinavia Belting Ltd (today BBA Aviation Ltd.), which manufactured a new type of woven belting for machinery. But Cobbett's heart was in music. \\"It has been humorously remarked that he has given to commerce what time he could spare from music,\\" said an article in a contemporary edition of Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians.\\"Cobbett, Walter Willson\\" in Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians (London: Macmillan Company, 1927) Cobbett played weekly in an amateur string quartet, was concertmaster of a number of amateur orchestras, and was a prolific writer and publicist for chamber music. In 1905, Cobbett endowed a competition, under the auspices of the Worshipful Company of Musicians, for chamber music composers. The Cobbett Competition was instrumental in advancing the careers of leading composers of the time. In this first competition Frank Bridge won a Special Prize of ¬£10 for his Phantasie String Quartet; to clarify past inaccuracies published widely about the names of the other winners of this competition, the following information is taken from the Court Minute Books of the Worshipful Company. First: William Hurlstone (¬£50 prize). Second: Haydn Wood (¬£10). Special Prize: Frank Bridge (¬£10). Three Extra Prizes: James Friskin, Harry Waldo Warner and Josef Holbrooke (¬£5.5.00) each. Other winners in later years included Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams. In addition to granting prizes, Cobbett commissioned works from these and other composers. Cobbett established other prizes as well. In 1920 he started granting annual prizes for chamber music performance for students of the Royal Academy of Music. The Cobbett Medal for services to chamber music was established in 1924 - the first recipient was Thomas Dunhill - and continues to be awarded annually by the Worshipful Company of Musicians. He also encouraged British luthiers by granting prizes for outstanding instruments. Cobbett started a periodical on Chamber music, called the Chamber Music Supplement. He established a free library of chamber music and started chamber music concert series in working-class neighborhoods of British cities. Cobbett playing with his amateur ensemble. Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music was the result of four years of labor. In addition to Cobbett's own extensive contributions, the two-volume survey includes articles by leading musicians and musicologists of the time, including Vincent d'Indy, Donald Tovey, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Cobbett wrote of his own devotion to chamber music that \\"there opened out before me an enchanted world... I became a humble devotee of this infinitely beautiful art, and so began for me the chamber music life.\\"\\"Chamber Music Life\\" in Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music (London: Oxford University Press, 1929).

He is an unusual example of an \\"outsider\\" artist who had considerable formal training in drawing. Born in Point Reyes, California, Rizzoli lived in San Francisco, where he was employed as an architectural draftsman. In the 1930s he showed his work in exhibits held in his home, which he called the Achilles Tectonic Exhibit Portfolio (A.T.E.P.) After his death, a group of elaborate drawings came to light, many in the form of maps and architectural renderings that described an imaginary world exposition (much of which was designated \\"Y.T.T.E.\\", for \\"Yield To Total Elation\\"). The drawings include \\"portraits\\" of his mother (whom he lived with until her death in 1937) and neighborhood children \\"symbolically sketched\\" in the form of fanciful neo-baroque buildings. Rizzoli published one novel, The Colonnade (1931), under the pseudonym Peter Metermaid. A film was made about his life and work, called Yield to Total Elation: The Life and Art of Achilles Rizzoli.

She was named for the Alamo, site of the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. Alamo was laid down on 11 October 1954 at Pascagoula, Miss., by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 20 January 1956; sponsored by Mrs. Daniel V. Gallery, the wife of Rear Admiral Daniel V. Gallery: and commissioned on 24 August 1956, Capt. James L. Semmes in command.  1956‚Äì1960  After commissioning, the ship briefly visited Galveston, Tex. then headed for NS Norfolk, Va., to complete her outfitting and initial loading. On 13 October, the dock landing ship sailed for the West Coast. After transiting the Panama Canal, she reached NS San Diego, Calif., her home port, and joined the Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet. The ship held amphibious exercises and acceptance trials off San Diego in February 1957. Further training exercises occupied her until 29 May, when she got underway for the Marshall Islands. Alamo paused at Pearl Harbor from 6 to 8 June to load amphibious craft, then continued on to the Marshall Islands. She discharged the craft at Eniwetok on 14 June and for the next 10 days, provided shuttle service between Eniwetok and Bikini Atolls. Alamo put to sea from Bikini on 22 June and steamed by way of Pearl Harbor to San Diego where she loaded landing craft, tugs, and spare parts before sailing for Pearl Harbor on 23 July. There, on 6 August, she embarked Marines and their equipment and put to sea for participation in \\"Operation Tradewind\\", conducted in the area of Lahaina Roads, Maui. Alamo returned from this exercise on 15 August; then left Pearl Harbor four days later to return to San Diego. On 24 September, Alamo began a voyage to the western Pacific (WestPac). She repeated her pattern of loading equipment at Pearl Harbor for transport to Eniwetok. Alamo then shuttled equipment between Eniwetok, Utirik, Kwajalein, and Ujelang Atolls. A voyage to Yokohama, Japan, where she arrived on 17 November, interrupted that duty. Alamo cleared that port on 21 November to resume her shuttling service in the Marshalls before returning to San Diego on 15 December. The beginning of 1958 brought more training and upkeep. On 8 March, Alamo headed for Pearl Harbor where she joined a fast transport group for a series of amphibious force landing and salvage exercises at Kauai. The ship departed Pearl Harbor on 7 April and reached San Diego on 14 April. Ten days later, she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for an overhaul and returned to her home port on 31 July to begin two and one-half months of refresher training. On 10 October, Alamo sailed for Japan. After loading landing craft at Yokosuka, Alamo headed to Kaohsiung, Taiwan. At that port, the ship conducted amphibious training with units of the Nationalist Chinese Navy until 2 December 1958. She then steamed for independent ship exercises off Okinawa and stopped at Naha to load the men and equipment of Marine Transport Squadron 163 for transportation to Yokosuka. For the next two months, Alamo shuttled various Marine Corps units between Yokosuka and Okinawa, terminating her last voyage of this duty at Naha on 11 February 1959. Three days later she pushed on to Sasebo, Japan, but again got underway for home on 23 February and paid visits to Adak and Kodiak, Alaska, and San Francisco, Calif., before reaching San Diego on 12 March. Following a round-trip run to Astoria, Oreg., ‚Äî from 17 to 25 April ‚Äì to deliver a load of small craft, she took part in exercises with other units of Amphibious Squadron 3 off Coronado, followed by \\"Operation Twin Peaks\\", held off the California coast from 18 May to 5 June. Late in September, Alamo sailed for the Far East. The ship visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Yokosuka, Iwakuni, Kagoshima, and Shimazu, Japan, Naha, Okinawa, Hong Kong, Subic Bay in the Philippines, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa. After touching at Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Diego on 3 May 1960. From 25 July to 1 November, the ship was overhauled at the Todd Shipyard, Seattle, Wash.; and, from 14 November to 9 December, she went through refresher training.  1961‚Äì1964  The ship began 1961 with amphibious refresher training at San Diego and devoted most of the first half of the year to training and gunnery exercises, Naval Reserve training cruises and \\"Operation Greenlight Phase III\\". On 17 June, she got underway for another WestPac deployment. Upon her arrival at Subic Bay, Alamo joined the 7th Fleet's Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and shuttled Marine Corps units to Buckner Bay. She took part in \\"Operation Warm-Up\\" off the northwest coast of Okinawa from 13 to 20 October. A visit to Hong Kong followed before the ship returned to Subic Bay and began preparations for her voyage back to the United States. She got underway early in December and arrived at NS San Diego on 16 December. Alamo remained there until 6 March 1962, when she got underway for San Francisco and the Todd Shipyard for her first interim overhaul. Six weeks later, she returned to San Diego. Local operations occupied her until 16 October when she got underway for the Far East with Amphibious Squadron 3. En route, several ships of the squadron were diverted to the Caribbean in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Alamo was held in Hawaii on a standby basis. On 17 November, she sailed for typhoon-stricken Guam with emergency supplies. After a two-day stop in Guam to unload supplies, the vessel proceeded to Subic Bay. Local operations off San Miguel were held before the ship sailed to Hong Kong for the Christmas holidays. The ship visited Manila during the New Year's holiday in 1963 then returned to Subic Bay. In January, she took part in Operation Jungle Drum II in Thailand and then spent two days in Bangkok. Her next assignment took her to the flood-stricken island of Mindanao in the Philippines. The month of March was taken up by Operation Silver Blade off Taiwan. After three weeks of restricted availability at Subic Bay, Alamo sailed on 20 April for Yokosuka. The ship finally reached San Diego on 11 May. Following a period of upkeep and training, she got underway for four weeks of operations in the Pacific Northwest with units of Amphibious Squadron 7 and Army Reserve units. Visits to Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, preceded her return to San Diego on 6 September. In mid-September, the ship entered the Bethlehem Steel Co. shipyard, Long Beach, California, to begin an overhaul which was completed barely in time for her to get back home for the Christmas holidays. A period of upkeep and refresher training kept the crew busy through March 1964. In April, Alamo proceeded north to assist the earthquake-stricken region around Kodiak, Alaska. She returned to San Diego in May and took part in Operation Pine Tree. Then, after several weeks of preparations, Alamo departed San Diego on 18 June, bound for the Far East. Upon reaching Pearl Harbor, she was involved in Operation Tool Box and had a period of leave and upkeep before sailing for Okinawa on 9 July. Alamo returned to Subic Bay on the last day of July. On 5 August, she sailed with Marine Corps Battalion Landing Team 3/1 (BLT 3/1) embarked for patrol duties off the coast of South Vietnam and, through most of the autumn, alternated periods of leave and upkeep at Hong Kong and Subic Bay with Vietnamese patrol duty through 2 December. The ship arrived back in San Diego on 18 December 1964.  1965‚Äì1969  Participation in Operation Silver Lance off the coast of southern California lasted from 23 February through 10 March 1965. On 11 March, Alamo was called upon to make an unscheduled run to Yokosuka carrying men and equipment for the American military buildup in the Far East as the United States was beginning direct participation in operations in Vietnam. She returned to San Diego on 12 April. The ship made a second unscheduled deployment to WestPac on 25 May. She sailed to Okinawa, onloaded Marines, then landed them at Qui Nhon and Danang, Vietnam. Alamo touched briefly at Yokosuka, then headed back to San Diego. She took part in Operations Cleansweep and Ragweed during September, devoted most of the autumn to training exercises, and ended the year in port at NS San Diego. In February 1966, the ship began her seventh major deployment to Westpac. Alamo spent six months operating as a part of an amphibious ready group (ARG) and shuttled troops and equipment from Subic Bay and Okinawa to various points in Vietnam. She returned to the United States in August. In September, her home port was switched to Naval Station Long Beach, California, and she was assigned to the newly formed Amphibious Squadron 7. In early 1967, she entered drydock at the Todd Shipyard in San Pedro, California, for her third major overhaul which, with the ensuing series of refresher training exercises, accounted for most of the year. In November, the ship sailed for the Far East. There, Alamo was engaged in a series of lifts from Guam and the Philippines to Da Nang. She also again became a member of an ARG and operated along the Vietnamese coast for much of her tour. The ship also participated in four amphibious operations before returning to Long Beach in June 1968. The ship engaged in local operations along the West Coast for the rest of 1968. On 30 January 1969, she began another WestPac deployment in which she lifted troops and equipment to Da Nang and then proceeded to Subic Bay where she joined ARG \\"Bravo.\\" The ship also took part in three amphibious operations off the coast of South Vietnam. After eight months away from home Alamo returned to Long Beach on 26 September 1969. The ship then engaged in a series of training exercises and operations for the remainder of the year.  1970‚Äì1974  Alamo opened 1970 at San Pedro, California, undergoing a restricted availability during which repairs were made to damaged deck plating, cranes, and a boiler. Work was completed on 19 January, and the ship made final preparations for more service in Oriental waters. On 31 January, she sailed with to participate in Operation Keystone Bluejay, which involved the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. Alamo sailed into Danang harbor on 19 February and began loading Marines and equipment for transportation back to the United States. Alamo debarked the Marines at Camp Pendleton, California, on 14 March and then steamed north to Long Beach. She spent the next four and one-half months in training exercises, refresher training, and availability. On 1 August, Alamo headed out to sea on her 10th WestPac deployment. She stopped at Pearl Harbor and Guam before reaching Subic Bay on 20 August. There, she unloaded her cargo and sailed on 21 August for Danang to bring more Marines back to the United States. Alamo reached Camp Pendleton on 11 September. After 10 days of leave and upkeep she got underway for Danang. Alamo also visited Yokosuka Tokyo, and Subic Bay. She transported landing craft along the Vietnamese coast between such points as Danang, Vung Tau, Song Bo De and An Thoi. In early December, the ship took on board BLT 2/4 for participation in Exercise GRR-1 in Subic Bay. Upon finishing that exercise, she sailed to Hong Kong for Christmas. On 28 December 1970, she returned to the Danang operating area. The vessel steamed to Mindoro, Philippines, on 5 January 1971 for amphibious operations and moved on to Subic Bay on 10 January to onload equipment to ship to Vietnam. After briefly touching back at Subic Bay, Alamo left Danang to onload Marines and vehicles as part of the general American troop withdrawal. On 1 February, she got underway to return to NS Long Beach and reached home port on 22 February. A leave and upkeep period ensued. Operations resumed on 5 April as Alamo sailed for southern California waters to hold a midshipman training cruise and amphibious exercises. In early May, Alamo unloaded her ammunition at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station in preparation for an overhaul at NS Long Beach. The ship entered drydock on 13 May. Yard work was completed on 15 September, and then began a period of refresher training which lasted through 10 December. The year 1972 began with the ship in upkeep. Then a series of training exercises in preparation for deployment followed. Prior to her departure, the crew adopted an Irish Setter puppy as the ship's mascot---Lady. In April, Alamo left Long Beach for the Far East. In company with the Amphibious Readiness Group arrived at the beginning of the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive. During her seven and one-half-month WestPac tour, she made numerous troop and equipment lifts to and from Vietnam. During this tour, the ship was attached to Amphibious Squadron 7. Alamo participated in the Second Battle of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, involving the sea and air landing of Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps troops near Quang Tri City in June 1972. She was the Primary Control Ship for an amphibious feint with LVTs and Army of the Republic of Vietnam forces to draw off pressure to the south. Alamo also was a primary control ship for the rescue efforts for flooding victims in Dagupan, Lingyan Gulf, Philippines in July 1972. A Marine CH-53 crashed in the town as it flaired for a landing. The pilot had not accounted for the extra weight of its armor. The assigned ACU-1 LCMS-8s brought out the demolished aircraft. The ship was awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. Following an offload of Marines in Okinawa she maneuvered south to evade Super Typhoon Rita. In a very unusual and unexpected move, Rita looped around Okinawa and caught her and in high sea and winds. She ballasted down and endured heavy seas with blue water cresting over her bridge. It was also during this deployment that a steering gear failure caused her to collided (port-side to) with an oiler during underway replenishment. Alamo's commanding officer exhibited exemplary seamanship as the ships were entangled in the refueling gear. Following completion of these duties, she got underway and returned to Long Beach on 8 November. Upon arrival the ship's 1MC broadcast the Lone Ranger theme to the delight of the dependents awaiting her return. The ship remained in upkeep through 27 March 1973. On 28 March, she moved to the Weapons Depot at Seal Beach to unload ammunition. She entered the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard at San Pedro, California on 5 April for a restricted availability. This period ended on 15 May, when Alamo held sea trials along the California coast. She commenced an availability at San Diego on 28 May to convert the fuel system from Navy standard fuel oil to distillate fuel. This work was completed on 14 September, and the ship sailed to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on 16 September to begin a week of training. She returned to Long Beach on 24 September. Alamo held amphibious refresher training off Coronado, California, through 12 November, and remained at Long Beach through the end of the year. The first three weeks of 1974 were spent making final preparations for another WestPac deployment which began on 19 January. Eight days later, Alamo took part in a Marine Corps landing exercise off Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. She reached Okinawa on Valentine's Day. After refueling and onloading Battalion Landing Team 2/9 (BLT 2/9) she sailed to Numazu, Japan, unloaded the Marines, and pushed on to Yokosuka for a fortnight's restricted availability. Next came port calls at Beppu, Japan, and at Keelung, Taiwan. Alamos ensuing assignment was an amphibious training exercise off Okinawa which, in turn, was followed by stops at Subic Bay; Chinhae, South Korea; Hong Kong; and Numazu and Yokosuka, Japan. On 30 May, the ship got underway to participate in Exercise Kangaroo I. The assault force gathered in the Coral Sea off the east coast of Australia. On 19 June, she headed for Sydney for a leave period. On 4 July, the ship weighed anchor and sailed home, via Pago Pago, American Samoa, and arrived back at San Diego on 19 July. However her commanding officer was relieved of command in Pearl Harbor following an investigation of unrest exhibited prior to the Australia visit. Local operations, which began for the ship on 23 September, were soon followed by preparations for an overhaul which began at San Diego on 4 December 1974.  1975‚Äì1979  Alamo got underway for Long Beach on 27 May 1975 and spent the month of June at her home port in restricted availability. On 2 July, Alamo sailed to Seal Beach to take on ammunition and, on 14 July, began amphibious refresher training off San Diego. She sailed on 4 October for another WestPac cruise. Following her arrival at Pearl Harbor, she took part in an amphibious exercise held in Kaneohe Bay from 12 to 14 October. The next day, the ship continued her journey, bound via Kwajalein for Subic Bay. After a brief stop there on 1 November, Alamo sailed to Sasebo for upkeep. She next transported BLT 2/9 from Numazu to Okinawa, then made a trip to Pusan, South Korea. Her other subsequent ports of call included Sasebo and Kagoshima, Japan; Keelung, Taiwan; Buckner Bay, Okinawa, Singapore; Sattahip, Thailand; and Inchon, Korea. On 7 May, Alamo finally set course for the United States. She reached her new home port of NS San Diego on 25 May and, following upkeep, devoted herself to local operations along the California coast for the rest of 1976. The year 1977 began with three months of refresher training for the ship. On 29 March, she once again set off for the Far East. During this trip, Alamo visited the now-familiar ports of Iwakuni and Numazu, Japan, Subic Bay, Buckner Bay, Inchon and Pusan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Keelung, Taiwan. She also participated in joint exercises with Korean and Thai naval forces and made numerous troop and supply shuttles before getting underway for home on 23 October. On 17 November, Alamo arrived at San Diego and entered a post- deployment standdown period. On 19 January 1978, Alamo began a fortnight's operations off the southern California coast and then turned to preparations for an overhaul. On 13 March, Alamo entered the Todd Shipyard in San Pedro. She held sea trials in December and was in port at Long Beach for the Christmas holidays. She returned to San Diego on 11 January 1979. The vessel sailed to Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach on 22 January to load ammunition and then began a series of training exercises. In June, the ship was assigned to resupply duty and provided small boat repair service at the naval outpost on Eniwetok. The group was involved in a cleanup operation to make the island habitable once again. After finishing her work on 28 June, she got underway for Pearl Harbor. At the end of a short stay there, she resumed her voyage and sailed into San Diego harbor on 15 July. She spent the month of August in restricted availability. In September, Alamo took part in a fleet exercise involving over 30 American and Canadian warships that included an amphibious landing on Vancouver Island, just off the Canadian coast. On 9 October, Alamo sailed to Seattle, where she underwent repair work for three weeks. She returned to San Diego on 2 November. The ship spent the remainder of the year preparing for a scheduled WestPac deployment in early 1980.  1980‚Äì1984  Alamo embarked upon the voyage to the Far East on 4 January 1980. En route, she made stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam before arriving at Subic Bay on 10 February. The dock landing ship stayed in the Philippines through the end of the month, getting underway once between 22 and 26 February to carry out an amphibious landing exercise at Zambales. On 1 March, she departed Subic Bay bound ultimately for duty in the Indian Ocean. Along the way, Alamo stopped at Pattaya, Thailand, and at Singapore. She departed Singapore on 15 March and made her way across the Indian Ocean to the Arabian Sea where she joined the contingency force established in response to the takeover of the American embassy in Tehran, Iran. Alamo operated in that area until the beginning of May. At that time the dock landing ship headed for the Navy facility at Diego Garcia Island. After stopping at Diego Garcia from 5 May to 13 May, she returned to sea and shaped a course for Western Australia. Following a five- day visit to Perth, the ship departed Australia on her way back to the Philippines. Alamo paid a five-day visit to Subic Bay as well and then began the voyage back to the United States. The dock landing ship stopped off at Pearl Harbor between 24 and 26 June to disembark Marines and arrived in San Diego on 3 July. Post-deployment standdown occupied her time from then until 11 August when she began normal operations along the West Coast. She remained so engaged through the end of 1980 and for the bulk of the first six months of 1981. On 24 June Alamo stood out of San Diego for another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Once again, however, her western Pacific assignment included an Indian Ocean interlude. After a stop at Pearl Harbor and an exercise out of Buckner Bay, Okinawa, she visited Subic Bay for a fortnight in August. On 21 August, Alamo left the Philippines for the east coast of Africa and arrived in Mombasa, Kenya, on 6 September. There, she participated in a bilateral exercise with Kenyan forces before heading back across the Indian Ocean via Diego Garcia to Australia. After visits to Perth and Sydney and the multilateral exercise Exercise Kangaroo 81, the dock landing ship set course for the Philippines on 1 November. She pulled into Subic Bay on 9 November and remained there for the rest of the month. On 30 November, the ship got underway for the United States. Alamo reentered San Diego again on 23 December and ended the year with the usual leave and upkeep routine. The relative inactivity following a deployment continued through the end of January 1982. In February, the dock landing ship carried out some operations at sea, but, late in the month, began preparations for regular overhaul. The extended repair period began on 12 April, lasted through the end of 1982, and carried over well into 1983. Overhaul ended on 6 May 1983, and Alamo commenced refresher training in the Southern California Operating Area. Late in June, however, damage to her propulsion plant interrupted her training evolutions and caused her to spend the summer tied up to a pier for repairs. Late in September, Alamo resumed operations at sea. Service along the West Coast, interrupted sporadically by repair problems, continued through the end of the year and into 1984. In February, she began concentrating her efforts on readiness exercises, trials, and examinations specifically geared to preparing the amphibious warship for her scheduled deployment to the Far East. On 30 May 1984, Alamo embarked upon the voyage to the western Pacific. On the first leg of the crossing she participated in multinational defense exercises with units of the navies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand as well as with elements of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. For the most part, those exercises were conducted in the Hawaiian Islands. On 3 July, Alamo concluded her visit to Hawaii and resumed the voyage to the Orient. En route, further troubles surfaced in the boilers of her main propulsion plant so that, upon her arrival in Subic Bay on 20 July, she commenced another round of repairs. The dock landing ship carried out post-repair trials during the last week in August and finally departed Subic Bay on 24 August. Alamo reached Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 27 August and began embarking Marines for transportation to Japan. Between 28 August and 16 September, the amphibious warship made two round-trip voyages between Okinawa and Japan carrying Marines to and from training exercises. On 18 September, she stood out of Buckner Bay on her way to Inchon, South Korea. During the period 18 September to 13 October, she made three round-trip voyages between Okinawa and South Korean ports. Upon her return to Okinawa from the third of those assignments, a problem with her stern gate was due to a maneuver consisting of a 90-degree turn with the rear gate down in the water at 15 knots. The force ripped one of the hinges and a hydraulic rod thrust out the back side end causing her to be tied up with repairs until 2 November. At that time she headed back to Korea to participate in the bilateral exercise \\"Operation Valiant Blitz 85-1\\" in cooperation with elements of the South Korean Navy and Marine Corps. Following stops at Buckner Bay and Sasebo, Japan, Alamo began the voyage back to the United States at the end of the third week in November. The dock landing ship made the usual call at Pearl Harbor and then reentered San Diego on 6 December.  1985‚Äì1990  Post- deployment standdown and holiday routine occupied her time for the rest of 1984 and during the first two weeks of January 1985. Alamo resumed local operations out of her home port late in January. The amphibious warship spent the whole of 1985 conducting exercises, trials, examinations, and inspections either in port in San Diego or in waters adjacent to the west coast. The only break in that schedule came in October when she made a round-trip voyage from the west coast to Hawaii and back for refresher training. At the beginning of 1986, preparations for her upcoming tour of duty with the 7th Fleet occupied the energies of Alamos crew. She embarked upon the voyage west on 16 January 1986 and made no stops along the way. The danger of violence during elections in the Philippines even prompted the cancellation of planned exercises at Iwo Jima in order that Alamo and other Navy ships be on station near Manila to render assistance to United States citizens in that eventuality. The threat never really materialized, and she entered Subic Bay on 9 February. Ten days later, the dock landing ship set sail for Hong Kong where she spent the five days from 21 to 26 February. Returning to Subic Bay briefly at the end of the month, Alamo then headed for Okinawa on 2 March. At Okinawa, she embarked troops for a major bilateral amphibious exercise conducted on the South Korean coast. Alamo returned to Okinawa on 1 April but stayed only until 4 April when she got underway for Japan. Following a nine-day call at Sasebo, the dock landing ship returned to Subic Bay on 20 April. From there, she voyaged to Singapore by way of the Indonesian island of Bali. Back in the Philippines by mid-May, Alamo carried out exercises there for the remainder of the month. On 10 June, she headed back to Okinawa. Alamo arrived at her destination on 13 June and spent the next 10 days conducting amphibious exercises at Okinawa. On 23 June, the dock landing ship put to sea for the passage home. After brief pauses at Iwo Jima and Pearl Harbor, the amphibious warship dropped anchor at Del Mar, California, on 15 July. She moved to San Diego on 16 July and commenced postdeployment standdown. The leave and upkeep period ended during the second week in August, and Alamo started another schedule of amphibious warfare training in waters along the west coast. Those evolutions lasted until 14 October at which time she began a restricted availability at pierside in San Diego. She remained there through the end of 1986.

History Jackson was named after Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States. Jackson was founded in 1961 in Jackson, Michigan, and moved to its headquarters in Lansing, Michigan in 1976. In the early years, the company focused on offering term insurance to individuals as an alternative to whole life products. Jackson was an early adopter of the independent distribution model, eliminating its captive agency sales force in 1970 to sell products through independent agents. By 1984, Jackson had grown to $1 billion in assets. The company's growth attracted the attention of Prudential plc, which acquired Jackson in 1986. In 1995, the company launched its first variable annuity and began selling guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements through its Institutional Products Department. In 1996, Jackson introduced its first fixed index annuity (FIA).

History In December 1870 a report was published regarding the discovery of mineral springs on \\"Clifton\\", the property of Thomas Bates (Jnr). The medicinal value of the waters was submitted to rigid chemical examination, and summarised as containing magnesia, seltzer, sulphur, soda and iron. In about 1871, Bates leased the land adjacent to the Springs to Mr. Levien, a large landholder at nearby Murradoc, who created a pleasure ground, and Clifton Springs boomed. A pier was built, along with salt water and sulphur baths. Steamers ran excursions from Geelong and other places, and regular coach services were provided by Cobb & Co. from nearby Portarlington and Drysdale. Other buildings, including a boiler house, mineral water bottling plant, kiosk, and manager's cottage were built in the vicinity of what became known as \\"Fairy Dell\\". A well- appointed hotel was constructed above the Springs. It was destroyed by fire in 1921, and a second one was built in 1926, which was remodelled as the Clifton Springs Country Club in about 1957, as part of a real estate development, and became the Clifton Springs Community Centre in 1977 when the building was purchased by the then Shire of Bellarine. A Clifton Springs Post Office was open from 1902 until 1921, and from 1927 until 1932. Fairy Dell Post Office opened on 1 July 1916 and closed in 1971. The springs area, located around Fairy Dell, was closed due to possible landslides, but was re-opened in 2007 after extensive work to repair the area. The former Mineral Springs site on Spring Street is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\\"Former Mineral Springs, Clifton Springs (H2088)\\". Victorian Heritage Register. Heritage Victoria. Retrieved 2014-03-26. Town overview Clifton Springs, often grouped with its neighbouring town, Drysdale, overlooks Corio Bay, the You Yangs and Geelong. This combined urban area had an estimated population of 13,494 Estimated resident population, 30 June 2016. at June 2016. The area has undergone significant changes over the past decade, with new housing developments on the north side of the town. In the early 1960s, as part of a large real estate development in Clifton Springs, which they dubbed \\"Clifton Springs and Country Club Estate\\", real estate agents Willmore and Randell erected a striking entrance structure in Bayshore Avenue. The structure included a fountain, which eventually passed to the control of the Greater Geelong Council. The fountain has degraded over time, and in late 2006 it was emptied until further notice, due to water restrictions. In 2013 a Clifton Springs fountain working group reported that locals wanted something done about the fountain's gradual deterioration. They felt it has been neglected for too long and were concerned that it was becoming an eyesore. A public meeting on 12 March expressed general support for renovating the structure, using an enclosed, non-evaporative system which would use much less water. The renovation should include symbols of the area‚Äôs past and possible futures, linking the fountain with some of the public art at The Dell, and evoking the time when mineral water was exported from Clifton Springs. Local councillor Lindsay Ellis told the working group that a report on the fountain's condition, with an estimate of the cost of refurbishing it, was due from council officers on 23 April, and that Geelong Council would consider the fountain's future as part of the process of formulating the council's 2013/14 budget.

She was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1994 who represented the downtown Toronto riding of St. Andrew‚ÄîSt. Patrick. She served as a cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae. She was the first woman from the African Diaspora elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and the first woman from the African Diaspora to serve as a cabinet minister in Canada. A daughter of immigrants from the Caribbean, she became a teacher and school principal in the Toronto public school system. After her election in 1990, she was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Community and Social Services but resigned because her private financial arrangements appeared to violate cabinet guidelines. A subsequent review cleared her of any wrongdoing. In 1992, she was named parliamentary assistant to Premier Bob Rae. In 1994 she quit politics after a dispute over the handling of an investigation and firing of Ontario civil servant Carlton Masters. As of 2009, Akande is retired but continues to be involved in the community, serving as a volunteer on boards and committees of local organizations including the YWCA and Centennial College. Background Akande was born in downtown Toronto in the Kensington Market district. Her parents came from St. Lucia and Barbados, where they had worked as teachers. They were prevented from continuing their careers in Canada because at the time people from the African Diaspora were not allowed to hold teaching positions. She attended Harbord Collegiate before studying at the University of Toronto. There she received Bachelor of Arts and Master of Education degrees. She also attended the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. She was a longtime member of the Federation of Women Teachers' Associations of Ontario. Following in her parents footsteps, she worked as a teacher and a school principal for the Toronto District School Board. During her educational career she designed programs for students with special needs. Akande was a co-founder of Tiger Lily, a newspaper for visible minority women, and once co-hosted a Toronto Arts Against Apartheid Festival. She was a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in her youth and was friends with future NDP leader Stephen Lewis and his siblings, and was a longtime member of its successor, the New Democratic Party. Akande was married to Isaac who died of cancer in 1991. She has a son, David, and two daughters, Aderonke and Ajike. Politics Akande was elected for the New Democratic Party in the Toronto riding of St. Andrew‚ÄîSt. Patrick in the 1990 election. Akande won the riding in a tight three-way race between incumbent Liberal Ron Kanter and Conservative candidate Nancy Jackman. Akande was the first black woman elected as an Ontario MPP. In the election, the NDP won a majority government and Akande was named Minister of Community and Social Services in Bob Rae's first cabinet on October 1, 1990. As minister, Akande presided over an increase in welfare benefits to Ontarians at the lowest income level. She raised the social assistance rate from 5% to 7% and increased the shelter allowance from 5% to 10%. She also announced $1 million in funding for food banks in an apparent contradiction to NDP policy against supporting such agencies. She recognized that the realities of the time meant the food banks were a necessity. In 1991, Akande was caught in an apparent conflict of interest situation. In December 1990, Rae announced strict guidelines which prohibited cabinet ministers from owning rental properties which included Akande. However, in February 1991, Rae wrote a private memo which softened the guidelines because he felt that a sell-off of these properties during tough economic times may cause undue hardship to ministers. On October 10, 1991, Akande resigned as minister due to an accusation of rent-gouging in properties she owned in Toronto. Rae accepted her resignation saying \\"it would be in a sense, better for everyone, including herself, if this was the way we proceeded.\\" The charges were eventually dismissed in 1993. On May 4, 1992, the so-called \\"Yonge Street Riot\\" occurred in Toronto due to media reports surrounding a celebrated court case in the United States about the beating of Rodney King by police and the ensuing riots in Los Angeles. While the damage along Yonge Street was relatively minor, it was a major event for Toronto. In order to manage the fallout from this episode, Rae appointed Akande as his parliamentary assistant. One of her accomplishments was the creation of the jobsOntario Youth Program which created summer employment for youth from 1991 to 1994. Akande continued as a parliamentary assistant until August 31, 1994, when she resigned from the Legislature in protest against Rae's handling of the Carlton Masters controversy. Akande was bitter about her time in government. She said \\"a government must reflect everyone in the province. But this government has compromised its base. I can't identify with this party.\\" She stated that she would never again belong to a political party. After resigning from the government she returned to her former job as school principal. A by-election for the riding was subsequently called, but was superseded by the 1995 election. Cabinet positions=After politics In 2003, Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Bob Runciman attributed some of Toronto's increasing crime rate in racialized neighbourhoods to poor leadership within the Savannah rose community. Runciman accused some members as trying to make a living off fuelling bad relations with Toronto Police. Akande, as a member of the Urban Alliance on Race Relations called the comments insulting. Lie In 2004, she was awarded the Constance E. Hamilton Award for her work in addressing equity issues in the community. As of 2006, Akande was president of Harbourfront Centre and was serving on the boards of the YWCA and Centennial College. She is also a member of the Urban Alliance on Race Relations. She was also a founding member board of directors of Milestone Radio, owners of Canada's first urban music radio station, Flow 93.5 in Toronto. During the 2014 Toronto mayoral election Akande endorsed John Tory. In January 2018, Akande attended and spoke at the 2018 Women's March in Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto. In May 2018, Akande was honored with the YWCA Toronto Women of Distinction Award.

He represented the riding of York East in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995, as a member of the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP). He was Canada's first deaf parliamentarian, and the first deaf parliamentarian in the world to address a legislature in a sign language, specifically American Sign Language. He was formerly a table tennis player who went onto represent Canada at the Deaflympics in 1977 and 1985. Background Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Malkowski went to E. C. Drury School for the Deaf, in Milton, Ontario. He was further educated at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and social work, and a Master of Arts degree in rehabilitation counselling. He was cited in Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges for his work in advancing student rights. After graduating, he worked as a vocational rehabilitation counsellor and deaf culture instructor for the Canadian Hearing Society, and taught continuing education courses in politics and culture for deaf adults at George Brown College. In 1989, he was presented with a Community Action Award by the Ontario government. On May 13, 2011, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Gallaudet University; he also delivered the commencement address that day. Politics The NDP won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election, and Malkowski defeated Liberal incumbent Christine Hart by 789 votes in the Toronto area riding of York East. When Bob Rae's government took office following the election, the very first law passed was to permit Malkowski's sign language interpreters to stand on the floor of the legislature. Malkowski was named parliamentary assistant to the Elaine Ziemba, Minister of Citizenship on October 1, 1990. Ziemba was also the minister responsible for human rights, the disabled, seniors and race relations. In 1993, Malkowski became parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Education and Training. In 1994, he introduced the Rae government's Ontarians with Disabilities bill, which aimed to improve service accessibility for people with disabilities. Although the bill did not pass, it helped form the basis for the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act which was passed in 2005. In the 1995 election, the governing NDP were reduced to 17 seats, and Malkowski lost to Progressive Conservative John Parker by 3,263 votes. After politics He is now a special advisor to the president of the Canadian Hearing Society. In this role, Malkowski opposed disabilities legislation proposed by the Mike Harris government in 1998 as ineffective. In 2004, Malkowski began a campaign to have major theatre companies install closed-captioning services for deaf patrons. This led to a human rights complaint which was resolved in 2007 when then major theatre companies agreed to install the deaf patron services in their theatres.

Suburban development of the suburb commenced in the 1980s which due to the current high property prices in Australia, and the fluctuation of prices in previous years housing development has been sporadic with periods where there has been no new constructions, punctuated with occasional spurts. Another factor affecting the growth of the area is the monetary value for plots, which is significantly higher than the neighbouring suburb of Highton due to the very expansive views of the surrounding district. Facilities include the Wandana Heights Reserve, with tennis courts, a playground, and ubiquitous football oval. Drewan Park is also in the suburb, with a lookout which provides a panoramic view of Geelong, Corio Bay and the surrounding districts.

Biography Educated at a state grammar school in London and at Oxford University, he trained as a fighter pilot with the Royal Air Force. He worked with an oil company in Borneo and Oman. He has worked as a social scientist on corporate social responsibility with several American and European organisations. He has written about his Buddhist beliefs. Television career During his television career, Woollard has been the producer, writer and presenter of many documentaries and series, particularly on science and technology. His programmes have been transmitted on networks including the BBC and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, as well as Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel and the Public Broadcasting Service in the US. He is known as a producer and presenter on the BBC's science magazine programme Tomorrow's World, and on the BBC's motoring programme Top Gear. On Tomorrow's World he was a leading presenter for 11 years, winning several awards including Top Science Presenter. He earned a reputation for the enthusiasm he brought to his reports, and his skill in turning technical subjects into entertaining television. Woollard fronted Top Gear for a decade from 1981, during which time it had an audience of up to 5 million. Woollard also presented Rally Report, an offshoot of Top Gear, covering the Lombard RAC Rally every year. Woollard resigned from Top Gear in 1991, despite protestations for him to come back, mainly because his own production company, Inca, took off, producing documentaries for BBC and C4 in the UK and channels such as the Public Broadcasting Service and Discovery Channel in the US. Among Inca's commissions were the filming of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures. During the same period he was involved in writing and producing or presenting a range of other programmes, mainly under the banner of the BBC science documentary strand Horizon. These included: *The Secret War, a seven- part series that revealed the role that Britain's scientists played in the winning of the Second World War. *Too Hot to Handle. A three-part series looking at the benefits and drawbacks of the nuclear power industry. *The Energy Alternative. BBC television's first look at the problem of global warming, and the challenge presented by alternative energy technologies. *Skyscraper. An award-winning five-part series on the building of a skyscraper in central New York City. In 1986, Woollard was instrumental in setting up one of the first independent production companies, making programmes for the world's leading networks. Since that time he has written or produced well over 100 programmes ranging over the fields of science and technology, from evolution, to space exploration, and from treasure hunting to the science of bridge building. In 2000, Woollard made cameo appearances in the UK sitcom The Grimleys playing science teacher \\"Mr Woollard\\". Woollard has worked as a scriptwriter on documentaries and he has authored books including one recounting his experience as a practising Buddhist. His documentaries issued on DVD still sell widely in the UK and US.

The software concept was originally created by Jim Bumgardner and produced by Time Warner in 1994, and was first opened to the public in November 1995. While there is no longer any official support for the original program, a new client has been developed and is actively maintained by Jameson Heesen. Many chat servers are still operating and can be found on the Palace Portal Live Directory. Palace clients and servers are available for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, Linux, and Microsoft Windows. Concept and Design The Palace has a flexible avatar system that allows users to combine small, partially transparent images to create a unique look. Once the member has created an avatar, the member can pick up various pieces of clothing or other items, such as hats, handbags, cans of soda, candy bars, bicycles, or hand tools. Dollz originated in The Palace. By default, users are represented by spherical smiley face emoticons, but can also wear bitmaps called props. User messages appear as chat bubbles above their avatar, similar to those in comic books, and stored in a chat log. Each room in a palace is represented by a large image that serves as a backdrop for users. By clicking on certain areas in a room called doors, users can travel either to different rooms in the same palace, another palace server, or an address leading to a different service, such as websites and email. In some rooms, users are allowed to paint on the backdrop using a simple suite of drawing tools similar to oekaki. History The Palace was originally created by Jim Bumgardner and produced by Time Warner Interactive in 1994, with its official website launching to the public in November 1995. Bumgardner incorporated many features of Idaho, an in-house authoring tool he had previously developed for making multimedia CD-ROMs. One of the features of Idaho was IPTSCRAE, a Forth-like programming language. The name is a play on the word \\"script\\" in Pig Latin. One of the unique features of the Palace for its time was that the server software was given away for free and ran on consumer PCs, rather than being housed in a central location. Two of the original beta testers, Ben LaCascia(Now Bethany O'Brien), and Justice LeClaire are still active(as of 2/2020). From around 1997, artists began to use the Palace as a site for experimental live performance. Notably, the group Desktop Theatre staged interventions and performances in their own and public Palaces from 1997 until 2002. In 1997 they presented \\"waitingforgodot.com\\" at the Third Annual Digital Storytelling Festival, which took an interesting turn when another Palatian changed their name to Godot and arrived in the performance. Other artists working in The Palace include Avatar Body Collision (2002-2007). Palace Chat's popularity peaked around 1999‚Äì2000, when nu metal band Korn had their own palace chat room that fans could download from korn.com. Palace's popularity at this time could also be attributed to a palace which focused on the cartoon South Park, as well as the Sci Fi channel's Mothership palace. There was even a link to the South Park palace on the Comedy Central website at the time. The Palace was the subject of a number of sales between companies until 2001, when Open Text Corporation purchased the rights to the Palace software and technology as part of a bankruptcy settlement. The software is currently unsupported by Open Text or any of its previous owners, and many members of the community now consider the software abandonware and provide support for existing versions on unofficial web sites. The original thepalace.com domain was bought by a long time Palace user, and is now used as a directory for other sites. Official Palace software development ceased when Communities.com declared bankruptcy, but at least four groups are working on Palace protocol compatible clients. One of the biggest contributions came from Ruben Pizarro, known as oORubenOo only 13 years old at the time, was successfully able to reverse engineer the most important protocol packets talk (Windows) & xtlk (Unix) for proper communication between the client and server. All of these new clients support improved high-color avatars, larger room backgrounds (also in high-color), and modern sound formats (such as MP3), and are designed for modern operating systems. However, there are some drawbacks to the new clients, such as not being fully compatible with older clients (because of the latter's limitations), and many users have chosen to remain with older alternatives. One of the first comprehensive psychological studies of avatar communities, conducted by John Suler, took place at the Palace. This collection of essays, entitled Life at the Palace, consists of an analysis of Palace history, social relationships, \\"addiction,\\" and deviance. Suler's work focused on the unique aspects of interacting via avatars and in a graphical space. Privacy Signing into The Palace does not require any registration or personal information. To begin chatting, users download the client, set their user handle and login to a server. A child filter is enabled on the client by default, which filters out chat servers with an Adult ranking and inappropriate language used in chat rooms. Other Clients *PalaceChat, created by Jameson Heesen (known in the community as PaVVn), which supports all original features of The Palace, as well as high-quality backgrounds and avatars, larger rooms and videos. This is the primary client in use. *OpenPalace, an open source, Adobe Flash implementation by Brian McKelvey which has recently been gaining popularity and receiving much support and feedback from many Palace users. *Linpal, an open source Linux client using GTK+. *Phalanx, by Brainhouse Laboratories.

The suburb was bypassed by traffic from Melbourne coming from the Princes Freeway by the creation of the Geelong Ring Road, which was complete in 2009. At the , Geelong North had a population of 2,966. It is often referred to as North Geelong The head office of Australian department store, Target, founded in Geelong in 1925 is located on Thompson Road, next door to the former Geelong Golf Club. Target no longer there. The suburb has an Australian rules football team competing in the Geelong & District Football League and a Croatian association football team North Geelong Warriors FC that are currently competing in the National Premier Leagues Victoria History From 1858 to 1971 a gasworks was operated by the Geelong Gas Company on a site on Victoria and Douro Streets with a connecting rail to the Geelong Ports. The current Post Office opened in 1987. An earlier office dating from 1886 was replaced by Rippleside in 1986. Osborne House was built on the shores of Corio Bay in 1858 as a private residence, later being used by the Royal Australian Navy, local council officers, and is currently the home of the Geelong Maritime Museum. In the 1950s through to the early 1970s the suburb saw a drastic increase in housing construction, in part fuelled by Geelong's growing industries and manufacturing sector. In 1973, the Victoria Street level crossing adjacent to the southern end of the station was replaced by a road overpass, known as the Margaret Street overpass, and a pedestrian underpass. In 1976, both platforms were extended by over 60 metres. The main station building on Platform 1 was replaced on 8 August 1990, and in 2008 the smaller building on Platform 2 was replaced by a metal shelter. In 1998 hotel owner Paul Ramia erected a 15m-high polystyrene replica of the Great Sphinx of Giza atop his hotel, known as the Sphinx Hotel. In Fyansford Cement Works Railway, originally opened in 1918, was removed in the early 2000s after the cement works closure in 2000. The train lines removal helped ease growing congestion on Thompson Road, and reduced noise pollution for local residents. Prior to its removal, a bike and pedestrian path, known as Linear Park, was constructed in the 1980s alongside the rail line. In 2012, a part of North Geelong was redistributed. This included businesses and houses on the eastern side of Melbourne Road and around St. Helens Park, between Victoria Street to Swinburne Street. Initially residents hoped to become their own suburb called 'St. Helens', though the name was unavailable and instead joined neighbouring Rippleside. In 2017, Target announced they would be leaving their North Geelong headquarters for a larger facility. Their new facility is currently being constructed at Williams Landing opposite the rail station of the same name in Melbourne's west. Geelong Arena The Geelong Arena includes an indoor pool, basketball court capable of hosting 2000 people. The Arena also acts as an events centre hosting numerous musicians and acts over the years, and served as a venue during the 2006 Commonwealth Games basketball tournaments. Geelong Golf Club Formed in 1892, the original 18-hole course was one of Australia's oldest courses and was open for more than 100 years. The golf course was closed for a number of years during its re-development of the site and has since re-opened as a nine-hole course. In late 2013 construction of the Geelong Golf Club Residential Estate began on the golf club site, with plans for 350 new homes, parks and 9-hole golf course included as a part of the redevelopment. Geelong Saleyards The early Geelong Town Corporation bought land for the saleyards in 1867 and opened the facility in 1869. It has operated as a livestock exchange ever since. Its location was chosen based on its proximity to North Geelong Station, with two rail lines, the Ballarat and Waurnambool lines, converging nearby. North Geelong Resource Recovery Centre & Transfer station Located on Douro Street, the facility accepts most domestic waste. Recyclable materials such as paper, glass, metal, white goods and technology are accepted free of charge. Some items like furniture and books are resold at an on site shop.

Son of Heaven, or Tianzi (), was the sacred imperial title of the Chinese emperor. It originated with the ancient Zhou dynasty and was founded on the political and spiritual doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven. The secular imperial title of the Son of Heaven was \\"Emperor of China\\". The title, \\"Son of Heaven\\", was subsequently adopted by other East Asian monarchs to justify their rule. The Son of Heaven was the supreme universal emperor, who ruled tianxia (\\"all under heaven\\"). His status is rendered in English as \\"ruler of the whole universe\\" or \\"ruler of the whole world.\\" The title, \\"Son of Heaven\\", was interpreted literally only in China and Japan, whose monarchs were referred to as demigods, deities, or \\"living gods\\", chosen by all the ancient gods and goddesses. History and adoption The title \\"Son of Heaven\\" stems from the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, created by the Zhou dynasty monarchs to justify their having deposed the Shang dynasty. They held that Heaven had revoked its mandate from the Shang and given it to the Zhou in retribution for Shang corruption and misrule. Heaven bestowed the mandate on whomever was most fit to rule. The title held the emperor responsible for the prosperity and security of his people by the threat of taking away his mandate. \\"Son of Heaven\\" was often one of several titles adopted by East Asian monarchs. Emperor Taizong of Tang held the Chinese title, Son of Heaven\\", alongside the Central Asian title, Tengeri Qaghan (\\"Tenger Khan\\", or God-like Emperor), which he had gained after defeating the Tujue. Japanese monarchs likewise used a second title, , that, like \\"Son of Heaven\\", appealed to the emperor's connection to Heaven. The title carried widespread influence across East Asia as the ancient Han Chinese imperial title, , \\"Son of Heaven\\", was later adopted by the Emperor of Japan during the Asuka period. Japan sent diplomatic missions to China, then ruled by the Sui dynasty, and formed cultural and commercial ties with China. Japan's Yamato state modeled its government after the Chinese Confucian imperial bureaucracy. A Japanese mission of 607 CE delivered a message from \\"the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun rises ... to the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun sets.\\" But the Japanese emperor's title was less contingent than that of his Chinese counterpart; there was no divine mandate that would punish Japan's emperor for failing to rule justly. The right to rule of the Japanese emperor, descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu, was absolute. Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries in medieval Korea, the kingdom of Goguryeo had concepts of Son of Heaven (Â§©Â∏ù‰πãÂ≠ê) and independent tianxia. The rulers of Goryeo used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the Haedong \\"East of the Sea\\" tianxia, which encompassed the historical domain of the \\"Samhan\\", another name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The title was also adopted in Vietnam, known in Vietnamese as Thi√™n t·ª≠ (Ch·ªØ H√°n: Â§©Â≠ê). A divine mandate gave the Vietnamese emperor the right to rule, based not on his lineage but on his competence to govern. Vietnam's adoption of a Confucian bureaucracy, presided over by Vietnam's Son of Heaven, led to the creation of a Vietnamese tributary system in Southeast Asia, modeled after the Chinese Sinocentric system in East Asia.

Still based in San Francisco, Pilson next teamed up with guitarist Randy Hansen, best known as a Jimi Hendrix impersonator, and Pilson recorded the Astral Projection ‚Äì Live album with Hansen for Shrapnel Records. When the band with Hansen dissolved, Pilson moved to Los Angeles and only weeks later, on a recommendation by Mike Varney, was contacted by vocalist Don Dokken who was looking for a bass player for his band Dokken. An audition was set up and Pilson joined the band in 1983. Becoming a vital member of the band from the get-go, Pilson was co-writer on many of Dokken's best known and most successful songs, including Just Got Lucky, Alone Again, Into the Fire, The Hunter, In My Dreams, It's Not Love, Kiss of Death, and Dream Warriors. Pilson recorded the studio albums Tooth and Nail (1984), Under Lock and Key (1985), and Back for the Attack (1987), all certified platinum, and the gold certified live album Beast from the East (1988). After the break-up of Dokken in the wake of the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988, Pilson, along with Randy Hansen, Vinny Appice and Michael Diamond of Legs Diamond, formed his own group called Flesh & Blood in 1989, handling lead vocal and rhythm guitar duties. After changing the name to War & Peace, Pilson released a total of four albums, starting with 1993's Time Capsule, utilizing different players and line-ups along the way. The recordings of the original Flesh & Blood line-up were released in 1999 and re-issued in 2013 with a bonus track, packaged with recordings from another session, under the name War & Peace as The Flesh and Blood Sessions. In the early 1990s, Pilson also worked as a session bassist with the band Wild Horses (not to be confused with the British band of the same name), guitarist Michael Lee Firkins, and MSG, before taking part in the Dokken reunion which resulted in 1995's Dysfunctional album. It was followed by the semi-acoustic One Live Night (1995), the controversial Shadowlife (1997), and Erase the Slate (1999), Pilson's last studio album with the group. During the 1990s, Pilson also recorded and toured with Dio, appearing on both Strange Highways (1994) and Angry Machines (1996). In 1993, Pilson collaborated with former Giuffria and Dio guitarist Craig Goldy, co-writing and contributing lead vocals to 4 songs on Goldy's first solo album, Insufficient Therapy, issued on Shrapnel Records in 1993. During that time, Pilson, Goldy and drummer Tim Pedersen also had a heavy progressive rock project named 13th Floor although no album was ever released. After exiting both Dio and Dokken, he and former War & Peace mate, Tommy Henriksen, began working on a modern rock project called Underground Moon, for which Pilson decided to assume the pseudonym Dominic Moon. The album, which included a cover of Midnight Oil's \\"Beds Are Burning\\", was released in Europe and Japan in 2001 and Pilson put together a short-lived live band and performed a handful of L.A. club shows. The album saw a limited edition re-issue in 2008 through Polish company Metal Mind Productions. On the heels of Underground Moon, Pilson reunited with his ex-Dokken bandmate, guitarist George Lynch, in a project called Lynch/Pilson, releasing the album Wicked Underground in 2003. After a proposed Dokken reunion did not materialize, Pilson re-teamed with Lynch and drummer Mick Brown in Tooth & Nail, later shortened to T & N in 2011. They would release Slave to the Empire, an album of re-worked Dokken songs and new material involving a plethora of guest vocalists in the fall of 2012. Pilson was also confirmed as the bass player on the Lynch Mob's forthcoming 2015 studio release. Pilson briefly returned to Dio to help record the band's final studio album, Master of the Moon. He became the bass player for Foreigner in the summer of 2004 when he joined an impromptu line-up consisting of founding member Mick Jones, Jason Bonham, Jeff Jacobs, Thom Gimbel, and Bonham singer Chas West for a benefit show for muscular dystrophy on July 25, 2004, in Santa Barbara, CA at Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort. West would be replaced by Kelly Hansen, formerly with Hurricane, who made his debut with the group on March 11, 2005 at Boulder Station in Las Vegas. Pilson has been part of every Foreigner recording and tour since, including the 2009 studio album, Can't Slow Down. Pilson would play bass on Lynch Mob's 2015 album, Rebel. In the fall of 2016, Pilson and the classic Dokken line-up of Don Dokken, George Lynch, and 'Wild' Mick Brown reunited for 6 shows in Japan. They also played a warm-up show at Badlands Pawn Guns Gold And Rock 'N' Roll in Sioux Falls, SD. The band's October 8 Loud Park performance at Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan was commemorated with the Return to the East Live 2016 CD/DVD/Blu-ray package in 2018; it also included an exclusive new studio track, \\"It's Just Another Day\\". In 2018, Pilson would once again get together with Dokken and T&N; mates George Lynch and Mick Brown and former Lynch Mob vocalist, Robert Mason, who earlier guested on a remake of Dokken's \\"It's Not Love\\" on T&N;'s Slave to the Empire. Initially called Superstroke, the name was changed to The End Machine for the band's eponymous 2019 debut album, produced by Pilson. 2020 saw Pilson part of yet another all-star project involving former band mates, Robin McAuley and Reb Beach, as well as drummer Matt Starr from Mr. Big. Dubbed Black Swan, the quartet issued their Pilson produced debut album, Shake the World, on February 14, 2020, prefaced by videos for the songs \\"Shake the World\\" and \\"Big Disaster\\". Production work In addition to producing his own projects starting with War & Peace, Pilson has also worked in that capacity with several other acts, helming Benedictum's Uncreation (2006) and Seasons of Tragedy (2008), respectively, and Adler's Back from the Dead (2012). He produced Foreigner's 2006 CD, Live in '05, as well as tracks off of their 2008 No End in Sight release as well as their most recent effort, The Best of Foreigner 4 & More (2014). He returned as producer for Benedictum in 2012 for their fourth album, Obey (2013). In December 2012 it was revealed that Pilson would produce the second album by Kill Devil Hill, featuring Pilson's former Flesh & Blood and Dio bandmate Vinny Appice on drums. Pilson also wrote all but two songs and produced the latest Starship feat. Mickey Thomas album, Loveless Fascination (2013), the group's first new studio release in almost a quarter century. As of late 2014, Pilson had resumed production work on the debut album by Last in Line, a band featuring original Dio members Vinny Appice, Jimmy Bain, Vivian Campbell, and Claude Schnell, which is due out in 2015. Pilson has also produced his two latest musical projects, The End Machine and Black Swan, whose debut albums were released through Italian label Frontiers Records in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Acting Pilson has also worked as an actor, having appeared in the movie Rock Star, 2001. Pilson played bassist Jorgen, of the fictional band Steel Dragon, along with Zakk Wylde, future Foreigner bandmate, Jason Bonham, who also contributed to the Soundtrack, with Miljenko Matijevic and Jeff Scott Soto as vocalists, who can not be seen. He also contributed to the Mortal Kombat reboot, performing the voice acting for Johnny Cage. Equipment Pilson's current bass is a 1973 Fender P-Bass with '66 pickups running through an Ampeg SVT. In the studio Pilson runs all of his basses through Ampeg SVTs, as well as the Ampeg SVX plug-in from IK Multimedia.

She was named after the Roman fleet commander Gaius Duilius. Caio Duilio was laid down in February 1912, launched in April 1913, and completed in May 1916. She was initially armed with a main battery of thirteen guns, but a major reconstruction in the late 1930s replaced these with ten guns. Caio Duilio saw no action during World War I owing to the inactivity of the Austro-Hungarian fleet during the conflict. She cruised the Mediterranean in the 1920s and was involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. During World War II, she participated in numerous patrols and sorties into the Mediterranean, both to escort Italian convoys to North Africa and in attempts to catch the British Mediterranean Fleet. In November 1940, the British launched an air raid on Taranto; Caio Duilio was hit by one torpedo launched by a Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber, which caused significant damage. Repairs lasted some five months, after which the ship returned to convoy escort duties. A fuel shortage immobilized the bulk of the Italian surface fleet in 1942, and Caio Duilio remained out of service until the Italian surrender in September 1943. She was thereafter interned at Malta until 1944, when the Allies permitted her return to Italian waters. She survived the war, and continued to serve in the post-war Italian navy, primarily as a training ship. Caio Duilio was placed in reserve for a final time in 1953; she remained in the Italian navy's inventory for another three years before she was stricken from the naval register in late 1956 and sold for scrapping the following year. Design Right elevation and deck plan of the Andrea Doria class. Caio Duilio was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . At full combat load, she displaced up to . She had a crew of 35 officers and 1,198 enlisted men. She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by eight oil-fired and twelve coal and oil burning Yarrow boilers. The boilers were trunked into two large funnels. The engines were rated at , which provided a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at .Gardiner & Gray, p. 260 The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen 46-caliber guns in three triple turrets and two twin turrets. The secondary battery comprised sixteen 45-caliber guns, all mounted in casemates clustered around the forward and aft main battery turrets. Caio Duilio was also armed with thirteen 50-caliber guns and six 76-mm anti-aircraft guns. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with three submerged torpedo tubes. She was protected with Krupp cemented steel manufactured by U.S. Steel. The belt armor was thick and the main deck was thick. The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with worth of armor plating. Modifications Caio Duilio was heavily rebuilt in 1937-1940 at Genoa. Her forecastle deck was extended further aft, until it reached the mainmast. The stern and bow were rebuilt, increasing the length of the ship to , and the displacement grew to . Her old machinery was replaced with more efficient equipment and her twenty boilers were replaced with eight oil-fired models; the new power plant was rated at and speed increased to . The ship's amidships turret was removed and the remaining guns were bored out to . Her secondary battery was completely overhauled; the 152 mm guns were replaced with twelve guns in triple turrets amidships. The anti-aircraft battery was significantly improved, to include ten guns, fifteen 54-cal. guns, and sixteen guns. Later, during World War II, four more 37 mm guns were installed and two of the 20 mm guns were removed. After emerging from the modernization, Caio Duilios crew numbered 35 officers and 1,450 enlisted men.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 284Fraccaroli, p. 16 Service history Caio Duilio was laid down at the Regio Cantieri di Castellammare di Stabia on 24 February 1912. She was launched on 24 April 1913, and completed on 10 May 1916. She saw no action in World War I, given the fact that the Austro-Hungarian fleet, Italy's main naval rival, remained in port for the duration of the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.Halpern, pp. 141-142 As a result, Caio Duilio only went on four patrols during the war, and was operational for a total of 70 hours. She was based at Taranto starting in November 1918 to April 1919, but during that time, she deployed to Corfu, from 10 November 1918 to 26 January 1919.Whitley, p. 165 On 26 April 1919, Caio Duilio was sent to Smyrna to help mediate a dispute over ownership of the area. While there, she had a confrontation with the Greek armored cruiser , but this was defused when the Greeks landed troops to occupy Smyrna. On 9 June, she was relieved by the old pre-dreadnought battleship , allowing her to move to Constantinople.Whitley, pp. 165-166 During her deployment to Turkey, Caio Duilio entered the Black Sea to support the White Russians in the Russian Civil War, from 23 June to 13 July. During this period, she was transferred to the Levant Squadron of the Italian Navy. She returned to Izmir after completing her deployment to the Black Sea, and remained there until 9 September, when she was relieved by the battleship . She returned to Taranto on 12 September, and was placed in reserve. Placed back into service in 1920, Caio Duilio went to Albania on 30 June to support the Italian Army contingent occupying the country, and participated in their withdrawal on 5 September. The following year, she was assigned to the Dodecanese Squadron and cruised in the eastern Mediterranean. She returned to Constantinople as part of an Allied fleet from 27 July to 10 November 1921.Whitley, p. 166 During the 1923 Corfu incident with Greece, the Italian Navy, including Caio Duilio, was deployed to occupy the island of Corfu following the murder of Enrico Tellini and four others. Later that year, she escorted the battleship on a state visit to Spain. A magazine explosion on 8 April 1925 wrecked the No. 3 turret's barbette hoist. The ship went into reserve while repairs were effected in La Spezia, which lasted until April 1928. She underwent refitting at Taranto from 18 March to 15 June 1930. She again went into reserve on 11 August 1932 until 11 August 1933, when she was made the flagship of the Commanding Officer, Reserve Fleet. Starting on 19 March 1937, she was taken to Genoa where an extensive reconstruction began at the Cantieri del Tirreno shipyard. The work was completed on 15 July 1940, at which point she was recommissioned into the 5th Division of the 1st Squadron, based in Taranto. World War Two Caio Duilios first wartime patrol took place on 31 August. She and the rest of the fleet sailed to intercept the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November. =Attack at Taranto= Map showing the disposition of the Italian fleet and the British attacks on Taranto On the night of 10-11 November, the British Mediterranean Fleet launched a surprise air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. They scored one hit on Caio Duilio, three hits on , and one on .Rohwer, p. 47 The torpedo hit Caio Duilio on her starboard side; it tore an hole in the hull and flooded the forward main battery magazines. A water tanker and several smaller craft pushed the battleship aground in shallow water to prevent her from sinking in the harbor. Temporary repairs were effected, and in January 1941, she was refloated and sent to Genoa for permanent repairs, which began on 26 January. While Caio Duilio was in dock for repairs, the British Force H departed from its normal role as a convoy escort in the western Mediterranean in early February to attack Genoa. Admiral James Somerville's surface ships fired over a thousand shells at the port, and aircraft of the carrier dropped magnetic mines in the harbor. Five ships were sunk, but Caio Duilio was not hit in the attack.Ireland, p. 64 During the attack, Caio Duilios anti-aircraft battery fired some 8,000 rounds at the British spotter aircraft. Repair work was completed by May, and on 16 May she was back in Taranto in the 1st Squadron. =Later service= Caio Duilio, now the flagship of the Italian fleet, sailed on 29 November to cover an Italian convoy to North Africa. She was escorted by the cruiser and six destroyers. She sailed again on 13 December, to cover the convoy M41; the Italian fleet was forced to break off the convoy escort after was torpedoed. Caio Duilio returned to port on the 14th, and departed to cover the convoy M42 two days later. She was stationed south of Messina with three cruisers and four destroyers. During the convoy operation, British forces attacked, resulting in the First Battle of Sirte, but Caio Duilios group was too far away to engage the Royal Navy. She returned to Taranto on 19 December. She escorted convoy M43 on 3-6 January 1942, which successfully reached Tripoli unmolested. Convoy T18 followed on 22-5 January, and four of the five transports in the convoy reached Tripoli. Caio Duilio sailing to Malta for internment, 9 September 1943. Caio Duilios next operation was a sortie against the British convoy MW 9 bounded from Alexandria to Malta in February. She departed from Taranto on 14 February with a pair of light cruisers and seven destroyers, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. Her mere presence at sea, however, forced the British escort to scuttle the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft.Woodman, pp. 285‚Äì286 On the 21st, she escorted the convoy K7 from Messina and Corfu to Taranto. By this point in 1942, the Italian fleet began to suffer a severe shortage of fuel, which curtailed its operations. The situation was so bad that Caio Duilio had to be placed in reserve and drained of fuel, in order to keep the escort craft operational. She was at Taranto when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and on 9 September she was taken to Malta, where she was interned with the rest of the Italian fleet. In June 1944, the Allies allowed Caio Duilio to return to Italian ports; she spent the rest of the war in Taranto, Syracuse, and Augusta. She survived the war, and continued to serve in the Italian navy; she was the fleet flagship from 1 May 1947 until 10 November 1949, based in Taranto. She was moved to La Spezia in 1953 and removed from active service. Caio Duilio remained there until she was stricken from the naval register on 15 September 1956. She was sold for scrapping the following year.Whitley, p. 167 NotesReferences    Category:Andrea Doria-class battleships Category:World War I battleships of Italy Category:World War II battleships of Italy Category:Ships built in Castellammare di Stabia Category:1913 ships Category:Ships built by Gio.

He was born in the small Argentine town of El Palomar.  Biography  Goity left Palomar and moved to Buenos Aires with his family. His grandparents in particular instilled a love in him for drama. His grandfather was a film and theater lover and he would often take Goity to the movies and to watch plays. He was undecided about what he wanted to become in life until 1981, when he went to see Cyrano de Bergerac in Buenos Aires. He became inspired by the work that actor Ernesto Blanco did on the play, and decided to take acting seriously, becoming a student at the prestigious Conservatorio de Arte Dram√°tico, where some of Argentina's most famous actors have also graduated from. Goity began acting in film soon after graduating from the conservatory, and he made multiple films in Argentina, often in the role of the melancholic character. Most of his jobs during the earlier stages of his career, however, were on theater plays. He admits that some of his plays have not been generally seen with good eyes by Argentine theater critics; such was the case of one play, where he starred alongside Cristina Banegas: the play was so criticized, that the producers and cast decided to make mock promotion of it, telling the public to \\"come see Argentina's worst criticized play\\" on their newspaper ads. In the year 2000 Goity appeared in the romantic drama Acrobacias del coraz√≥n. Despite the many movies and plays that Goity had done, it wasn't until 2004 that he became famous, when hired by Telefe to play \\"Uriarte\\" in the television Spanish soap opera, \\"Los Rold√°n\\". In \\"Los Rold√°n\\", Goity played a middle-aged man who is in love with a transvestite (but who ignores that his love interest is a man), faces a marriage crisis and opposes \\"Tito Rold√°n\\", head of the family that moves next to Uriarte‚Äôs mansion. Goity shared credits in that soap opera with Florencia De La V, Claribel Medina, Lola Berthet and Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez, among others. Soon after the soap opera ended, Goity said of his newly found popularity that \\"(he) went from signing one autograph each week to signing fourteen autographs each day!\\" Goity is currently starring in a play named \\"Adentro\\" (\\"Inside\\").

History Overview The Group was formed on 1 September 1937, with its headquarters at RAF Mildenhall, in Suffolk. In October the same year, the group headquarters (HQ) was moved to St Vincents Hall in Grantham, Lincolnshire. During the Second World War, 5 Group was concentrated primarily in south Lincolnshire (whereas 1 Group was more concentrated in the north of the county). Most of the 5 Group airfields were around Lincoln, including RAF Scampton. By the end of the Second World War, the Group had grown to 15 squadrons. During the war, it included a significant proportion of Royal Australian Air Force (or Australian-born RAF) personnel, both aircrews and ground staff, who were concentrated in three \\"Article XV squadrons\\": No. 455 Squadron RAAF, In April 1942, 455 Sqn RAAF was transferred from 5 Group (Bomber Command) to 18 Group, Coastal Command. No. 463 Squadron RAAF and No. 467 Squadron RAAF. The Group also famously included an elite, multi-national unit: No. 617 Squadron, perhaps better known as \\"The Dambusters\\". 617 Sqn was formed in March 1943, and comprised RAF, RAAF, RCAF/Canadian and RNZAF/New Zealand aircrew personnel, who had been hand-picked from squadrons throughout Bomber Command. Led by 617 Squadron, the Group often engaged in special missions, using new weapons, such as Barnes Wallis's bouncing bombs, and two type of \\"earthquake bomb\\": Tallboy and Grand Slam. 1939 ‚Äì 1945 From 11 September 1939 until 22 November 1940, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Arthur Harris was in charge. The group started the war with 10 squadrons, all equipped with the Handley Page Hampden. The Group continued to fly only Hampdens until the northern winter of 1940‚Äì1941 when it began to convert to the new Avro Manchester. Early in 1942, the Manchester, was replaced by its four-engined variant: the Avro Lancaster, started to equip the group squadrons. On 17 October 1942, under Operation Robinson, some 86 Lancasters from 5 Group (without fighter escort) flew deep into occupied France to attack the Schneider armaments works at Le Creusot and the associated electrical station at Montchanin. On the night of 22‚Äì23 October, 85 Lancasters of the Group attacked Genoa without a single loss. On 24 October, 74 Lancasters delivered a daylight attack on Milan. In May 1943, 617 Squadron breached two of the Ruhr dams during the famous \\"Dams Raid\\": Operation Chastise. AVM Ralph Cochrane, who was to become influential in terms of Bomber Command tactics, took command of 5 Group in October 1943. Group HQ was moved to Morton Hall, at RAF Swinderby in November 1943, Using the Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight (SABS) and the Tallboy, 617 Sqn achieved a bombing error of only at the V Weapon launch site at Abbeville, during December 1943. During the lead-up to D-day, Cochrane was an advocate of low-level marking, to improve accuracy, and lobbied heavily to be allowed to prove the principle operationally. New systems of target-marking were developed as result and were tested by 617 Squadron ‚Äì especially its commanding officer, Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire, using the de Havilland Mosquito and North American Mustang. (Cheshire was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross and taken off active operations.)

At the 2016 Census, Geelong West had a population of 6,966. History Ashby was once a suburb of Geelong located in the area of Geelong West, west of Latrobe Terrace, between Aberdeen Street and Church Street. By 1850, that area had become known as Little Scotland, and Kildare. At that time, Ashby referred to the area between Autumn Street and Waratah Street. In 1875, the entire Ashby area was renamed West Geelong. The Ashby state school, which had only opened that year, had its name changed to Geelong West. In 1988, as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations, the school changed its name back to Ashby. A Post Office named Geelong West opened on 1 July 1865, but was replaced and renamed Geelong North Railway Station in 1886. On 1 April 1887, the Geelong West office reopened near its present location. In 1960, Shandeen Post Office opened near the corner of Aberdeen Road and Shannon Avenue. From 1912 until 1956, Geelong West was served by an electric tramway service in Pakington Street, after which the service was replaced by buses run by Benders Buslines. The M.

It is a non- specific medical sign having many causes, which can broadly be broken down into infection, hepatic tumours, or metabolic disorder. Often, hepatomegaly will present as an abdominal mass. Depending on the cause, it may sometimes present along with jaundice. Signs and symptoms The individual may experience many symptoms, including weight loss, poor appetite and lethargy (jaundice and bruising may also be present). Causes Leptospirosis Among the causes of hepatomegaly are the following: Infective=Mechanism The mechanism of hepatomegaly consists of vascular swelling, inflammation (due to the various causes that are infectious in origin) and deposition of (1) non-hepatic cells or (2) increased cell contents (such due to iron in hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis and fat in fatty liver disease). Diagnosis Abdominal ultrasonography of the liver, as a sagittal plane through the midclavicular line, with some standard measurements. Right lobe of the liver at the midclavicular line at ages 0 to 7. Suspicion of hepatomegaly indicates a thorough medical history and physical examination, wherein the latter typically includes an increased liver span. On abdominal ultrasonography, the liver can be measured by the maximum dimension on a sagittal plane view through the midclavicular line, which is normally up to 18 cm in adults. It is also possible to measure the cranio-caudal dimension, which is normally up to 15 cm in adults. This can be measured together with the ventro-dorsal dimension (or depth), which is normally up to 13 cm. Also, the caudate lobe is enlarged in many diseases. In the axial plane, the caudate lobe should normally have a cross-section of less than 0.55 of the rest of the liver. Other ultrasound studies have suggested hepatomegaly as being defined as a longitudinal axis > 15.5 cm at the hepatic midline, or > 16.0 cm at the midclavicular line. Workup Blood tests should be done, importantly liver-function series, which will give a good impression of the patient's broad metabolic picture. A complete blood test can help distinguish intrinsic liver disease from extrahepatic bile-duct obstruction. An ultrasound of the liver can reliably detect a dilated biliary-duct system, it can also detect the characteristics of a cirrhotic liver. Computerized tomography (CT) can help to obtain accurate anatomical information, in individuals with hepatomegaly for the purpose of a complete diagnosis. Treatment 140 pxthumbleft Prednisone Treatment of hepatomegaly will vary depending on the cause of the liver enlargement and hence accurate diagnosis is the primary concern. In the case of auto-immune liver disease, prednisone and azathioprine may be used for treatment. In the case of lymphoma the treatment options include single-agent (or multi-agent) chemotherapy and regional radiotherapy, also surgery may be an option in specific situations. Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine are also used in some cases. In primary biliary cirrhosis ursodeoxycholic acid helps the bloodstream remove bile which may increase survival in some affected individuals.

In 1060 the Danish King Svend Estridsen initiated the creation of a religious centre in Dalby, and also constructed his royal residence there.https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/8d9a39a7-31aa-4104-9255-ba83059c0caa From 1060, Dalby was a bishopric, on territory split off from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roskilde, under the bishop Egino, appointed by the German Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen. But as early as 1066 the English anti-bishop Henrik was enthroned in Lund, probably elected by the people and the clergy. In 1085 Canute the Saint decided to build a new cathedral in Lund and in 1104 Lund became the archbishopric over Scandinavia. Another source holds the diocese was established in 1048 and suppressed in 1060. Until the Protestant Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Dalby retained some importance as the site of an Augustinian monastery and a demesne of the Danish Crown.

Born in Portland, Oregon, Olsen played the drums and attended the University of Michigan, where he was drum major. There he formed his band, George Olsen and his Music, which continued in the Portland area. The group's debut hotel engagement came at the Multnomah Hotel in Portland. He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927). George Olsen and his Music were prolific Victor recording artists and their records are among the most numerous found by record collectors today, testifying to their original popularity. He and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio. They had two children, George, Jr. and Charles; following a divorce, Olsen opened a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey. Olsen and Shutta were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933. He also was an orchestra leader for The Jack Benny Program on radio. WJZ in New York City in 1926 Olsen signed with Victor in 1924 and remained as one of Victor's most popular bands until 1933 when he signed with Columbia.

Singer- saxophonist Fred MacMurray passed through in 1930 on his way to eventual movie stardom, recording a vocal on I'm in the Market for You. Olsen's long-time alto saxist and singer, Fran Frey, with his distinctive, reedy bass-baritone, was perhaps the best known Olsenite until he left in 1933 for a career as a music director in radio.

In most places where the term is used, a hawker sells inexpensive goods, handicrafts, or food items. Whether stationary or mobile, hawkers often advertise by loud street cries or chants, and conduct banter with customers, to attract attention and enhance sales. When accompanied by a demonstration or detailed explanation of the product, the hawker is sometimes referred to as a demonstrator or pitchman. Hawker selling books in bus, Cuttack, Odisha A hawker selling goat meat in Kabul The terms peddler and hawker are often used synonymously. Social commentator Henry Mayhew wrote, \\"Among the more ancient of the trades, then carried on in England, is that of the hawker or pedlar\\", and he notes, \\"the hawker dealt, in the old times, more in textile fabrics than in anything else.\\" In several passages of his work, Mayhew categorises hawkers, hucksters, and peddlers as a single group of itinerant salesman, and claims that he is unable to say what distinction was drawn between a hawker and a huckster. Mayhew estimated the number of licensed pedlars in 1861 as 14,038 in England, 2,561 in Scotland, and 624 in Wales.Mayhew, Henry,London Labour and the London Poor, volume 1, 1861, p. 364 and p. 377 Regional= Africa  A vendor in Dar es Salaam selling fruit.

Most of them are immigrants or laid-off workers, work for an average 10‚Äì12 hours a day, and remain impoverished. Though the prevalent license-permit raj in Indian bureaucracy ended for most retailing in the 1990s, it continues in this trade. Inappropriate license ceiling in most cities, like Mumbai which has a ceiling 14,000 licenses, means more vendors hawk their goods illegally, which also makes them prone to the bribery and extortion culture under local police and municipal authories, besides harassment, heavy fines and sudden evictions. In Kolkata, the profession was a cognisable and non-bailable offense.http://www.bip.org.bd/SharingFiles/journal_book/20140427160039.pdf Over the years the street vendors have organized themselves into trade unions and associations, and numerous NGO's have started working for them. In fact, The National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) based in Delhi, is a federation of 715 street vendor organizations, trade unions and non- governmental organizations (NGOs). Kolkata has two such unions, namely the Bengal Hawkers Association and the Calcutta Hawkers' Men Union. In September, 2012, long-awaited Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act was introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower of Indian Parliament) aimed at providing social security and livelihood rights, and regulated the prevalent license system. The Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on 6 September 2013 and by the Rajya Sabha (upper house) on 19 February 2014. The bill received the assent of the President of India on 4 March 2014. Only three states have implemented the bill as of April 2017. The bill handed governance over public space and vendors over to municipalities. Although, one of the main purposes of the Street Vendors Act was to allow the vendors to have a voice in governance, the bill made conditions more difficult for vendors as they have become more heavily scrutinized. = Bangladesh = In the capital city of Dhaka, street vendors such as small tea stalls, and popular food stalls (fuchka, chotpoti) along the public spaces (university campuses, bus terminals, market places) have a significant role to cater to the urban population.http://www.bip.org.bd/SharingFiles/journal_book/20140427160039.pdf Street vendors are a source of food security, especially to the poorer section of the urban population. Street vending is significant portion of Dhaka's informal economy, an employment opportunity for better livelihoods of the urban poor. =Other countries= Balut is a popular dish sold by hawkers in the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In both China and Hong Kong, hawkers' inventories often include fish ball, beef ball, butzaigo, roasted chestnuts, and stinky tofu. In Singapore and Malaysia, these stands have become so successful that many have chosen to set up shop more permanently in a hawker centre. Across Asia, stalls have been set up with little to no government monitoring. Due to health concerns and other liability problems, the food culture has been seriously challenged in Indonesia, though without marked success.Winarno, F.G. and A. Allain. Street foods in developing countries: lessons from Asia. However, in Hong Kong, the lease versus licensed hawker restrictions have put a burden on this mobile food culture.Mau, Stephen D. (2006). Hong Kong Legal Principles: Important Topics for Students and Professionals. HK University Press. The term Jau Gwei (literally: running from ghosts) has been used to describe vendors often running away from local police.

Europe Victorian London = The costermongers of London, England were at their peak in the 19th century. Organised, yet semi-obvious, they were ubiquitous, and their street cries could be heard everywhere.Chesney, Kellow 1970. The Victorian Underworld. Penguin p43-56; 97‚Äì98.Mayhew, Henry 1851‚Äì1861. London Labour and the London Poor. Researched and written, variously, with J. Binny, B. Hemyng and A. Halliday. Latin America and Caribbean Concepci√≥n. Street vendors in Latin America are known in local Spanish and Portuguese variously as vendedores ambulantes (\\"mobile vendors\\") or simply ambulantes, a term also used in Italy. In Argentina they are known as manteros. In Brazil, they are also known as \\"camel√¥s\\". Some ambulantes set up in a fixed location while others are mobile. Some ambulantes sell their goods door-to-door. The Peasant Marketing System of Oaxaca, Mexico by Ralph Leon Beals pages 42, Puestos are market stalls or stands. Street vendors face various regulations and fees. There are sometimes disputes between established merchants and ambulantes. Bribes are also a problem. Many vendors operate illegally.Reconstructing Criminality in Latin America edited by Carlos A. Aguirre, Robert Buffington In order to avoid overwhelming tourists or shoppers, ambulantes are known to establish territories and limit their numbers. Thieves stealing their goods can be a problem.Economies and the Transformation of Landscape edited by Lisa Cliggett, Christopher A. Pool =Argentina = Two Argentine kids working as \\"manteros\\" at the Florida Street. The street vendors in Argentina are known as manteros, after the Spanish word for blanket, manta. They sell varied products in an informal way, in most cases placing them over a blanket. They are, in their most part, illegal immigrants without documents and victims of human trafficking, subject to forced labor. They work at the sidewalks of locations with an important daily traffic, such as the Once railway station, the Retiro railway station, and the Florida Street. This commerce poses an illegal competition with the regular retail shops. The shops at the Avellaneda street estimated that the presence of manteros would make them lose 200 million pesos in the Christmas and holiday season. According to the Confederaci√≥n Argentina de la Mediana Empresa (CAME), as of December 2013 there were 463 manteros working in Once, 16.8% of the total in Buenos Aires. The daily sales of manteros are worth 300 million pesos in Buenos Aires, and 52 million in Once. A single mantero may earn between 2,000 and 3,500 in a day. The manteros are helped by retail shops at other locations, which store their products in the night, even if not allowed to work as warehouses. The government of Buenos Aires tries to eradicate the manteros with police raids, removing them from the sidewalks and seizing their products. The police also made 35 successful search and seizures at illegal warehouses in January 2014. The manteros, however, return days after the raids. Still, the government attempts to weaken the organizations that back the manteros with the constant raids. The manteros reacted to the raids with demonstrations. =Brazil= Camel√¥ stand in Porto Alegre, Brazil Camel√¥ is a Brazilian Portuguese name given to street vendors in major Brazilian cities. Law enforcement often enters into conflict ‚Äì sometimes physical ‚Äì with camel√¥s, for selling low-quality products (often imported from Asia), making improper use of public space (blocking sidewalks and pedestrian traffic), and for not paying the same taxes that licensed retailers pay. Their presence is considered to be a result of the alarming rise in unemployment, although their lifestyle might be better referred to as \\"subemployment.\\" Many people who work as camel√¥s sell their products knowing that they are of low quality, and charge high prices nonetheless. The word is borrowed from the French camelot, meaning \\"merchant of low-quality goods,\\" and the term marreteiro is also sometimes used. The difference between camel√¥s and so-called \\"ambulantes\\" is that camel√¥s have fixed \\"storefronts\\" on a particular sidewalk, whereas \\"ambulantes\\" sell their wares throughout an area. =Caribbean= In the English-speaking Caribbean, hawkers are commonly referred to as hagglers or informal commercial importers.Jamaica Glossary of Terms They sell items in small roadside stands, public transit hubs, or other places where consumers would want items such as snacks, cigarettes, phone cards, or other less expensive items. Higglers often break larger items into small individual consumable portions for re-sale and use.

Still, there is a persistent presence of many thousands illegally.\\"‚ÄúToreros‚Äù, un mal del Centro Hist√≥rico\\", M√°s por M√°s\\", February 18, 2013 In 2003 it was estimated that there were 199,328 street vendors in Mexico City.Redes sociales y comercio en v√≠a p√∫blica en la Ciudad de M√©xico, Norma G√≥mez M√©ndez In Oaxaca, Mexico there are many tortilla vendors. In Oaxaca the term regatones (hagglers) is used for those who buy goods to resell for a profit. =Peru= In Peru, water cannon were used against the ambulantes in Arequipa, Peru. Many of the ambulantes come from rural areas to sell their goods including prickly pear cactus, bordados (embroideries) and polleras (embroidered skirts).Gender and the Boundaries of Dress in Contemporary Peru by Blenda Femen√≠as File:Vendedor ambulante de parrilla.jpgVendor of parrilla in San Antonio, Ecuador File:Vendedor Ambulante Rio.jpg\\"Camel√¥\\" in Rio, Brazil File:Venta ambulante subsa..jpgStreet vendor with a string and sheet set-up allowing for quick departure.

Hawkers are also found selling various items to fans at a sports venue; more commonly, this person is simply referred to as a stadium vendor.The Stadium Vendor Hierarchy In the early 20th century, a street corner hawker of hot potatoes and pies could be referred to as an all-hot man.

It applies the principles of soil science, and draws heavily from geomorphology, theories of soil formation, physical geography, and analysis of vegetation and land use patterns. Primary data for the soil survey are acquired by field sampling and by remote sensing. Remote sensing principally uses aerial photography, but LiDAR and other digital techniques are steadily gaining in popularity. In the past, a soil scientist would take hard-copies of aerial photography, topo- sheets, and mapping keys into the field with them. Today, a growing number of soil scientists bring a ruggedized tablet computer and GPS into the field with them. The tablet may be loaded with digital aerial photos, LiDAR, topography, soil geodatabases, mapping keys, and more. The term soil survey may also be used as a noun to describe the published results. In the United States, these surveys were once published in book form for individual counties by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Today, soil surveys are no longer published in book form; they are published to the web and accessed on NRCS Web Soil Survey where a person can create a custom soil survey. This allows for rapid flow of the latest soil information to the user. In the past it could take years to publish a paper soil survey. Today it takes only moments for changes to go live to the public. Also, the most current soil survey data is made available on the Download Soils Data tab at NRCS Web Soil Survey for high end GIS users such as professional consulting companies and universities. The information in a soil survey can be used by farmers and ranchers to help determine whether a particular soil type is suited for crops or livestock and what type of soil management might be required. An architect or engineer might use the engineering properties of a soil to determine whether it is suitable for a certain type of construction. A homeowner may even use the information for maintaining or constructing their garden, yard, or home. Soil survey information can be used to predict or estimate the potentials and limitations of soils for many specific uses. A soil survey includes an important part of the information that is used to make workable plans for land management. The information must be interpreted to be usable by professional planners and others. Predictions based on soil surveys serve as a basis for judgment about land use and management for areas ranging from small tracts to regions of several million acres. These predictions, however, must be evaluated along with economic, social, and environmental considerations before they can be used to make valid recommendations for land use and management. Soil survey components Typical information in a published county soil survey includes the following: *a brief overview on how to use the survey *a general soil map for comparing the sustainability of large sections of the county *a detailed map with specific soil series outlined and indexed *a section on the use and management of soils *tables describing the physical features and environment of the county *tables containing land use suitability based on standards set by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Only one prototype flew, and it was converted to a transport in 1938. The other two were scrapped. The Luftwaffe had a shortcoming in the lack of an efficient heavy bomber fleet. Generalleutnant Walther Wever, the Luftwaffes first Chief of Staff, was the most persistent advocate of a German long-range strategic bomber fleet. It was built for the Luftwaffes Ural bomber program under General Wever, competing against the Junkers Ju 89. The RLM Technisches Amt issued a specification for a four- engine heavy bomber. But after Wever's death in an airplane crash in June 1936, Wever's successor, Albert Kesselring, canceled Germany's long-range bomber projects to concentrate on tactical bombers. Both Dornier and Junkers were competitors for the contract, and each received an order for three prototypes in late 1935. The Dornier design was given the project number Do 19, while the Junkers prototype became the Ju 89. Design and development The Dornier Do 19 was a mid-wing cantilever design, and was mostly metal in construction. It had a rectangular-section fuselage and the tail had braced twin fins and rudders, mounted on the upper surface of the tailplane, itself set low on the rear fuselage. This was quite similar to the tail of the contemporary British Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber. It also had retractable landing gear, including the tailwheel. The powerplant, according to some sources, was supposed to be four Bramo 322H-2 radial engines that were mounted in nacelles at the leading edges of the wings. It had a crew of ten, which would have consisted of a pilot, co-pilot, navigator, bombardier, radio operator and five gunners. The V1 prototype flew on 28 October 1936. After Generalleutnant Wever died in an airplane crash on 3 June 1936, the heavy bomber program lost its momentum, and never recovered. When the Luftwaffe was given its heavy blow over the skies of England, the error of not having heavy bombers became apparent. By then, however, it was too late to develop the bombers required. Albert Kesselring, Wever's successor, believed that what Germany required were more fighters and tactical bombers. Therefore, the V2 and V3 prototypes were scrapped. The original V1 became a transport in 1938. The Dornier Do 19 had a disappointing performance: it was slow, carried only a 1,600 kg bombload, and had only medium range. In fact, the whole Ural bomber concept had already been abandoned, not only because the required range was impossible, but also because existing navigation and bombsights were not up to the task.

He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1985, and was until 2005 the chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Background Norton was educated at Queen's University in Kingston, and worked as a lawyer after his graduation. Politics He was elected as an alderman in Kingston in 1972, and became the city's deputy mayor in 1974. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Ken Keyes by 203 votes in Kingston and the Islands. He served as a backbench supporter of Bill Davis's government for the next two years, and was re-elected with an increased majority in the 1977 election. Norton was appointed to cabinet on February 3, 1977 as Minister of Community and Social Services and held this portfolio throughout the parliament that followed. Re- elected without difficulty in the 1981 provincial election, he was appointed as Minister of the Environment on April 10, 1981. As environment minister, he became the first Canadian politician to speak before a committee of the United States Senate. Norton was transferred to the Ministry of Health on July 6, 1983, and held this position until Davis resigned as Premier in early 1985. He supported Dennis Timbrell's unsuccessful bid to succeed Davis as Progressive Conservative Party leader in January 1985. When Frank Miller succeeded Davis as Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he appointed Norton as Minister of Education and Minister of Colleges and Universities. The Progressive Conservatives lost government following the 1985 provincial election, and Norton was personally defeated in the Kingston and the Islands riding, losing to Keyes by more than 2,000 votes. Cabinet positions=Later life After leaving politics in 1985, Norton became a businessman and consultant, working in the field of water purification. He attempted to return to politics in the 1990 election, running in Toronto against Liberal Attorney General Ian Scott. Norton had come out of the closet by this point, and ran as an openly gay politician in the riding of St. George‚ÄîSt. David, which includes Toronto's Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, Canada's largest gay village. While Scott was criticized for not being open about his sexuality, Norton was derided for opportunism, declaring himself openly gay only after he'd decided to run in a riding with a large gay population. Norton finished third, behind Scott and the NDP candidate. Human rights commissioner In 1992, Norton was appointed to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, and served as its president from 1992 until 1995. On July 18, 1996, Norton was appointed chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission by Premier Mike Harris. From 1996 to 2004, he pushed for higher standards of protection for people with disabilities, and jump started the move to abolish mandatory retirement in Ontario. In late 2004, he argued that racial profiling was still a serious problem in Ontario. Norton has also been active in promoting gay rights. Norton's third term as Chief Commissioner ended in November 2005. He was succeeded by former Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall. Final years After leaving the OHRC, Norton went to work as a mediator/arbitrator for a company that specializes in settling disputes between parties outside of court. Norton died on January 31, 2010 of cancer.

Early life  Pick was born in Brookneal, Virginia. He was part of the first graduating class of Rustburg High School in 1910 and attended VPI, graduating in 1914. Pick received his Regular Army commission in the United States Army Corps of Engineers on July 1, 1917. Military career During World War I, Pick served with the 23rd Engineers in France. He served in the Philippines from 1921 until 1923 and helped organize The 14th Engineer Regiment Philippine Scouts, largely composed of Filipino soldiers. He was the Corps of Engineers' District Engineer in New Orleans during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, and he helped coordinate federal relief efforts. Pick was named Missouri River Division Engineer in 1942, and with William Glenn Sloan of the Bureau of Reclamation he co-wrote the Pick-Sloan Plan for controlling the water resources of the Missouri River Basin. Pick carefully wrote his plan to avoid flooding Bismarck and Williston, North Dakota, along with Pierre and Chamberlain, South Dakota, but intentionally flooded the entire productive acreage of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, some 155,000 acres, supporting 349 families of 1,544 individuals. United States Secretary Of The Interior Julius Albert Krug ordered compensation in the form of an equal amount of acreage on lesser lands, at-cost hydroelectric power for irrigation, grazing and watering rights for tribal cattle, and $5,105,625 in payment for lost lands. Colonel Pick revoked this order and all its compensations, then denied the Three Tribes all access to the reservoir which would flood their lands, including the rights to fish, water their cattle, or cut any timber from the land to be flooded. The tribes were likewise forbidden to hire legal counsel with any compensatory money they might receive. The revised plan was approved by Krug.\\"Cadillac Desert\\" https://www.amazon.com/Cadillac-Desert- American-Disappearing-Revised/dp/0140178244 Forced to sign the Pick-Sloan Plan contract, George Gillette, leader of the Three Tribes' business council, openly wept. Colonel Pick was assigned to the China Burma India Theater of World War II in October 1943, replacing Brigadier General John C. Arrowsmith as Chief Road Engineer. He oversaw construction of the Ledo Road in British Raj India and Burma. His driving force enabled the difficult task to be completed in two and a half years. His men nicknamed the road \\"Pick's Pike\\". After his return to the United States in 1945, he served again as Missouri River Division Engineer. On March 1, 1949, President of the United States Harry S. Truman appointed him Chief of Engineers. Pick was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster. Pick City, North Dakota located by the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River was founded in 1946 and named for him.Pick City named for Lewis A. Pick http://www.epodunk.com/cgi- bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=52896 Pickstown, South Dakota located by the Fort Randall Dam was also named for him. He died in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Auburn, Alabama. Personal life Pick attended and played college football at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and graduated in 1914. He was initiated into Theta Chi Fraternity in 1924 at Auburn University, where he was a professor of military science and tactics. Pick married Alice Cary, one of the founding members of the Sigma Lambda chapter of Kappa Delta sorority at Auburn.

It has been characterised as an alternative medicine practice. Medical uses A 2015 review found no evidence that prolotherapy is safe or effective for Achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciosis, and Osgood Schlatter disease. The quality of the studies was also poor. Another 2015 review assigned a strength of recommendation level A for Achilles tendinopathy, knee osteoarthritis and level B for lateral epicondylosis, Osgood Schlatter disease, and plantar fasciosis. Level A recommendations are based on consistent and good-quality patient-oriented evidence while level B are based on inconsistent or limited- quality patient-oriented evidence. Two 2016 review articles expanded level B strength of recommendations to include low back/sacroiliac pain and rotator cuff tendinopathy. As of 2016 evidence to support the use of prolotherapy in acute pain, myofascial pain or as first-line therapy, could not be determined. Low back pain A 2007 Cochrane review of prolotherapy in adults with chronic low-back pain found unclear evidence of effect. A 2009 review concluded the same for subacute low back pain. A 2015 review found consistent evidence that it does not help in low back pain. There was tentative evidence of benefit when used with other low back pain treatments. Evidence of benefit remains tentative (level B) for dextrose prolotherapy in low back or sacroiliac pain. Tendonitis A 2009 systematic review of the efficacy in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis concluded that these therapies may benefit people with lateral epicondylitis, but the evidence was limited. A 2010 review concluded moderate evidence exists to support the use of prolotherapy injections in the management of pain in lateral epicondylitis, and that prolotherapy was no more effective than eccentric exercise in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy. A 2016 review found a trend towards benefit in 2016 for lateral epicondylitis. A 2017 review found tentative evidence in Achilles tendinopathy. In 2012, a systematic review studying various injection therapies found that prolotherapy and hyaluronic acid injection therapies were more effective than placebo when treating lateral epicondylitis. Of the studies evaluated, one of ten glucocorticoid trials, one of five trials for autologous blood injection or platelet-rich plasma, one trial of polidocanol, and one trial of prolotherapy met the criteria for low risk of bias. The authors noted that few of the reviewed trials met the criteria for low risk of bias. Knee osteoarthritis Tentative evidence of prolotherapy benefit was reported in a 2011 review. One 2017 review found evidence of benefit from low-quality studies. A 2017 review described the evidence as moderate for knee osteoarthritis. A 2016 review found benefit but there was a moderate degree of variability between trials and risk of bias. Contraindications Contraindications for patients to receive prolotherapy injections may include: * Local abscess * Bleeding disorders * Patient on anticoagulant medication * Known allergy to prolotherapy agent * Acute infections such as cellulitis * Septic arthritis Relative contraindications include: * Acute gouty arthritis * Acute fracture Side effects Patients receiving prolotherapy injections have reported generally mild side effects, including mild pain and irritation at the injection site (often within 72 hours of the injection), numbness at the injection site, or mild bleeding. Pain from prolotherapy injections is temporary and is often treated with acetaminophen or, in rare cases, opioid medications. NSAIDs are not usually recommended due to their counter action to prolotherapy-induced inflammation, but are occasionally used in patients with pain refractory to other methods of pain control. Theoretical adverse events of prolotherapy injection include lightheadedness, allergic reactions to the agent used, bruising, infection, or nerve damage. Allergic reactions to sodium morrhuate are rare. Rare cases of back pain, neck pain, spinal cord irritation, pneumothorax, and disc injury have been reported at a rate comparable to that of other spinal injection procedures. Technique Prolotherapy involves the injection of an irritant solution into a joint space, weakened ligament, or tendon insertion to relieve pain. Most commonly, hyperosmolar dextrose (a sugar) is the solution used; glycerine, lidocaine (a commonly used local anesthetic), phenol, and sodium morrhuate (a derivative of cod liver oil extract) are other commonly used agents. The injection is administered at joints or at tendons where they connect to bone. Prolotherapy treatment sessions are generally given every two to six weeks for several months in a series ranging from 3 to 6 or more treatments. Many patients receive treatment at less frequent intervals until treatments are rarely required, if at all. Terminology The term originated with George S. Hackett, MD, in 1956 in a publication titled ‚ÄúThe rehabilitation of an incompetent structure by the generation of new cellular tissue‚Äù. He applied the term prolotherapy from the words ‚Äúproli‚Äô‚Äù (Latin), meaning offspring, and ‚Äúproliferate‚Äù, meaning to produce new cells in rapid succession. Although the erroneous term \\"sclerotherapy\\" was utilized by some in the past to describe this treatment, it is now clear that prolotherapy does not cause scarring. The mechanism of prolotherapy requires further clarification. It is expected to involved a number of mechanisms. Criticism Some major medical insurance policies view prolotherapy as an investigational or experimental therapy with an inconclusive evidence base. Consequently, they currently do not provide coverage for prolotherapy procedures. Medicare reviewers in 1999 determined at that time that practitioners had not provided \\"any scientific evidence on which to base a [different] coverage decision,\\" and so retained Medicare's current coverage policy to not cover prolotherapy injections for chronic low back pain, but expressed willingness to reconsider if presented with results of \\"further studies on the benefits of prolotherapy.\\" History The concept of creating irritation or injury to stimulate healing has been recorded as early as Roman times when hot needles were poked into the shoulders of injured gladiators. Prolotherapy use began in the 1930s and was originally used in the treatment of ligamentous laxity. In the 1950s, George S. Hackett, a general surgeon in the United States, began performing injections of irritant solutions in an effort to repair joints and hernias. This practice is what would eventually evolve into modern-day prolotherapy. In 1955, Gustav Anders Hemwall became acquainted with George Hackett at an American Medical Association meeting and started practicing prolotherapy.

It is responsible for the innervation of two of the muscles that originate from the scapula, namely the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Structure The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus which is formed by the union of the ventral rami of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. After branching from the upper trunk, the nerve passes across the posterior triangle of the neck parallel to the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle and deep to the trapezius muscle. It then runs along the superior border of the scapula through the suprascapular canal, in which it enters via the suprascapular notch inferior to the superior transverse scapular ligament and enters the supraspinous fossa. It then passes beneath the supraspinatus, and curves around the lateral border of the spine of the scapula through spinogleniod notch to the infraspinous fossa. Function The suprascapular nerve is a mixed peripheral nerve containing motor and sensory components. Motor innervation *Supraspinatus muscle *Infraspinatus muscle (through the spinoglenoid notch) Sensory innervation *Acromioclavicular joint *Glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) In the supraspinous fossa it gives off two branches to the supraspinatus muscle and in the infraspinous fossa it gives off two branches to the infraspinatus muscle.

Born in Dublin, Kehoe was raised in China, Maine in the United States. In his early teens, he was first exposed to computing when he was given a Commodore 64 computer, which he used to teach himself about computing and computer networks. On leaving high-school, he moved to Widener University where he continued his computer studies, leaving in 1992.  Career  Kehoe wrote two books and a number of technology articles in the specialist press (e.g., Boardwatch Magazine) on the topic of the Internet. His first book, Zen and the Art of the Internet: A Beginner's Guide, first published by Prentice Hall in July 1992, was the first mass-published user's guide to the Internet. Zen was written while Kehoe was still at Widener; he struck a bargain with the publishers to ensure that the original edition of the book would remain free- of-charge in the internet for everyone to access. In a survey taken by PC Magazine for the twentieth anniversary of the PC, Zen and the Art of the Internet was listed as one of the \\"top sci-fi/tech non-fiction books of the past twenty years\\" (1981‚Äì2001). It also appeared on Sergey Brin's \\"Favorite Booklist\\".Sergey Brin ‚Äì My favorite books As one of the first substantial books freely available for reuse on the Internet, Zen predated and helped to inspire the free culture movement. Parts of it were reworked into other works including the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Guide to the Internet. Kehoe was a dedicated and detailed programmer, who, as a student, volunteered changes to one of the most complex pieces of free software in the world at the time, the GNU C++ Compiler and Library. His unusual skill at wrangling this code led to a full-time job as a key employee of Cygnus Support in Silicon Valley in 1992, improving, supporting and documenting this code base. By 1995 he was managing the entire GNU C++ group at Cygnus. Later in life, Kehoe volunteered doing IT support for his local school, the Dalkey School Project. This led to positions as a member of its Board of Management, and from there to being Chairperson of the school.

The original base of Internet email, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), has no such feature, so forged sender addresses in emails (a practice known as email spoofing) have been widely used in phishing, email spam, and various types of fraud. To combat this, many competing email authentication proposals have been developed, but only fairly recently have three been widely adopted ‚Äì SPF, DKIM and DMARC. The results of such validation can be used in automated email filtering, or can assist recipients when selecting an appropriate action. This article does not cover user ~~authentication~~ of email submission and retrieval. Rationale In the early 1980s, when Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was designed, it provided for no real verification of sending user or system. This was not a problem while email systems were run by trusted corporations and universities, but since the commercialization of the Internet in the early 1990s, spam, phishing, and other crimes increasingly involve email. Email authentication is a necessary first step towards identifying the origin of messages, and thereby making policies and laws more enforceable. Hinging on domain ownership is a stance emerged in the early 2000. It implies a coarse-grained authentication, given that domains appear on the right part of email addresses, after the at sign. Fine-grain authentication, at user level, can be achieved by other means, such as Pretty Good Privacy and S/MIME. At present, digital identity needs to be managed by each individual. An outstanding rationale for email authentication is the ability to automate email filtering at receiving servers. That way, spoofed messages can be rejected before they arrive to a user's Inbox. While protocols strive to devise ways to reliably block distrusted mail, security indicators can tag unauthenticated messages that still reach the Inbox. A 2018 study shows that security indicators can lower the click-through ratio by more than ten points, 48.9% to 37.2% of the users who open spoofed messages. Nature of the problem SMTP defines message transport, not the message content. Thus, it defines the mail envelope and its parameters, such as the envelope sender, but not the header (except trace information) nor the body of the message itself. STD 10 and define SMTP (the envelope), while STD 11 and define the message (header and body), formally referred to as the Internet Message Format. SMTP defines the trace information of a message, which is saved in the header using the following two fields: * Received: when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first). * Return- Path: when the delivery SMTP server makes the final delivery of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header. A mail user agent (MUA) knows the outgoing mail SMTP server from its configuration. A MTA (or a relay server) typically determines which server to connect to by looking up the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS resource record for each recipient's domain name The path depicted below can be reconstructed on the ground of the trace header fields that each host adds to the top of the header when it receives the message: Email authentication can be complicated by the presence of an intermediate relay. A and B clearly belong to the author ADMD, while D and E are part of the recipient network. What role does C play? Return-Path: Received: from D.example.org by E.example.org with SMTP; Tue, 05 Feb 2013 11:45:02 -0500 Received: from C.example.net by D.example.org with SMTP; Tue, 05 Feb 2013 11:45:02 -0500 Received: from B.example.com (b.example.com [192.0.2.1]) by C.example.net (which is me) with ESMTP id 936ADB8838C for ; Tue, 05 Feb 2013 08:44:50 -0800 (PST) Received: from A.example.com by B.example.com with SMTP; Tue, 05 Feb 2013 17:44:47 +0100 Received: from [192.0.2.27] by A.example.com with SMTP; Tue, 05 Feb 2013 17:44:42 +0100 It is important to realize that the first few lines at the top of the header are usually trusted by the recipient. In fact, those lines are written by machines in the recipient's Administrative Management Domain (ADMD), which act upon her or his explicit mandate. By contrast, the lines that prove the involvement of A and B, as well as of the purported author's MUA could be a counterfeit created by C. The \`Received:\` field shown above is an epoch-making piece of the header. The \`Return-Path:\` is written by E, the mail delivery agent (MDA), based on the message envelope. Additional trace fields, designed for email authentication, can populate the top of the header. Normally, messages sent out by an author's ADMD go directly to the destination's MX (that is B ‚Üí D in the figures). The sender's ADMD can add authentication tokens only if the message goes through its boxes. The most common cases can be schematized as follows: A schematic representation of the most common ways that an email message can get transferred from its author to its recipient. Sending from within ADMD's network (MUA 1) * The ADMD's MSA authenticates the user, either based on its IP address or some other SMTP Authentication means. Depending on the recipient address, the message can follow the normal path or pass through a mailing list or a forwarding service.For example, a recipient can instruct Gmail to forward messages to a different email address. The sender is not necessarily aware of that. B can be an outbound SMTP proxy or a smarthost.Properly configured proxies appear as part of the author ADMD. * If the local network does not block outbound port 25 connections,Some ADMDs block outbound connection to port 25 (SMTP) to avoid this. This proactive technique is described in RFC 5068. In addition, some block inbound SMTP connections from IPs listed as dialup/DSL/cable. the user can deploy some \\"direct-to-mx\\" software.In this case the author's ADMD is not involved at all. Typically, zombies and other malicious hosts behave that way. * If the MUA is badly configured, it can also use a different relay, such as an outmoded open relay, that often doesn't authenticate the user. Roaming user (MUA 2) * Most of the times it is still possible to use one's own ADMD MSA.Some ISPs block port 587, although RFC 5068 clearly says: > Access Providers MUST NOT block users from accessing the external Internet > using the SUBMISSION port 587. * Outbound connections to port 25 can be intercepted and tunneled to a transparent proxy. * A MUA can be configured to use an SMTP relay that the local network provider offers as a bonus. Disconnected user * An e-card can send mail on behalf of a customer who typed email addresses on the local keyboard; some web forms can be considered to work similarly. Section notes=Authentication methods in widespread use=SPF SPF authenticates the sender IP address. SPF allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain comes from an IP address authorized by that domain's administrators. Usually, a domain administrator will authorize the IP addresses used by their own outbound MTAs, including any proxy or smarthost. The IP address of the sending MTA is guaranteed to be valid by the Transmission Control Protocol, as it establishes the connection by checking that the remote host is reachable.IP Address forgery is possible, but generally involves a lower level of criminal behavior (breaking and entering, wiretapping, etc.), which are too risky for a typical hacker or spammer, or insecure servers not implementing RFC 1948, see also Transmission Control Protocol#Connection hijacking. The receiving mail server receives the \`HELO\` SMTP command soon after the connection is set up, and a \`Mail from:\` at the beginning of each message. Both of them can contain a domain name. The SPF verifier queries the Domain Name System (DNS) for a matching SPF record, which if it exists will specify the IP addresses authorized by that domain's administrator. The result can be \\"pass\\", \\"fail\\", or some intermediate result - and systems will generally take this into account in their anti-spam filtering. DKIM DKIM authenticates parts of the message content. DKIM checks the message content, deploying digital signatures. Rather than using digital certificates, the keys for signature-verification are distributed via the DNS. That way, a message gets associated to a domain name. A DKIM-compliant domain administrator generates one or more pairs of asymmetric keys, then hands private keys to the signing MTA, and publishes public keys on the DNS. The DNS labels are structured as \`selector._domainkey.example.com\`, where selector identifies the key pair, and \`_domainkey\` is a fixed keyword, followed by the signing domain's name so that publication occurs under the authority of that domain's ADMD. Just before injecting a message into the SMTP transport system, the signing MTA creates a digital signature that covers selected fields of the header and the body (or just its beginning). The signature should cover substantive header fields such as \`From:\`, \`To:\`, \`Date:\`, and \`Subject:\`, and then is added to the message header itself, as a trace field. Any number of relays can receive and forward the message and at every hop, the signature can be verified by retrieving the public key from the DNS. As long as intermediate relays don't modify signed parts of a message, its DKIM-signatures remain valid. DMARC DMARC allows the specification of a policy for authenticated messages. It is built on top of two existing mechanisms, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). It allows the administrative owner of a domain to publish a policy in their DNS records to specify which mechanism (DKIM, SPF or both) is employed when sending email from that domain; how to check the \`From:\` field presented to end users; how the receiver should deal with failures - and a reporting mechanism for actions performed under those policies. Other methods A range of other methods have been proposed, but are now either deprecated or have not yet gained widespread support. These have included Sender ID, Certified Server Validation, DomainKeys and those below: ADSP ADSP allowed the specification of a policy for messages signed by the author's domain. A message had to go through DKIM authentication first, then ADSP could demand a punishing treatment if the message was not signed by the author domain(s) ‚Äîas per the \`From:\` header field. ADSP was demoted to historic in November 2013. VBR VBR adds a vouch to an already authenticated identity. This method requires some globally recognized authorities that certify the reputation of domains. A sender can apply for a reference at a vouching authority. The reference, if accepted, is published on the DNS branch managed by that authority. A vouched sender should add a \`VBR-Info:\` header field to the messages it sends. It should also add a DKIM signature, or use some other authentication method, such as SPF. A receiver, after validating the sender's identity, can verify the vouch claimed in \`VBR-Info:\` by looking up the reference. iprev Applications should avoid using this method as a means of authentication. Nevertheless, it is often carried out and its results, if any, written in the \`Received:\` header field besides the TCP information required by the SMTP specification. The IP reverse, confirmed by looking up the IP address of the name just found, is just an indication that the IP was set up properly in the DNS. The reverse resolution of a range of IP addresses can be delegated to the ADMD that uses them, or can remain managed by the network provider. In the latter case, no useful identity related to the message can be obtained. DNSWL Looking up a DNSWL (DNS-based whitelist) may provide an assessment of the sender, possibly including its identification. Authentication-Results RFC 8601 defines a trace header field \`Authentication-Results:\` where a receiver can record the results of email authentication checks that it carried out. Multiple results for multiple methods can be reported in the same field, separated by semicolons and wrapped as appropriate. For example, the following field is purportedly written by \`receiver.example.org\` and reports SPF and DKIM results: Authentication-Results: receiver.example.org; spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=example.com; dkim=pass header.i=@example.com The first token after the field name, \`receiver.example.org\`, is the ID of the authentication server, a token known as an authserv-id. A receiver supporting RFC 8601 is responsible to remove (or rename) any false header claiming to belong to its domain, so that downstream filters cannot get confused. However, those filters still need to be configured, as they have to know which identities the domain may use. For a Mail User Agent (MUA), it is slightly harder to learn what identities it can trust. Since users can receive email from multiple domains‚Äîe.g., if they have multiple email addresses -‚Äî any of those domains could let \`Authentication-Results:\` fields pass through because they looked neutral. That way, a malicious sender can forge an authserv-id that the user would trust if the message arrived from a different domain. A legitimate \`Authentication-Results:\` typically appears just above a \`Received:\` field by the same domain from which the message was relayed. Additional \`Received:\` fields may appear between that and the top of the header, as the message got transferred internally between servers belonging to that same, trusted ADMD. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority maintains a registry of Email Authentication Parameters. Not all parameters need to be registered, though. For example, there can be local \\"policy\\" values designed for a site's internal use only, which correspond to local configuration and need no registration.

Biography Catherine Carey was born in about 1524, the daughter of William Carey of Aldenham in Hertfordshire, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII, and his wife Mary Boleyn, who had once been a mistress of the king. Catherine was thus Elizabeth I's maternal first cousin. Some historians believe that Catherine was an illegitimate child of Henry VIII, which would make her also Elizabeth I's paternal half-sister. Catherine was said to be a witness to the execution of her aunt, Anne Boleyn, in 1536; however claims that she had stayed overnight to entertain and distract her aunt Anne in the Tower before the latter's execution have been dismissed. Catherine went on to become Maid of Honour to both Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard, the fourth and fifth wives of Henry VIII. On 26 April 1540 she married Sir Francis Knollys. Her husband was named a Knight of the Garter in 1593, although he had already been knighted in 1547. He was also Treasurer of the Royal Household. From the time of her marriage, Catherine became known as Mistress Knollys, and from 1547 as Lady Knollys. When not in London, the couple lived at Reading in Berkshire and Rotherfield Greys in Oxfordshire, and because they were staunch Protestants, they fled to Germany during the reign of Queen Mary I. Princess Elizabeth wrote to her cousin there and Catherine was appointed Chief Lady of the Bedchamber after she became Queen Elizabeth I. For the first ten years of the reign, Lady Catherine combined the most senior post among the ladies-in-waiting with motherhood to more than a dozen children. Elizabeth never recognized Catherine as her half-sister, and it was certainly not a relationship that Catherine or Sir Francis ever openly claimed. At court, Catherine was acknowledged as the queen's favourite among her first cousins, and Elizabeth's lack of other female relatives to whom she felt close may be adequate to explain this favoured position. She died on 15 January 1569 at Hampton Court Palace, being outlived by her husband and children, and was buried the following April in St Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. There is a small commemorative plaque in the abbey, although her chief monument is at Rotherfield Greys in Oxfordshire. Catherine's epitaph reads: Katherine's mother, Mary Boleyn, was the sister of Anne Boleyn and a mistress of King Henry VIII of England. Issue Sir Francis and Lady Knollys produced a number of offspring who survived to maturity. Of the children listed, only the last, Dudley, is known to have died in infancy: *Mary Knollys (c. 1541 ‚Äì 1593). She married Edward Stalker. *Sir Henry Knollys (c. 1542 ‚Äì 1582). He was a member of parliament representing first Shoreham, Kent (1563) and then Oxfordshire. Esquire of the Body to Elizabeth I. He was married to Margaret Cave (1549‚Äì1600), daughter of Sir Ambrose Cave and Margaret Willington. Their daughter Lettice Knollys (1583‚Äì1655) married before 19 June 1602 William Paget, 4th Baron Paget. *Lettice Knollys, Countess of Essex and of Leicester (8 November 1543 ‚Äì 25 December 1634).

He was a member of Parliament. *Sir Robert Knollys (1547‚Äì1626). Member of Parliament representing Reading, Berkshire (1572‚Äì1589), Brecknockshire (1589‚Äì1604), Abingdon, Oxfordshire (1604, 1624‚Äì1625) and finally Berkshire (1626). He married Catherine Vaughan, daughter of Sir Rowland Vaughan, of Porthamel. *Richard Knollys (1548 ‚Äì 21 August 1596).

She was the mother of Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly. *Margaret Knollys. No known descendants. *Dudley Knollys (9 May 1562 ‚Äì June 1562) In literature The possibility that Catherine, and perhaps her brother Henry, were illegitimate children of Henry VIII, appears in many works of fiction, including Wendy J. Dunn's The Light in the Labyrinth' and Philippa Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl'. Catherine Carey is also a character in Gregory's The Boleyn Inheritance, where she is sent to the royal court during the time of Queens Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard, and in The Virgin's Lover, where, as the mother of the seventeen-year-old Lettice Knollys, she is among Elizabeth I's closest companions. In Henry VIII's Wives by Alison Prince, the book's narrator has a friend, Catherine \\"Kitty\\" Carey, whose father died of sweating sickness and whose mother is Mary Boleyn. In this book, Catherine was thought to be the king's daughter. Catherine is the featured subject in the novel Cor Rotto: A Novel of Catherine Carey by Adrienne Dillard and the young adult novel The Light in the Labyrinth by Wendy J. Dunn.

Its capital was Paris and its official number was 75. The Seine department was abolished in 1968 and its territory divided among four new departments.  General characteristics  From 1929 to its abolition in 1968, the department consisted of the city of Paris and 80 suburban communes surrounding Paris. It had an area of 480 km¬≤ (185 sq. miles), 22% of that area being the city of Paris, and 78% being independent suburbs. It was divided into three arrondissements: Paris, Sceaux, and Saint-Denis. For most of the Seine department's existence, its prefect also exercised direct authority over the city of Paris as well. As a result, Paris was the only commune without a mayor, and had less autonomy than the smallest village.  Formation  Seine department and its communes before the 1860 enlargement of the city of Paris The Seine department was created on March 4, 1790, as the Paris department. In 1795, it was renamed the Seine department after the Seine River flowing through it. At the first census of the French Republic in 1801, the Seine department had 631,585 inhabitants (87% of them living in the city of Paris, 13% in the suburbs) and was the second most populous department of the vast Napoleonic Empire (behind the Nord department), more populous than even the dense departments of what is now Belgium and the Netherlands. With the growth of Paris and its suburbs over the next 150 years, the population of the Seine department increased tremendously.  Dissolution  Seine department and its 81 communes as it existed between 1929 and 1968 (the city of Paris, enlarged several times between 1860 and 1929, is now considerably larger in area). Colors show how the department was split in 1968 By 1968 it contained 5,700,754 residents (45% of them living in the city of Paris, 55% in the suburbs), making it by far the most populous department of France. It was judged that the Seine department was now too large to be governed effectively, and so on January 1, 1968, it was split into four smaller departments: Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, and Val-de-Marne. The break-up of the Seine department involved the following changes: * The city (commune) of Paris was turned into a department in its own right, with no other communes inside this department. The official number 75 which was used for the Seine department was given to the new Paris department. * To the south and southeast of the city, 29 communes of the Seine department were grouped with 18 communes of the Seine-et-Oise department (which was also abolished in 1968) to form the new Val-de-Marne department. The official number 94 was assigned to this department, a number previously used for the Territoires du Sud territory in the Saharan part of French Algeria. * To the west of Paris, 27 communes of the Seine department were grouped with nine communes of Seine-et-Oise to form the new Hauts-de-Seine department. The official number 92 was assigned to this department, a number previously used for the department of Oran in French Algeria. * Finally, to the north and north-east the 24 remaining communes of the Seine department were grouped with 16 communes of the Seine-et-Oise department to form the new Seine-Saint-Denis department. The official number 93 was assigned to this department, a number previously used for the department of Constantine in French Algeria. Taken together, Hauts-de-Seine, Val-de-Marne, and Seine-Saint-Denis are known in France as the \\"small ring\\" (), as opposed to the \\"large ring\\" (') of the more distant suburbs. The small ring plus the city of Paris total , more than the former Seine department (). The M√©tropole du Grand Paris is an administrative structure created in 2016, which comprises Paris and the three departments of the ', plus seven additional communes in the '.  Population  At the 2006 census, the population of the communes that had previously comprised the Seine department was 5,496,468. The population of the department peaked in 1968 at 5,700,754. It then lost inhabitants until 1999 (with a nadir of 5,203,818 inhabitants at the 1999 census) as residents increasingly relocated to the more distant suburbs of the metropolitan area of Paris, but since 1999 it has regained some inhabitants, with a population increase of 292,650 inhabitants between 1999 and 2006. This new population growth after a long period of decline is comparable to what is observed in the central areas of other large Western metropolises such as Inner London. Of the new departments created in 1968, Paris (75) was the most populous in 2006 with 2,181,371 inhabitants. The Paris department is currently the second-most populous of France behind that of the Nord department.

Biography Son of a London merchant, he was born at Peckham. He was educated at St Paul's School and at Heidelberg University, which was famous as a school of law. Called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1848, he joined the home circuit. At this time he also wrote for the press, and supplied special reports for the Morning Chronicle. Though not eloquent in speech, he was clear, accurate and painstaking, and soon advanced in his profession, passing many more brilliant competitors. He appeared for the claimant in the Shrewsbury peerage case in 1858, when Henry Chetwynd-Talbot, 3rd Earl Talbot was declared to be entitled to the earldom of Shrewsbury as the descendant of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury; was principal agent for the United Kingdom on the mixed British and American commission for the settlement of outstanding claims, 1853‚Äì1855; and assisted in the prosecution of the Fenian prisoners at Manchester. In 1868, Hannen was appointed a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. In many cases he took a strong position of his own, notably in that of Farrar v. Close (1869), which materially affected the legal status of trade unions and was regarded by unionists as a severe blow to their interests. Hannen became judge of the Court of Probate and Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in 1872. By virtue of being the Probate Judge, he became President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division by operation of the Judicature Acts when three courts became part of the new High Court of Justice. Here he showed himself a worthy successor to Cresswell Cresswell and Lord Penzance. Many important causes came before him, but he will chiefly be remembered for the manner in which he presided over the Parnell special commission. His influence pervaded the whole proceedings, and it is understood that he personally penned a large part of the voluminous report. Hannen's last public service was in connection with the Bering Sea inquiry at Paris, when he acted as one of the British arbitrators. In January 1891 he was appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary with the dignity of a life peerage as Baron Hannen, of Burdock in the County of Sussex, but in that capacity he had few opportunities for displaying his powers, and he retired at the close of the session of 1893. Personal life He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1891. He died in London, after a prolonged illness, on 29 March 1894 and is interred in the catacombs of West Norwood Cemetery He was the elder brother of Sir Nicholas John Hannen who was Chief Justice of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan from 1891 to 1900 and concurrently British Consul General at Shanghai from 1891 to 1898.

Based on Windows 2000, it was to replace the Windows 9x series and was scheduled to be the first consumer version of Windows built on Windows NT code.  History  Neptune largely resembled Windows 2000, but some of the new features introduced, such as the firewall, were later integrated into Windows XP as the Windows Firewall. Neptune introduced a logon screen similar to that later used in Windows XP. Neptune also experimented with a new HTML and Win32-based user interface originally intended for Windows Me, called Activity Centers, for task-centered operations. Only one alpha build of Neptune, 5111, was released to testers under a non-disclosure agreement, and later made its way to various beta collectors' sites and virtual museums in 2000.The Windows that Never Was‚Ä¶ at theopenbracket.netDigiBarn Screen Shots: Windows XP Neptune Build 5111 DigiBarn Computer Museum Also, recently build 5111.6 leaked, it turned out that 5111 was the last build of Neptune that was sent to external testers. Also, it was discovered that the .1 or .6 after the build number stands for variant, not for compile. As of now, it's the only build of Neptune that made its way to the public. Build 5111 included Activity Centers, which could be installed by copying ACCORE.DLL from the installation disk to the hard drive and then running regsvr32 on ACCORE.DLL. The centers contained traces of Windows Me, then code-named Millennium, but were broken due to JavaScript errors, missing links and executables to the Game, Photo, and Music Centers. In response, some Windows enthusiasts have spent years fixing Activity Centers in build 5111 close to what Microsoft intended. In early 2000, Microsoft merged the team working on Neptune with that developing Windows Odyssey, the upgrade to Windows 2000 for business customers. The combined team worked on a new project codenamed Whistler, which was released at the end of 2001 as Windows XP. In the meantime, Microsoft released Windows Me in 2000 as their final 9x series installment. Some development builds of Whistler feature an improved version of the logon screen found in Neptune build 5111. In the early roadmap for Neptune's development (shown in the 1998‚Äì2001 United States v. Microsoft Corp. documents) there were five service packs planned. Also in these documents, it shows that Neptune was to have a successor named Triton which would be a minor update with very few user interface changes, and service packs were planned for it.

He was one of the most prominent religious leaders in the United States during the mid- to late-19th century, equaled as a pulpit orator perhaps only by Henry Ward Beecher. He also preached to crowds in England. During the 1860s and 70s, Talmage was a well- known reformer in New York City and was often involved in crusades against vice and crime. During the last years of his life, Dr. Talmage ceased preaching and devoted himself to editing, writing, and lecturing. At different periods he was editor of the Christian at Work (1873-76), New York; the Advance (1877-79), Chicago; Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine (1879-89), New York; and the Christian Herald (1890‚Äì1902), New York. Each week he was said to have preached to audiences of 8,000 people, and for many years his sermons were published regularly in more than 3,000 journals, through which he was said to reach 25,000,000 readers. Biography=Early life and education T. De Witt Talmage was born in what is now Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey and he was a member of the Reformed Church of Bound Brook (located on Main Street in South Bound Brook) and always had a close association to South Bound Brook. His ancestors included some of the earliest Dutch families who settled in New York. His father's ancestors came from Barton Stacy, England, and included founders of Southampton and East Hampton, New York. Talmage earned an undergraduate degree at the University of the City of New York (now New York University). Following his graduation in 1853, Talmage studied law for a time before deciding on entering the ministry. He studied theology at the Reformed Dutch Theological Seminary in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Four of his brothers also entered the ministry, all of them earning the title Doctor of Divinity. John Van Nest Talmage was a missionary in China, while his brothers James and Goyn Talmage became noted preachers in their own right. The fifth brother Daniel Talmage was a successful merchant. Pastoral career Talmage began preaching in Belleville, New Jersey once he graduated in 1856. He spent two years at a pastorate in Syracuse, New York before moving in 1862 to Philadelphia to become the pastor for the Second Reformed Dutch Church. (In 1867 the denomination changed its name to the Reformed Church in America.) It was here that Talmage began to establish a reputation as a gifted orator and preacher. He also served as a chaplain for the Union Army during the American Civil War.\\"Sketch of Rev. Dr. Talmage\\", New York Times, 13 Apr 1902, accessed 7 Jan 2010 Philadelphia and the Reformed Dutch Church Under his guidance, the church grew from a minor congregation to one of the most powerful and influential institutions in the city. Talmage began attracting large crowds almost from the time of his arrival. Despite his being called a \\"pulpit clown\\" and \\"mountebank\\" for his sensational sermons, Talmage attracted a growing audience. The church could no longer seat everyone who attended. Larger and wealthier congregations began to recruit him and in 1869, Talmage accepted an offer from the Central Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York. Marriage and family His first wife, Mary R. Avery, was from Brooklyn. They had two children together before she drowned in the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia on June 7, 1861. In May 1863, Talmage married Susan Whittemore of Greenpoint, New York, a neighborhood of Brooklyn. They had five children together. Upon Susan's death after 32 years of marriage, Talmage inherited most of her estate, estimated at $200,000. In January 1898, about three years after his wife died, Talmage married a third time, to 40-year-old Eleanor Collier of Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. Collier was a wealthy young widow, having been married to the late Judge Charles W. Collier. She was 27 years younger than Talmage. Brooklyn and the Central Presbyterian Church The interior of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, which burned in 1872. The text accompanying this 1873 engraving says, \\"It was one of the best buildings in the country for speaking and hearing, and was unsurpassed in its arrangements for seating a large congregation.\\" Once settled in Brooklyn, Talmage continued his dramatic services with even greater success than before. An example of one of his colorful performances was reported by a newspaper of the era: Attending Talmage's sermons became one of the most popular religious experiences of the era. In 1870, the congregation built a tabernacle solely to accommodate the large crowds who attended his church services. The building was built over an old church structure then being used as a Sunday School. The demand for his sermons helped with the raising of funds, and construction was completed in only three months. Although the tabernacle had been built to seat large crowds, seating was free of charge and hundreds were turned away every Sunday. The original tabernacle was destroyed in a fire in December 1872, then regarded as one of the worst in Brooklyn's history. Talmage and his congregation met at the Brooklyn Academy of Music until they built a newer and larger tabernacle in 1874. The building featured semicircular seating to provide an unobstructed view. Talmage continued to preach with great success for several more years. When the second tabernacle was destroyed in a fire in 1889, the congregation became convinced there was \\"a fatality about the location.\\" They built a third tabernacle at a new location at Clinton Avenue and Greene Avenue, rather than in Schemerhorn Street. After the third tabernacle was destroyed by a fire in 1894, a discouraged Talmage announced his decision to retire from holding a regular pastorate in favor of taking up an evangelist practice. Later years Talmage changed his mind to accept an offer to join the First Presbyterian Church in Washington, DC. He was the associate pastor with Dr. Byron Sunderland for four years. Although he continued to attract large crowds, they did not express the same enthusiasm as that of his Philadelphia or Brooklyn congregations. This may have been due to the more conservative attitudes of Washington residents. Increasingly interested in writing about religion, Talmage resigned on March 9, 1899. His writings, published in magazines and newspapers, were estimated to have reached millions of readers. His sermons were regularly printed in newspapers across the country. The performance aspect was lost in print, however. In addition, tastes were changing. Talmage's popularity began to wane after his resignation from the pastorate in 1899. Death In early 1902, Talmage vacationed in Mexico for six weeks to recover from influenza. By the time he returned to Washington, he had become seriously ill. His condition was not considered life-threatening until the first week of April. The immediate cause of his death on April 12 was inflammation of the brain.\\"Rev. Dr. Talmage Dead; He Passed Away at Washington from Brain Inflammation. Members of Family Were at Bedside of the Noted Divine -- Interment in Brooklyn\\", New York Times, 13 Apr 1902,, accessed 7 Jan 2010 Three days later, his body was brought to the Church of the Covenant, where a quiet funeral service was held. Those who assisted included Dr. Teunis S. Hamlin of the Church of the Covenant; Dr. Thomas Chalmers of the Eastern Presbyterian Church of Washington; St. Louis preacher and lifelong friend Dr. Samuel J. Nicols; and former classmates Dr. E.P. Terhune, Dr. Howard Suydam and Dr. James Demarest. His death received international attention, and condolence messages were sent to the family from England, Russia and other countries.

Others consider him to be one of the innumerable sons of Ramesses II. Very little is known about this pharaoh, who ruled Egypt for only three to four years. Various Egyptologists date his reign between 1202 BC-1199 BCEdward Wente and Charles Van Siclen III, \\"A Chronology of the New Kingdom,\\" 218 or 1203 BC-1200 BCMichael Rice, Who's Who in Ancient Egypt, Routledge, 1999 with others giving an accession date of 1200 BC.Vandersleyen, ƒΩ√àgypte et la Vall√©e du Nil, vol 2: 575 Amenmesse means \\"born of or fashioned by Amun\\" in Egyptian. Additionally, his nomen can be found with the epithet Heqa-waset, which means \\"Ruler of Thebes\\".K. A. Kitchen, \\"The Titularies of the Ramesside Kings as Expression of Their Ideal Kingship,\\" ASAE 71 (1987): 134-35. His royal name was Menmire Setepenre. Usurper It is likely that he was not Merneptah's intended heir. Scholars Kenneth Kitchen and J√ºrgen von Beckerath have theorized that Amenmesse usurped the throne from Seti-Merneptah, who was Merneptah's son and crown prince and who should have been next in the line of royal succession. It is unclear how this would have happened. Kitchen has written that Amenmesse may have taken advantage of a momentary weakness of Seti-Merneptah or seized power while the crown prince was away in Asia. Seti- Merneptah was most likely the same man as king Seti II, whose reign was traditionally thought to have followed upon Amenmesse's reign. The cartouches of Seti II's tomb in Upper Egypt were deliberately erased and then repainted, suggesting that Seti's rule in Upper Egypt was temporarily interrupted by agents of his half-brother. Confusion generally clouds Amenmesse's reign and its correct position within the succession sequence of the rulers of the Egyptian 19th Dynasty. However, an increasing number of Egyptologists today such as Rolf Krauss and Aidan Dodson maintain that Seti II was in fact the immediate successor of Merneptah \\"without any intervening rule by Amenmesse.\\"Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, p.212 Under this scenario, Amenmesse did not succeed Merneptah on the throne of Egypt and was rather a rival king who usurped power sometime during Years 2 to 4 of Seti II's reign in Upper Egypt and Nubia where his authority is monumentally attested.Krauss 1976, 1977, 1997; Dodson 1997 Amenmesse was documented in power at Thebes during his third and fourth year (and perhaps earlier in Nubia) where Seti II's Year 3 and Year 4 are noticeably unaccounted for.Hornung, Krauss & Warburton, op. cit., p.213 The treatment of Amenmesse as a rival king also best explains the pattern of destruction to Seti II's tomb which was initially ransacked and later restored again by Seti II's officials. This implies that the respective reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II were parallel to one another; Seti II must have initially controlled Thebes in his first and second years during which time his tomb was excavated and partly decorated. Then Seti was ousted from power in Upper Egypt by Amenmesse whose agents desecrated Seti II's tomb. Seti would finally defeat his rival Amenmesse and return to Thebes in triumph whereupon he ordered the restoration of his damaged tomb. Rolf Krauss, followed by Aidan Dodson, suggests that Amenmesse was once a Kushite Viceroy called Messuy.Krauss 1976, 1977; The Viceroy of Kush In particular, two representations of Messuy on the temple of Amida allegedly show that a royal uraeus had been added to his brows in a way consistent with other pharaohs such as Horemheb, Merenptah and some of the sons of Rameses III. An inscription at the temple of Amada also calls him \\"the king's son himself\\" but this may be merely a figure of speech to emphasize Messuy's high stature as Viceroy under Merneptah. However, Frank Yurco notes that various depictions of Messuy in several Nubian temples were never deliberately defaced by Seti II's agents compared to the damnatio memoriae meted out to all depictions of another Viceroy of Kush, Khaemtir, who had served as Amenmesse's Vizier.Frank J. Yurco, Was Amenmesse the Viceroy of Kush, Messuwy?, JARCE 34 (1997), pp.53-54 & 56 This strongly implies that Seti II held no grudge against Messuy, which would be improbable if Messuy was indeed Amenmesse.Yurco, JARCE 34, p.56 Yurco also observes that the only objects from Messuy's tomb which identified a Pharaoh all named only Merneptah, Seti II's father, which leads to the conclusion that Messuy died and was buried in his tomb at Aniba, Nubia, during Merneptah's reign, and could not be Amenmesse.Yurco, JARCE 34, pp.55-56 There has also been a suggestion that the narrative of the \\"Tale of Two Brothers\\", first attested during the reign of Seti II, may contain a veiled reference to the struggle between Amenmesse and Seti II. The records of a court case early in the reign of Seti II also throw some light on the matter. Papyrus Salt 124 records that Neferhotep, one of the two chief workmen of the Deir el-Medina necropolis, had been killed during the reign of Amenmesse (the king's name is written as Msy in the document).J.J. Janssen, Village Varia. Ten Studies on the History and Administration of Deir El-Medina, Egyptologische Uitgaven 11, Leiden 1997. pp.99-109 Neferhotep was replaced by Paneb his adopted son, against whom many crimes were alleged by Neferhotep's brother Amennakhte in a strongly-worded indictment preserved on a papyrus in the British Museum. If Amennakhte's allegations can be trusted, Paneb had stolen stone for the embellishment of his own tomb from that of Seti II in the course of its completion, besides purloining or damaging other property belonging to that monarch. Also he had allegedly tried to kill Neferhotep in spite of having been educated by him, and after the chief workman had been killed by \\"the enemy\\" had bribed the vizier Pra'emhab in order to usurp his place. Whatever the truth of these accusations, it is clear that Thebes was going through very troubled times. There are references elsewhere to a \\"war\\" that had occurred during these years, but it is obscure to what this word alludes‚Äîperhaps to no more than internal disturbances and discontent. Neferhotep had complained of the attacks upon himself to the vizier Amenmose, presumably a predecessor of Pra'emhab, whereupon Amenmose had Paneb punished. Paneb, however, then successfully brought a complaint before 'Mose'/'Msy' whereupon the latter decided to dismiss Amenmose from office. Evidently this 'Mose'/'Msy' was a person of the highest importance who most probably should be identified with king Amenmesse himself.Rolf Krauss, Untersuchungen zu K√∂nig Amenmesse: Nachtr√§ge, SAK 24 (1997), pp.161-184 Family Jar inscribed with the prenomen and nomen of Amenmesse. Faience, cylindrical. 19th Dynasty. From Cemetery C at el-Riqqeh, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London His mother is known to be Queen Takhat, but who she is exactly is a matter of interpretation complicated by inscriptions being revised by Seti II and Amenmesse. Among her titles are \\"King's Daughter\\", which would make her a daughter of Merenptah or Ramesses II or possibly a granddaughter of Ramesses. The name Takhat appears in a list of princesses dated to Year 53 of Ramesses II (Louvre 666).Dodson A.; Poisoned Legacy: The Decline and Fall of the Nineteenth Egyptian Dynasty. American University In Cairo Press (2010), p 42 n 42 If this is the same Takhat, she would be about the same age as Seti II.Dodson, A.; (2010) p 42 A monument from Karnak, carved while Amenmesse was in control of the area, includes the relief of a woman titled \\"King's Daughter\\" and \\"King's Mother\\". The monument was reinscribed from 'Mother' to 'Wife'. Another statue of Seti II (Cairo CG1198) bears Seti's name surcharged over someone else's while the names of Takhat were left alone. This suggests that Takhat was married to Seti as well as mother to Amenmesse.Dodson, A.; (2010) p 40-42 Others such as Frank Yurco believe Takhat was wife to Merenptah making the rivals Seti II and Amenmesse half-brothers.Dodson A.; (2010); n 38, n 40 Some assumes that Twosret, wife of Seti II, was his sister, And Takhat wife of Merneptah making him half-brother to Seti II. Amenmesse's wife was thought to be a woman named Baktwerel since she was buried in same tomb of Amenmesse, KV10. Three mummies were initially present in this tomb, two women and one man, it is uncertain if any of these remains belong to Amenmesse, Takhat or the later Baketwerel. The two females Baketwerel and Takhat could have been buried later.Yurco, JARCE 34 (1997), p.54 Some people believe that Seti II broke into this tomb however and had Amenmesse's remains desecrated since his mummy was never found. Six quartzite statues originally placed along the axis of the hypostyle hall in the Amun Temple at Karnak are thought to be his, although these were defaced and overwritten with the name of Seti II.Cardon 1979; Yurco 1979 One of these statues, with the inscription, \\"the Great Royal Wife Takhat\\", lends credence to the argument that a Takhat was Amenmesse's wife. Amenmesse was also responsible for restoring a shrine dating from Thutmose III that stands before a temple at El-Tod. There is confusion about the events surrounding his death. His mummy was not amongst those found in the cache at Deir el Bahri, and from the destruction of his tomb in the Valley of the Kings, it is assumed that Seti II took revenge upon his usurping half-brother. Aftermath Amenmesse was buried in a rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings which is now identified as Tomb KV10. However, almost all of its texts and scenes were either erased or usurped by Seti II's agents. No mention of Amenmesse was spared.Dodson, Aidan. \\"The Tomb of King Amenmesse: Some Observations.\\" DE 2 (1985): 7-11.Dodson, Aidan. \\"Death after Death in the Valley of the Kings.\\" In Death and Taxes in the Ancient Near East, ed. Sara E. Orel, 53-59. Lewiston, New York: Edwin Mellen Press, 1992. A number of officials associated with Amenmesse were also attacked or replaced, chief among them being the Theban High Priest of Amun, Roma called Roy, and Khaemtir, a former viceroy of Kush, who may have supported Amenmesse's usurpation.Dodson, Aidan (2004), ibid, p.176 Amenmesse's tomb was looted in antiquity. However the remains of three mummies were found in this tomb, two women and one man, it is uncertain if any of these remains belong to Amenmesse, Takhat or the later Baketwerel without further testing or whether they were later intrusions. It seems more likely, however, that Seti II had Amenmesse's remains desecrated since his mummy was never found \\"in either of the two great caches of royal mummies found in 1881 and 1901\\".Yurco, JARCE 34 (1997), p.54 Surviving inscriptions mentioning Takhat's name along with the wall inscriptions suggest she was buried in Amenmesse's tomb. Artifacts from the tombs of Seti I and Rameses VI were also found in the KV10 tomb adding to the uncertainty. After his death, Seti II also conducted a damnatio memoriae campaign against the memory of Amenmesse's Vizier, Khaemtir. Egyptologist Frank Yurco notes that Seti II's agents erased all of Khaemtir's depictions and inscriptions‚Äîeven those that were inscribed when Khaemtir served as a Viceroy in Nubia.Yurco, JARCE 34 (1997), pp.49-56. It is possible that Siptah, the Pharaoh who succeeded Seti II, was the son of Amenmesse and not of Seti II. A statue of Siptah in Munich shows the Pharaoh seated in the lap of another, clearly his father. The statue of the father, however, has been destroyed. Dodson writes: > The only ruler of the period who could have promoted such destruction was > Amenmesse, and likewise he is the only king whose offspring required such > explicit promotion. The destruction of this figure is likely to have closely > followed the fall of Bay or the death of Siptah himself, when any short- > lived rehabilitation of Amenmesse will have ended.Dodson, Aidan,(2004), The > Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt (American University of Cairo > Press), p.181 M.

Hippel was born at Gerdauen in the Kingdom of Prussia, where his father was rector of a school. He enjoyed an excellent education at home, and in his sixteenth year he entered the University of K√∂nigsberg as a student of theology. Among his instructors was the philosopher Immanuel Kant and the two became close friends.Jane Kneller, \\"Kant on Sex and Marriage\\" in Paul Guyer, ed., The Cambridge Companion to Kant and Early Modern Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006): 451 Interrupting his studies, he went, on the invitation of a friend, to St Petersburg, where he was introduced at the brilliant court of the empress Catherine II. Returning to K√∂nigsberg he became a tutor in a private family; but, falling in love with a young lady of high position, his ambition was aroused, and giving up his tutorship he devoted himself with enthusiasm to legal studies. He was successful in his profession, and in 1780 was appointed chief burgomaster in K√∂nigsberg, and in 1786 privy councillor of war and president of the town. As he rose in the world, however, his inclination for matrimony vanished, and the lady who had stimulated his ambition was forgotten. He died at K√∂nigsberg on 23 April 1796, leaving a considerable fortune. Hippel had extraordinary talents, rich in wit and fancy; but his was a character full of contrasts and contradictions. Cautiousness and ardent passion, dry pedantry and piety, morality and sensuality; simplicity and ostentation composed his nature; and, hence, his literary productions never attained artistic finish. In his Lebenslaufe nach aufsteigender Linie (1778‚Äì81) he intended to describe the lives of his father and grandfather, but he eventually confined himself to his own. It is an autobiography, in which persons well known to him are introduced, together with a mass of heterogeneous reflections on life and philosophy. Kreuz- and Querz√ºge des Ritters A bis Z (1793‚Äì94) is a satire levelled against the follies of the age ‚Äì ancestral pride and the thirst for orders, decoration and the like. Among others of his better known works are √úber die Ehe (1774) and √úber die b√ºrgerliche Verbesserung der Weiber (1792). In the latter essay, Hippel argues that the natural traits of women make them superior for many tasks, especially education. According to Jane Kneller, Hippel's \\"central claim\\" in this essay is that \\"excluding women from the public square is a travesty of justice that prevents the advancement of humanity toward genuine civilization.\\"ibid. Timothy F. Sellner has produced an English translation of this work under the title On Improving the Status of Women.Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel, On Improving the Status of Women, tr. Timothy F.

Smaller pedestals, especially if round in shape, may be called socles. An elevated pedestal or plinth which bears a statue and which is raised from the substructure supporting it (typically roofs or corniches) is sometimes called an acropodium. The term is from the Greek akros or \\"topmost\\" and pous (root pod-) or \\"foot\\". Architecture Cloister of Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi, Valencia Although in Syria, Asia Minor and Tunisia the Romans occasionally raised the columns of their temples or propylaea on square pedestals, in Rome itself they were employed only to give greater importance to isolated columns, such as those of Trajan and Antoninus, or as a podium to the columns employed decoratively in the Roman triumphal arches. The architects of the Italian Renaissance, however, conceived the idea that no order was complete without a pedestal, and as the orders were by them employed to divide up and decorate a building in several stories, the cornice of the pedestal was carried through and formed the sills of their windows, or, in open arcades, round a court, the balustrade of the arcade. They also would seem to have considered that the height of the pedestal should correspond in its proportion with that of the column or pilaster it supported; thus in the church of Saint John Lateran, where the applied order is of considerable dimensions, the pedestal is high instead of the ordinary height of 3 to . Asia Lotus throne under the Hindu goddess Parvati, 11th century, India In Asian art a lotus throne is a stylized lotus flower used as the seat or base for a figure. It is the normal pedestal for divine figures in Buddhist art and Hindu art, and often seen in Jain art. Originating in Indian art, it followed Indian religions to East Asia in particular. In imperial China, a stone tortoise called bixi was traditionally used as the pedestal for important stele, especially those associated with emperors.Stele on the Back of Stone Tortoise (an overview of the Bixi tradition) According to the 1396 version of the regulations issued by the Ming Dynasty founder, the Hongwu Emperor, the highest nobility (those of the gong and hou ranks) and the officials of the top 3 ranks were eligible for bixi-based funerary tablets, while lower-level mandarins' steles were to stand on simple rectangular pedestals..

Irlen syndrom is also sometimes referred to as asfedia or visual stress. Many mainstream professionals are skeptical of the concept. Research on Irlen syndrome has produced mixed results, finding a possible neurological basis for the condition but little or no evidence supporting the most commonly proposed treatment using tinted eyeglasses or overlays to aid reading. History In 1980, New Zealand teacher Olive Meares described the visual distortions some individuals reported when reading from white paper. In 1983, American psychologist Helen Irlen wrote a paper about the use of coloured overlays aiding the reading abilities of some people. Similar symptoms were separately described by Meares and Irlen‚Äîeach unaware of the other's work. Irlen, who was the first to systematically define the condition, named her findings \\"scotopic sensitivity\\", though in the discussions and debates over the following years, some referred to it as Meares-Irlen syndrome. The Irlen Institute, founded by Helen Irlen, describes scotopic senstivity as \\"a perceptual processing disorder\\" related to brain interpreations of colors and light.https://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/ What is Irlen Syndrome? The Irlen Institute, accessed 2020-10-08 It remains controversial whether non-Irlen-certified Meares-Irlen syndrome and the original Irlen syndrome are the same condition. Irlen syndrome, for example, seems to include a broader array of symptoms, including severe variants of the core condition. Basic testing for scotopic sensitivity was tried by optometrists, opticians, and orthoptists in UK hospitals, and by optometrists and opticians in private practice employing a technique that used the Intuitive Colorimeter, developed under Medical Research Council license. An alternative approach to correct Irlen syndrome was tried by Orthoscopics franchise in the UK, with wide colour coverage and tints manufactured by Hoyato match. Other commercial organisations have produced sets of therapeutic tints, although most have not received scientific evaluation. Studies investigating Irlens' syndrome as a treatable condition have been criticised for having a biased and subjective approach to their research.https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/irlen-syndrome/ Treatments offered by Irlens' practitioners have not been found to be effective in improving reading ability.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21930551/ Research The disorders have been studied in several institutions, including the Psychology Department at Essex University, the former Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge University in England, and in the case of Meares-Irlen syndrome, Visual Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland. the Visual Stress Unit offered non-commercial diagnostic and therapeutic services to individuals, and provided advice to the Scottish National Health Service. In Australia, Irlen syndrome was researched by Paul Whiting at the University of Sydney. Whiting set up the first Irlen Dyslexia Centre in Australia, which operated in the Children's Centre at Sydney University for more than 15 years. Irlen syndrome was also studied in Australia by Greg Robinson (1944‚Äì2008) at the University of Newcastle. He was director of the Special Education Centre at the School of Education. In the US, peer-reviewed literature on the topic suggests that much is unknown about the cause of these disorders, ranging from the 2011 study in a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, \\"Irlen Colored Overlays Do not Alleviate Reading Difficulties\\" and the 2012 study in the journal Brain Topography, \\"A Functional Neuroimaging Case Study of Meares‚ÄìIrlen Syndrome\\". The first, purely in relation to Meares-Irlen syndrome, finds that there is no evidence for one of the fundamental claims of therapeutic benefit. The second, which focused primarily on Irlen syndrome, found compelling evidence of unique brain function linked to the syndrome. Treatment The College of Optometrists (UK) has specified guidelines for optometrists who use the colorimeter system. A society for coloured lens prescribers has been established to provide a list of eye-care practitioners with expertise in the provision of coloured lenses for the treatment of visual stress. Irlen Method The Irlen Method uses coloured overlays and tinted lenses in the form of glass or contact lenses. The method is intended to reduce or eliminate perceptual processing errors; it is claimed the resultant retiming of visual signals in the brain improves the reading difficulties associated with scotopic sensitivity syndrome. Scientific repudiation Skepticism relating to scotopic sensitivity syndrome's exact pathology has evolved on several fronts: # Whether it exists as a distinct, predictably identifiable disease with a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or whether a range of symptoms from other conditions are being placed under this convenient heading; # Whether it is causally or incidentally related to dyslexia, autism, or other conditions; and # Whether existing methods of scotopic sensitivity syndrome treatment are appropriate and effective. A 2009 report by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not believe that there is conclusive scientific evidence for the use of coloured lenses (one treatment used to relieve symptoms of scotopic sensitivity syndrome) although it acknowledges anecdotal evidence in support of customized colored lenses. When discussing its scientific basis, the AAP mentions that \\"[t]he method used to select the lens or filter color has been highly variable, the color selection has also shown considerable variability, and the test-retest consistency has been poor\\" (p. 843). The association of scotopic sensitivity syndrome and dyslexia has been challenged by many authors in the optometric and ophthalmologic communities. Furthermore, many special education departments at universities challenge the validity of coloured lenses as an effective treatment for the condition as outlined by the Macquarie University Special Education Centre. Critics claim that the symptoms of those with Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome are related to already known visual perceptual and neurological disorders. According to a statement released by the American Optometric Association in 2004: As outlined by Hyatt, Stephenson and Carter (2009) Terminology Critics maintain that the term \\"scotopic sensitivity\\" is a misnomer given that the symptoms of \\"scotopic sensitivity syndrome\\" reportedly occur during photopic conditions. The term \\"scotopic sensitivity\\" seems dubious, given that scotopic vision is the vision of the eye under low light conditions and as such vision is provided by rod cells on the retina, which have little or any role in colour vision; it does not make sense that a coloured lens or coloured overlay would have any impact upon \\"scotopic sensitivity syndrome\\". However, under low light conditions, the condition may exhibit itself in a distinctive manner (i.e. perceptions/visual disturbances of light, tones, and tracers that are not otherwise visually recordable or present).

After a modest playing career within the French leagues he moved into management where he started out within the lower echelons of French football, however it was his move to Ivorian team ASEC Mimosas where he started to distinguish himself as a manager after winning several league titles with them. This would soon see him have a long association with African football and particularly their national teams, with Ivory Coast, Nigeria, South Africa and Burkina Faso being teams he managed. His international management career would continue with Japan where he had a successful spell with them by winning the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, since then he has returned to club management. Playing career Philippe Troussier started his career in football as a player and would go on to become a professional with French Division 2 football club Angoul√™me in the 1976‚Äì77 league season. The following campaign he would leave to join Red Star 93, however his stay at the club was brief and he moved to Rouen. After several seasons with Rouen, Troussier's last professional club was Stade de Reims whom he played for until 1983 after having spent his whole professional career in the second division he moved into management. Coaching career=Early coaching career Troussier soon moved into management after gaining his coaching licences and achieved his first coaching position with the French Football Federation where he was allowed to manage a National football centre football club called Institut national du football de Vichy or more commonly known as INF Vichy. The team were allowed to participate in the third tier and given exemption from promotion or relegation so the young players could develop. In his time with the team he led them into the 1983‚Äì84 league season where they came second within their group. The following season Troussier would coach CS Alen√ßon in the French fourth division and spent three seasons learning how to manage an amateur football club. He would return to his former club Red Star 93 in the 1987‚Äì88 league season as their manager. In his time with the club he would guide them to second within the group and promotion to the second tier at the end of the 1988‚Äì89 league campaign. He would, however leave the club on 30 June 1989 to join second tier club Cr√©teil on a caretaker basis until 1 October 1989 when Bernard Maligorne took on the management position. Move to Africa Troussier's first move away from France started with Ivory Coast top division football club ASEC Mimosas where in his debut season he won the league championship. This would soon be followed by two further league titles and an endearment towards the country, which saw him gain citizenship with Ivory Coast. With his impressive run at club level the Ivory Coast national football team hired him as their manager in hopes that he could replicate his success with the national team. He was assigned to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, however he failed to achieve this and soon left his post to move to South African football club Kaizer Chiefs. After a brief period with Kaizer Chiefs Troussier moved to Moroccan football club Fath Union Sport and led them to the 1995 Coupe du Tr√¥ne. His time with Fath Union Sport also saw him experience relegation to the second tier with them, however he remained with the club for several seasons until he was offered a chance to return to international management with Nigeria to replace Shaibu Amodu as they attempted to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Entering the job halfway through qualifying he led them into four games throughout the campaign as Nigeria successfully qualified, however the Nigeria Football Federation decided to relieve Troussier of his duties and ultimately let highly experienced coach Bora Milutinoviƒá lead them into the tournament due to his experience of already managing three different nations in a World Cup at that time. Troussier quickly found a new job managing another African nation in Burkina Faso where he was assigned to coach them in the 1998 African Cup of Nations, which they were hosting. In a short period of time he made the team genuine title contenders until they were beaten by Egypt 2-0 in the semi- finals. Burkina Faso ultimately finished fourth after losing to DR Congo in the third-place match, nevertheless the result meant it was their highest ever finish at the time. His stint at Burkina Faso would impress the South African Football Association, who offered him the job of leading South Africa to the 1998 World Cup. He would replace Jomo Sono, who, despite leading South Africa to the final of the 1998 African Cup of Nations as a caretaker manager, was not given a permanent position. Troussier, however was not able to galvanize the squad as he had done with Burkina Faso and the team were knocked-out in the group stages. After the tournament he would leave Africa, but before he did he was nicknamed as the \\"White Witch Doctor\\" for his overall successful legacy towards African football. Move to Asia In 1998 Troussier replaced Takeshi Okada to coach Japan and was assigned to improve upon the nation's previous results at the 1998 FIFA World Cup as they prepared to co-host the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Having to use a translator, he struggled to get what he wanted from the players as they were knocked out of the 1999 Copa Am√©rica within the group stages. The disappointing performance within the tournament gathered a negative reaction from the Japanese media, which saw Troussier go for a more youthful approach and take the reins of the under-20 team as they participated in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. The Japanese team had a successful campaign and were runners-up within the tournament. He continued to take control of Japan's youth teams when he managed the under-23 team in the 2000 Summer Olympics and led them to the quarter-finals. The majority of that team would then go on to be called up to the 2000 AFC Asian Cup and win the tournament. With this success, Troussier went into the 2002 FIFA World Cup with confidence and led Japan to the final 16, making it at the time Japan's best ever finish within the competition. In July 2003 Troussier was appointed as the new manager of Qatar and was assigned with qualification for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup with the hope of repeating the success he previously had with Japan. Initially his reign went smoothly with a successful qualification campaign and a team selection that once again employed a youthful approach as well as several naturalized players. The tournament itself turned out to be a disappointment that saw Qatar finish bottom of their group. Along with his disappointing start to the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Troussier was ultimately fired from his position. Return to France and Africa On 27 November 2004, Troussier returned to France to manage Ligue 1 team Olympique de Marseille. His time with the club would see him have a tumultuous relationship with the senior players, particularly French international player Bixente Lizarazu. A fifth-place finish at the end of the season saw Troussier replaced by Jean Fernandez. He returned to Africa and became the head coach of the Moroccan national team, having taken over after the country's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. However, he was fired after two months in charge by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation due to a difference in opinion. Return to Asia In March 2008, he returned to Japan to manage FC Ry≈´ky≈´ a Japanese third-division team, before he was replaced by compatriot Jean Paul Rabier. Troussier would stay away from football and converted to Islam On 22 February 2010, he returned to management with Chinese Super League side Shenzhen Ruby F.C. on a three-year contract. He would once again enforce a youthful team selection; however this would relegate the team, making them the first top-tier champions to be relegated since the foundation of professional football in China. He would remain with the club whilst they were in the second tier; however after mounting criticism he would alienate himself from the fans after the fourth-round league match versus Chongqing F.C. when in a local TV interview Troussier fired out against criticism and doubt from fans and urged them \\"not to come to the game or him\\". Shenzhen Ruby won the match, however former players who were forced to leave by Troussier in his efforts to force youth into the team Li Fei and Chris Killen scored for Chongqing F.C. in their first return to Shenzhen and physical confrontations took place after the match among fans, staffs, players and even Troussier himself. He further alienated his relationships with the squad and staff on 25 August after a defeat to Chengdu Tiancheng F.C. saw the club's hopes of promotion vanish and he provided a statement that he would take leave back to France on a \\"regular holiday under his contract\\". The club's supporters would believe the board sent him on leave hoping that the indignity would see him resign rather than compensating him the 1 million euros per year in his contract. He returned from his holiday and managed the club throughout the 2013 Chinese league season, where he was unable to gain promotion. Troussier is widely believed to be the first-choice replacement as coach of the Malaysia national football team after the Football Association of Malaysia didn't renew former coach K. Rajagopal's contract after it expired in December 2013. He was said to have agreed a MYR5 million annual salary with the FAM. However, the deal fell through when he faced some disagreements with the Football Association of Malaysia. On 30 June 2014, Troussier became manager of CS Sfaxien of Tunisia. On 28 September 2014, Troussier quit CS Sfaxien. In April 2018 he was one of 77 applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job. Later in 2018 he became a strategic adviser and then officially a technical director of PVF, a Vietnamese football academy. In 2019, referred by PVF, Philippe Troussier became the head coach of Vietnam U19 National Team.

In Sweden designs for a two-person, four-wheeled velomobile called the Fantom were sold as blueprints in the 1930s and 40s. Many thousands of sets of DIY instructions were sold, but very few vehicles were actually built. The body was made of plywood. The oil shock of 1978-9 inspired Carl Georg Rasmussen, a Danish engineer and pilot, to design and build the first practical velomobile. A tadpole recumbent tricycle with full glass-fiber fairing, it was dubbed the Leitra (Danish: Let individuel transport, meaning \\"light individual transport\\"). About the company Carl Georg Rasmussen initially formed the company as a limited partnership with ten investors ‚Äì mostly friends and intending customers. He also received some of his early funding from other customers who, while not wishing to risk a direct investment in the company, were nevertheless prepared to make an advance purchase. This enabled Rasmussen to start work on an initial run of twelve Leitras in 1983. About the Leitra velomobile The Leitra is a three- wheeled, non-motorized vehicle designed for commuting, shopping, distribution of light goods, recreation, and touring. The international term for this type of vehicle is a velomobile. It is fast, but not designed specifically for racing. The primary considerations for the design of such a tricycle with full fairing were: * Safety in normal traffic, * Cycling comfort in cold, windy, and wet weather, * Sufficient payload for touring and shopping, * Reliability in daily operation ‚Äì including in wintertime. For fair weather use the fairing can be removed in moments by means of a toe-activated snap coupling. The two luggage compartments can also be removed quickly without tools. The Leitra was approved by the Danish authorities for general use after systematic tests in 1982. Approval was given on the condition that the cyclist must be able to give unhindered arm signals for turning and stopping. This explains the characteristic open design of the fairing with soft fabric on both sides. The design of the built-in rearview mirror on top of the fairing was also approved by the Danish authorities. The first Leitra was built in 1980. Since 1982 it has successfully participated in many tough rallies in Europe, such as Trondheim - Oslo (1983) and Paris-Brest-Paris (1987). It has proven to be a real practical vehicle for long-distance touring. Several million kilometers have been covered without personal injuries. As of 2015, approximately 260 Leitras have been produced. Production is on an order-by-order basis, as each Leitra is built for a specific customer, and has currently slowed to about one Leitra per year, but renovation and repairs continue on velomobiles that make their way back to the company's workshop in Herlev ‚Äì a suburb of Copenhagen. In 2013 development began of the Leitra Wildcat ‚Äì a detachable fairing designed to fit most any kind of recumbent trike. Currently the Steintrike Nomad, Terratrike, TW Bent, and Leitra Sport have all been adapted to use the Wildcat fairing.

Wink spent much of his career teaching at Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City. He was well known for his advocacy of and work related to nonviolent resistance and his seminal works on \\"The Powers\\", Naming the Powers (1984), Unmasking the Powers (1986), Engaging the Powers (1992), When the Powers Fall (1998), and The Powers that Be (1999). He is also known for coining the phrase \\"the myth of redemptive violence\\". Career Wink earned a B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1956, majoring in history, and minoring in philosophy and English. He completed his Master of Divinity in 1959 and his Ph.D. in 1963, both from Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Ordained as a Methodist minister in 1961, he served as Pastor of First United Methodist Church, in Hitchcock, Texas from 1962‚Äì67. He then returned to Union Seminary as an Assistant Professor of New Testament, then Associate Professor of New Testament, from 1967‚Äì1976. After being denied tenure at Union, he began teaching at Auburn Theological Seminary, remaining there until his death, when he was Professor Emeritus. His faculty discipline was Biblical interpretation. In 1989‚Äì1990, he was a Peace Fellow at the United States Institute of Peace.Dr. Wink's Curriculum Vitae He was known for his work on power structures, his commentary on current political and cultural matters, and his contributions to the discourse on homosexuality and religion, pacifism, the relationship between psychology and biblical studies, and research related to the historical Jesus. Neal Stephenson likens some of Wink's ideas to \\"an epidemiology of power disorders\\", a phenomenology of oppression. Author Philip Yancey references Wink frequently in his work. One of Wink's major avenues for teaching has been his leadership of workshops to church and other groups, based on his method of Bible study (The Bible in Human Transformation, 1973), and incorporating meditation, artwork, and movement. These workshops were often presented jointly with his wife, June Keener-Wink, a dancer and potter. One of Walter Wink's sons‚ÄîChris Wink‚Äîis known as a founding member of the Blue Man Group.

The group performs early English polyphony, works of the Renaissance, Baroque and early Classical music, and a diversity of 20th-century music. The Sixteen are \\"The Voices of Classic FM\\", TV media partner with Sky Arts and associate artists of the Southbank Centre in London and Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. The group promotes an annual series at the Queen Elizabeth Hall as well as the Choral Pilgrimage, a tour of Britain's finest cathedrals: bringing music back to the buildings for which it was written. The BBC television series Sacred Music was produced in collaboration with The Sixteen; between 2008 and 2015, two full series aired, along with numerous specials. Tours The Sixteen tour throughout Europe, Japan, Australia and the Americas and have given regular performances at major concert halls and festivals worldwide, including the Barbican Centre in London, the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Sydney Opera House, Tokyo Opera City and the Vienna Musikverein. They have also performed at the BBC Proms and the festivals of Granada, Lucerne, Istanbul, Prague and Salzburg. In addition, the Sixteen's period orchestra have taken part in semi-staged performances of Purcell's Fairy Queen in Tel Aviv and London, a fully staged production of Purcell's King Arthur in Lisbon's Centro Cultural de Bel√©m , followed by new productions of Claudio Monteverdi's Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria at Lisbon Opera House and The Coronation of Poppea at the English National Opera. Education The Sixteen have an education programme and recent projects include a series of school matin√©es for hundreds of primary school children in Bury St Edmunds, Liverpool and Southwell under the national Sing Up initiative. The Sixteen also have close ties with the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity College of Music, offering opportunities for young people about to embark on careers as professional musicians. Discography Over 90 recordings reflect the Sixteen's range of work, spanning the music of 500 years and winning many awards including the Grand Prix du Disque, numerous Schallplattenkritik, a Gramophone Award (Early Music, 1992), the Classical Brit Award in 2005 for Renaissance and IKON, which was nominated for a Grammy Award and two Classical Brits. These latter two discs were recorded as part of the group's contract with Universal Classics and Jazz. Since 2001, the Sixteen have had their own record label, CORO, which has released over 90 titles to date. Recent recordings include Handel's oratorio Messiah, with soloists Carolyn Sampson, Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Mark Padmore and Christopher Purves (winner of a MIDEM Classical Award 2009), Dixit Dominus featuring Handel's eponymous early work and Steffani's Stabat Mater, Ceremony and Devotion: Music for the Tudors, which accompanied the 2010 Choral Pilgrimage and Hail, Mother of the Redeemer, which accompanied the 2011 Choral Pilgrimage.

Dr. Jarson D. Kunha, Marathi version Ed. By Gajanan shastri Gaytonde, published by Shree Katyani Publication, Mumbai The Saraswats are a sub-group of Hindu Brahmins of India who trace their ancestry to the banks of the Rigvedic Sarasvati River. The Saraswat Brahmins are mentioned as one of the five Pancha Gauda Brahmin communities. History In Kalhana's Rajatarangini (12th century CE), the Saraswats are mentioned as one of the five Pancha Gauda Brahmin communities residing to the north of the Vindhyas. They were spread over a wide area in northern part of the Indian subcontinent. One group lived in coastal Sindh and Gujarat, this group migrated to Bombay State after the partition of India in 1947. One group was found in pre- partition Punjab and Kashmir most of these migrated away from Pakistan after 1947. Another branch known as Dakshinatraya Saraswat Brahmin are now found along the western coast of India.Dakshinatya Sarasvats: Tale of an Enterprising Community,page 6 Culture=Social statusKashmir= According to M. K. Kaw (2001), Kashmiri Pandits, a part of the larger Saraswat Brahmin community hold the highest social status in Kashmir. =Maharashtra= Historically, in Maharashtra, Saraswats had served as low and medium level administrators under the Deccan Sultanates for generations. In 18th century, the quasi-independent Shinde and the Holkar rulers of Malwa recruited Saraswats to fill their respective administrative positions.This made them wealthy holder of rights both in Maharashtra and Malwa during the eighteenth century. During the same period in Peshwa ruled areas, there was a continuation of filling of small number of administration post by the Saraswats. In Maharashtra, till the rise of Peshwas, the Chitpavans held low social status and other Brahmins refused to dine with them however during the rule of the Chitpavan Brahmin Peshwas in the 18th century, Saraswat Brahmins was one of the communities against whom the Chitpavans conducted a social war which led to Gramanya (inter-caste dispute). After the liberation of Goa from the Portuguese colonial rule in 1961, many Goan Saraswats opposed merger of Goa into Maharashtra. DietKonkan and Goa= In Goa, the Saraswat Brahmins have fish as a part of their diet. The Saraswat Brahmins of the Konkan region also eat fish. =Karnataka= In coastal districts of Karnataka, Gaud Saraswats are the Madhva Vaishnavite Saraswat Brahmins, followers of Madhvacharya, while the Saraswats are Smarthas, followers of Shankaracharya. They are largely vegetarians. =Others= Saraswat Brahmins from northern and eastern India also include fish in their diet. Marriages The Saraswat Brahmins are divided into various territorial endogamous groups, who at one time did not intermarry. According to the sociologist, Gopa Sabharwal (2006), marriages between Saraswat and non- Saraswat Brahmins are on the increase though they were unheard of before, mainly because the Saraswats eat fish and occasionally meat, while all other Brahmins in that region are vegetarians.

The city is the chief seaport of the country, situated northeast of its capital and biggest city Antananarivo. According to the 2014 official estimate, Toamasina had a population of 300,813.Population data, Madagascar - Aires urbaines (2014), populationdata.net, accessed on June 3, 2019 The city is served by Toamasina Airport.  History  Downtown in 1912 Under French rule, Toamasina was the seat of several foreign consuls, as well as of numerous French officials, and was the chief port for the capital and the interior. Imports consisted principally of piece-goods, farinaceous foods, and iron and steel goods; main exports were gold dust, raffia, hides, caoutchouc (rubber) and live animals. Communication with Europe was maintained by steamers of the Messageries Maritimes and the Havraise companies, and also with Mauritius, and thence to Sri Lanka, by the British Union-Castle Line. During the colonial period, owing to the character of the soil and the formerly crowded native population, the town was often plagued by epidemics: the plague broke out in 1898, and again in 1900; but since the draining of the neighboring marshes, there was an improvement. After 1895, the native population was removed from the town and settled in a new village to the north-west.  Geography  Toamasina owes its importance to the existence of a coral reef which forms a spacious harbour, entered by two openings. The city center is built on a sandy peninsula which projects at right angles from the general coastline. Climate Toamasina features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification. While Toamasina has no true dry season month where less than of precipitation (on average) falls, the seaport has noticeably wetter and drier periods of the year. September‚ÄìNovember is the driest period of the year, while February‚ÄìApril is the wettest time of the year. Average temperatures are relatively constant throughout the course of the year, though it is slightly cooler in the months of July and August, where average highs are around , and warmer in the months of January and February, where high temperatures on average are . Toamasina averages roughly of precipitation annually.  Transport  The port of Toamasina. Lighthouse of Ile aux Prunes The town is the railhead for the line to the capital. Pousse-pousse (bicycle rickshaws), tuk-tuk (motorized rickshaws), and taxis are available throughout Toamasina to get around the city. Toamasina is the northern end of the Canal des Pangalanes. The port of Toamasina serves as Madagascar's most important gateway to the Indian Ocean and to the world. The city is served by Ambalamanasy Airport, which has limited domestic and international service. The city is the country's main seaport for international shipping.  Education  The University of Toamasina was founded in 1977. A regional centre for distance education (CRTE) of the Centre National de T√©l√©-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is also located in Toamasina. Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Tamatave, a French international school, is in Toamasina.  Places of worship  Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Malagasy Lutheran Church (Lutheran World Federation), Assemblies of God, Association of Bible Baptist Churches in Madagascar (Baptist World Alliance), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toamasina (Catholic Church seated in the Cathedral of St. Joseph) and Iglesia Ni Cristo.J.

The term reverberation is used here in a generic sense of rebounding or reflecting, not in the acoustic sense of echoing.  Operation  Reverberatory furnace Chemistry determines the optimum relationship between the fuel and the material, among other variables. The reverberatory furnace can be contrasted on the one hand with the blast furnace, in which fuel and material are mixed in a single chamber, and, on the other hand, with crucible, muffling, or retort furnaces, in which the subject material is isolated from the fuel and all of the products of combustion including gases and flying ash. There are, however, a great many furnace designs, and the terminology of metallurgy has not been very consistently defined, so it is difficult to categorically contradict other views. Applications and comparison with blast furnace The applications of these devices fall into two general categories, metallurgical melting furnaces, and lower temperature processing furnaces typically used for metallic ores and other minerals. A reverberatory furnace is at a disadvantage from the standpoint of efficiency compared to a blast furnace due to the spatial separation of the burning fuel and the subject material, and it is necessary to effectively utilize both reflected radiant heat and direct contact with the exhaust gases (convection) to maximize heat transfer. Historically these furnaces have used solid fuel, and bituminous coal has proven to be the best choice. The brightly visible flames (due to the substantial volatile component) give more radiant heat transfer than anthracite coal or charcoal. Contact with the products of combustion, which may add undesirable elements to the subject material, is used to advantage in some processes. Control of the fuel/air balance can alter the exhaust gas chemistry toward either an oxidizing or a reducing mixture, and thus alter the chemistry of the material being processed. For example, cast iron can be puddled in an oxidizing atmosphere to convert it to the lower-carbon mild steel or bar iron. The Siemens-Martin oven in open hearth steelmaking is also a reverberatory furnace. Reverberatory furnaces (in this context, usually called air furnaces) were formerly also used for melting brass, bronze, and pig iron for foundry work. They were also, for the first 75 years of the 20th century, the dominant smelting furnace used in copper production, treating either roasted calcine or raw copper sulfide concentrate.W G Davenport, \\"Copper extraction from the 60s into the 21st century,\\" in: Proceedings of the Copper 99‚ÄìCobre 99 International Conference.

They were first applied to smelting metals in the late 17th century. Sir Clement Clerke and his son Talbot built cupolas or reverberatory furnaces in the Avon Gorge below Bristol in about 1678. In 1687, while obstructed from smelting lead (by litigation), they moved on to copper. In the following decades, reverberatory furnaces were widely adopted for smelting these metals and also tin. They had the advantage over older methods that the fuel was mineral coal, not charcoal or 'white coal' (chopped dried wood). In the 1690s, they (or associates) applied the reverberatory furnace (in this case known as an air furnace) to melting pig iron for foundry purposes. This was used at Coalbrookdale and various other places, but became obsolete at the end of the 18th century with the introduction of the foundry cupola, which was a kind of small blast furnace, and a quite different species from the reverberatory furnace. The puddling furnace, introduced by Henry Cort in the 1780s to replace the older finery process, was also a variety of reverberatory furnace.  Aluminium melting  Today, reverberatory furnaces are widely used to melt secondary aluminium scrap for eventual use by die- casting industries. The simplest reverberatory furnace is nothing more than a steel box lined with alumina refractory brick with a flue at one end and a vertically lifting door at the other. Conventional oil or gas burners are placed usually on either side of the furnace to heat the brick and the eventual bath of molten metal is then poured into a casting machine to produce ingots.

A committee was appointed to oversee the arrangements. Six people were chosen as its moderators including the judge of the Chief Court of Punjab and the former governor of Jammu. The committee invited the learned representatives of the Hindu, Christian and Muslim faiths to set forth the excellences of their respective faiths. The main objective of such a conference was so that the learned divines of each of these faiths were given the opportunity to convince others of the truth of their religion in the context of a few published themes and so that the listeners may assess each speech and accept the truth from wherever it was to be found. Each speaker was required to address the five themes set by the moderators and to confine his discourse to the holy scriptures of their religions. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of Hinduism, Freethought, the Theosophical Society, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism as well as various scholars, barristers, lawyers, professor, doctors and extra assistants, who numbered between 7 and 8 thousand. The speech representing Islam was the essay written by Gulam Ahmad and though he could not attend himself due to poor health, it was read out by his disciple Mawlwi Abdul Karim. It could not be read out within the set time allotted for it; therefore the conference was extended to an extra day. The Report of the Conference of Great Religions stated: > The essay was delivered in four hours and from start to finish it was most > interesting and well appreciated.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 13 Dec. 2012 Louis had been made Count Palatine of Saxony as a reward for his services to the emperor, but transferred the dignity to Hermann. He strengthened his authority over the County Palatine by marrying Sophia,Jonathan R. Lyon, \\"Princely Brothers and Sisters: The Sibling Bond in German Politics, 1100-1250\\", Cornell Press, 243 daughter of Lutgard of Stade and Frederick II of Sommerschenburg, a former Count Palatine. Louis III died in 1190. Emperor Henry VI attempted to seize Thuringia as a vacant fief of the Holy Roman Empire, but Hermann frustrated the plan and established himself as the landgrave. Having joined a league against the emperor, he was accused, probably wrongly, of an attempt to murder him. Henry VI was not only successful in detaching Hermann from the hostile combination, but gained his support for the scheme to unite Sicily with the Empire. Hermann joined the German Crusade of 1197 but returned on news of Henry VI's death. In the wars between the rival kings, Philip of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick (1198-1208), Hermann's support was purchased by the emperor's brother, Duke Philip of Swabia, but as soon as Philip's cause appeared to be weakening he transferred his allegiance to Otto of Brunswick, the later Emperor Otto IV. Philip accordingly invaded Thuringia in 1204 and compelled Hermann to come to terms by which he surrendered the lands he had obtained in 1198. After the death of Philip and the recognition of Otto, Hermann was among the princes who assembled at Nuremberg in 1211 and invited Frederick of Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily, (afterwards Emperor Frederick II), to come to Germany and assume the crown. In consequence of this step the Saxons attacked Thuringia, but the landgrave was saved by Frederick's arrival in Germany in 1212. After the death of his first wife in 1195, Hermann married Sophia, daughter of Otto of Wittelsbach.Jonathan R.

His oldest son Louis, who succeeded him, was the husband of St. Elizabeth of Hungary. Hermann died at Gotha in 1217 and was buried at Reinhardsbrunn. Hermann was fond of the society of men of letters, and Walther von der Vogelweide and other Minnesingers were welcomed to his castle, the Wartburg.

This sequence is consistent: the estimators are getting more and more concentrated near the true value Œ∏0; at the same time, these estimators are biased. The limiting distribution of the sequence is a degenerate random variable which equals Œ∏0 with probability 1. In statistics, a consistent estimator or asymptotically consistent estimator is an estimator‚Äîa rule for computing estimates of a parameter Œ∏0‚Äîhaving the property that as the number of data points used increases indefinitely, the resulting sequence of estimates converges in probability to Œ∏0. This means that the distributions of the estimates become more and more concentrated near the true value of the parameter being estimated, so that the probability of the estimator being arbitrarily close to Œ∏0 converges to one. In practice one constructs an estimator as a function of an available sample of size n, and then imagines being able to keep collecting data and expanding the sample ad infinitum. In this way one would obtain a sequence of estimates indexed by n, and consistency is a property of what occurs as the sample size ‚Äúgrows to infinity‚Äù. If the sequence of estimates can be mathematically shown to converge in probability to the true value Œ∏0, it is called a consistent estimator; otherwise the estimator is said to be inconsistent. Consistency as defined here is sometimes referred to as weak consistency. When we replace convergence in probability with almost sure convergence, then the estimator is said to be strongly consistent. Consistency is related to bias; see bias versus consistency.  Definition  Formally speaking, an estimator Tn of parameter Œ∏ is said to be consistent, if it converges in probability to the true value of the parameter: : \\\\underset{n\\\\to\\\\infty}{\\\\operatorname{plim}}\\\\;T_n = \\\\theta. i.e. if, for all Œµ > 0 : \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\Pr\\\\big(T_n-\\\\theta > \\\\varepsilon\\\\big) = 0. A more rigorous definition takes into account the fact that Œ∏ is actually unknown, and thus the convergence in probability must take place for every possible value of this parameter. Suppose } is a family of distributions (the parametric model), and } is an infinite sample from the distribution pŒ∏. Let { Tn(XŒ∏) } be a sequence of estimators for some parameter g(Œ∏). Usually Tn will be based on the first n observations of a sample. Then this sequence {Tn} is said to be (weakly) consistent if : \\\\underset{n\\\\to\\\\infty}{\\\\operatorname{plim}}\\\\;T_n(X^{\\\\theta}) = g(\\\\theta),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{for all}\\\\ \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta. This definition uses g(Œ∏) instead of simply Œ∏, because often one is interested in estimating a certain function or a sub- vector of the underlying parameter. In the next example we estimate the location parameter of the model, but not the scale:  Examples = Sample mean of a normal random variable  Suppose one has a sequence of observations {X1, X2, ...} from a normal N(Œº, œÉ2) distribution. To estimate Œº based on the first n observations, one can use the sample mean: Tn = (X1 \\\\+ ... + Xn)/n. This defines a sequence of estimators, indexed by the sample size n. From the properties of the normal distribution, we know the sampling distribution of this statistic: Tn is itself normally distributed, with mean Œº and variance œÉ2/n. Equivalently, \\\\scriptstyle (T_n-\\\\mu)/(\\\\sigma/\\\\sqrt{n}) has a standard normal distribution: : \\\\Pr!\\\\left[\\\\,T_n-\\\\mu\\\\geq\\\\varepsilon\\\\,\\\\right] = \\\\Pr!\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\,\\\\bigT_n-\\\\mu\\\\big}{\\\\sigma} \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{n}\\\\varepsilon/\\\\sigma \\\\right] = 2\\\\left(1-\\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\,\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\to 0 as n tends to infinity, for any fixed . Therefore, the sequence Tn of sample means is consistent for the population mean Œº (recalling that \\\\Phi is the cumulative distribution of the normal distribution).  Establishing consistency  The notion of asymptotic consistency is very close, almost synonymous to the notion of convergence in probability. As such, any theorem, lemma, or property which establishes convergence in probability may be used to prove the consistency. Many such tools exist: * In order to demonstrate consistency directly from the definition one can use the inequality :: \\\\Pr!\\\\big[h(T_n-\\\\theta)\\\\geq\\\\varepsilon\\\\big] \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\big[h(T_n-\\\\theta)\\\\big]}{h(\\\\varepsilon)}, the most common choice for function h being either the absolute value (in which case it is known as Markov inequality), or the quadratic function (respectively Chebyshev's inequality). * Another useful result is the continuous mapping theorem: if Tn is consistent for Œ∏ and g(¬∑) is a real-valued function continuous at point Œ∏, then g(Tn) will be consistent for g(Œ∏): :: T_n\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{p}\\\\ \\\\theta\\\\ \\\\quad\\\\Rightarrow\\\\quad g(T_n)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{p}\\\\ g(\\\\theta) * Slutsky‚Äôs theorem can be used to combine several different estimators, or an estimator with a non-random convergent sequence. If Tn ‚ÜídŒ±, and Sn ‚ÜípŒ≤, then :: \\\\begin{align} & T_n + S_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\alpha+\\\\beta, \\\\ & T_n S_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\alpha \\\\beta, \\\\ & T_n / S_n \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\alpha/\\\\beta, \\\\text{ provided that }\\\\beta eq0 \\\\end{align} * If estimator Tn is given by an explicit formula, then most likely the formula will employ sums of random variables, and then the law of large numbers can be used: for a sequence {Xn} of random variables and under suitable conditions, :: \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n g(X_i) \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{p}\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,g(X)\\\\,] * If estimator Tn is defined implicitly, for example as a value that maximizes certain objective function (see extremum estimator), then a more complicated argument involving stochastic equicontinuity has to be used.  Bias versus consistency = Unbiased but not consistent  An estimator can be unbiased but not consistent. For example, for an iid sample {x,..., x} one can use T(X) = x as the estimator of the mean E[x]. Note that here the sampling distribution of T is the same as the underlying distribution (for any n, as it ignores all points but the last), so E[T(X)] = E[x] and it is unbiased, but it does not converge to any value. However, if a sequence of estimators is unbiased and converges to a value, then it is consistent, as it must converge to the correct value.  Biased but consistent  Alternatively, an estimator can be biased but consistent. For example, if the mean is estimated by {1 \\\\over n} \\\\sum x_i + {1 \\\\over n} it is biased, but as n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, it approaches the correct value, and so it is consistent. Important examples include the sample variance and sample standard deviation. Without Bessel's correction (that is, when using the sample size n instead of the degrees of freedom n-1), these are both negatively biased but consistent estimators. With the correction, the corrected sample variance is unbiased, while the corrected sample standard deviation is still biased, but less so, and both are still consistent: the correction factor converges to 1 as sample size grows. Here is another example. Let T_n be a sequence of estimators for \\\\theta. :\\\\Pr(T_n) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 - 1/n, & \\\\mbox{if }\\\\, T_n = \\\\theta \\\\ 1/n, & \\\\mbox{if }\\\\, T_n = n\\\\delta + \\\\theta \\\\end{cases} We can see that T_n \\\\xrightarrow{p} \\\\theta, \\\\operatorname{E}[T_n] = \\\\theta + \\\\delta , and the bias does not converge to zero.

It lies in the back-arc region of the Andean Volcanic Belt, and was formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Pay√∫n Matr√∫, along with the Llancanelo, Nevado and Salado Basin volcanic fields, form the Payenia province. It has been proposed as a World Heritage Site since 2011. Pay√∫n Matr√∫ developed on sediment and volcanic rocks ageing from the Mesoproterozoic to the Tertiary periods. It consists of a large shield volcano capped by a caldera, formed during a major eruption between 168,000 and 82,000 years ago, a high compound volcano (known as Payun or Payun Liso), and two groups of scoria cones and lava flows. The Pleistocene Pampas Onduladas lava flow reaches a length of and is the world's longest Quaternary lava flow. Volcanic activity at Pay√∫n Matr√∫ commenced during the Plio-Pleistocene period, and generated lava fields such as Pampas Onduladas, the Pay√∫n Matr√∫ shield volcano and the Payun volcano. After the formation of the caldera, volcanism continued both within the caldera as lava domes and flows, and outside of it with the formation of scoria cones and lava flows east and especially west of Pay√∫n Matr√∫. Volcanic activity continued into the Holocene until about 515 years ago; oral tradition of local inhabitants contains references to earlier eruptions.  Name  In local dialect, the term Pay√∫n or Paium means \\"bearded\\", while the term Matru translates as \\"goat\\". The field is sometimes also known as Payenia.  Geography and geomorphology = Regional  Pay√∫n Matr√∫ lies in the Malarg√ºe Department of the Mendoza Province, in Argentina. The area is inhospitable due to the lack of usable water and high elevation. Nevertheless, there are many paved roads such as National Route 40 which passes west of the field, and National Route 186 which runs around its northern and eastern parts. The volcano is within the Reserva Provincial La Payunia. Owing to the variety of volcanic landforms, the province was included in the 2010 Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and a number of potential geosites have been identified at Pay√∫n Matr√∫ itself. The active field is part of the backarc area of the Southern Volcanic Zone, a long volcanic arc and one of four eruptive belts in the Andes; the other three being the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. Other volcanoes in the region include the Laguna del Maule, almost due west from Pay√∫n Matr√∫.  Local  Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is a shield volcano whose foot coincides with the elevation contour and which extends mainly east‚Äìwest; rising about above the surrounding terrain it covers about of land with lava and has diverse landforms. Ignimbrites cover and flatten its northern and eastern slopes, while in the west and south lava domes and coul√©es predominate; these have often rough surfaces and are difficult to traverse. The lower slopes are more gentle and covered by Pleistocene-Holocene lava flows. Wind erosion has created flutes, grooves and yardangs within the ignimbrites, such as in the western sector where yardangs reach heights of and widths of . The total volume of this shield is about . alt=Labelled description of hills/mountains above a lake A and caldera lies in the summit region of the shield and covers a surface area of about . It is surrounded by several peaks, which clockwise from north include the Nariz/Punta del Pay√∫n, the Punta Media, the Punta Sur and the approximately Cerro Matru or Payen. In the field however Cerro Matru appears smaller than Nariz. The caldera was once wide but erosion of its flanks and later activity have reduced its size and buried the rim below coul√©es, lava domes, lava flows and pumice cones that were emplaced after the caldera collapse. The exception are the northern and southern walls which are almost vertical; remnants of old andesitic and trachyandesitic volcanism crop out there. The caldera also contains a permanent lake known as \\"\\" that is fed by snowmelt and by occasional rainfall. Matr√∫'s highest active point field is the high, conical, eroded Payun stratovolcano. It is also known as Payun Liso, Pay√∫n and Pay√∫n Liso. This volcano rises from the southern side of Pay√∫n Matr√∫, away from the caldera. It has a summit crater open to the north and it has a volume of about .

These fields are also known as West Pay√∫n Matr√∫ or West Pay√©n and East Pay√∫n Matr√∫ or East Pay√©n, respectively. Two further ruptures, known as \\"Chapua\\" and \\"Puente\\", have been identified east of Pay√∫n Matr√∫. All these groups include fissure vents, lapilli cones, scoria cones and strombolian cones. These edifices are up to high and are associated with lava flows and pyroclastic units; the vents in the Los Volcanes group are spread across two separate belts. Wind-driven ash transport has formed ash tails at individual vents. Older lava flows have pahoehoe surfaces with lava tubes and pressure ridges, while Holocene flows are more commonly aa lava with blocky surfaces. Some flows have reached the Rio Grande River west of Pay√∫n Matr√∫, damming it; the river later cut through and formed table-like landforms and canyons. One of these is a slot canyon known as La Pasarela, where the structures of lava flows such as joints in the rocks and vesicles are clearly visible. The entire field covers an area of over and some of its flows have reached the Llancanelo Lake north of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ and the Salado River in the east. The estimated volumes of the entire Pay√∫n Matr√∫ volcano are as large as ; the volcanic edifice was generated mostly through Strombolian and Hawaiian eruptions. alt=Several cinder cones, some forming an alignment The cones are aligned along easterly or northeasterly lineaments which correlate with geological structures in the basement, and appear to reflect the tectonic stresses underground. Among these lineaments is the La Carbonilla fracture which runs in east‚Äìwest direction and crops out in the eastern part of the field; in the central sector it is hidden by the caldera and in the western it is buried by lava flows. The La Carbonilla fracture is a fault that appears to have been an important influence on the development of the Pay√∫n Matr√∫ complex in general. Fissural ridges and elongated chains of vents and cones highlight the control that lineaments exercise on the volcanic eruptions. In the summit area, pumice cones are aligned along the caldera rim. Among the cones in Pay√∫n Matr√∫ are the Plio-Pleistocene (5.333 million years ago until 11,700 years ago) Morados Grandes east and the cones around Pihuel volcano northeast of the field, respectively; the Guadalosos, La Mina and Mont√≥n de Cerros cones in the northern part of the field; and the Holocene cones in the eastern and western part of the field. Among these the Los Morados, Morado Sur and Volc√°n Santa Mar√≠a cones in the eastern and northeastern part of the field are uneroded and are probably of recent age. These cones are the source of conspicuous black lava flows in the western part of the field; some lava flows are over long. * Los Morados is a complex of scoria cones and vents of different ages which during its emplacement underwent a sector collapse, intense Strombolian activity and a lava flow-induced rafting and re-healing of its slopes. * On the southeast and east Los Morados is bordered by a lapilli plain, the Pampas Negras, which was formed by fallout of Strombolian eruptions and is being reworked by wind with the formation of dunes. * Morado Sur consists of two aligned cones that formed in the same eruption and are covered with reddish deposits; it also features several vents and lava flows. * Volc√°n Santa Mar√≠a is a cone with a small crater and also covered with red scoria and lava bombs. It is high and is associated with an area called \\"El Sandial\\", where lava bombs have left traces such as impact craters and aerodynamically deformed rocks. = Pampas Onduladas and other giant lava flows = Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is the source of the longest Quaternary (last 2.58 million years ago) lava flow on Earth, the Pampas Onduladas lava flow in the eastern and northern sector of the volcanic field. The flow originates on the eastern side of the volcanic field in the La Carbonilla fault and eventually splits up into a shorter (\\"Llancanelo lava flow\\", long) northwestern and the longer southeastern branch which reaches all the way to an alluvial terrace of the Salado River in the La Pampa Province. This compound lava flow moved over a gentle terrain and is covered by lava rises and lava tumuli especially in areas where the flow encountered obstacles in the topography. There is some variation in its appearance between a wide, leveled initial proximal sector and a more sinuous distal sector. The unusually fast flowing lava under the influence of its low viscosity and of a favourable topography eventually accumulated to a volume of at least , a surface area of about and depending on the measurement a length of . The process by which such long lava flows form has been explained as \\"inflation\\" whereby lava forms a crust that protects it from heat loss; the so protected lava flow eventually inflates from the entry of new magma, forming a system of overlapping and interconnected lava flow lobes. Such lava flows are known as \\"sheet flows\\". Parts of the Pampas Onduladas lava flow have been buried by more recent lava flows. Together with the √ûj√≥rs√° Lava in Iceland and the Toomba and Undara lava flows in Queensland, Australia, it is one of only a few Quaternary lava flows that reached a length of over and it has been compared to some long lava flows on Mars. Southwest from Pampas Onduladas lie the Los Carrizales lava flows, which have in part advanced to even larger distances than Pampas Onduladas but owing to a straighter course are considered to be shorter than the Pampas Onduladas lava flow, and the La Carbonilla lava flow which like Los Carrizales propagated southeastward and is located just west from the latter. Additional large lava flows are located in the western part of the field and resemble the Pampas Onduladas lava flow, such as the El Puente Formation close to the Rio Grande River of possibly recent age. Long lava flows have also been produced by volcanic centres directly south of Pay√∫n Matr√∫, including the long El Corcovo, Pampa de Luanco and Pampa de Ranquelc√≥ flows. = Hydrography and non-volcanic landscape = Apart from the lake in the caldera, the area of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is largely devoid of permanent water sources, with most water sites that draw in humans being either temporary so-called \\"\\" or ephemeral. Likewise, there are no permanent rivers in the field and most of the precipitation quickly seeps into the permeable or sandy ground. The whole massif is surrounded by sandy plains, which are simply volcanic rocks covered by aeolian sediments; the plains also feature small closed basins which are also found in the lavic area.  Geology  West of South America, the Nazca Plate and the Antarctic Plate subduct beneath the South America Plate at a rate of , giving rise to the Andean volcanic belt. The volcanic belt is not continuous and is interrupted by gaps where the subduction is shallower and the asthenosphere between the two plates missing. North of the Pay√∫n Matr√∫, flat slab subduction takes place; in the past flat slab subduction occurred farther south as well and had noticeable influence on magma chemistry. In general, the mode of subduction in the region over time has been variable. There is evidence of Precambrian (older than 541 ¬± 0.1 million years ago) and Permian-Triassic (298.9 ¬±0.15 to 201.3 ¬±0.2 million years ago) volcanism (Choique Mahuida Formation) in the region, but a long hiatus separates them from the recent volcanic activity which started in the Pliocene (5.333‚Äì2.58 million years ago). At that time, the basaltic El Cenizo Formation and the andesitic Cerro El Zaino volcanics were emplaced. This kind of calcalkaline volcanic activity is interpreted to be the consequence of flat slab subduction during the Miocene (23.03-5.333 million years ago) and Pliocene, and took place between twenty and five million years ago. Later during the Pliocene and Quaternary the slab steepened, and probably as a consequence volcanism in the land above increased, reaching a peak between eight and five million years ago.  Local  The basement rock underneath Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is formed by Mesoproterozoic (1,600‚Äì1,000 million years ago) to Triassic rocks of the San Rafael Block, Mesozoic (251.902 ¬± 0.024 to 66 million years ago) to Paleogene sediments of the Neuqu√©n Basin and Miocene lava flows such as the Tertiary Patagonian basalts. The Andean orogeny during the Miocene has folded and deformed the basement, creating basins and uplifted basement blocks, and the Malarg√ºe fold and thrust belt underlies part of the volcanic field. Oil has been drilled close to the volcanic field from sediments of Mesozoic age. Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is part of the backarc volcanic province, east of the Andes and east of the Peru-Chile Trench. The volcanic activity still relates to the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate, however; one proposed mechanism is that a Miocene change in the subduction regimen led to the development of extensional tectonics and of faults that form the pathways for magma ascent, while other mechanisms envisage changes in mantle characteristics.alt=Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is part of a group of volcanoes, with a string of volcanoes just to its south Other volcanic fields in the region are the Llancanelo volcanic field, the Nevado volcanic field and Salado Basin volcanic field; the first two lie north of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ and the last south. These fields are subdivided on the basis of geochemical differences and consist of two stratovolcanoes (Pay√∫n Matr√∫ itself and Nevado) and many monogenetic volcanoes. The volcanic field is part of the larger Payunia volcanic province, which covers an area of about in the Provinces of La Pampa, Mendoza and Neuqu√©n and is also known as the Payenia or Andino- Cuyana volcanic province. Monogenetic volcanism of mainly basaltic composition has been active here for millions of years accompanied by the formation of several polygenetic volcanoes, generating more than eight hundred monogenetic cones although historical eruptions have not been observed. Further south are the Chachahuen and Auca Mahuida volcanoes, while the Tromen volcano is located southwest from Pay√∫n Matr√∫.  Lava and magma composition  The volcanic field has produced rocks with composition ranging from alkali basalts over basalts, trachyandesite, basaltic trachyandesite, trachybasalt and trachyte to rhyolite. They define a calc-alkaline volcanic suite with some variation between the various volcanic centres; Los Volcanes is formed mainly by calc- alkaline magmas while Payun and Pay√∫n Matr√∫ are more potassium-rich and shoshonitic. The volcanic rocks contain variable amounts of phenocrysts, including alkali feldspar, amphibole, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and sanidine, but not all phenocryst phases can be found in every rock formation. Magma temperatures of have been inferred. Volcanic rocks erupted at Pay√∫n Matr√∫ resemble ocean island basalt volcanism, implying a deep origin of the magma although a shallow origin cannot be ruled out. Magnetotelluric observations indicate the presence of a \\"plume\\"-like structure that rises from depth close to the edge of the Nazca Plate slab to underneath Pay√∫n Matr√∫; it may indicate that magma erupted in the volcanic field originates at such depths which would explain the ocean island basalt-like composition. The magma ejected at Pay√∫n Matr√∫ originates during partial melting of enriched mantle; the resulting melts then undergo crystal fractionation, assimilation of crustal material and magma mixing in magma chambers. The magmas eventually reach the surface through deep faults. The edifice of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ acts as an obstacle to magmas ascending to the surface; this is why only evolved magmas are erupted in the caldera area of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ while basic magmas reached the surface mainly outside of the main edifice. Obsidian from Pay√∫n Matr√∫ has been found in archeological sites, although its use was not widespread in the region perhaps owing to its low quality, the difficulty of accessing the volcanic complex and that human activity in Payunia only began comparatively late in the Holocene and mostly from the margins of the region. Further, Payun volcano is notable for large crystals of hematite pseudomorphs which originated in fumaroles.  Climate, soils and vegetation  The climate at Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is cold and dry with strong westerly winds. Annual temperature varies between while the average temperature in the wider region is about and the average annual precipitation amounts to . Generally, the area of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is characterized by a continental climate with hot summers especially at lower elevations and cold winters especially at higher elevations. The climate is dry owing to the rainshadow effect of the Andes which block moisture bearing winds from reaching Pay√∫n Matr√∫, and strong winds and the evaporation associated with them reinforce the dryness. In the westerly part of the volcanic field most precipitation falls during winter under the influence of the Andes, while the eastern part has most precipitation occurring during summer. The higher parts of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ may have risen above the snowline during ice ages, and periglacial landforms have been observed. Palynology data from south of the region indicate that the climate has been stable since the Late Pleistocene. The vegetation in the volcanic field is mostly characterized by sparse bushes as well as herbaceous vegetation but few trees, and is classified as xerophytic. Soils are shallow and are mainly rocky to loess-like. Representative plant genera are Opuntia cactus and Poa and Stipa grasses. Pay√∫n Matr√∫ is a refuge for a number of animals such as the armadillos, black-chested buzzard-eagle, condors, Darwin's rhea, guanaco, mara, Pampas fox or South American gray fox, puma and Southern viscacha.  Eruptions  alt=The volcano is formed of many stratigraphic formations that were emplaced partly consecutively partly concurrently The geological history of the Pay√∫n Matr√∫ volcanic field is poorly dated but the field has been active since Pliocene at least. The older volcanism appears to be located in the eastern part of the field where ages of 0.95 ¬± 0.5 to 0.6 ¬± 0.1 million years ago have been obtained by potassium-argon dating. Lava flows have been subdivided into the older Puente Group and the younger Tromen Group formations, which are of Pleistocene to Pleistocene-Holocene age, respectively; a Chapua Formation of Plio-Pleistocene age has been defined as well. The eastern volcanism is also known as the Pre-caldera basaltic unit; a western counterpart to it is probably buried beneath younger eruption products. The first volcanic activity occurred west and east of Pay√∫n Matr√∫ and involved the emission of olivine basalt lava flows. The long Pampas Onduladas lava flow was erupted 373,000 ¬± 10,000 years ago and buried parts of the 400,000 ¬± 100,000 years old Los Carrizales lava field; both have hawaiitic composition. The Payun volcano formed around 265,000 ¬± 5,000 years ago within a timespan of about 2,000‚Äì20,000 years. Its inferred eruption rate of is similar to typical volcanic arc eruption rates such as at Mount St. Helens. The main Pay√∫n Matr√∫ massif formed in about 600,000 years, with the oldest trachytic rocks dated to 700,000 years ago. It is comprised by the lavic and ignimbritic Pre-caldera Trachyte unit and consists of trachyandesitic to trachytic rocks, with trachyte being the most important component. The massif may have formed a tall edifice like the Payun volcano before caldera collapse. The formation of the caldera coincides with the eruption of the Portezuelo Ignimbrite/Portezuelo Formation and took place between 168,000 ¬± 4,000 and 82,000 ¬± 2,000 years ago. This ignimbrite formation where it is not buried by younger eruption products spreads radially around the caldera and reaches a maximum exposed thickness of ; it covers an area of about on the northern and southern sides of Pay√∫n Matr√∫, and its volume is estimated to be about . The event was probably precipitated by the entry of mafic magma in the magma chamber and its incomplete mixing with pre-existent magma chamber melts, or by tectonic processes; the resulting Plinian eruption generated an eruption column, which collapsed, producing the ignimbrites. Different layers of magma in the magma chamber were erupted during the course of the eruption and eventually the summit of the volcano collapsed as well, forming the caldera; activity continued and emplaced lava domes and lava flows in the caldera area. These post-caldera volcanic formations are subdivided into three separate lithofacies. Basaltic and trachyandesitic activity continued after the formation of the caldera. Morphology indicates that the El Rengo and Los Volcanes volcanic cones appear to be of Holocene age, while the Guadaloso vents formed during the Plio-Pleistocene. One age from the eastern side is 148,000 ¬± 9,000 years ago, it comes from northeast of the Pay√∫n Matr√∫ caldera. Uneroded volcanic cones and dark basaltic lavas indicate that activity continued into the Holocene. Oral tradition by a local indigenous tribe indicate that volcanic activity occurred within the last several centuries, although no eruptions have been observed since the European settlement. Future volcanic eruptions would be unlikely to constitute a hazard given the low population density of the area, although roads might be interrupted and lava dams might form in rivers. Various dating methods have yielded various ages for late Pleistocene-Holocene volcanic eruptions: * 44,000 ¬± 2,000 years ago, surface exposure dating. * 43,000‚Äì41,000 ¬± 3,000 years ago, surface exposure dating, El Puente Formation.

Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 624. was a general of the Northern and Southern Courts period (1337‚Äì92) of Japanese history and a close associate of his elder brother Takauji, the first Muromachi sh≈çgun. Son of Ashikaga Sadauji and Uesugi Kiyoko, daughter of Uesugi Yorishige, the same mother as Takauji, he was a pivotal figure of the chaotic transition period between the Kamakura and Muromachi shogunates.Yasuda (1990:22) Tadayoshi is today considered a military and administrative genius and the true architect of many of his elder brother's successes.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online accessed on August 11, 2009 In contemporary chronicles he is rarely called with his name, but is instead called either or from the name of his family temple.Sansom (1977:87) His posthumous name was .(Kan (1980:123) Biography The Ashikaga were a samurai family from Kamakura having blood ties with the Seiwa Genji, Minamoto no Yoritomo's clan. Unlike his brother Takauji, Tadayoshi took no part in the Kamakura shogunate's political activities until the Genk≈ç War (1331‚Äì1333), a civil war whose conclusion (the Siege of Kamakura (1333) marks the end of the Kamakura period and the beginning of the most turbulent period in Japan's history, the Muromachi era. Like his brother, Tadayoshi resolutely abandoned the Kamakura shogunate to ally himself with Emperor Go-Daigo during the Kenmu Restoration of 1333. When Go-Daigo had ascended to the throne in 1318, he had immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura.Sansom (2000:23‚Äì42) The samurai class as a whole however was not ready to give away power, so the alliance between him and the Ashikaga was bound to be only temporary. Go-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending there a sh≈çgun, as this was seen, just a year from the fall of its shogunate, as still too dangerous. As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to Mutsu Province and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and Dewa Provinces. In an obvious reply to this move, Tadayoshi, without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old Prince Nariyoshi (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as governor of the K≈çzuke Province with himself as a deputy and de facto ruler. The appointment of a warrior to such an important post was intended to show the Emperor that the samurai class was not ready for a purely civilian rule. Since he ruled without interference from Kyoto and the area in itself was in effect a miniature shogunate, this event can be considered the beginning of the Ashikaga shogunate. In 1335, during the Nakasendai Rebellion led by H≈çj≈ç Tokiyuki Tadayoshi, being unable to defend the city, had to leave Kamakura in a rush. Not being in the position to take along another son of Go-Daigo's, Prince Morinaga, whom he had kept as a hostage for several months, rather than letting him go he decided to have him beheaded. In Dec. 1335, Tadayoshi was defeated by imperial forces under the command of Nitta Yoshisada forcing his retreat to the Hakone mountains. However, with the aid of his brother Takauji, they were able to defeat Yoshisada at the battles of Sanoyama and Mishima. The brothers were then free to advance upon Kyoto. Their occupation of Kyoto was short lived however, as forces loyal to Go-Daigo forced the brothers to flee west. In April 1336, Ashikaga Tadayoshi, \\"drove the enemy before him\\" helping his brother defeat the Kikuchi clan, allies of Go-Daigo. This Battle of Tatarahama (1336) occurred in Hakata Bay. The victory enabled Takauji to become master of Kyushu. By May, Takauji was able to advance with a flotilla, reaching the environs of present-day Kobe in July. Tadayoshi followed in parallel with a land force. Turning against Go-Daigo, Tadayoshi and Takauji set up a rival emperor in 1336 after defeating the Loyalists in the Battle of Minatogawa. Their Muromachi shogunate was founded in 1338. Dividing power between them, Takauji took charge of military affairs and Tadayoshi of judicial and administrative matters. Both Tadayoshi and Takauji were disciples of famous Zen master, intellectual and garden designer Mus≈ç Soseki, under which guidance the first would later become a Buddhist monk. It was partly because of Soseki's influence that the pre-existing Five Mountain System network of Zen temples was expanded and strengthened, first with the establishment of the Jissetsu, and later with that of the Ankoku-ji temple sub-networks. The creation of both systems is generally attributed wholly to Tadayoshi. It was also Soseki which famously wrote about the two brothers, describing Takauji as more apt to military pursuits, and Tadayoshi to government. The Kann≈ç disturbance and Tadayoshi's death Ashikaga Takauji was the formally-appointed shogun but, having proved incapable of ruling the country, for more than ten years Tadayoshi had governed in his stead. The relationship between the two brothers was however destined to be destroyed by the Kann≈ç disturbance, an event which takes its name from the Kann≈ç era (1350‚Äì1351) during which it took place, and which had very serious consequences for the entire country. Trouble between the two started when Takauji made K≈ç no Moronao his deputy sh≈çgun. According to the Taiheiki, Tadayoshi didn't like Moronao and, every other effort to get rid of him having failed, tried to have him assassinated. According to the same source, his plot was discovered and he was therefore removed from the government. In any event, Tadayoshi in 1350 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, and take the tonsure under the monastic name Keishin.Papinot (1972:29) In 1351 Tadayoshi rebelled and joined his brother's enemies, the Southern court, whose emperor, Go-Murakami appointed him general of all his troops. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied Kyoto, and entered Kamakura. During the same year his forces killed Moronao and his brother Moroyasu at Mikage (Settsu Province). The following year Tadayoshi's fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama. A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief; Tadayoshi was sandwiched by two of Takauji's armies and fled to the hills of Izu in 1352. Shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi was captured and confined in the Kamakura Jomyoji monastery, where he died suddenly in March. According to the Taiheiki, by poisoning. Ashikaga Tadayoshi was buried at , a Buddhist temple which no longer exists, but whose ruins are now near J≈çmy≈ç-ji in Kamakura.Kamiya Vol. 1 (2008:110) The temple was founded on the grounds of Tadayoshi's former Kamakura residence, according to J≈çmy≈ç- ji's own records by Tadayoshi himself.(Kan (1980:123) According to the , the diary of priest Gid≈ç Sh≈´shin, in 1372 on the day of Tadayoshi's death Kamakura's Kub≈ç Ashikaga Ujimitsu visited Daiky≈´-ji. The date of disappearance of the temple is unknown. He also adopted Ashikaga Tadafuyu, one of Takauji's sons, as his own.

Sergeant Morris was wounded and blinded in one eye during a fire-fight on July 27, 2002, that left Sergeant 1st Class Christopher J. Speer dead. Canadian youth Omar Khadr, then fifteen and held from 2002 until 2012, by the United States, pled guilty for Speer's death. Sergeant Morris retired from the military. He returned to his home in Utah, where he became a local West Valley City housing director in civilian life. He lives with his wife Leisl in South Jordan, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. He appeared in a National Geographic special, U.S. Army Special Forces (2003), and on 60 Minutes (2007). Civil suit The United States alleged Khadr's father Achmed Said Khadr had been a close associate of Osama bin Laden and worked with members of Al-Qaeda; he was killed near the border of Afghanistan in 2004. Sergeant Morris joined with Sergeant Speer's widow, Tabitha Speer, in a legal civil suit against Achmed Khadr's estate. His argument, then, was that since Omar Khadr was only fifteen, he could not be held responsible for his actions‚Äîbut his father could. Normally \\"acts of war\\" are not subject to civil suits. Morris and Speer argued successfully that Khadr was a terrorist, not a soldier‚Äîso his actions were not exempted from civil suits. On February 16, 2006, U.S. District Judge Paul Cassell awarded Morris and Tabitha Speer triple damages, totalling $102.6 million. An article published in the June 14, 2007 Salt Lake Tribune said that Morris and Tabitha Speer might collect funds via the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. A Treasury Department official had acknowledged that Ahmed Khadr's assets had been frozen, but said it was up to Morris and Speer to locate them. Senator Orrin Hatch had been asked to intervene and was \\"very interested\\". In January 2008, a U.S. Attorney claimed the US federal government to have \\"sovereign immunity\\" over the seized funds, asserting that it does not have to comply with a judgement in a civil suit. Guantanamo military commissions Omar Khadr was named as one of ten detainees who faced charges before special military commissions. These commissions were not courts martial. Guantanamo military commission chief prosecutor Colonel Morris Davis said, on January 10, 2006, that he planned to call Layne Morris as a witness against Khadr. Sergeant Morris was to testify that he knew he was injured by Khadr. On June 29, 2006, the US Supreme Court upheld an earlier ruling that the commissions were unconstitutional because they had not been authorized by Congress, and violated both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the United States' obligations under the Geneva Conventions. Sergeant Morris told interviewers he was disappointed that the military commissions had been overturned. *\\"It is justice delayed. I don't think that's a good thing ...

In that sense, I think it is unfortunate,\\"Wounded soldier miffed tribunal for Canadian detained in Guantanamo is off, National Post, June 30, 2006, mirror *\\"I guess I don't agree with giving these people all of the legal rights that citizens have,\\"US ruling won't close Guantanamo camp-Pentagon, Reuters, June 30, 2006 *\\"I think everyone on both sides of the political aisle just wants to see some sort of resolution to their status and I guess it's just going to take longer now to figure out how that process is going to work.\\"Send Khadr home, lawyers urge U.S.: Top court deems tribunals illegal Toronto teen held at Guantanamo, Toronto Star, June 30, 2006 In 2008, a five-page statement from an American who shot Khadr said that the youth had not been the only occupant of the compound to have survived the American aerial bombardment. He said further that Khadr had been shot in the back; he was sitting upright with his back to the skirmish. This cast doubt on assertions that Khadr had thrown the grenade that killed Speer. While journalists questioned whether Omar Khadr threw the grenade at US forces, in a telephone interview with Michelle Shephard of the Toronto Star. Morris insisted \\"That was a total shock to me. Everyone had told me from the get-go that there was only one guy in there.\\" He thought there was evidence that \\"Omar was the grenade man.\\" *\\"Instead of surrendering and calling it a day, he made the decision to wait until personnel got close enough that he could restart the battle, pop up and throw a hand grenade.\\" *\\"I'm fine with this dragging on for another five years before there's a trial as long as they stay locked up.\\" Khadr settlement Morris criticized the Canadian government after they paid $10.5 N to Khadr, by calling it ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù in a letter.https://www.tisdalerecorder.ca/opinion- letters/letter-omar-khadr-settlement-is-outrageous-1.21156784 He called for Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to be charged with treason.https://torontosun.com/2017/07/08/trudeau-should-be-charged-with- treason-morris/wcm/d167b350-ca58-4211-aa14-2ca5d65f9c1c He also accused Trudeau of being an Omar Khadr ‚Äúsupporter‚Äù and ‚Äúgroupie‚Äù.https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/omar-khadr-payment-layne-morris- interview-1.4198620 He stated ‚Äúit was wrong‚Äù for the Canadian government to settle Khadr's lawsuit, as well as believing that Canada should have taken Khadr's lawsuits to court.https://globalnews.ca/news/3607099/injured-u-s- soldier-says-canada-should-have-taken-omar-khadr-lawsuit-to-courts/ ReferencesExternal links *a brief account of Layne Morris's civil suit. *U.S. woman sues dead Khadr dad for $10 million, CTV, August 6, 2004 * * you-tube mirror  mirror * mirror  * * Category:Living people Category:United States Army soldiers Category:1961 births ","title":"Layne Morris"},{"id":"1497610","text":"Volcanic Landscapes of the Central Andes.

Geeraerts was born in Antwerp. After his studies in political and administrative sciences at the in Antwerp he became a colonial administrator in Belgian Congo. On the independence of the Congo he sent his wife and children back to Belgium and in August 1960 he himself returned to Belgium. During the next six years he was paid by the government (return program). After that time he needed to find a job to survive. He decided to become a writer and went to the University of Brussels to study Germanic languages. Career as a writer When he had finished his studies he wrote his first novel, Ik ben maar een neger (\\"I'm just a negro\\"), which put him on the map as extremely controversial. The book was based on his experience as military in the Congo. He wrote more of these politically motivated colonial books before he started his Gangreen series. There are four parts, Gangreen 1 (Black Venus), Gangreen 2 (De Goede Moordenaar), Gangreen 3 (Het Teken van de Hond) and Gangreen 4 (Het Zevende Zegel). These books were sexually explicit, which led to controversy in Belgium. His books were considered by some to be racist and pornographic. Geeraerts later became famous for his detective stories. Nowadays, he is a celebrated crime-novelist and several of his books (De zaak Alzheimer and Dossier K) have been filmed. In total Geeraerts wrote 35 novels, some plays and a radio drama. Two of his books were used for a film.  Private life  Geeraerts has three children from his first marriage, among these his daughter Ilse. In 1978, he married Eleonore Vigenon.

He played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers under legendary head coach Robert Neyland. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Atkins was a fierce defender who was known for using his immense size and agility to his advantage. At , Atkins often batted passes down at the line of scrimmage and used his skills as a high jump champion to leapfrog blockers and get to the quarterback. Atkins was one of the first great exclusively defensive players in professional football and, along with fellow Hall of Famer Gino Marchetti, revolutionized the defensive end position. Amateur career Atkins was born May 8, 1930, in Humboldt, Tennessee. He attended Humboldt High School and played for the school's basketball team, which won the state championship in 1949 with an undefeated record. He enrolled at the University of Tennessee to play for the Tennessee Volunteers of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on a basketball scholarship, but once American football head coach Bob Neyland saw his combination of size and agility, he was recruited for the football team. Atkins played on the 1951 Tennessee Volunteers football team that won the national championship. He earned All-America honors in 1952. Atkins is one of the few players in Tennessee history to have his number retired. He was considered one of the, if not the, most dominant defensive players in SEC history. Atkins was the only unanimous selection to the SEC All Quarter-Century team and was selected as the overall SEC \\"Player of the Quarter-Century\\" for the years 1950 to 1975. At Tennessee, Atkins also lettered in three seasons in track and fieldhttps://issuu.com/utad/docs/2012_t_f_media_guide_pdf_for_web and one season in basketball.http://utsports.com/documents/2017/10/30//18_Volmanac_203_258.pdf?id=7809 He finished runner-up in the high jump at the 1952 Southeastern Conference championships with a mark of 6' 6\\" (1.98m) which placed him 25th in the world that year.https://www.knoxtntoday.com/12224-2/ Professional career The Cleveland Browns selected Atkins with the 11th overall selection in the 1953 NFL draft. He played his first two seasons in the NFL with the Browns, winning the NFL Eastern Conference in 1953, and the NFL Championship in 1954. The Browns traded Atkins and Ken Gorgal to the Chicago Bears for a third-round and a sixth-round pick in the 1956 NFL draft. According to Pat Summerall, Atkins was traded by Paul Brown for burping out loud in a team meeting. In Chicago, Atkins quickly became the leader of a devastating defensive unit. With the Bears, Atkins was a First Team All-Pro selection in 1958, 1960, 1961, and 1963, along with being a starter in the Pro Bowl in eight of his last nine years with Chicago. At the 1966 Pro Bowl, Atkins announced his retirement from football. He changed his mind and signed with the Bears for the 1966 season. Before the 1967 season, Atkins requested a trade from Chicago and was traded to the New Orleans Saints. He suffered a fractured knee cap during the 1968 season. He retired after the 1969 season. On the final play of his NFL career, Atkins sacked Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dick Shiner, preserving the Saints' 27‚Äì24 victory in the 1969 season finale. Honors Atkins was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1985. He has also been inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. His collegiate jersey number, #91, was retired by the University of Tennessee in 2005. Even though he only played three seasons for New Orleans, the club retired his #81, one of two numbers originally retired by the franchise. The other, #31, belongs to Hall of Fame fullback Jim Taylor, a long-time rival of Atkins during Taylor's days with the Green Bay Packers. The NFL Network ranked him as the number 9 Pass Rusher of All Time in its Top Ten show. During a 1983 segment about Atkins on the NFL Films show \\"This Is the NFL\\", legendary narrator John Facenda described Atkins \\"like a storm rolling over a Kansas farmhouse. He came from all directions, and all there was to do was to tie down what you could, and hope he didn't take the roof\\". Personal life Atkins married twice.

It is used in game playing as well as in divination. It depicts a pittura infamante (), an image of a man being hanged upside-down by one ankle (the only exception being the Tarocco Siciliano, which depicts the man hanged by the neck instead). This method of hanging was a common punishment at the time for traitors in Italy. However, the solemn expression on his face traditionally suggests that he is there by his own accord, and the card is meant to represent self-sacrifice more so than it does corporal punishment or criminality. In other interpretations, The Hanged Man is a depiction of the Norse god Odin, who suspended himself from a tree in order to gain knowledge. There is also a Christian interpretation that portrays Judas Iscariot, and include the bags of silver in his hands. In the Lo Scarabeo African American Tarot deck the 12th card of the major arcana is the Observer, depicting the Nigerian god ‚ÄúIfa‚Äù of fate and destiny blindfolded and surrounded by eyes. Description A 1393 decree for Milan and Lombardy of the punishment for traitors: ‚ÄúLet him be drug [dragged] on a [wooden] plank at a horse‚Äôs tail to the place of execution, and there be suspended by one foot to the gallows, and be left there until he is dead. As long as he lives let him be given food and drink.‚ÄùA Modern Catholic Looks at the Tarot, Pre- Gebelin Tarot History The Cross of St. Peter is shown in this French stained glass window. Saint Peter is conventionally shown as having been crucified upside-down. Modern versions of the tarot deck depict a man hanging upside- down by one foot. The figure is most often suspended from a wooden beam (as in a cross or gallows) or a tree. Ambiguity results from the fact that the card itself may be viewed inverted. In his book The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, A. E. Waite, the designer of the Rider-Waite tarot deck, wrote of the symbol: > The gallows from which he is suspended forms a Tau cross, while the figure-- > from the position of the legs--forms a fylfot cross. There is a nimbus about > the head of the seeming martyr. It should be noted (1) that the tree of > sacrifice is living wood, with leaves thereon; (2) that the face expresses > deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as a whole, suggests > life in suspension, but life and not death. [...] It has been called falsely > a card of martyrdom, a card of prudence, a card of the Great Work, a card of > duty [...] I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the > relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.Waite, > A. E. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at > sacred-texts.com Waite writes that the card carries several divinatory associations: > 12\\\\. THE HANGED MAN.‚ÄîWisdom, circumspection, discernment, trials, sacrifice, > intuition, divination, prophecy. Reversed: Selfishness, the crowd, body > politic. There is a halo burning brightly around the hanged man's head, signifying a higher learning or an enlightenment.Gray, Eden. \\"Complete Guide to the Tarot.\\" 1970. Crown Publishers, New York, NY.

Buchanan was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. High school years Buchanan attended A. H. Parker High School in Birmingham, Alabama, and was a standout in football and basketball. College years Buchanan attended Grambling College in Louisiana and was a letterman in football and an NAIA All-America selection. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996. He is one of four Grambling State players, Willie Brown, Willie Davis, and Charlie Joiner coached by Eddie Robinson enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Professional career The Buchanan was selected in both the NFL and AFL drafts in 1963. The New York Giants took him 265th overall in the 19th round of the 1963 NFL Draft, while he was the first overall selection in the AFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. Eddie Robinson, his coach at Grambling State, where he had been an NAIA All-American in 1962, called him \\"the finest lineman I have seen.\\" Buchanan was the first black number one draft choice in Professional Football. Others who had watched Buchanan in action were equally enthusiastic. Buchanan had the physical size and athletic instincts to be exceptionally successful. He was particularly effective at intimidating the passer and in 1967 batted down 16 passes at or behind the line of scrimmage. He was clocked at 4.9 in the 40-yard dash and 10.2 in the 100-yard dash at Grambling State, allowing him to range from sideline to sideline to make tackles. Buchanan (left) and fellow Football Hall of Famer Curley Culp stop a Vikings running play during Super Bowl IV In spite of the weekly pounding he took on the line of scrimmage, Buchanan was extremely durable. He played in 182 career games that included a string of 166 straight. After dabbling briefly at defensive end as a rookie, Buchanan settled down to his permanent job as the Chiefs' defensive right tackle. He was named to his first AFL All- Star Game after his second season and played in six AFL All-Star games and two AFC-NFC Pro Bowls. He teamed with Curley Culp, Aaron Brown and Jerry Mays to establish a dominant front four for the Chiefs, culminating in their victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV, when they allowed Viking runners only 67 yards rushing in 19 carries and 172 net passing yards, Buchanan in particular dominating the opposing center, Mick Tingelhoff, a 5-time AP first- team All-Pro selection up to that 1969 season, as handily as the left guard, Jim Vellone. He was selected to the second team of the AFL All-Time Team, and was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. Two years later, he died from lung cancer at the age of 51. In 1999, he was ranked number 67 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, right behind his former Chiefs teammate Bobby Bell. The Chiefs also retired his uniform number 86. Personal life Buchanan was diagnosed with lung cancer a week before his Hall of Fame induction and died at age 51 in his Kansas City home on July 16, 1992. He is survived by his wife, Georgia; sons Dwaine of Kansas City and Eric of Lincoln, Neb.; daughter Nicole of Kansas City; parents Wallace and Fannie Buchanan of Birmingham, Ala.; brother Doug, of Birmingham, and sisters Evelyn Buchanan and Betty Barksdale of Atlanta.

He was the younger son of Tim Mara, who founded the Giants in 1925. Wellington was a ball boy that year. Life and career Mara was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Elizabeth \\"Lizette\\" (n√©e Barclay), a homemaker, and Timothy James Mara. He was of Irish descent. Mara was an alumnus of Loyola School and Fordham University, both New York City Jesuit schools. In 1930, Timothy James Mara split his ownership interests between Wellington (then 14) and his older brother Jack. Soon after graduating from Fordham University, Wellington moved into the Giants' front office as team treasurer and assistant to his father. He became the team's secretary in 1940. After fighting in World War II, he returned to the Giants as team vice president, a post he retained after his father died in 1958. When Jack, who had been president since 1941, died in 1965, Wellington became team president. For his first 37 years in the organization, he handled the franchise's football decisions. However, his growing involvement in league affairs led him to turn over most of his day-to-day responsibilities to operations director Andy Robustelli in 1974. He didn't relinquish full control over the football side of the operation until 1979, when George Young became the team's first general manager. The Giants were hamstrung for several years by a strained relationship between Wellington and his nephew, Tim J. Mara, who inherited Jack's stake in the team upon Jack's death. By the 1970s, they almost never spoke to each other, and a partition had to be built in the owners' box. The Maras continued to retain close control over the Giants' day-to-day operations long after most other owners had delegated such authority. Only the fallout from the 1978 Fumble, in which a certain Giant win turned into a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on a last-second fumble, convinced the Maras of the need to modernize--among other things, by hiring Young and giving him full control over football operations. Under Mara's direction the New York Football Giants won six NFL titles (including two Super Bowl wins), nine conference championships (including six Eastern Conference championships in the days before the NFL-AFL merger and three NFC championships post-merger), and 13 division championships. An eighth NFL title, third and fourth Super Bowl victories, fifth NFC championship (11th conference championship overall), and 15th division title have been captured since his passing under the leadership of his son, John, and co-owner Steve Tisch (who in turn is the son of Wellington's former co-owner from 1991‚Äì2005, Bob Tisch; Tisch also died in 2005, with his death coming three weeks after Mara's). The Giants have also accumulated the third highest number of victories in National Football League history. Mara was also well liked by the Giants' players, and was known to stick by them even when they struggled with off-the-field problems. When Lawrence Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999 he credited Mara for supporting him even during the worst times of his drug addiction saying, \\"He probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have.\\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com, Five for the ages: Pro Football Hall of Fame inducts five more members, accessed February 17, 2007 Taylor has since lived a clean life style and credits Mara with helping him fight his addiction.Dave Anderson, PRO FOOTBALL; Losing Himself to Find Himself, New York Times, November 28, 2003, accessed April 4, 2008 The grave of Wellington Mara in Gate of Heaven Cemetery He had surgery in May 2005 to remove cancerous lymph nodes from his neck and under his armpit, but was initially given a good prognosis by his doctors who said the cancer had not metastasized, according to his son, John Mara, who is the Giants' co-chief executive officer. Not long after Mara came to work with the team, the players- many of whom were barely older than him- nicknamed him \\"Duke\\" because they knew he was named after the Duke of Wellington, whom his father called \\"the fightingest of all Irishmen.\\" The nickname stuck. The Wilson football used in NFL games prior to the AFL merger (1941‚Äì69) was nicknamed \\"THE DUKE\\" after Mara; the ball was named as such by George Halas, the owner of the Chicago Bears, to reward Tim Mara for arranging the contract that made Wilson the official supplier of footballs to the NFL.http://www.wilson.com/en-us/football/nfl/wilson-and-the- nfl/history/;jsessionid=F778176F5935A23A9E5C363660A75A0A Since the 2006 season, a new version of \\"THE DUKE\\" has been used in NFL games. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997. Mara was married to Ann Mara. His granddaughters include actresses Kate Mara and Rooney Mara. In 2012, Mara was elected into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Death Wellington Mara succumbed to lymphoma in 2005 at age 89. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York, after his funeral at New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral. He was survived by his wife Ann Mara (1929-2015), 11 children, and 42 grandchildren. His team honored him after his death by defeating the Washington Redskins, the team he always viewed as the Giants' biggest (and oldest) rival, 36‚Äì0 on October 30, 2005 at Giants Stadium.

History Founded in 1922, the school was formerly called the Taihoku (Taipei during Japanese rule) Prefectural Second Middle School and then briefly called Taihoku Second Middle School. It moved from the Bodhidharma temple to the present site in 1925, and was intended for the enrollment of Taiwanese students, as all the \\"first\\" middle schools were reserved for the Japanese except for Taichung First Middle School (which was founded by a group of local elites in Taichung). In 1946, the following year of the Allies victory over Japan in World War II and restoration of Taiwan to the Republic of China, the school was renamed the Taiwan Provincial Taipei Cheng Kung High School in memory of the national hero, Koxinga (Cheng Cheng- kung) for his resistance to foreign invaders. In 1955, the school was ordered to disperse, and set up a branch school in Taoyuan, which was later expanded in \\"the Joint Taoyuan Branch School of the Five Provincial Taipei High School.\\" It became independent and was renamed the Taiwan Provincial Wu-Ling High School in 1959. In the autumn of 1967, Taipei City came under control of the Executive Yuan. The school was given the name Taipei Municipal Cheng Kung Senior High School. The present name of the school is Taipei Municipal Chenggong High School. By order of the government, the school began to have evening sessions in 1953, which stopped enrolling new students in 1981. The evening sessions terminated two years later after the final students in the programme graduated. Surroundings Chenggong High School is situated in the city center where government offices and other organisational institutions abound. The campus has an area of 20,000 square meters. Guidance and counseling The guidance programs are set up by the guidance committee and carried out by the teachers and the counselors. There is one chief guidance counselor and four guidance teachers. The objectives of the guidance services are to improve the students' psychological health and to adjust them well in the learning and living environment. Club activities There are 57 clubs for academics, skills and talents, physical training, recreation, leisure activities, and school teams. Student organizations The school features autonomous student organizations, such as the class Union, which pushes forward self-governing activities in the school. The Students' Representatives' Union works to promote interschool exchanges. The Club Union assumes responsibility for performances and competitions outside school.

In the 2002 parliamentary election, he was elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the list of pro-Kuchma United Ukraine Bloc. Later, Kadeniuk joined the \\"Trudova Ukrayina - Industrialists and Entrepreneurs\\" faction, but had not been politically active. He worked within parliament's Committee on Defense and National Security. In the 2006 parliamentary election, Kadenyuk was #3 in the electoral party list of Lytvyn's People's Bloc, but the block won only 2.44% of the popular vote (short of the required 3%) and no seats in the parliament.

It lies between the Ceraunian Mountains and the Ionian Sea and is part of the Albanian Riviera. The region consists of the town of Himar√´ and the villages of Dh√´rmi, Pilur, Kudh√´s, Qeparo, Vuno, Ilias, UPCYCLING ‚Äì Albanische Riviera and Palas√´. The municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Himar√´, Hor√´- Vranisht and Lukov√´, that became municipal units. The total population is 7,818 (2011 census), in a total area of . The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 2,822. The region of Himara is predominantly populated by an ethnic Greek community. Geography The Himara region is a strip approximately 20 km long by 5 km wide, bounded by the 2000-metre-high Llogara mountains to the northeast (known in antiquity and in the local Greek dialect as the Ceraunian mountains (, Keravnia ori, \\"Thunder Mountains\\") and the Ionian Sea to the southwest. There are long white sandy beaches and the few hills close to the sea are terraced and planted with olive and citrus trees. The villages of Himar√´ are perched up high on the spurs of the Ceraunian range in positions which offered natural defences against the nearby Lab Albanians during the Ottoman era.Hammond, 1993: p. 405: \\"It is one of the several Greek-speaking villages in which the centre is Himare... Liaps\\" Attractions Riviera of Himara The area has a great potential for tourism, with the major characteristics of the municipal town being its seaside promenade, the Greek tavernas and the traditionally preserved old town built on a hill.; The town of Himar√´ consists of the old town, Kastro, situated on and around the old castle and the coastal region of Spilea, which is the touristic and economic center of the region. Other parts of the town are Potami, Livadhi, Zhamari, Michaili and Stefaneli. North of the town of Himar√´ lie the villages of Vuno, Ilias, Dh√´rmi, with its coastal region Jaliskari, and Palas√´. Dhermi contains a number of recently built beach resorts. On the mountains lie Pilur and Kudh√´s, while Qeparo lies to the south of the town of Himar√´. The region has several Orthodox churches and monasteries, built with traditional Byzantine architecture, like the Monastery of the Cross, Athaliotissa, Saint Theodore, Virgin Mary in Dh√´rmi and Saint Demetrius. Moreover, a number of churches are located inside the castle of Himar√´, which was initially built in classical antiquity, like the Church of Virgin Mary Kasopitra, Episkopi, which is built on the site of an ancient temple dedicated to Apollo, as well as the Aghioi Pantes church, in the entrance of the castle. Additional monuments in the castle include the mansion of the Spyromilios family and the Greek school.  History = Antiquity  Tribes of Epirus in ancient times In antiquity the region was inhabited by the Greek tribe of the Chaonians. \\"Epirus was a land of milk and animal products...The social unit was a small tribe, consisting of several nomadic or semi-nomadic groups, and these tribes, of which more than seventy names are known, coalesced into large tribal coalitions, three in number: Thesprotians, Molossians and Chaonians...We know from the discovery of inscriptions that these tribes were speaking the Greek language (in a West-Greek dialect)\\" The Chaonians were one of the three principal Greek-speaking tribes of Epirus, along with the Thesprotians and the Molossians.Hecataeus of Miletus, Fr.103Plutarch, Pyrrhus at The Internet Classics Archive The town of Himar√´ is believed to have been founded as ChimairaChimaira, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, at Perseus (ŒßŒØŒºŒ±ŒπœÅŒ±An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen, 2005, p. 340) by the Chaonians as a trading outpost on the Chaonian shore. However, another theory suggest that it comes from Greek œáŒµŒØŒºŒ±œÅœÅŒøœÇ (cheimarros), meaning \\"torrent\\".Cheimarros, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus In classical antiquity, Himar√´ was part of the Kingdom of Epirus under the rule of the Molossian Aeacid dynasty, which included King Pyrrhus of Epirus. When the region was conquered by the Roman Republic in the 2nd century BC, its settlements were badly damaged and some were destroyed by the Roman General Aemilius Paulus.  Middle Ages  Ruins of the Himara Fortress, locally known as 'Kastro' meaning castle Himara and the rest of the southern Balkans passed into the hands of the Byzantine EmpireBadlands, borderlands: a history of Northern Epirus/Southern Albania by Tom Winnifrith,2002,, p. 80 following the fall of Rome, but like the rest of the region it became the frequent target of various attackers including the Goths, Avars, Slavs, Bulgars, Saracens and Normans. Himara is mentioned in Procopius of Caesarea's Buildings (544)Epirus Vetus: The Archaeology of a Late Antique Province (Duckworth Archaeology) by William Bowden,2003,,2003, p. 14 as Chimaeriae, being part of Old Epirus and that a new fortress was built in its location. In 614, the Slavic tribe of the Baiounetai invaded the area and controlled a region from Himar√´ to Margariti called \\"Vagenetia\\". The use of the name \\"Chaonia\\" in reference to the region apparently died out during the 12th century, the last time it is recorded (in a Byzantine tax collection document). In 1278, Nicephorus of Epirus surrendered to the Angevins the ports of Himar√´, Sopot and Butrint. As a result, Charles of Anjou controlled the Ionian coast from Himar√´ to Butrint. It was later ruled by Serbian Empire between 1342 and 1372. In 1372 Himar√´, together with Vlora, Kanina and Berat region was given as a dowry to Bal≈°a II due to his marriage with the daughter of John Komnenos Asen. After the death of Bal≈°a II, his widow and his daughter (who married Mrk≈°a ≈Ωarkoviƒá) managed to keep the possession of the region up to 1417 when the Ottomans captured Vlora.  Ottoman period  The flag of Himara during the Ottoman era, depicting the Archangels Michael and Gabriel The Ottoman Empire overran northern Epirus from the late 14th century, but being a natural fortress, Himara was the only region that did not submit to Ottoman rule. It became a symbol of resistance to the Ottomans but suffered from an almost continuous state of warfare. Himariotes participated in Skanderbeg's resistance against the Ottoman Empire. In the summer of 1473 the chieftain John Vlasis, with a small unit from nearby Corfu as well as with native Himariot support, took control of the entire coastal region from Sagiada to Himara, but when the ongoing Ottoman-Venetian war ended (1479) the region was again under Ottoman control.Sakellariou, 1997, p. 244: \\"In the summer of 1473 the chieftain John Vlasis and a small band of men, using Corfu as a base... while the inhabitants of Cheimara liberated many of the Greek villages.\\" In 1481, one year after the Ottomans had landed in Otranto in southern Italy, the Himariotes joined the forces of Gjon Kastrioti II (son of Skanderbeg) in his uprising against the Ottomans. The uprising failed, but the Himariotes rose up again in 1488, and between 1494‚Äì1509, destabilizing Ottoman control but failing to liberate their territory. The Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent personally mounted an expedition in 1537 that destroyed or captured many surrounding villages but did not manage to subdue the area. The Ottomans found it necessary to compromise with the inhabitants by giving them a series of privileges: local self-government, the right to bear arms, exemption from taxes, the right to sail under their own flag into any Ottoman port and to provide military service in time of war.Pappas, 1991: p. 35: \\"In 1537 the Ottomans mounted an expedition... the maritime privileges of Cheimarra.\\" However, despite the privileges, the Himariotes revolted during the following conflicts: Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1537‚Äì40), Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1570‚Äì73), Morean War (1684‚Äì99), Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1714‚Äì18) and the Russo- Turkish wars of the 18th century. On the other hand, Ottoman reprisals depopulated the area and led to forced Islamizations which finally limited the area's Christian population by the 18th century to the town of Himar√´ and six villages.Pappas, 1991: p. 36: \\"Even the special privileges which they enjoyed...\\" Additionally the Himariotes were often attacked by the Labs, a nearby Albanian tribe, on the grounds of race and religion.Hammond, 1993: p. 405 In one occasion, in 1577, the chieftains of Himar√´ appealed to the Pope for arms and supplies promising to fight the Ottomans. They also promised to transfer their religious allegiance to Rome, provided that they would retain their Eastern Orthodox liturgical customs \\"since the majority of the population was Greek and didn't understand the Frankish language\\". In various letters to European rulers the Himariotes claimed that they were once ruled by leaders such as Alexander the Great, Pyrrhus of Epirus and Skanderbeg, personalities with which the Himariotes formed identitarian historical memory. The most cited figure with which the Himarotes proud themselves through their past is Skanderbeg. During these years, the people of Himar√´ established close links to the Italian city states, especially Naples and the powerful Republic of Venice, which controlled Corfu and the other Ionian Islands, and later with Austro-Hungary. It was at this time (18th century), that many Himariotes emigrated to Italy, while they still maintain their Greek identity.Hammond, 1993: p. 405 The first school in the region opened in 1627, where lessons were held in the Greek language. The following years (until 1633) Greek-language schools opened also in the villages of Dh√´rmi and Palasa.Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 67. During the Ottoman period, judicial authority in Himar√´ and the surrounding villages was exercised by community courts also known as \\"councils of elders\\", that consisted exclusively of laymen. Their decisions was subject to the sanction of the local Orthodox bishop who belonged to the metropolis of Ioannina.Sakellariou, 1997, p. 255: \\"In Cheimara and the villages of its region (Nivitsa, Hagios Basileios, Loukovo, Keparon, Drymades, Vounos, Pikerni), the court consisted exclusively of elders (laymen), but the execution of its decisions was subject to the sanction of the local bishop (episcopal see at Bouthrotos), who was dependent on the metropolis of Ioannina\\" In 1720, the villages of Himara, Palasa, Ilias, Vuno, Pilur and Qeparo refused to submit to the Pasha of Delvina. In 1759-1760 local agents of the Russian Empire reported that the population of Himar√´ was willing to join an anti-Ottoman uprising, provided the Russians would support a liberation movement of the Greek-inhabited regions of the Ottoman Empire.Pappas, 1991, p. 69: \\"In late 1759 and early 1760, three letters arrived in St. Petersburg from Cheimarra. The first described the conditions of the territory and expressed the willingness of its population to rise against the Turks if the Russians came to free Greece\\"  Late Ottoman period  Ethnographic map based on the work of P. Aravandinos of the Epirus region from 1878 In 1797, Ali Pasha, the Muslim Albanian ruler of the Ottoman Pashalik of Yanina, led a raid on the town of Himar√´ because they supported his enemy, the Souliotes, and more than 6,000 civilians were slaughtered.Antonina Zhelyazkova. Urgent Anthropology. Vol. 2. Albanian Prospects. IMIR, Sofia, 2003. p. 90 Two years later, Ali Pasha tried to create good relations with the Himariotes after declaring their enclave part of his emerging semi-independent state, by financing various public works and churches. A church he built near Himar√´, opposite of the Porto Palermo (Panormos) Castle is the largest and most magnificent in the region and still stands today as a major tourist attraction. Ali Pasha's rule over Himar√´ lasted about 20 years until it was abruptly terminated by his murder at the hands of the Ottoman agents. Himar√´ subsequently reverted to its status quo ante of an enclave surrounded by Ottoman territory. To emphasize the region's special status, the terms that the Himariotes had reached with Suleiman the Magnificent were inscribed on bronze tablets at the request of their leaders, who wanted to record the agreement on a durable medium. These tablets are preserved to this day in the Topkapi palace museum in Istanbul. When the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1830) broke out, the people of Himar√´ rose in revolt.Pappas, 1991: p. 318: \\"Following the failure of an insurrection in Cheimarra in 1821\\" The local uprising failed, but many Himariotes, veterans of the Russian and French Army, joined the revolutionary forces in today southern Greece, where they played a significant role in the struggle.Banac, Ackerman, Szporluk, Vucinich, 1981: p.46: \\"Cheimarriote veterans played a significant role in the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830)\\" In 1854, during the Crimean War, a major local rebellion broke out, with Himar√´ being one of the first towns that joined it. Although the newly founded Greek state tried tacitly to support it, the rebellion was suppressed by Ottoman forces after a few months.Sakellariou, 1997, p. 288. The Himariotes were continuously held suspicious of supporting the expansionist plans of Greece in the region, especially during the era of the Albanian national awakening.  Modern  Spyros Spyromilios in the entrance of the castle (locally called Kastro) of Himara During the First Balkan War, on 18 November 1912, the town revolted under Spyros Spyromilios and expelled the Ottoman forcesBadlands, borderlands: a history of Northern Epirus/Southern Albania by Tom Winnifrith,2002,, page 129 in order to join Greece. In March 1914, the \\"Protocol of Corfu\\" was signed, which established the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, of which Himar√´ formed a part, though the Autonomous Republic itself formally remained part of the newly formed Albanian state. However, in the Panepirotic assembly in Delvin√´, that aimed at the ratifications of the terms of the Protocol by the Northern Epirote representatives, the delegates of Himar√´ abstained, insisting that only union with Greece would be a viable solution.Sakellariou, 1997, p. 381. During the First World War, Himar√´ was under Greek administration (October 1914-September 1916) and then occupied by Italy. The Italians used Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war to build a road running through Himar√´, which greatly reduced the region's isolation. Spiro Jorgo Koleka, a native of Vuno and a local leader of the Albanian national movement, opposed the annexation by foreign powers of Himara area and the wider region around Vlora. To that effect Koleka was an organiser of the Vlora War, where other local Himariots participated.Meta, Beqir (2008). \\"Ballafaqimi shqiptaro- grek p√´r Himar√´n (1920-1924) [Greek-Albanian confrontation in Himara (1920-1924)].\\" Studime Historike. 1-2: 43: \\"Pas mbarimit t√´ Luft√´s I Bot√´rore l√´vizja atdhetare shqiptare n√´ Himar√´ u rigjall√´rua.

A special place Spiro Gogo Koleka played, who assisted at the gathering of the Congress of Lushnja and implementation of its decisions. He and other patriots were signatory to many documents sent to the representatives of the Great Powers during the Peace Conference, that opposed any attempt to annex Vlora and Himar√´. In May 1920 Spiro G. Koleka was appointed member of the national government. He later became one of the organizers of the Vlora War against the Italians, where other Himariots participated.]\\" In 1921 the region came under the control of the Albanian state. The Himara question in 1921, regarding the rights of \\"Himariotes\\" and their villages Dh√´rmi, Vuno, Himara, Piluri, Kudh√´s and Qeparo, was supervised by Albanian government representative Spiro Jorgo Koleka. The government concluded that Albanian was obligatory in school, as the official language, while Greek was free to be taught as a second language, as desired by the people. The locals rose in revolt, in 1924, protesting against a series of measures aiming at Albanisation, and demanding the same privileges they enjoyed prior to incorporation to Albania.Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 124. Other uprisings followed in 1927 and 1932, both suppressed by the government of king Zog of Albania.Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 156. Later, Himar√´ was again occupied by the Italians as part of the Italian invasion in Albania. During the Greco-Italian War, the 3rd Infantry Division of the Greek Army entered Himar√´, on 22 December 1940, after victorious fighting against the Fascist Italian forces deployed in the region. The town briefly re-joined Greece until the German invasion in 1941. In 2015 the government merged Himara with the municipalities Hor√´-Vranisht and Lukov√´. The seat of the municipality is the town Himar√´.Law nr. 115/2014 Demographics The population of the Himar√´ region is 11,257 inhabitants,Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 44. with the ethnic composition of both the town and region predominantly Greek.Urgent anthropology Vol. 3.

Comparatively, the 2015 Albanian Civil Registry offices suggested a municipal population of 27,049 people, mostly as a result of the Greek community's boycotting of the 2011 census where it recorded only 5,738 people. Historically, there have been several conflicting theories about the ethnicity of the Himariotes. In the early 19th century according to Greek scholar and secretary to Ali Pasha Athanasios Psalidas, three villages of the area were considered Greek, while he also stated that there were also some Orthodox Albanian villages in the region.Kallivretakis, Leonidas (1995). \\"Œó ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ œÖœÄœå œÑŒø œÄœÅŒØœÉŒºŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ≥ŒµœâŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ±œÇ [The Greek Community of Albania in terms of historical geography and demography.\\" In Nikolakopoulos, Ilias, Kouloubis Theodoros A. & Thanos M.

The later factors indicate closer links with their Greek co- religionists than to the Muslim Albanian communities.Banac, Ackerman, Szporluk, Vucinich, 1981: p. 45: \\"Since, Himara has been part of the disputed border region of Greek and Albania in this century, the question of nationality of the Cheimarriotes has prompted much discussion... Leaving conflicting linguistic evidence aside and using the modern criteria of nationality, one cannot label the Cheimarriotes as either Greeks or Albanians. In a narrow sense their alegiances were to their respective clans and areas, and in a broader sense to their religious and cultural heritage. This latter allegiance to Orthodox Christianity would seem to indicate closer ties to their Greek coreligionists than to the Muslim Albanians.\\"  Religion  Bell tower of the Orthodox Church Part of the Dhermi village with two Orthodox church buildings visible The inhabitants of Himara are predominantly Orthodox Christians.Frank Kressing, Karl Kaser. Albania--a country in transition: aspects of changing identities in a South-East European country. Nomos, 2002. p. 129 In 1577, 38 chieftains of the Himara region appealed to Pope Gregory XIII for arms and supplies against the Ottomans. They promised to switch allegiance from the Orthodox to the Roman Catholic Church, and recognize Philip II of Spain as their sovereign. They asked to retain their Orthodox liturgical customs 'since the majority of the population is Greek and does not understand the Frankish language'. From 1577 to 1765 the population accepted the Pope as the religious head of the community and identified with the Roman Catholic Church. The success of the Roman Catholic missionaries among the Eastern-rite Albanians in Himar√´ led to the region becoming a refuge for Orthodox prelates that had converted. Himariotes thus largely adhered to Christian faith, although individual conversions to Islam were recorded from the early 16th century. One of them, Ajaz Pasha, became Grand Vizier and was sent by the Ottoman Sultan to put down the 1537 revolt of Himariotes. Even so, crypto-Christianity appeared, particularly in the villages of Fterre, Corraj, and Vuno. Moreover, Basilian missions were sent by Rome since 1682, founding a number of Greek schools. In August 2015 Albanian police demolished the renovated Orthodox church of Saint Athanasius in Dhermi, as local authorities weeks earlier declared it an \\"illegal construction\\". The Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania declared it a vandalistic act of desecration and a violation of church property and it also triggered diplomatic protests from Greece. \\"Albanian police have demolished a contested church dedicated to St Athanas in the southern village of Dhermi, angering the Orthodox Church and neighbouring Greece, which supports the Church's mission. The Orthodox Church called it a vandalistic act of desecration and a violation of church property.... Police used heavy machinery to reduce to rubble the roof built in 1994 to cover the foundations of a much older church destroyed during the communist era. The renovated church was declared an \\"illegal construction\\" by the local authorities in Himara municipality two weeks ago, pitting Albanian nationalists against the Greek-supported Orthodox Church.... Speaking about the church, Prime Minister Rama said on Monday that \\"the old church in Dhermi will be regenerated in the name of national heritage [over] the 'parking lot' that is illegal, which they call a church.\\"\\" This is the second demolition of the church, the first having taken place during the era of the People's Republic of Albania, but at the time the church was rebuilt by the local Orthodox Church after the restoration of Democracy in the country (1991). The Albanian government has promised to rebuild the church after archaeological excavations have taken place. \\"Po, do ta k√´rkojm√´ varrin e Nilo Katalanos.

This was expressed yesterday for \\"Gazeta Shqiptare\\", by the mayor of Himar√´, George Goro. Asked about the time of the demolition, he suggests that the village priest was notified a day prior regarding the demolition and had the time until 10 to remove items from the building‚Ä¶ For me it is a rash reaction, because there is no demolition of an object of worship, but an illegal construction on the ruins of a church with 500 years of history and of particular importance to the area and Albania, something which most of the residents of Dh√´rmi know.

Special appreciation and honor to the history of our ancestors as pioneers of the Renaissance.]\\" The demolition of the religious monument also triggered strong reactions from the European Commission.  Language  Himariote dialect of Greek= The vast majority of people in Himar√´, who call themselves \\"Horiani\\" (), meaning locals in the local Greek dialect,Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 43: most of the people who claim to originate from Himar√´/Himara area have declared themselves as horiani (pl.), meaning locals. are bilingual in both Albanian and Greek, while 85% of the municipality's population use Greek as their mother tongue according to the municipal authorities.Tourist Guide of Himar√´. Bashkia e Himares. In the intro, written by Vasilis Bolanos, the then- mayor. In the town of Himar√´ as well as in nearby villages of Dh√´rmi and Palasa mainly speak a unique local Greek dialect that preserves many archaic features no longer found in standard Modern Greek. This dialect has small variations in the way it is spoken in every town, especially in the accent. In the spring of 2006, a private Greek-language school opened in the town of Himar√´,Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 68 at the precise location where the Orthodox missionary Cosmas the Aetolian founded the Acroceraunian School in 1770. Elements of Slavic influence are limited compared to the neighboring Albanian idioms, as well as the other variants of the Greek language spoken in southeast Albania and Nart√´ region. = Himare subdialect of Lab Albanian = On the other hand, the surrounding towns of Ilias, Vuno, Qeparo, Kudh√´s and Pilur mainly speak the Lab Albanian dialect, a subdialect of Tosk Albanian.Gregoriƒç, 2008: p. 63. Lab Albanian as a whole, and especially the local dialect of Himare, are known for being conservative and preserving features of Old Albanian that are lost elsewhere in the Tosk south of Albania but typically preserved in the Gheg north, such as the vowel length distinction. Another conservative phonological trait of Lab is the lack of palatalization, making residents speak \\"shkjip\\", not \\"shqip\\" (as in Arb√´resh). The purported discovery of nasal vowels in the Himara region and the neighboring Kurvelesh region, a characteristic of Old Albanian that was lost in most Tosk but preserved in Gheg challenged the traditional view that the split between Gheg and Tosk was in part caused by the loss of nasalization in Tosk;: \\"Second difference is the existence of nasal vocals in Gheg which is not a characteristic of Tosk even sometimes the nasality is not really stressed. This nasal-oral feature, according to Desnickaja, forms one of the elements which differentiate the Albanian dialects whereas Gjinari cites Dilo Sheper who said that there are also some nasal vocals in some places of Eastern Albania such as in Kurvelesh and Himar√´ but the information at that time did not confirmed that\\". these finds were supported by a discovery of nasal vowels in the neighboring Lab dialect spoken in Borsh.. Elements of Slavic influence in the lexicon are also evident in the local Albanian idiom.  Politics  The possibility of victory by the Greek minority Unity for Human Rights Party in the municipal elections in the past triggered nationalist rhetoric, both at the local and even national level, and heightened tension in the town.http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/01/22/nb-01 Nationalist rhetoric during the campaign, both at the local and national level, had heightened tension in the town over a possible victory by the local ethnic Greek Human Rights Union Party. The Unity for Human Rights Party secured the greatest number of seats in the current municipal council, during the last municipal elections, however the mayorship was won by the Socialist party, and mayor is Gjergi Goro in the town of Himara (2011). In the last governmental elections (2013), the region of Himara voted 48.3% for the Socialist Party and 25.5% for the Unity of Human Rights party.results for the region of Himara in 2013, 2013.  Minority issues  While the situation of the Greek minority in Albania has improved since the fall of communism, ethnic tensions in Himara remain high. During the 1994 trial of the Omonoia members, an organization that represents the Greek minority in Albania, three local Greeks were arrested and beaten by the Albanian police after they were found in possession of leaflets calling for the release of the arrested Omonoia leaders. In 2008, a number of protests took place with the locals demanding land ownership and autonomy for the region. The house of former mayor of Himara's, Vasil Bollano, has been the target of a bomb attack twice, in 2004 and again in May 2010. On 12 August 2010, ethnic tensions soared after ethnic Greek shopkeeper Aristotelis Goumas was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by three Albanian youths with whom Goumas allegedly had an altercation when they demanded that he must not speak Greek to them in his store. Outraged locals blocked the main highway between Vlore and Saranda and demanded reform and increased local Himariote representation in the local police force. The incident was condemned by both the Greek and Albanian governments and three suspects are currently in custody awaiting trial. The census of 2011 included ethnicity for the first time, a long-standing demand of the Greek minority in Albania and of international organizations., however, Greek minority representatives found unacceptable article 20 of the Census law, according to which there is a $1,000 fine for declaring an ethnicity other than what was written down on someone's birth certificate. As a result, the census was boycotted by parts of the Greek community. In 2005, after years of unanswered demands, President Berisha authorized the opening of a Greek- language school in Himara partially funded by the Greek government. The school now has five teachers and 115 pupils. On 26 August 2015, Albanian government demolished the church of St. Athanasios at Dh√´rmi. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned this action. Sports The city of Himar√´'s soccer club KF Himara. The club currently plays in the Albanian Second Division.

He played in 1952 for the Dallas Texans and from 1953 to 1966 for the Baltimore Colts. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972. In 1969, Marchetti was named to the National Football League 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1994, Marchetti was named to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 2019, he was unanimously named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Early years Marchetti was born in Smithers, West Virginia, the son of Italian immigrants Ernesto and Maria. He enlisted in the U.S. Army after graduating high school in Antioch, California, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge as a machine gunner during World War II. Reflecting upon his World War II experience in a 2009 interview, Marchetti called it \\"life altering\\" and said \\"If I had not gone to the Army, what probably would have happened to me is, I would have gone to one of the factories, worked until I was 65, retired, and that would have been my life. That's what they did in Antioch. Because the war was coming to an end, I could have probably stayed home, graduated [from high school] and never had to go. But it was the best thing I ever did. It gave me the discipline that I needed in my life.\\"http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story/_/page/marchetti%2F091111/sportCat/nfl Upon returning home to California after the war, he attended Modesto Junior College for a year before joining the football program at the University of San Francisco, where his team enjoyed an undefeated season in 1951. He was selected in the second round of the 1952 NFL draft (14th overall) by the New York Yanks. In 2004, Marchetti was voted to the East-West Shrine Game Hall of Fame.Gino Marchetti (Class of 2004) - East-West Shrine Game Hall of Fame. Professional football career During his rookie season, the Yanks became the Dallas Texans, which became the Baltimore Colts in 1953. Marchetti played 13 seasons with the Colts and helped them win NFL Championships in 1958 and 1959. During his career, he was noted for being effective against the run and a relentless pass-rusher. He was voted \\"the greatest defensive end in pro football history\\" by the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972. He moved to left offensive tackle in 1954, a position Marchetti hated, but admitted that it taught him how to beat a blocker. He returned to defensive end in 1955 and made his first Pro Bowl. He made a big play in the 1958 NFL Championship Game when he prevented the New York Giants from gaining a first down by tackling Frank Gifford just a yard before the first down mark. He fractured his ankle on that same play but, as a team captain, insisted on watching the rest of the historic overtime contest from the sideline with his teammates rather than seeking immediate medical attention in the locker room. The injury forced him to miss the Pro Bowl that year and ended his string of nine consecutive Pro Bowl appearances. Marchetti was First-team All-Pro nine times and a Second- team selection once. Marchetti's stellar play led to his being called by Sid Gillman, the Los Angeles Rams head coach, \\"(T)he greatest player in football. It's a waste of time to run around this guy's end.

And he never let you rest.\\" Restaurant In 1959, Marchetti joined with several of his teammates, including Alan Ameche, and opened a fast food restaurant. The business grew, began to franchise, and would eventually become known as Gino's Hamburgers. It was a successful Mid- Atlantic regional fast food chain and had 313 company-owned locations when they were sold in 1982 to Marriott International, which abandoned the name in favor of their Roy Rogers restaurants.

It was founded on December 29, 1898, at City College of New York and is recognized as the first Jewish collegiate social fraternity. Originally a Zionist youth society, its purpose changed from Zionism in the fraternity's early years, and in 1954 the organization became nonsectarian and opened itself to non-Jewish members, changing its membership policy to include \\"All Men of Good Character\\". History=Founding The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was led until his death by Dr. Richard J. H. Gottheil, a professor of languages at Columbia University and a Zionist. On December 29, 1898, he formed a Zionist youth society with a group of students from several New York City universities. Fifteen young men ‚Äî among them Herman Abramowitz, Aaron Levy, Bernhard Bloch, David Liknaitz, Isidore Delson, Louis S Posner, Aaron Drucker, Bernhard Saxe, Bernard Ehrenreich, Herman Sheffield, Menachem Eichler, David Swick, Aaron Eiseman, Maurice Zellermayer and David Levine ‚Äî gathered at the Jewish Theological Seminary on that date to found the organization. The society was called Z.B.T., which referred to the first letters in the Hebrew phrase \\"Zion Be-mishpat Tipadeh\\", which translated means \\"Zion shall be redeemed with judgment\\". This is taken from Isaiah 1:27 ‚Äî \\"Zion be-mishpat tipadeh ve-shaveha be-tzedakah\\" (Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and they that return of her, with righteousness\\"). The word \\"judgment\\" is sometimes translated as \\"justice\\". The meaning of Z.B.T. was listed in the American Jewish Committee's annual report as early as 1900-1901. In 1903, Z.B.T. formally became Zeta Beta Tau, and its purpose shifted away from that of a Zionist youth organization as other Zionist organizations grew in prominence. The original Hebrew meaning of Z.B.T. is not esoteric. However, it was publicly revealed in the official written history of Zeta Beta Tau, Here's to Our Fraternity: One Hundred Years of Zeta Beta Tau, 1898‚Äì1998, by Marianne Rachel Sanua. Zeta Beta Tau expanded rapidly. By 1909, it had established 13 chapters in the Northeastern United States and a 14th at Tulane University in New Orleans. In 1913, it established its first Canadian chapter at McGill University in Montreal and, in the same year, Zeta Beta Tau was first represented at the National Interfraternity Conference. Five years later, it founded its first West Coast chapter at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. At the 1954 National Convention, the delegates amended Zeta Beta Tau's constitution, ritual and internal procedures both in theory and in practice to eliminate sectarianism as a qualification for membership. Mergers The Zeta Beta Tau has merged with four other national Jewish fraternities: Phi Alpha, Kappa Nu, Phi Sigma Delta and Phi Epsilon Pi, with chapters and colonies at over 90 campus locations. In 1959, Phi Alpha merged into Phi Sigma Delta, and in 1961 Kappa Nu merged into Phi Epsilon Pi. In 1969-70, Phi Sigma Delta and Phi Epsilon Pi merged into Zeta Beta Tau.Our Antecedent Groups Zeta Beta Tau's official name is \\"A Brotherhood of Kappa Nu, Phi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Sigma Delta and Zeta Beta Tau\\". Pledging abolished Zeta Beta Tau abolished the institution of pledging in 1989 as a way to combat and eliminate hazing, and replaced the pledging process with one in which new members are accepted as brothers upon receiving a bid to the fraternity. Zeta Beta Tau's decision to do away with pledging did not involve an associate membership process, however. Once a brother joins the fraternity he will receive all rights and responsibilities as the rest of the chapter, and shall be eligible for any position within the chapter regardless of how long he has been a brother. This decision was made in response to the Age of Liability, in which extensive research on hazing shed light on how the culture of subservient pledging led to a number of deaths nationwide. National philanthropies Children's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMNH), which raises funds for children's hospitals in North America, was chosen as an official philanthropy of the fraternity during a Supreme Council meeting in summer 2002. Chapters host Get on the Ball events in which people donate to CMNH to sign a large inflatable beach ball. The Zeta Beta Tau Foundation, a non-profit corporation exclusively committed to educational and charitable purposes that assist the Brothers of Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity, as another official philanthropic partner of the Fraternity. The foundation assists the fraternity by funding scholarships and academic and leadership programs to maximize their personal development and prepare them to be leaders of society. The scholarships and academic and leadership programs funded by the Foundation enhance the overall value of membership in Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity by complementing the collegiate educational experience. Jewish Women International has been the third official philanthropic partner of ZBT, since 2015. JWI is the leading Jewish organization working to empower women and girls by ensuring and protecting their physical safety and economic security, promoting and celebrating inter-generational leadership, and inspiring civic participation and community engagement. JWI provides chapters with prevention programming to create stronger and safer Greek communities. JWI works with students to create sexual assault and dating violence prevention programming so that they understand how to ask for consent, so that every bystander knows to intervene, so that if a friend discloses after an assault students know how to respond, how to identify an abusive relationship, and build a culture of respect. ZBT chapters raise funds for JWI's National Library Initiative, which creates libraries in domestic violence shelters nationwide - transforming basic spaces into comforting havens stocked with colorful furniture, toys, computers and dozens of brand-new books. Gift of Life Marrow Registry is another official partner of ZBT since 2017. It is an international bone marrow registry whose sole purpose is to find life-saving bone marrow transplants for those suffering from blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Gift of Life achieves this goal with the help of ZBT chapters from college campuses across the US who run registration drives and help find life-saving matches. Since the partnership began, ZBT brothers have added nearly 6,000 names to the donor registry, with nearly 70 matches and 11 life-saving transplants thus far. Semi-annual brotherhood review vote In conjunction with the 1989 abolition of pledging, ŒñŒíŒ§ National instituted the Semi-Annual Brotherhood Review Vote (SBRV). All ŒñŒíŒ§ chapters twice a year (once a semester) have a vote to see who, if anyone, should be removed from membership within a chapter. The ballots are counted by the president and an executive member of his choice. The criteria for voting during the SBRV are the Chapter Standards, which all chapters must make known to their membership. If a brother receives a simple majority of nay votes, he is expelled from the fraternity. The Journey Brotherhood Program Twenty years after ŒñŒíŒ§ eliminated pledging, the Supreme Council, based on feedback from undergraduates and alumni, voted to continue the evolution and development of what was initially called the Membership Development Program, then became the Brotherhood Program. The newest evolution is called the Journey. The Journey implements a number of significant changes. The Journey adds the position of Provost, in addition to the Brotherhood Development Director (BDD). In the past, the BDD was responsible for all education in the chapter. Now, the Provost teaches members about the history, values, and traditions of organization. The BDD oversees the Provost, and still is responsible for overall program. Through the first six weeks of the Journey, newly initiated ŒñŒíŒ§ men learn the history of the fraternity, delve into the credo, mission statement and ritual, the skills needed to succeed in college, and how to make wise life decisions. Upon initiation, all ŒñŒíŒ§ brothers are given full rights and privileges, within days of accepting their bids. This is true for all versions of the Journey. The Journey then continues to develop brothers for the next four years, offering education on building a better brotherhood and strong leadership skills. The Journey also offers a leadership track. Controversies In 1988, the ZBT chapter at the University of Wisconsin-Madison held a mock slave auction featuring blackface and racial slurs. New pledges were dressed in wigs and \\"sold\\" for their services. This incident resulted in widespread campus protests against the fraternity, which was accused of creating a hostile environment for minorities.\\"Inquiry on Fraternity 'Slave Auction'\\", The New York Times, 26 October 1988 \\\\- \\"Campuses Struggling With Racism\\", Chicago Tribune, 6 November 1988. In February 1988, the Judicial Inquiry Office of the University of Pennsylvania charged the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity with violating seven Pennsylvania statutes and University of Pennsylvania guidelines including sexual and racial harassment during a fraternity rush event on October 1, 1987. The fraternity was accused of hiring two African American women to perform before an audience of 100-200 men during the rush event. While the two women were undressing, the crowd yelled \\"Where did you get them niggers?\\" and other racist remarks. In June 2016, the Miami University chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was suspended until May 2018 because of hazing violations. In February 2018, the Cornell University chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was placed on probation for two years following an investigation into multiple reports of \\"pig roasts\\" in which men competed to try to sleep with and humiliate women they considered to be overweight.\\"Cornell fraternity Zeta Beta Tau suspended for offensive ‚Äúpig roast‚Äù game\\" In September 2018, Syracuse University's student newspaper published a video showing Zeta Beta Tau members forcibly spitting into pledges' mouths and covering their faces with a wet mop.\\"Video surfaces showing behavior that led to Zeta Beta Tau fraternity‚Äôs disciplinary probation, SU official confirms\\", Daily Orange  Warrior Beach Retreat controversy  While in Panama City Beach, Florida, on April 17, 2015, for a spring formal, members of the fraternity's University of Florida chapter were accused of abusing disabled military veterans. The Warrior Beach Retreat provides wounded veterans a place to relax and heal. The event was allegedly disrupted by a band of fraternity brothers who were accused of disrespecting and dishonoring the veterans. According to Warrior Beach Retreat's founder, Linda Cope, the students were antagonizing veterans. She stated that some of the men made inappropriate comments to the spouses of veterans. One veteran said that he and his service dog were spat on, and that beer was poured on them from the 20th floor. * The University of Florida placed the ZBT chapter on interim suspension and charged the organization with a series of offenses as part of its formal investigation into the allegations of the event in Panama City Beach. Laurence Bolotin, the executive director of Zeta Beta Tau International, issued a statement on the organization's web site that noted, in part, \\"While the details of their actions are still under investigation, there is no doubt that some of our members engaged in ugly and unacceptable behavior. Their actions have no place in ŒñŒíŒ§ or anywhere, and they will not be tolerated. On behalf of our entire organization, I want to apologize to veterans, both those who were in Panama City Beach, and those who have felt the pain from afar, as well as to their families...\\"Statement from Laurence Bolotin, Executive Director of Zeta Beta Tau International Regarding Panama City Beach Incident Zeta Beta Tau, 23 April 2015 The president of the University of Florida, W. Kent Fuchs, called the actions of the fraternity members unacceptable and committed to a full investigation. Ultimately, no criminal charges were filed and a University of Florida investigation resulted in the fraternity being charged with causing potential harm to others, obscenity and public intoxication. One of the students present said they were not even aware that there was a Wounded Warrior‚Äôs beach retreat. The university said that the immediate suspension of the chapter was primarily for safety reasons because of the high number of threats made to the chapter and its members after news of the incident surfaced. Zeta Beta Tau at the University of Florida has since been re-formed.  University of California, Los Angeles Controversy  In August 2018, the ZBT National Fraternity and the chapter at the University of California, Los Angeles, were sued for negligence, assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit also encompassed the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity as well as UCLA. The lawsuit stemmed from the continuous denial and \\"sweeping under the rug\\" of complaints regarding rape and sexual assault and failing to adhere to their policies regarding alcohol consumption and abuse. Notable alumni Chapter house of Zeta Beta Tau's Zeta Alpha Chapter at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. Chapters Zeta Beta Tau has 82 chapters and colonies in the United States and Canada. The state with the most chapters is New York. Currently, the oldest active chapter is Gamma at New York University. In 2019, the largest ŒñŒíŒ§ chapter was Lambda at The University of Texas at Austin.

EpisodesProduction The series was originally commissioned from Davies by Executive Producer Julie Gardner when she was working at Granada-owned London Weekend Television. However, after Gardner moved on to become Head of Drama at BBC Wales in 2003, she commissioned Davies to write the drama for the BBC instead, as part of the deal that also saw him installed as the chief writer and Executive Producer of Doctor Who (in which Tennant later played the Doctor's tenth incarnation), also being overseen by Gardner and made at BBC Wales. It was Tennant's role as Giacomo that led to Davies casting him in Doctor Who as the Tenth Doctor. It was aired in the United States in two parts, 8 and 15 October 2006, with the full unedited British version released on DVD the following week, 17 October 2006. The programme also aired in Australia on the ABC, again edited into two parts. Home release The serial was released on DVD in the UK in May 2005, and in the United States in October 2006.

It is a form of file literal or here document. This technique allows normally separate elements such as images and style sheets to be fetched in a single Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, which may be more efficient than multiple HTTP requests, and used by several browser extensions to package images as well as other multimedia contents in a single HTML file for page saving. , data URIs are fully supported by most major browsers, and partially supported in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Syntax The syntax of data URIs was defined in Request for Comments (RFC) 2397, published in August 1998, and follows the URI scheme syntax. A data URI consists of: data:[<media type>][;base64],<data> * The scheme, \`data\`. It is followed by a colon (\`:\`). * An optional media type. The media type part may include one or more parameters, in the format \`attribute=value\`, separated by semicolons (\`;\`) . A common media type parameter is \`charset\`, specifying the character set of the media type, where the value is from the IANA list of character set names. If one is not specified, the media type of the data URI is assumed to be \`text/plain;charset=US-ASCII\`. * An optional base64 extension \`base64\`, separated from the preceding part by a semicolon. When present, this indicates that the data content of the URI is binary data, encoded in ASCII format using the Base64 scheme for binary-to-text encoding. The base64 extension is distinguished from any media type parameters by virtue of not having a \`=value\` component and by coming after any media type parameters. Since Base64 encoded data is approximately 33% larger than original data, it is recommended to use Base64 data URIs only if the server supports HTTP compression or embedded files are smaller than 1KB. * The data, separated from the preceding part by a comma (\`,\`). The data is a sequence of zero or more octets represented as characters. The comma is required in a data URI, even when the data part has zero length. The characters permitted within the data part include ASCII upper and lowercase letters, digits, and many ASCII punctuation and special characters. Note that this may include characters, such as colon, semicolon, and comma which are delimiters in the URI components preceding the data part. Other octets must be percent-encoded. If the data is Base64-encoded, then the data part may contain only valid Base64 characters. Note that Base64-encoded \`data:\` URIs use the standard Base64 character set (with '\`+\`' and '\`/\`' as characters 62 and 63) rather than the so-called \\"URL- safe Base64\\" character set. Examples of data URIs showing most of the features are: :\`data:text/vnd-example+xyz;foo=bar;base64,R0lGODdh\` :\`data:text/plain;charset=UTF-8;page=21,the%20data:1234,5678\` (outputs: \\"the data:1234,5678\\") The minimal data URI is \`data:,\`, consisting of the scheme, no media-type, and zero-length data. Thus, within the overall URI syntax, a data URI consists of a scheme and a path, with no authority part, query string, or fragment. The optional media type, the optional base64 indicator, and the data are all parts of the URI path. Examples of use=HTML An HTML fragment embedding a picture of a small red dot: File:Red-dot-5px.png ![Red dot](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAA ANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4 //8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU 5ErkJggg) In this example, the lines are broken for formatting purposes. In actual URIs, including data URIs, control characters (ASCII 0 to 31, and 127) and spaces (ASCII 32) are \\"excluded characters\\". This means that whitespace characters are not permitted in data URIs. However, in the context of HTML 4 and HTML 5, linefeeds within an element attribute value (such as the \\"src\\" above) are ignored. So the data URI above would be processed ignoring the linefeeds, giving the correct result. But note that this is an HTML feature, not a data URI feature, and in other contexts, it is not possible to rely on whitespace within the URI being ignored.

Directed by Mark Cullingham and John Glenister, the serial was made by the BBC and screened on the BBC2 network in November and December 1971. It is loosely based on Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova's Histoire de ma vie (Story of My Life; 1780‚Äì1792). It was Dennis Potter's first television serial, having previously written single plays for the BBC's The Wednesday Play and Play for Today series. Frank Finlay starred in the title role and was nominated for the best actor award at the 1972 BAFTA ceremony. Plot=Episode one: \\"Steed in the Stable\\" After being arrested and charged with \\"foul atheism\\" and fornication, Casanova is sentenced to five years imprisonment at \\"The Leads\\": the most notorious of Venetian gaols. Brutalised by Lorenzo the gaoler and devoid of hope under the harsh prison regime, Casanova's mind wanders back to his past loves and adventures. He finds himself haunted by the memory of Christina, a simple country girl he gave to another rather than marry her himself. Episode two: \\"One at a Time\\" Casanova receives a new cellmate in the form of Schalon, a corrupt insurance broker, and reflects on his seduction of three daughters at a house in Grenoble. Episode three: \\"Magic Moments\\" Casanova is irritated by his constantly complaining cell mate Schalon and remembers how he once pretended to be a magician casting a spell to seduce the virgin daughter of an old naive man. Episode four: \\"Window, Window\\" The episode flashes back and forward between Casanova trying to seduce Anne Roman-Coupier, even though his friend strongly discourages this, and him trying to receive some books while being in prison. He is also haunted by memories of watching a man being executed and him smashing a window with a stone in Venice. Episode five: \\"Fevers of Love\\" While in his prison cell, Casanova is tormented by fever dreams and flashbacks to his past loves and especially his stay in London. Episode six: \\"Golden Apples\\" This episode flashes back and forward between Casanova finally managing to escape from his prison cell and him trying to write his memoirs in Castle of Duchcov near the end of his life as an old, dying man.

Trask published the first of his 12 volume translation of Casanova's memoirs while Potter was working as a book reviewer for The Times newspaper. Potter had been after a subject for his first drama serial and found in Casanova a suitable figure to continue the themes of sex, memory and redemption that had influenced much of his previous work. When writing the serial Potter decided not to read the story of Casanova's adventures, choosing instead to work from a list containing the names of Casanova's lovers and specific events from his life.\\"Most autobiographies are lying and self- serving,\\" Potter informed Graham Fuller in Potter on Potter; \\"And I assumed his would be no different.\\" Potter intended to explore the reason why Casanova was \\"driven\\" to have had so many sexual encounters. As a result, Potter's Casanova is far different from other interpretations of the character; he suffers from tristitia post-coitum (literally, the sadness after sex) and considers his reliance on women for sexual satisfaction a weakness. The serial includes a number of events that depart from established facts about Casanova. The series resulted in a number of complaints to the BBC. Clean-up TV campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who regularly found fault with Potter's work, thought the first two episodes \\"boring\\" and believed the third used a kind of Playboy flashback photography.Charles Gillies \\"Mrs Whitehouse, Casanova, and Tom Brown's Schooldays\\", Glasgow Herald, 8 December 1971, p.8 She commented to a journalist from The Glasgow Herald: \\"Of all the characters the BBC could have chosen to dramatise Casanova is the most ridiculous.\\" Home release Casanova was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2004, as part of The Dennis Potter Collection, a range of Potter's work released that year.

They were one of the companies involved in the development of the COBOL programming language.  History  Sylvania Model 4P14 (1961) radio, made of plastic Sylvania was a major manufacturer of vacuum tubes until the early 1980s Vacuum tube cartons displaying two generations of Sylvania branding SG7460 (7400 series) integrated circuit manufactured by Sylvania The Hygrade Sylvania Corporation was formed when NILCO, Sylvania and Hygrade Lamp Company merged into one company in 1931. In 1939, Hygrade Sylvania started preliminary research on fluorescent technology, and later that year, demonstrated the first linear, or tubular, fluorescent lamp. It was featured at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Sylvania was also a manufacturer of both vacuum tubes and transistors. In 1942, the company changed its name to Sylvania Electric Products Inc. During World War II, Sylvania was chosen from among several competing companies to manufacture the miniature vacuum tubes used in proximity fuze shells due to its quality standards and mass production capabilities.}} In 1959, Sylvania Electronics merged with General Telephone to form General Telephone and Electronics (GTE). Sylvania developed the earliest flash cubes for still cameras, later selling the technology to Eastman Kodak Company, and later a 10-flash unit called FlipFlash, as well as a line of household electric light bulbs, which continued during GTE's ownership and today is sold by Osram Sylvania. In June 1964, Sylvania unveiled a color TV picture tube in which europium-bearing phosphor was used for a much brighter, truer red than was possible before.https://www.nytimes.com/1964/06/05/archives/sylvania-develops-new- colortv-tube.html Through merger and acquisitions, the company became a significant, but never dominating supplier of electrical distribution equipment, including transformers and switchgear, residential and commercial load centers and breakers, pushbuttons, indicator lights, and other hard-wired devices. All were manufactured and distributed under the brand name GTE Sylvania, with the name Challenger used for its light commercial and residential product lines. GTE Sylvania contributed to the technological advancement of electrical distribution products in the late 1970s with several interesting product features. At the time, they were the leading supplier of vacuum cast coil transformers, manufactured in their Hampton, Virginia plant. Their transformers featured aluminum primary winding and were cast using relatively inexpensive molds, allowing them to produce cast coil transformers in a variety of KVA capacities, primary and secondary voltages and physical coil sizes, including low profile coils for mining and other specialty applications. They also developed the first medium voltage 3 phase panel that could survive a dead short across two phases. Their patented design used bus bar encapsulated in a thin coating of epoxy and then bolted together across all three phases, using special non-conductive fittings. By 1981 GTE had made the decision to exit the electrical distribution equipment market and began selling off its product lines and manufacturing facilities. The Challenger line, mostly manufactured at the time in Jackson, Mississippi, was sold to a former officer of GTE, who used the Challenger name as the name of his new company. Challenger flourished, and was eventually sold to Westinghouse, and later Eaton Corporation. By the mid-1980s, the GTE Sylvania electrical equipment product line and name was no more. In 1993 GTE exited the lighting business to concentrate on its core telecomms operations. The European, Asian and Latin American operations are now under the ownership of Havells Sylvania. With the acquisition of the North American division by Osram GmbH in January 1993 Osram Sylvania Inc. was established.The Washington Post: GTE to Sell Sylvania Light Unit, 1992-08-07  Brand name  In the early 1980s, GTE Sylvania sold the rights to the name Sylvania and Philco for use on consumer electronics equipment only, to the Netherlands' NV Philips. This marked the end of Sylvania's TV production in Batavia, New York, USA, and Smithfield, North Carolina, USA. The Sylvania Smithfield plant later became Channel Master. The rights to the Sylvania name in many countries are held by the U.S. subsidiary of the German company Osram. The Sylvania brand name is owned worldwide, apart from Australia, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and the USA, by Havells Sylvania, headquartered in London.  Osram Sylvania  Osram Sylvania manufactures and markets a wide range of lighting products for homes, business, and vehicles and holds a leading share of the North American lighting market [2]. In fiscal year 2008, the company achieved sales of about 1.75 billion euros, which comprised about 38% of Osram's total sales at the time. Osram Sylvania Management presentation June 25, 2009 Osram's worldwide lighting businesses employed about 9,000 people at the time. In 2016, Osram spun off the general lighting business which included the North American Osram Sylvania unit into an independent company called LEDVANCE headquartered in Garching, Germany. In 2017, LEDVANCE was merged into a consortium of Chinese investment companies and the Chinese lighting manufacturer MLS under the LEDVANCE name. The North American headquarters of LEDVANCE, previously referred to as Osram Sylvania, and located in Danvers, Massachusetts, was relocated to Wilmington, Massachusetts in 2015, a town north of Boston, MA. LEDVANCE continues to use the well known Osram and Sylvania brand names in their corresponding and representative markets throughout the world.

Life Holl was born in London to family of noted engravers, being the son of Francis Holl , as well as a nephew of William Holl the Younger and a grandson of William Holl the Elder, whose profession he originally intended to follow. He was educated mainly at University College School. Entering the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer in painting in 1860, he rapidly progressed, winning silver and gold medals, and making his debut as an exhibitor in 1864 with A Portrait, and Turned out of Church, a subject picture. A Fern Gatherer (1865); The Ordeal (1866); Convalescent (the somewhat grim pathos of which attracted much attention), and Faces in the Fire (1867), succeeded. Holl gained the travelling studentship in 1868; the successful work was characteristic of the young painter's mood, being The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. In 1869 he was recruited as an artist by the wood-engraver and social reformer William Luson Thomas, to work on Thomas's newly founded newspaper, The Graphic. In 1886, he produced a portrait of Millais as his diploma work, but his health rapidly declined and he died at Hampstead, north London, on 31 July 1888. He is buried in Highgate Cemetery. Works I am the Resurrection and the Life, or, The Village Funeral (1872) Overwork undermined Holl's health, but his reputation was assured by the studentship picture. In 1870 he painted Better is a Dinner of Herbs where Love is, than a Stalled Ox and Hatred therewith; No Tidings from the Sea, a scene in a fisherman's cottage, in 1871‚Äîa story told with breath- catching pathos and power; I am the Resurrection and the Life (1872); Leaving Home (1873), Deserted (1874), both of which had great success; Her First-born, girls carrying a baby to the grave (1876); and Going Home (1877). Van Gogh admired Holl's works and wrote enthusiastically to his brother Theo about them. In 1877 he painted the two pictures Hush and Hushed. Newgate, Committed for Trial, first attested the breaking down of the painter's health in 1878. In this year he was elected A.R.A., and exhibited The Gifts of the Fairies, The Daughter of the House, Absconded, and a portrait of Samuel Cousins the mezzotint engraver. Holl was overwhelmed with commissions, which he would not decline. The consequences of this strain upon a constitution which was never strong were more or less, though unequally, manifest in Ordered to the Front, a soldier's departure (1880); Home Again, its sequel, in 1883 (after which he was made Royal Academician). Holl's major portraits include likenesses of Lord Roberts, painted for Queen Victoria (1882); the Prince of Wales (1882‚Äì83); Lord Dufferin, the Duke of Cleveland (1885); Lord Overstone, John Bright, Mr Gladstone, Joseph Chamberlain, John Tenniel, Earl Spencer, Viscount Cranbrook, and a score of others.

Also, prospective students need to have a minimum of three years' professional work experience in the global wine community. Applicants must submit a basic essay, a tasting paper, a brief statement explaining their interest in becoming a Master of Wine, and a reference to support their application, from a Master of Wine or another senior wine trade professional.http://www.mastersofwine.org/en/education/who-can-apply.cfm The study programme is made up of three stages. Stage 1 is the foundation year and gives students the opportunity to meet Masters of Wine and fellow students in both professional and social settings. Stage 1 assessment includes six pieces of work evaluated during the year, culminating in an exam that takes place in early June. The exam involves one tasting paper and two essays. Stage 2 is a crucial time for students and can be very intense. Students must provide three pieces of work for assessment during the Stage 2 year, and must pass both the Theory and Practical parts of the June MW Examination. Stage 3 consists of writing a sole-authorship research paper of between 6,000 and 10,000 words in length on a topic of the student's choice. The qualification process takes at least three years to complete.

His research interests extend over most aspects of information processing in quantum-mechanical systems, with a focus on quantum communication and quantum computation. He is best known as one of the pioneers of quantum cryptography. Early life Ekert was born in Wroc≈Çaw, and studied physics at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow and at the University of Oxford. Between 1987 and 1991 he was a graduate student at Wolfson College, Oxford. In his doctoral thesis he showed how quantum entanglement and non- locality can be used to distribute cryptographic keys with perfect security. Career In 1991 he was elected a junior research fellow and subsequently (1994) a research fellow at Merton College, Oxford. At the time he established the first research group in quantum cryptography and computation, based in the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford. Subsequently, it evolved into the Centre for Quantum Computation, now based at DAMTP in Cambridge. Between 1993 and 2000 he held a position of the Royal Society Howe Fellow. In 1998 he was appointed a professor of physics at the University of Oxford and a fellow and tutor in physics at Keble College, Oxford. From 2002 until early 2007 he was the Leigh- Trapnell Professor of Quantum Physics at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge University and a professorial fellow of King's College, Cambridge. Since 2007 he has been a professor of quantum physics at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, and a Lee Kong Chian Centennial Professor at the National University of Singapore. He has worked with and advised several companies and government agencies. He has served on several professional advisory boards and is one the trustees of The Croucher Foundation. Research Ekert's research extends over most aspects of information processing in quantum-mechanical systems, with a focus on quantum cryptography and quantum computation. Building on the idea of quantum non-locality and Bell's inequalities he introduced entanglement-based quantum key distribution. His 1991 paper generated a spate of new research that established a vigorously active new area of physics and cryptography. It is one of the most cited papers in the field and was chosen by the editors of the Physical Review Letters as one of their \\"milestone letters\\", i.e. papers that made important contributions to physics, announced significant discoveries, or started new areas of research. His subsequent work with John Rarity and Paul Tapster, from the Defence Research Agency (DRA) in Malvern, resulted in the proof-of-principle experimental quantum key distribution, introducing parametric down-conversion, phase encoding and quantum interferometry into the repertoire of cryptography. He and collaborators were the first to develop the concept of a security proof based on entanglement purification. Ekert and colleagues have made a number of contributions to both theoretical aspects of quantum computation and proposals for its experimental realisations. These include proving that almost any quantum logic gate operating on two quantum bits is universal, proposing one of the first realistic implementations of quantum computation, e.g. using the induced dipole-dipole coupling in an optically driven array of quantum dots, introducing more stable geometric quantum logic gates, and proposing \\"noiseless encoding\\", which became later known as decoherence free subspaces. His other notable contributions include work on quantum state swapping, optimal quantum state estimation and quantum state transfer. With some of the same collaborators, he has written on connections between the notion of mathematical proofs and the laws of physics. He has also contributed semi-popular writing on the history of science. Honours and awards For his discovery of quantum cryptography he was awarded the 1995 Maxwell Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics, the 2007 Hughes Medal by the Royal Society and the 2019 Micius Prize (http://miciusprize.org/). He is also a co-recipient of the 2004 European Union Descartes Prize. In 2016 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He married Aleida Schaap and the couple had two children, a daughter Mathilde Anna Isra√´ls and a son, Isaac Lazarus Isra√´ls, born Amsterdam 3 February 1865, who also became a fine art painter. Sensibility Isra√´ls on the beach at Scheveningen (1911) Isra√´ls has often been compared to Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. As artists, even more than as painters in the strict sense of the word, they both, in fact, saw in the life of the poor and humble a motive for expressing with peculiar intensity their wide human sympathy; but Millet was the poet of placid rural life, while in almost all Isra√´ls' pictures there is some piercing note of woe. Edmond Duranty said of them that they were painted with gloom and suffering. He began with historical and dramatic subjects in the romantic style of the day. By chance, after an illness, he went to recuperate his strength at the fishing- town of Zandvoort near Haarlem, and there he was struck by the daily tragedy of life. Thenceforth he was possessed by a new vein of artistic expression, sincerely realistic, full of emotion and pity. Among his more important subsequent works are The Zandvoort Fisherman (in the Amsterdam Gallery), The Silent House (which gained a gold medal at the Brussels Salon, 1858) and Village Poor (a prize at Manchester). In 1862, he achieved great success in London with his Shipwrecked, purchased by Mr Young, and The Cradle, two pictures that the Athenaeum magazine described as the most touching pictures of the exhibition.

In 1893, the painter and art critic Jan Veth wrote: Rembrandt's great pathos seems to be resurrected in Jozef Isra√´ls\\". Wetering, pages 133-4. As a watercolour painter and etcher he produced a vast number of works, which, like his oil paintings, are full of deep feeling. They are generally treated in broad masses of light and shade, which give prominence to the principal subject without any neglect of detail. Isra√´ls probably influenced many other painters and one them was the Scottish painter Robert McGregor (1847-1922).

It hosts the Mangla Power Station, which is the second largest in Pakistan. Mangla is the site of the historic Mangla Fort. The fort is situated on a high hill overlooking the Jhelum river, dividing the Mirpur and Jhelum districts. A part of Mangla fort was razed during the construction of the Mangla Dam, however, a large part remains and serves as a public recreation place. After the completion of Mangla Dam, most of the Baral & Sultanpure Thill Area was taken over by Pak Army and converted into a Cantonment whereas a small section within the compound walls of Pakistan Army's Officers residences, known as Baral Colony, was allotted to WAPDA named as WAPDA OFFICERS COLONY.

Coming from Dedham, Essex in southeastern England, he and several of his siblings and cousins settled in New England. His first residence was in Roxbury in the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he lived for a few years, but he became interested in the teachings of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson, and at the conclusion of the Antinomian Controversy he was disarmed and forced to leave the colony. He went with many followers of Hutchinson to establish the town of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island, later called Rhode Island. He became the first secretary of the colony there, and served in many other roles in the town government. Sherman became a Quaker after settling in the Rhode Island colony, and died at an advanced age, leaving a large progeny.  Life  Born in the village of Dedham in Essex, near the southeast coast of England, Philip Sherman (often spelled Shearman) was the son of Samuel and Philippa (Ward) Sherman. His grandfather and great grandfather were both named Henry Sherman. In 1633, he arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, settling in Roxbury, where he was made a freeman the following year. Portsmouth Compact with Sherman's signature 13th on the list In time, Sherman became attracted to the preachings of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson, during the so-called Antinomian Controversy, and following their banishment from the Massachusetts colony, Sherman and many other followers were disarmed. On 20 November 1637, he and others were ordered to deliver up all guns, pistols, swords, powder, and shot because the \\"opinions and revelations of Mr. Wheelwright and Mrs. Hutchinson have seduced and led into dangerous errors many of the people here in New England.\\" The Roxbury church records give this account of Sherman, \\"He came into the land in the year 1632 [sic; should read 1633], a single man, & after married Sarah Odding, the daughter o[f] the wife of John Porter by a former husband. This man was of melancholy temper, he lived honestly & comfortably among us several years, upon a just calling went for England & returned again with a blessing: but after his father-in-law John Porter was so carried away with these opinions of familism & schism he followed them & removed with them to the Iland, he behaved himself sinfully in these matters (as may appear in the story) & was cast out of the church.\\" Scores of the followers of Wheelwright and Hutchinson were ordered out of the Massachusetts colony, but before leaving, a group of them, including Sherman, signed what is sometimes called the Portsmouth Compact, establishing a non-sectarian civil government upon the universal consent of the inhabitants, with a Christian focus. Planning initially to settle in New Netherland, the group was persuaded by Roger Williams to purchase some land of the Indians on the Narragansett Bay. They settled on the north east end of Aquidneck Island, and established a settlement they called Pocasset, but in 1639 changed the name to Portsmouth. William Coddington was elected the first judge (governor) of the settlement. Sherman was in Portsmouth by May 1638 when he was present at a general meeting, and the following year, he was selected as Secretary. In 1640, he and four others were chosen to lay out lands within the town, and the following year, he was made a freeman. From 1648 to 1651, he was the General Recorder for the town, and from 1649 to 1656, he was the town clerk. He sat on the Portsmouth town council for many years from 1649 to 1657, and again in the early 1670s, but appears to have stayed out of public service between 1657 and 1665. From 1665 to 1667, he once again served in a civil capacity when he was elected as a Deputy from Portsmouth. Though Sherman was never the governor or deputy governor of the colony, that he was highly esteemed by his fellow citizens was made very clear in 1676, during the difficult times of King Philip's War. On 4 April in that year, it was voted by the General Assembly that \\"in these troublesome times and straits in this Colony, this Assembly desiring to have the advice and concurrence of the most judicious inhabitants, if it may be had for the good of the whole, do desire at their next sitting the company and counsel of...Philip Shearman..\\" and 15 others, including several former governors and deputy governors such as Benedict Arnold, Gregory Dexter, and James Barker. Sherman wrote his will on 30 July 1681, and it was proved on 22 March 1687. He had become a member of the Religious Society of Friends, better known as Quakers. His house, originally built in 1670, still stands in Portsmouth as a private residence, though moved from its original location.  Family and descendants  While still living in Roxbury, in the Massachusetts colony, Sherman married Sarah Odding, the daughter of William and Margaret Odding. He and Sarah had a large family of at least 11 children, most of whom survived childhood, married, and had large families. Sherman's mother-in-law, Margaret Odding, married secondly John Porter, another signer of the Portsmouth Compact. With Margaret, Porter had one child, Hannah, who married Samuel Wilbur, Jr., whose father, Samuel Wilbore was another signer of the compact. Among the many descendants of Philip and Sarah Sherman are former United States Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Other descendants include James S. Sherman, Susan B. Anthony, Janis Joplin, Sir Winston Churchill, Lyndon LaRouche, Conrad Aiken, Mamie Eisenhower, Taylor Swift and possibly Marilyn Monroe.  Ancestry  The ancestry of Philip Sherman is covered in Roy V. Sherman's 1968 genealogy of the family, with additional material published in 2013 by Michael Wood.

Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard University. An influential figure in both disciplines, Skocpol is best known as an advocate of the historical-institutional and comparative approaches, as well as her \\"state autonomy theory.\\" She has written widely for both popular and academic audiences. In historical sociology, Skocpol's works and opinions have been associated with the structuralist school. As an example, she argues that social revolutions can best be explained given their relation with specific structures of agricultural societies and their respective states. Such an approach differs greatly from more \\"behaviorist\\" ones, which tend to emphasize the role of \\"revolutionary populations,\\" \\"revolutionary psychology,\\" and/or \\"revolutionary consciousness,\\" as determinant factors of revolutionary processes. Her 1979 book States and Social Revolutions was highly influential in research on revolutions, ushering in a new paradigm. According to her profile on the Harvard Department of Sociology website, her current research agenda focuses on ‚ÄúU.S. social policy and civic engagement in American democracy, including changes since the 1960s. She has recently launched new projects on the development of U.S. higher education and on the transformations of U.S. federal policies in the Obama era.‚Äù Biography Theda Skocpol was born in Detroit, Michigan on May 4, 1947.. Both of her parents were teachers. Her mother wanted her to study home economics at a small liberal arts college, while her father was concerned about the cost of college education. She earned her B.A. in sociology at Michigan State University in 1969. While she attended Michigan State, she participated in the antiwar movement in response to the Vietnam War. Through the Methodist student association, she went to Rust College, a historically black college in Holly Springs, Mississippi, to teach English and math to incoming freshman. Many of the students were from sharecropper families, and were first-generation college students. She called her time in Mississippi observing racism and segregation \\"life-changing\\". She then went on to earn her M.A. (1972), and Ph.D. at Harvard University (1975). While attending Harvard University, Skocpol studied with Barrington Moore Jr. From 1975‚Äì1981, Skocpol served as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Sociology, at Harvard University. During this time, Skocpol published her first of many books, States and Social Revolutions: A comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in Russia, France and China (1979). Some of her subsequent work focused on methodology and theory, including the co-edited volume Bringing the State Back In, which heralded a new focus by social scientists on the state as an agent of social and political change. In 1981, Skocpol moved on to work at the University of Chicago. For the next five years, Skocpol would serve as an Associate Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and of Social Science, Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and Director for the Center for the Study of Industrial Societies. In the early 1980s, Skocpol publicly alleged that Harvard University had denied her tenure (1980) because she was a woman. This charge was found to be justified by an internal review committee in 1981. In 1984, Harvard University offered Skocpol a tenured position (its first ever for a female sociologist), which she accepted. From 1986 to the present, Skocpol has held various positions at Harvard University to include: Professor of Sociology; Director for the Center for American Political Studies; Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; and presently is the Professor of Government and of Sociology, Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology.  Honors and titles  Throughout her career, Skocpol has held many positions at various academic, and professional organizations, some of which include: President of Politics and History Section, Chairperson, and later Council member of the American Political Science Association (1991‚Äì1996). Out of over one hundred past presidents, since 1903, only about ten women have held that office. Skocpol is also Founder and Co-Editor, Princeton Studies in American Politics: Historical, Comparative, and International Perspectives (1993 ‚Äì present); and Senior Advisor in the Social Sciences, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study (2006‚Äì2008). According to her Curriculum Vitae Skocpol has been distinguished by over twenty awards and honors, some of which are: C. Wright Mills Award of The Society for the Study of Social Problems in 1979; elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2006; and she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2008. Her book Protecting Soldiers and Mothers (1992) was awarded the 1993 Woodrow Wilson Award for best book in political science by the American Political Science Association. She is also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. In 2007, she was awarded the Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science, one of the world's most prestigious prizes in political science for her \\"visionary analysis of the significance of the state for revolutions, welfare, and political trust, pursued with theoretical depth and empirical evidence.\\" In 2015, she was named an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University (term: 2015‚Äì2021). In Oktober 2019 Skocpol was awarded with an honorary doctorate from Radboud University Nijmegen.  Major works and contributions =States and Social Revolutions (1979) Skocpol‚Äôs most famous book, States and Social Revolutions: A comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in Russia, France and China (1979), discusses how most theories account only for direct action in bringing about revolutions. Social Revolutions are fast-paced foundational transformations of society's state and class structures. She includes the structure involved in creating a revolutionary situation that can lead to a social revolution - one that changes civic institutions and government once the administration and military branches collapse. In her text, Skocpol \\"offers a framework of reference for analyzing social-revolutionary transformations in modern world history\\" and discusses and compares the causes of The \\"French Revolution\\" of 1787‚Äì1800, The Russian Revolution of 1917‚Äì1921, and The Chinese Revolution of 1911‚Äì1949. According to Skocpol, there are two stages to social revolutions: a crisis of state and the emergence of a dominant class to take advantage of a revolutionary situation. The crisis of state emerges from poor economy, natural disaster, food shortage, or security concerns. Leaders of the revolution also have to face these constraints, and their handling of them affects how well they re-establish the state. Skocpol uses Marxism‚Äôs class struggle to assert that the main causes of social unrest are state social structures, international competitive pressures, international demonstrations, and class relations. Critics suggest that Skocpol ignores the role of individuals and ideology and uses varied comparative methodological strategies. State Autonomy Theory Before she wrote Protecting Soldiers and Mothers, Skocpol first devised what she termed State Autonomy Theory. This theory underlined the idea that state bureaucracies could have the potential for autonomous operations, and that this potential was ignored by scientists who were focused on society-centric studies. Skocpol considers the idea that parties are more important in America than the government, and that class dominance plays heavily into American politics.Skocpol, Theda, Peter Evans, and Dietrich Rueschemeyer. \\"Bringing the state back in.\\" Cambridge (1999). Protecting Soldiers and Mothers (1992) In this book, Skocpol considers increased benefits for Civil War veterans and their families resulting from competitive party politics, as well as greater actions taken in women's movements. Soldiers and mothers benefited from social spending, labor regulations, and health education through reformative women's clubs across the nation. Simultaneously, Skocpol refutes her claim that theorists had ignored states' independent power in her state autonomy theory, explaining \\"my state- centered theoretical frame of reference had evolved into a fully 'polity- centered approach,' meaning that social movements, coalitions of pressure groups, and political parties must be given their due in understanding power in America.\\" Skocpol explains how clubs and associations fill the vacuum left by fewer bureaucracies and an official church throughout the country, offering a case study in how women succeeded in gaining labor rights, pensions, minimum wage, and subsidized natal health clinics. Further, Skocpol points out that women were able to overcome class disparity to achieve these goals, working at a national level, influencing representatives with books, TV, magazines, and meetings. Diminished Democracy (2003) Diminished Democracy discusses the changes in US public involvement and its recent concerning decline. Skocpol talks about how to reverse it in explaining how the U.S. became a civic nation, the organizers of that movement, management of civic organizations, changes in them, the harmful effects of that change, and how to recreate a sense of citizenship. Since fewer and fewer Americans join voluntary groups that meet frequently, there has been a proliferation of nonprofit groups led by elites who can interact with the government, but not the people. Skocpol provokes the reader with the idea that civic involvement will one day become another job rather than a civilian responsibility.  Scholars Strategy Network  In 2009, Skocpol conceived of and co-founded the Scholars Strategy Network, an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of academia. As of 2018, she serves as the network's Director.  Personal life  In 1967, while studying at Michigan State University, she married Bill Skocpol. They were both students at Michigan State, with Bill a physics major from Texas. They had met through a Methodist organization for students. Her last name is sometimes quoted as Skoƒçpol. She has one son, the attorney and former law clerk for Sonia Sotomayor, Michael Skocpol.

Atrato is in the far northwest of the country near the Panama border The Atrato River () is a river of northwestern Colombia. It rises in the slopes of the Western Cordillera and flows almost due north to the Gulf of Urab√° (or Gulf of Dari√©n), where it forms a large, swampy delta. Its course crosses the Choc√≥ Department, forming that department's border with neighboring Antioquia in two places. Its total length is about , and it is navigable as far as Quibd√≥ (400 km / 250 mi), the capital of the department. Flowing through a narrow valley between the Cordillera and coastal range, it has only short tributaries, the principal ones being the Truand√≥, the Sucio, and the Murr√≠ rivers. The gold and platinum mines of Choc√≥ line some of its confluence, and the river sands are auriferous. Mining and its toxic leavings have adversely affected river and environmental quality, damaging habitat for many species and affecting the ethnic groups: the predominately Afro-Colombian and Native American indigenous peoples who live along the river. The river is one of the only ways to move around in the Choc√≥ region. Northwestern Colombia encompasses an area of great diversity in wildlife. During the Pleistocene era at the height of the Atrato river, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena, the area was covered by a sea. It is proposed that this created a geographic barrier that may have caused many species to diverge through the process of allopatric speciation. For example, Philip Hershkovitz proposed that the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) and the white-footed tamarin (Saguinus leocopus) diverged because of the rise of the Atrato, and today they are principally separated by the river. File:Rio Atrato.JPGThe Atrato River File:Medio Atrato .jpgView from a side branch, in the Medio Atrato region File:Atrato river Medio Atrato region.jpgThe river seen from above, Medio Atrato region.  History  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the San Juan and the Atrato rivers attracted considerable attention as part of a feasible route for a trans-isthmian canal in Colombia. William Kennish, an engineer and inventor from the Isle of Man and Royal British Navy veteran, proposed an aqueduct making use of the Atrato River and its tributary, the Truando River, to cross the Colombian isthmus. After publishing a report in 1855 on this proposal for a New York firm, he was chosen to guide a US military expedition to explore and survey the proposed project in Colombia. In the early 20th century, the United States built the Panama Canal instead. In November 2016 the Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled that the Atrato River basin possesses rights to \\"protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration.\\" This ruling came about as a result of degradation to the river basin from mining, which has adversely affected nature and harmed Afro- Colombian and Indigenous peoples and their cultures. The court referred to the New Zealand declaration of the Whanganui River as a legal person holding environmental personhood. The court ordered that joint guardianship would be undertaken in the representation of the Atrato River basin. Similarly to the New Zealand declaration, the representatives would come from the national government and the Indigenous peoples living in the basin.

The series represented the 30th anniversary of the Kamen Rider Series. The series was also a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei and was shown on TV Asahi from January 28, 2001 to January 27, 2002. The series served as an indirect sequel to Kamen Rider Kuuga and the first Kamen Rider series to not have an ending sequence. Story A man named Shouichi Tsugami has no memory of who he was, where he came from, or how he came upon his peculiar circumstances to transform into a powerful superhuman, Kamen Rider Agito, whenever in the presence of the beings referred by the police as the \\"Unknown\\". Known as the Lords, these powerful monsters perceived themselves as humanity's defenders and kill certain people in a series of murders that force the police department to make Makoto Hikawa the user of the Kamen Rider G3 powersuit which was modeled after Kamen Rider Kuuga. Shouichi and Makoto, both initially hesitant of the other at first, are joined by Ry≈ç Ashihara, who becomes a pre-Agito known as Kamen Rider Gills and seeks the truth behind his father's suicide. These mysteries and many others collide as the true nature of Agito would ultimately determine the fate of humanity.

Shouichi encounters psychologist Azuma Kunieda, who had once nursed him back to health, fights an Unknown at night and reaches Burning Form, but goes out of control. Then, Kunieda helps him control it. All three Riders fight against the Beetle Lord. The story ended with a mysterious girl stalking G4 and was to be continued in the movie. There is a difference concerning the series' plot and the special's plot. In the special, T≈çru H≈çj≈ç finds out the truth about Shouichi's identity by secretly hearing a conversation between him and Kunieda as he stands behind a window and listens to them. In the series, however, H≈çj≈ç ambushes Agito as he flees from the battle scene and sees as he reverts to Shouichi, ultimately arresting him. It is possible, however, that he did not believe Shouichi in his conversation without physical evidence. * Released in theatres on 22 September 2001, Project G4 was a double bill with the Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger movie, \\"Fire Mountain Howls!\\". Shouichi encounters a teenage girl called Sayaka Kahara, who ran away from a military facility because of an attack by the Ant Lords. Sayaka has a supernatural ability to foresee the future. Risa Fukami, of the military group GA, wants to use that power to enhance the newly made G4 System, which was based upon designs stolen from Ozawa. Now, Agito and Gills must fight to stop the Ant Lords' attack, as G3 and G4 settle their score. The events of the movie happen in the late 30s‚Äìearly 40s after the special.

The fort was also designed to suppress the local Gakhar tribes of then Potohar region. See List of forts in Pakistan Some Gakhar tribes were allies of the Mughal Empire, and refused to recognize the suzerainty of Sher Shah Suri.Temples of Koh-e-Jud & Thar: Proceedings of the Seminar on Shahiya Temples of the Salt Range, Held in Lahore, Pakistan,by Kamil Khan Mumtaz, Siddiq-a-Akbar, Publ Anjuman Mimaran, 1989, p8 The fort is one of the largest and most formidable in the subcontinent. Rohtas Fort was never stormed by force, and has survived remarkably intact. The fort is known for its large defensive walls, and several monumental gateways. Rohtas Fort was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1997 for being an \\"exceptional example of the Muslim military architecture of Central and South Asia.\\" Location Pothohar plateau. The fort lies eight kilometers south of the Grand Trunk Road. It is approximately 16 km NW of Jhelum, and is near the city of Dina. It is approximately 3 km from Khukha. The historic Shahrah- e-Azam road once passed adjacent to the outer northern wall of the fort. Rohtas Fort was built on a hill overlooking a gorge where the Kahan River meets a seasonal stream called Parnal Khas within the Tilla Jogian Range. The fort is about above its surroundings. It is above sea level and covers an area of 70 hectares. Background The fort was commissioned by Sher Shah Suri, founder of the Sur Empire. The fort was designed to block the advances of Mughal emperor Humayun, who had been exiled to Persia following his defeat at the Battle of Kannauj. The fort occupies a strategic position between the mountainous region of Afghanistan and the plains of Punjab, and was intended to prevent the Mughal emperor from returning to India. The fort was also designed to suppress the local Gakhar tribes of the Potohar region. The Gakhar tribes were allies of the Mughal Empire, and refused to recognize the suzerainty of Sher Shah Suri.Temples of Koh-e-Jud & Thar: Proceedings of the Seminar on Shahiya Temples of the Salt Range, Held in Lahore, Pakistan,by Kamil Khan Mumtaz, Siddiq-a-Akbar, Publ Anjuman Mimaran, 1989, p8 History=Sur period The origin of the fort goes back to the Sur dynasty, where emperor Sher Shah Suri ordered the fort to be constructed after his victory over the Mughal emperor Humayun. Construction of the fort began in 1541. It was made primarily as a defense against the Mughals . Mughal period The fort was soon ceded to Mughal emperor Humayun in 1555, after the local governor, Tatar Khan Khasi, deserted the fort ahead of the Mughal army's advances. The fort lost much of its significance as the fort's purpose of subduing pro-Mughal Gakhar tribesmen, as well as the preventing the return of Emperor Humayun, was no longer required. Further, the construction of the nearby Attock Fort in the 1580s by the Emperor Akbar better served Mughal interests. Rohtas Fort, ironically, came to serve as capital of the Gakhar tribes that it had initially been designed to subdue, and was not required as a military garrison as the local Gakhar tribes remained loyal to the Mughal crown. Maratha period After the decline of the Mughals, the Marathas gained most of their territories in North India. In 1758, the Marathas invaded the Punjab and took Rohtas Fort. The fort was used by the Marathas as a frontier post for their operations in Peshawar and Attock. The fort however was captured again by the Durranis in 1759 who drove the Marathas out of North India. Sikh Empire period The fort remained in use during the Mughal era, and was used almost continuously until 1707, though it was not popular with the Mughal rulers. The Afsharid ruler Nadir Shah camped at the fort during his attack on the Mughal Empire. Also the Afghan chieftain Ahmed Shah Abdali had used the fort in his expeditions in the Punjab during the waning days of the Mughal empire. In 1825, the Sikh forces of Gurmukh Singh Lamba conquered the fort from the Gakhar chieftain Nur Khan. Rohtas was also thereafter used for administrative purposes by the Sikh Empire until its collapse by the British in 1849. Layout Layout of the fort Rohtas Fort covers an area of 70 hectares, enclosed by 4 kilometres of walls that were bolstered by 68 bastion towers, and 12 gates. The fort roughly forms an irregularly shaped triangle, and follows the contours of the hill it was constructed on. The northwest corner of the fort is walled off from the rest of the fort by a wall. The enclosed section served as a citadel for elites and was more heavily guarded. The enclosed section is site of much of the fort's most notable remains. The fort's Langar Khani gate opens into the citadel, but is actually a trap that is in the direct line of fire from the fort's bastions. The large fort could hold a force of up to 30,000 men.The northwest corner of the fort is walled off from the rest of the fort by a wall. The enclosed section served as a citadel for elites. Due to its location, massive walls, trap gates and 3 baolis (stepped wells), it could withstand a major siege, although it was never actually besieged. There are no palaces in the fort except for the Raja Man Singh Haveli, which is built on the highest point of the citadel. The area of the fort is 3200 canals. Major structures=Ramparts Rohtas Fort is protected by thick defensive walls. The height of the outer wall varies between 10 and 18 metres, with a thickness that varies between 10 and 13 metres. The fortified walls have 68 bastions at irregular intervals, with 12 monumental gateways providing access to the inner fort. The ramparts follow the hilltop's contours. The walls have up to 3 terraces located at different levels. Each level was connected to the other by way of a staircase. The uppermost terrace has merlon-shaped battlements from which muskets could be fired, and from which soldiers could also pour molten lead. The wall is built in sandstone laid in lime mortar mixed with brick. The gates are in grey ashlar masonry. Some portions have been built using burnt brick. Gates The Rohtas Fort has the following 12 gates. All of them are built in ashlar stone. =Sohail= Sohail Gate Close-up of Sohail Gate The Sohail gate features some of the best masonry work of the Sur Empire, and was likely the ceremonial main entrance to the fort. It derives its name from a local saint named Sohail Bukhari ‚àí whose remains are interred in the south- western portion of the gate. The gate rectangular in shape, and measures high, by wide, and with a depth of . Its central archway is wide, and maintains its shape throughout the gates depth. The gateway is with floral motifs, with richer decoration on the outer face. There are seven battlements along the outer face of the Sohail gate. The gate features room in the upper portion that have windows which open towards the fort's interior. Like the outer arch there is a small window in the middle of the inner arch. =Shah Chandwali= Shah Chandwali Gate This gate links the citadel to the main fort. It is named after Shah Chandwali who refused to get his wages for working on this gate. The saint died while still on work and was buried near the gate. His shrine still stands to this day. This gate is also a double gate. The outer gate, the entrance of which is from the citadel is 13.3 meters wide and 8.23 meters deep. The inner gate is a simple archway which is 3.66 meters wide. There are 12 gates of the fort. =Kabuli= Kabuli Gate The Kabuli gate derives its name from the fact that it opens towards the northwest in the general direction of Kabul. The gate now houses a visitors' information center, and a museum set up by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation. The gate may have been built in two stages. It consists of an inner and outer gate which encloses a step-well. Its opening is wide, and is flanked by two bastions on either side of the opening. The gate has 5 battlements on top, and has stairs leading up to it from the outside. On the southern side of the gate is the Shahi (Royal) Mosque because of which many people also call it Shahi (Royal) Darwaza (Gate or Door). =Shishi= The gate derives its name from the beautiful glazed tiles used to decorate its outer arch. These tiles are the earliest examples of this technique which was later refined in Lahore. These tiles are blue in color. An inscription on the left side of the gate gives the date of construction of the fort. The inscription is in Persian and is translated as In the Hijri Year 948 [1541 CE] came the exalted At that time constructed the great fort The emperor is Sher, with long life There is no match to his good fortune It was completed by Shahu Sultan =Langar Khani= Langar Khani Gate Plan Langar Khan is a double gate which is high, wide with a central arched opening. The outer arch has a small window like the Sohail Gate. The outer opening leads to a Langar Khana (Mess or Canteen). There are two bastions on either side of the gate which have kitchen, stores and a well for water. The opening of this gate is L shaped. As soon as one enters from the outer gate one has to turn right. =Talaqi= This gate is 15.25 meters high and 13.8 meters wide with two bastions on either side. This gates name derives from \\"Talaq\\" (divorce). According to a legend, Prince Sabir Suri entered the gate and had an attack of fever which proved fatal. This was regarded as a bad omen and the name became \\"Talaqi\\". =Mori or Kashmiri= The gate opens to the north and faces towards Kashmir. This gate opens into one chamber which opens into another. =Khwas Khani= This gate is named after one of Sher Shah Suri's greatest general, Khawas Khan Marwat. This was the original entrance to the Qila (Fort) because outside the gate lies the old GT Road. It is a double gate. The outer gate is wide and deep. It is accessible by only one gate and also had a very fine Baoli which suggests that it was meant for the chief and his family.This gate has a bastion and a defensive wall on each side. On the bastions cannons could be deployed. The inner and outer gates are almost mirror images of each other. The top of the gate has five battlements. All of these have loopholes as well as machicolation. Unlike other gates of this Qila, the inner side of the gate has five battlements. The inner and outer arches have sunflower motifs like the Sohail Gate. The gate also has a room which has windows opening to the inside and the outside. It is pertinent to mention here that when the Gakhars refused their allegiance to Sher Shah Suri, he launched an expedition to punish them. This resulted in the capture of the Gakhar chief Sultan Sarang Khan and his daughter. Sarang Khan was then killed. His daughter was then married to Sher Shah's favourite general Khawas Khan Marwat. =Gatali= Gatali Gate It is a single gate 9.15 meter high and 6.1 meter deep. This gate faces to the village Gatali Ford (ravine) which is called also Patan Gatiali or Gatiyalian, the important point to cross the River Jhelum for the Kashmir Valley, thus the name. =Tulla Mori= This is an entrance rather than a gate. It is on the eastern side of the fort. It is about 2 meters wide. There is a bastion next to this entrance. =Pippli= This is a small entrance like the Tulla Mori Gate. It is 2.13 meter wide. =Sar= This is a small entrance seems to be developed by breaking main wall (outer boundary) at latter stage by the locals as a short passage to an adjacent jungle. There is a bastion next to this gate. There is also located a dipilated pond in front of this gate within the fort, since the construction of the fort, for this reason it is now called \\"Sar Gate\\" as \\"Sar\\" means water pond. Royal mosque Remains of the former mosque. This small mosque known as Shahi masjid is near the Kabuli gate. It has a prayer chamber and a small courtyard. It is the most decorated of the original buildings of the fort. To be ever ready in case of attack, stairs lead directly from the courtyard of this mosque to the top of Kabuli Gate. The prayer chamber is 19.2 meter long and 7.3 meter deep. It is divided into 3 equal chambers. There are domes from the inside but from the outside no domes can be seen. There is a small room at the end of these three chambers. This room was for the Pesh Imam (Prayer Leader). This room has a small domed roof from the inside but no outer dome. There is no place for ablution (cleaning up before prayers) in the mosque. This mosque is built into the fortification wall i.e. soldiers walked over the mosque's roof. The outer wall of the mosque is the fortification wall itself. On the outer wall of the mosque are beautiful round designs in which Islamic verses are written in Naqsh script. These verses are surrounded by a Lilly going around the Naqsh script. The Lilly design was later used by Mughals in Tomb of Jahangir, Tomb of Nur Jehan and the Shah Burj Gate in Lahore Fort. The design seems to have been copied from the coins used in that time. Stepwells The central stepwell. There are 3 Baolis in the fort. These were made by cutting deep into the lime rock.This is used to take their horses to drink water. There are 137 steps. =Central baoli= It is in the middle of the Fort for soldiers, elephants, horses etc. This Baoli has 148 steps. Each step is wide. The upper portion has been cut in stone. It has three arches that span the length of the baoli. =Royal baoli= It is near the Kabuli Gate for the Royal family. It has 60 steps and has small chambers that were used as baths by the Royal family. =Sar Gate baoli= A small Baoli near the Sar Gate, most likely used by soldiers. Rani Mahal and Haveli Man Singh Raja Man Singh haveli The Rani Mahal (Queens palace) is near Haveli Man Singh. It is a one-storey structure. It originally had four rooms but only room remains standing today. The foundation of the four rooms can still be seen today. The room still standing today is about high and beautifully decorated on the inside and outside. The roof of the dome like room is like a flower. The inside of the roof is decorated with flowers, geometrical patterns and fake windows. The room is about . Decorative features This fort is an example of purely \\"Masculine\\" architecture. It places function over form. This can be gauged from the fact that the fort originally had no permanent building for living. Stone carvings Stonework displaying the name of God. These carvings are found on the gate and in the mosque. Most of these are engravings in Arabic and sunflowers. One of these carvings is inside the Shahi Mosque outside the Pesh Imam's (Prayer leaders) room. The carving is of the word \\"Allah\\" in Arabic. The same carving is also done on merlons on top of Shahi Mosque. The sunflower motif is on each sides of the arches of Shahi Mosque. It is also present in the guard post in between each gate. Calligraphy Most of these inscriptions are on the Shahi Mosque. On the outer wall of the mosque the \\"Kalima\\" is written in beautiful calligraphy on both sides of each arch of the Shahi Mosque. The Naskh script is used. There is an inscription in Persian on the Shishi gate which gives the date of start of construction. The same inscription is also found over the Talaqi gate. There are other inscriptions on the Khwas Khani, Langar Khani and Gatali gate. Tilework These tiles are found on Shishi gate. This type of tile became extremely popular with the Mughals who further refined them. The tiles on Shishi gate are the earliest example of the usage of these tiles. These tiles were made in Lahore. Plasterwork Plaster has been used in the Shahi Mosque. Machicolations Machicolations are small drains that lead from the inside to the walls outside. They are built into the walls and are used by the soldiers on the inside to pour molten lead or other hot liquids on soldiers trying to scale the walls. The Rohtas Fort has hundreds of them and each one is beautifully decorated with geometric patterns. The pictures is of a machicolation near the Langar Khana (Mess Hall). Architecture The fort's defenses were bolstered by large bastions. This fort was built in a style that draws from Turkish, Middle Eastern, and South Asian artistic traditions. Use The fort was never popular with the Mughals because of its military character. Emperor Akbar stayed here for a single night. Emperor Jahangir rested here for a single night while going to Kashmir for a rest. He said the following about its location: Emperor Jahangir again stayed here when he was being forced to go to Kabul by Mahabat Khan. Nur Jahan, his beautiful and resourceful wife obtained troops from Lahore and ordered Mahabat Khan to release her husband. Emperor Jahangir then proceeded to Rohtas and held his court here for a while. Then he went on to Kashmir and back to Lahore to die. The later Mughals seem to have made no use of the fort. The reason is that they were allies of the Gakhars and consequently needed no troops to maintain their hold over this area. The Afsharid ruler Nader Shah camped at the fort during his invasion of the Mughal Empire. Thereafter it was used by the Durrani ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani during his invasions of the Punjab against the Sikhs. Timur Shah Durrani retook Multan from the Sikhs in 1780 after defeating them at Rohtas, he then secured Bhawalpur and Kashmir. By 1788 he even attempted unsuccessfully to ford the plains of Punjab to rescue his brother-in-law the weak Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II who was blinded by a eunuch Ghulam Qadir. Unable to succeed he wrote a letter to Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, requesting that the British protect the Mughal dynasty.https://books.google.com/books?id=Ifs9AQAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=history+of+punjab+from+aurangzeb+to+mountbatten&hl;=en&sa;=X&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=Timur%20Shah%20Rohtas&f;=false After the takeover of the Punjab by Emperor Ranjit Singh, Gurmukh Singh Lamba captured the Rothas Fort from the Ghakhar chief Nur Khan, father of Fazil Dad Khan in 1825. Ranjit Singh gave the fort to Mohar Singh who was succeeded by Gurmukh Singh Lamba. It was subsequently leased to different people and the last person to manage Rohtas was Raja Fazal Din Khan who joined Sher Singh in rebellion.

Conservation Most of the fort is in a very good state of preservation. In the portions that have fallen away (Haveli Man Singh) one can still see some part of the original construction. The central archway of the Chandwali Gate has been rebuilt recently so that is the only ‚Äúfake‚Äù part of the fort. In early 2005, seepage, heavy rains, and general neglect caused the left inner face of the Talaqi Gate to collapse, and the right flank and foundation to become detached from the original structure. The Gatali Gate forms one of the original entrances to Rohtas. Over time, its right bastion and supporting wall have collapsed as a result of permeated rainwater and the erosion of its foundations. World Heritage Status Rohtas Fort was designated a World Heritage Site in 1997, having met the following inclusion criteria: > Criterion (ii): \\"Rohtas Fort blends architectural and artistic traditions > from Turkey and the Indian subcontinent to create the model for Mughal > architecture and its subsequent refinements and adaptations.\\" > Criterion (iv): \\"Rohtas Fort is an exceptional example of the Muslim > military architecture of central and south Asia during the 16th century.\\" The fort was also noted for its high-level of integrity, and authenticity. Himalayan Wildlife Foundation The Rohtas Fort Conservation Programme was conceived by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation in 2000 to help protect the sixteenth-century Rohtas Fort near Jhelum, and develop it as a heritage site conforming to international standards of conservation and tourism. It is undertaking the following projects in conjunction with the Royal Norwegian Embassy. Government Eviction Notice In 1992 the government ordered the locals of Rohtas to leave the inside area of fort and state that the government would construct houses for them outside the fort. Zafar Chughtai the chairman of Rohtas opposed the stay order from government declaring that no government will take the properties of Rohtas locals. The stay order is still effective but no subsequent government has pursued its execution and has allowed the fort residents to reside there. # Complete restoration of Shah Chandwali Gate # Conservation of Haveli Man Singh # Conservation of Talaqi Gate and Gatali Gate # Establishment of Sher Shah Suri Museum in upper storey of Sohail Gate # Improvement of quality of life in Rohtas Fort village Nearby places of historical significance Outside the Langar Khani Gate is the tomb of a lady called Khair Un Nisa. She was the daughter of the food minister named Qadir Bukhsh. She died here and was buried in this tomb but she was later moved to Sasaram. Until the construction of the new Grand Trunk Road, Rohtas was a halting place on the main Peshawar-Lahore road. This road had serais about a mile apart. One of these is about one mile (1.6 km) north of the Rohtas Fort. It is in a fair state of preservation. Access=From Islamabad The dual-carriage Grand Trunk Road takes you past Gujar Khan and Sohawa, to the small city of Dina 110 km away. Just past Dina you will drive over a railway overpass, stay to the right of the road and take the first U-turn to drive back towards Dina. After about 100 meters to your left you will find a signpost, which indicates the way towards the road leading to Rohtas Fort which is 8 km away, past the small holy village of Muftian home to the Mufti Tribe. Drive on the road to enter into the fort and keep driving till you reach the parking area. From Lahore Drive on G.T. road past Gujranwala, Wazirabad and the city of Jhelum.

She is known as the first female professional sculptor. Among other technical innovations, she pioneered a process for turning limestone into marble. Hosmer once lived in an expatriate colony in Rome, befriending many prominent writers and artists. She was a cousin of poet William H. C. Hosmer and tragic actress Jean Hosmer. Biography=Early life and education Harriet Hosmer, engraving by Augustus Robin (1873) Harriet Hosmer was born on October 9, 1830 at Watertown, Massachusetts, and completed a course of study at Sedgewick School in Lenox, Massachusetts. Her mother and three siblings died during her childhood. She was a delicate child, and was encouraged by her father, physician Hiram Hosmer, to pursue a course of physical training by which she became expert in rowing, skating, and riding. He also encouraged her artistic passion. She traveled alone in the wilderness of the western United States, and visited the Dakota Indians. She showed an early aptitude for modeling, and studied anatomy with her father. Through the influence of family friend Wayman Crow she attended the anatomical instruction of Dr. Joseph Nash McDowell at the Missouri Medical College (then the medical department of the state university). She then studied in Boston and practiced modeling at home until November 1852, when, with her father and her lover Charlotte Cushman, she went to Rome, where from 1853 to 1860 she was the pupil of the Welsh sculptor John Gibson, and she was finally allowed to study live models. Harriet Goodhue Hosmer with her assistants and carvers in the courtyard of her studio in Rome (1867)  Rome  While living in Rome, she associated with a colony of artists and writers that included Nathaniel Hawthorne, Bertel Thorvaldsen, William Makepeace Thackeray, and the two female Georges, Eliot and Sand. When in Florence, she was frequently the guest of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning at Casa Guidi. The artists included Anne Whitney, Emma Stebbins, Edmonia Lewis, Louisa Lander, Margaret Foley, Florence Freeman, and Vinnie Ream. Hawthorne was clearly describing these in his novel The Marble Faun, and Henry James called them a \\"sisterhood of American ‚Äòlady sculptors'.\\" As Hosmer is now considered the most famous female sculptor of her time in America, she is credited with having 'led the flock' of other female sculptors.  Artistic style  The Sleeping Faun was created in 1865 in Rome, and was one of Hosmer's most celebrated works. Hosmer was drawn to the Neoclassical style, which was easy to study given her presence in Rome. She enjoyed studying mythology, and she created various representations of mythological icons, such as the sculpture of The Sleeping Faun, which includes intricate details of elements such as his hair, the grapes, and the cloth draped over him. Later life She also designed and constructed machinery, and devised new processes, especially in connection with sculpture, such as a method of converting the ordinary limestone of Italy into marble, and a process of modeling in which the rough shape of a statue is first made in plaster, on which a coating of wax is laid for working out the finer forms. Hosmer later lived in Chicago and Terre Haute, Indiana. Hosmer exhibited her sculpture of Queen Isabella, commissioned by the Queen Isabella Association, in the California State Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The statue was exhibited again in 1894 at the California Midwinter International Exposition. Lady Ashburton For 25 years she was romantically involved with Louisa, Lady Ashburton, widow of Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton (died 1864).Sherwood, Dolly. Harriet Hosmer, University of Missouri Press, pp.102-3; 270-3. Lady Ashburton provided Harriet a studio at Albert Gate Studios in William Mews, close to the Ashburton home at Kent House in Rutland Gardens. Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, MA Hosmer died at Watertown, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1908, and is buried in the family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge.Wilson, Scott.

Aside from the work she produced, Harriet Hosmer made her mark on art history and feminist and gender studies. As the National Museum of Women in the Arts put it, \\"Harriet Goodhue Hosmer defied 19th-century social convention by becoming a successful sculptor of large scale, Neoclassical works in marble.\\"  Context  Illustration of the Prince of Wales visiting Hosmer's studio In the 19th century women did not usually have careers, especially careers as sculptors. Women were not allowed to have the same art education as men, they were not trained in the making \\"great\\" art such as large history paintings, mythological and biblical scenes, modeling of figure. Women usually produced artwork that could be done in their home, such as still lives, portraits, landscapes, and small scale carvings, although even Queen Victoria allowed her daughter, the Princess Louise, to study sculpture. Hosmer was not allowed to attend art classes because working from a live model was forbidden for women, but she took classes in anatomy to learn the human form and paid for private sculpture lessons. The biggest career move she made was moving to Rome to study art. Hosmer owned her own studio and ran her own business. She became a well-known artist in Rome, and received several commissions. Hosmer commented on her break from tradition by saying \\"I honor every woman who has strength enough to step outside the beaten path when she feels that her walk lies in another; strength enough to stand up and be laughed at, if necessary.\\" Legacy Mount Hosmer, near Lansing, Iowa is named after Hosmer; she won a footrace to the summit of the hill during a steamboat layover during the 1850s.Sherwood, Dolly, ‚Äò‚ÄôHarriet Hosmer, American Sculptor: 1830-1908‚Äô‚Äô University of Missouri Press, Columbia MO, 1991 p. 31 During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in her honor. A book of poetry, Waking Stone: Inventions on the Life Of Harriet Hosmer, by Carole Simmons Oles, was published in 2006. Her sculpture, Puck and Owl, is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. The Hosmer School in Watertown, Massachusetts is a public elementary school named in her honor. Selected works H. G. Hosmer: Beatrice Cenci Hosmer made both large and small scale works and also produced work to specific order. Her smaller works were frequently issued in multiples to accommodate demand.

She has also skipped for the Scotland curling team at both the World and European Championships. Career=Early career Martin was long known in Scottish curling circles for her uncanny knack of repeatedly failing to win the national championships at the final hurdle, but finally won the right to appear in a major international championship in 1998, where she was skip of the Scotland team that won a silver medal at the European Curling Championships. With some significant changes in personnel, she returned to the championships in Chamonix the following year, where the team was narrowly edged out of the medal placings. In 2000, Martin's quartet won the Scottish Women's Curling Championship, defeating the team led by former Olympic skip Kirsty Hay in the final, and were therefore entitled to represent Scotland at the World Curling Championships, held that year in Glasgow. They performed well at the World Curling Championships, with a particular highlight of defeating the Canadian side skipped by Kelley Law in the round-robin stage of the competition. However, Law earned her revenge against Scotland in the semi- finals, leading Canada to a 10‚Äì6 win. Martin's team was disappointed after missing out on a medal by losing 10‚Äì5 to Dordi Nordby's Norwegian outfit in the subsequent play-off. 2002 Olympics The fourth-place finish at the World Championships left the team well placed to secure its place as Great Britain's representatives at the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, selection for which was based on performances in the World and European Championships over the whole four-year Olympic cycle. Crucially, though, changes in the team's line-up meant that the European silver medal in 1998 was discounted, meaning that the team skipped by former world junior champion Julia Ewart, which represented Scotland at the 2001 World Championships in Lausanne, had the potential to be selected. Ewart recovered from a slow start to string together an extraordinary sequence of wins; a gold for Scotland would take Ewart and her teammates to the Olympics, and a silver would result in a special play-off to decide the selection. However, Scotland were derailed in the semi-final by Sweden, allowing Martin's team to represent Great Britain in Salt Lake City. After battling illness, Martin arrived in Salt Lake City, and she and her teammates found their Olympic form early, reaching the brink of qualification for the semi-finals by winning five out of their first seven round-robin matches. However, the USA team came back to win against Martin's with a steal, and the British team then succumbed to Germany in the concluding round-robin match. The team's chances of progressing were thus dependent on a Swiss win over Germany. In order to progress to the semi-finals, it was necessary for the British team to win two successive tie-break matches against Sweden and Germany, which was achieved. The win over Sweden was an upset as Elisabeth Gustafsson was a 4 time World Champion. For their semi-final match, the British team was paired with Kelley Law's Canadian team, to whom three members of Martin's team had lost whilst playing for Scotland at the same stage of the 2000 World Championships. Martin's team surged to an unexpected win, guaranteeing them a medal. As the underdog against Switzerland's Luzia Ebnother, the 2nd seed and a former World and European silver medalist, Britain won the final with Martin's last stone, often described as a difficult draw. The team of Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald and Janice Rankin thus became Great Britain's first gold medallists in any sport at the Winter Olympics since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean came first in the ice dancing of the 1984 Winter Olympics. Later that year, Martin was awarded an MBE for services to curling. Post-Olympic career Martin's team lost to Jackie Lockhart's rink in the three-match final of the Scottish Championships, played within days of their return to Scotland. Attention was focused on Lockhart, whose team subsequently won the World Championships for Scotland, with Lockhart selecting the same stone used by Martin to seal victory in the Olympics for her own winning delivery. The rock was dubbed the Stone of Destiny, and is now housed in a Scottish sports museum. In 2005, Martin was back on the world stage, when her all-star team (including Lockhart at the second position) finished fifth at the European Championships. Prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics, it was reported that Martin was living on welfare and that her financial problems were causing her to live apart from her husband. Her husband Keith had recently had trouble with his computer business, and they were forced to move into government housing. Martin had considered quitting curling, but her two children encouraged her to stay. Martin skipped the British Olympic team during the 2006 Winter Olympics, where the team was eliminated during the round-robin stage. In 2007, Martin halted playing for the time being and focused on coaching. She spent 3 years doing the UK Sport Elite Coach Programme whilst delivering the Performance Development Coach role within the national governing body for curling, the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, looking after the National and Regional Academies. Martin joined the BBC commentary team for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, overseeing the curling along with Steve Cram. Prior to this, Martin also made several TV guest appearances on shows that included A Question of Sport, The Weakest Link and This Morning. In 2010, Rhona was appointed as the new women's head coach of the British and Scottish curling performance squad and was part of a five strong coaching team looking forward to the 2014 Winter Olympics. In June 2012, Martin was part of the London 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay, taking the flame through Glasgow whilst being cheered on by the public. She also attended many Olympics events in London in her role as a games ambassador. Also in 2012, Martin was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame. Martin joined the BBC's commentary team for coverage of curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics.  Medal theft  In May 2014, Martin's Olympic gold medal along with other Olympic memorabilia was stolen from a museum in Dumfries.

In practice, variants of the related Big5 character set are de facto standard. CNS 11643 is designed to conform to ISO 2022. It contains 16 planes, so the maximum possible number of encodable characters is 16√ó94√ó94 = 141376. Planes 1 through 7 are defined by the standard; since 2007, planes 10 through 15 have also been defined by the standard. Prior to this, planes 12 to 15 (35344 code points) were specifically designated for user-defined characters. Unlike CCCII, the encoding of variant characters in CNS 11643 is not related. EUC-TW is a encoded representation of CNS 11643 and ASCII in Extended Unix Code (EUC) form. Other encodings capable of representing certain CSIC planes include ISO-2022-CN (planes 1 and 2) and ISO-2022-CN-EXT (planes 1 through 7). History The first edition of the standard was published in 1986, and included planes 1 and 2, deriving from levels 1 and 2 of Big5, with some re-ordering due to corrected stroke counts, two duplicate characters being omitted, and the addition of 213 classical radicals. Extensions to the standard were subsequently published in 1988 (6319 characters, occupying plane 14) and 1990 (7169 characters, occupying plane 15). Unicode 1.0, although it did not yet include hanzi, included characters for compatibility with CNS 11643: the CJK Compatibility Forms block was titled \\"CNS 11643 Compatibility\\" in Unicode 1.1. When the Unicode CJK Unified Ideographs set was being compiled for Unicode 1.0.1, the national bodies submitted character sets to the CJK Joint Research Group for inclusion. The version of CNS 11643 submitted included the plane 14 extension, in addition to further desired characters appended to plane 14 (after 68-21, the last used code point in the standard version of the extension). In the second edition of the standard, published in 1992, a much larger collection of hanzi was defined across seven planes. A subset of the 1988 plane 14 extension, including the 6148 code points 01-01 through 66-38, became plane 3 (with the remaining 171 characters, code points 66-39 through 68-21, being instead distributed amongst plane 4). The plane 15 extension was not included, although 338 of its characters were included amongst planes 4 through 7. The third edition of the standard, published in 2007, added the Euro sign, ideographic zero, kana and extensions to the existing bopomofo and Roman alphabet support to plane 1. It introduced planes 10 through 14, containing additional hanzi, and incorporated the existing plane 15 extension into the standard itself (with gaps left where the characters already existed in planes 4 through 7). It also added 128 further hanzi to plane 3, starting at code point 68-40. , there are several thousand CNS 11643 characters with no corresponding Unicode character, mostly in planes 10 through 14; these are mapped to the Unicode Supplementary Private Use Area. Relationship to Big5 Levels 1 and 2 of the Big5 encoding correspond mostly to CNS 11643 planes 1 and 2, respectively, with occasional differences in order. They can be mapped using a list of ranges. The Big5-2003 variant of Big5 is defined as a partial encoding of CNS 11643. References * This page is based on the information on the CNS official web site.

Currently two sections of the line, from Limerick via Ennis to Athenry and from Collooney to Sligo, see regular services, with other sections either closed or only technically classed as open. Context=West on Track West on Track was established in 2003 with the aim of reopening the western rail corridor line, for the use of passenger and freight traffic. Its aim was to preserve the infrastructure already in place and to seek funding for the reopening of the railway line. People involved in West on Track include the sociologist Fr. Miche√°l MacGr√©il SJ. Expert Working Group In 2005 an Expert Working Group reported on the prospects for reopening all or part of the corridor. In September 2006 the preservation and reclamation from encroachment of the northern section began and the Government then announced funding to begin Phase 1 (Ennis-Athenry) of the re-opening of the corridor. The reopening of these sections was included in the Transport 21 infrastructural plan, and the National Development Plan 2007‚Äì2013 \\"Transforming Ireland ‚Äì A Better Quality of Life for All\\". Transport 21 was the plan name given to long term public transport planning by the Irish government which fell from office in 2011. The plan was dropped by the Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar in 2011 and is no longer the blueprint for transport planning in Ireland. Route and services The Western Rail Corridor encompasses a series of railways built by various companies throughout the late 19th century, forming a south-north line from Limerick to Sligo. Towns along the WRC include Ennis, Gort, Athenry, Tuam and Claremorris. The route crosses the Dublin‚ÄìGalway line at Athenry, the Dublin‚ÄìWestport/Ballina line at Claremorris and joins the Dublin‚ÄìSligo line at Collooney. The route largely parallels the corridor served by the N17 and N18 roads. Passenger services between Claremorris and Collooney ended in 1963, with the section being closed completely in 1975 (the track was left in situ but severed at Collooney). Passenger services between Limerick and Claremorris ceased in 1976, though freight services continued for some time afterwards. In 1988, a new passenger service started between Limerick and Ennis operating on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This was expanded to Fridays and Saturdays in February 1993 and a six-day service in May 1994. In December 2003, a new seven train a day service started between Limerick and Ennis (connecting or continuing to/from Dublin or Limerick Junction). This has since been upgraded to up to 9 trains per day. Rail Freight Services Freight services ran regularly on the Limerick to Claremorris section until the mid-1990s. However, with the closure of the Asahi factory near Ballina, regular freight services north of Athenry ceased in 1997. Fertiliser trains from Foynes continued to use the line as far as Athenry until 2000 and bulk cement trains from the Irish Cements Ltd Castlemungret factory near Limerick until 2001, when the line ceased to have any regular traffic. The line from Claremorris to Athenry now carries no services and is classified by Iarnr√≥d √âireann as \\"engineering sidings\\". Work on clearing the line was undertaken by Iarnr√≥d √âireann from November 2015 onwards. Works included reinstating fencing and removal of vegetation. Line clearance at Athenry on Western Rail Corridor - November 2015 Debate on the need for the Corridor=Overview The reopening of the Western Rail Corridor has raised debate in Ireland, with opinion divided on the benefits of the scheme. Arguments in favour of reopening the corridor: Arguments in favour are generally advocating a balanced development of the regions vis √† vis Dublin and the importance of infrastructure in so doing. The lobby group WestOnTrack is leading the campaign to reopen the corridor. * The Western Rail Corridor has been supported by all the main political parties and by the local and regional authorities of the counties through which it passes. * The case for its reopening has been articulated in an op-ed in the Irish Times,Restored Western Rail Corridor will reinvigorate west Irish Times, 21 May 2005Let's put the west back on track Irish Times, 12 June 2006Decentralisation, the WRC and Regional Development Irish Times 19 June 2006 in the Sunday Independent,'Lack of road and rail links' killing tourism in west Sunday Independent, 14 August 2005 by the Irish Hotels Federation,Plans for Increased Regional Access Vital for Tourism Spread throughout Ireland IHF Galway branch press release, 13 February 2006 in the Irish Independent,Gridlock in Galway City Irish Independent (Letters), 14 August 2006 in the Western People,Students call for Western Rail Corridor to re-open Western People, 6 Sep 2006 and in the findings of a TG4 opinion poll.Opinion Poll Findings show Significant Passenger Demand for Western Rail Corridor MRBI/TG4 Press Release, 31 October 2006 * Environmental benefits from reduced car usage including lower air pollution and smaller carbon footprint Arguments against reopening the Corridor: Arguments against the reopening are based on the cost of the restoration work and the annual subsidy required post capital expenditure, and some advocate using trackbed as a cycle path or Greenway instead. *Questions have been raised about its viability in an editorial in the Irish Times, by an article in the Irish Independent,'Ladybird' WRC report a one-track journey into madness Irish Independent, 16 May 2005 by the lobby group, Platform 11, and by the Strategic Rail Review, 2003. *In 2009, the Bord Snip Nua report recommended cancelling future sections of the project and closing the Ballina-Manulla rail line. *Critics say that southern sections of the scheme are more viable than those closer to Sligo. The idea of a greenway on any parts of the route, which may become surplus if a railway order process was undertaken, was suggested by Minister Eamon O'Cuiv at a West on Track conference in May 2009 in response to lobbying for this idea from Enniscrone resident Brendan Quinn and his colleague John Mulligan.The Merits of a Cycleway Not A Railway Western People Letters Quoting Minister O Cuiv speech , 20 May 2009 Report on transport budget underspend in the West of Ireland A mid-term evaluation of the Irish government's National Development Plan by the consultants INDECON, is cited by some parties as a reason to build the Western Rail Corridor. The report stated that only half the forecast NDP transport investment in the BMW region for the period 2000‚Äì2006 was spent or committed to be spent by 2002, a shortfall of ‚Ç¨364 million. As Transport projects have long lead times this report indicated that the relative shortfall in transport expenditure would be maintained over the course of the planning period to 2006. Frank Dawson detailed statistics breaking out the INDECON data, who is now the Roscommon County Manager. Reliability of the McCann Expert Working Group report Lobbyists for the project point to the recommendations of this report commissioned by the minister for transport as evidence that the project is justified. The report stated that if the case for Mayo rail freight could be proven, it would add to the case for rebuilding Athenry-Claremorris as one section. Frank McDonald, in an article in the Irish Times based on information released under the Freedom of Information Act, indicated that the report was rewritten to exclude any negative assessment of the viability of the project including a forecast that it would 'attract only 750 passengers per day and could require an annual subvention of up to ‚Ç¨10 million'. Passenger numbers for the first section of the line between Ennis-Limerick were reported at a mere 600 a day in March 2008. Criticisms of the McCann Report have included the reliance on anecdotal testimony regarding freight demand and the absence of costings for rolling stock and operating expenses. A cost-benefit analysis report prepared by Goodbody Economic Consultants for the Department of Transport in 2006 stated that passenger numbers on the soon to be opened Ennis-Athenry section of the WRC would be in the order of 200,000, requiring an annual subvention of ‚Ç¨2.4m, with a negative Net Present Value of -‚Ç¨137m. The report concluded that even a doubling of patronage would not make the project viable on cost-benefit grounds, while the regional development benefits from the re-opening were viewed as 'unlikely to be significant.' The effect of freight The McCann Report suggests that the Ennis Claremorris Section could divert and grow Mayo to Waterford freight traffic via the Western Rail Corridor. Opponents argue that rail freight volumes in the country have dropped near to zero in recent years and that indirect freight routes already exist from most large towns in the region. As of September 2015 nine trains serve this freight route in each direction each week. Infrastructure before development Advocates of the project argue that key transport infrastructure should be built prior to development and may actually encourage development to take place. Land use and settlement strategies are in place in all of the counties along the route of the WRC as a result of direct initiatives by the County Development Boards and County Councils concerned. In addition the WRC is specified as a key infrastructural objective in the County Development Plans of Clare, Galway, Mayo and Sligo as well as the Regional Planning Guidelines of the West Regional Authority. Project opponents, however, argue that the local councils are not following land use policies that would create centres of population density around the railway stations along this route, but instead are continuing to permit isolated rural housing. Timeline for the reopening of the corridor=Expert Working Group Report An Expert Working Group, headed by Pat McCann, CEO of Jurys Doyle Hotels, reported to the Minister for Transport regarding the prospects for reopening some or all of the route. The group was set up by Minister S√©amus Brennan at the urging of West-on-Track in June 2004 and delivered its report to Minister Martin Cullen in May 2005. The report recommended the reopening of most of the Corridor in three phases and the deferral of the reopening of the northernmost section: Phase 1: Ennis to Athenry 58 km / 36 miles (‚Ç¨74.7 million) Phase 2: Athenry to Tuam 25 km / 15.5 miles (‚Ç¨34.7 million) Phase 3: Tuam to Claremorris (subject to study of rail freight demand or in conjunction with phase 2) 27 km / 17 miles (‚Ç¨58.9 million) Phase 4: Claremorris to Collooney (subject to further feasibility studies and possibly justifiable on the grounds of balanced regional development) 74.43 km / 46.25 miles (‚Ç¨197.4 million) Transport 21 On 1 November 2005 the Transport 21 plan was launched committing government expenditure of ‚Ç¨34 billion between 2006 and 2015 on road, rail and light rail projects. The Western Railway Corridor commitments under this plan were largely those recommended by the McCann Report: * 2009 ‚Äì Opening of Ennis-Athenry section * 2011 ‚Äì Opening of Athenry-Tuam section * 2014 ‚Äì Opening of Tuam-Claremorris section Former Minister for Transport Martin Cullen also announced the undertaking of a feasibility study into a rail link for Shannon Airport in his speech at the launch. This study, undertaken by MVA Consultants, estimated the proposed link would cost ‚Ç¨700m, while an Iarnr√≥d √âireann manager stated that 'the costs of the construction of the rail link are out of proportion to the benefits to be gained'. Transport 21 also stated the section of line from Claremorris to Collooney, the northern section known as Section Four in the McCann Report should be subject to protection of the alignment. Transport 21 was shelved by the current Irish Government in May 2011. There are no plans to re-open any more sections of the Western Rail Corridor. Former Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar TD is on record as saying the Government has no plans to re-open any further sections of the Western Rail corridor. TEN-T Transport policy In November 2013 the European Parliament approved European TEN-T Transport policy. In the most radical overhaul of EU infrastructure policy since its inception in the 1980s, the European Parliament on 19 November 2013 gave final approval to new maps showing the nine major corridors which will act as a backbone for transportation in Europe's single market and revolutionise East‚ÄìWest connections. To match this level of ambition, Parliament also voted to triple EU financing for transport infrastructure. On the island of Ireland, the only rail route corridor that is included in the TEN-T Core network is the route Cork-Dublin-Belfast. The Limerick-Athenry section of the Western Rail Corridor is included in the TEN-T Comprehensive network. Progress of works Following preliminary works in late 2005 and early 2006, official clearance work on the northern section of the line (Claremorris to Collooney) began on 18 September 2006. Renewal of track commenced in 2007 on the line between Ennis and Athenry was completed in 2009. After a gap of more than thirty years, train services between the cities of Galway and Limerick commenced on Tuesday 30 March 2010, on budget at a cost of ‚Ç¨106.5m, a figure which included building new stations in Sixmilebridge and Oranmore. The service provides five trains per day between Galway and Limerick. It serves existing stations at Limerick, Ennis, Athenry and Galway, as well as new stations at Sixmilebridge, Gort, Ardrahan and Craughwell. The Limerick to Galway service also feeds into expanded intercity services between Limerick and Dublin and between Galway and Dublin. Iarnr√≥d √âireann planned for both routes to gain hourly services at peak and two hourly off-peak, however recession has resulted in delay, with some services withdrawn. The middle section of the western rail corridor, Athenry ‚Äì Claremorris, has been programmed but not funded under Transport 21 while the Colooney ‚Äì Claremorris northern section has not been programmed or funded bar some line clearance work in 2006. Transport 21 is no longer Irish government policy. In comments by then Taoiseach Enda Kenny on 22 December 2014 on Midwest radio said the Western Rail corridor was \\"not going to happen in the foreseeable future\\" and said \\"this is not going to happen\\" when asked about the Western Rail Corridor. Following those remarks, in January 2015 Kenny said at a press briefing in Lough Lannagh in Castlebar told local media in Mayo that he still sees the potential for developing freight services on the line stating, \\"I still see potential [on the Western Rail Corridor] from a freight point of view.\\" Patronage In 2011 The Irish Examiner reported that passenger numbers were \\"still quite low\\" in 2010. On 7 July 2013, The Irish Examiner reported that patronage on the Ennis to Athenry sector had fallen to 34,200 in 2012 from the 34,461 reported in 2011, and that passengers on that sector in the first 5 months of 2013 were 11,900. The Irish Examiner noted that total passengers on the line from Limerick to Galway had grown in 2012 from 224,000 to 235,000. 4 years after the opening of the route an online booking facility was finally introduced in December 2013. On 6 January 2015 Iarnr√≥d √âireann reported that following the introduction of online booking and new adult fares, passenger numbers on the Galway-Limerick railway (Western Rail Corridor) for 2014 were in excess of 220,000, including a 72.5 per cent increase in passenger journeys through the Ennis- Athenry section of the line, the largest annual growth on the rail network. The service was also being promoted through free car parking at Gort, Ardrahan and Craughwell; promotion of Taxsaver tickets, giving commuters full tax relief on the cost of monthly and annual season tickets purchased through employers and group travel promotions, including schools.\\" The Irish Times noted the 2015 figures as follows \\"Of particular note was the growth in passenger numbers on the western rail corridor, which saw a 72.5 per cent increase from 29,000 to 50,000 journeys through the Ennis-Athenry section of the line.\\". By 2017, the Ennis-Athenry section carried nearly 100,000 passengers. Collooney-Claremorris section as a Greenway This idea has been advocated by the campaign group Sligo-Mayo Greenway, who argue that the funding for a Greenway on this section would be minimal in infrastructural terms and would not hinder the eventual reinstatement of the Railway should the funding for that ever become available. The campaigners for the Greenway on this section of the track, point to the success of the recently opened Great Western Greenway. In August 2011 this proposal was ruled out by the former Western Regional Authority but the proposal continues to be discussed. During 2013 the idea twice failed to get a seconder at Galway and Mayo Co. Councils and was also defeated (16-3) at Roscommon Co Council. The County Managers' reports in respect of the new Co Development Plans for both Galway and Mayo pointed to the strategic importance of protecting the railway infrastructure and to having proposed walking and cycling routes located elsewhere. In July 2014 Sligo County Council passed a motion put to the council chamber by Cllr Dara Mulvey that Sligo County Council should seek funding for a feasibility study for a Greenway on the route within County Sligo from Collooney to Bellaghy on the County Sligo/Mayo border. The motion was passed without a vote by Sligo county council and is now County Council policy. In February 2015 a new campaign group the Sligo Greenway Co-op was formed as a shareholding co-op - with shares issued at ‚Ç¨1 each and shares sold in blocks of ten. As of July 2015 the Sligo Greenway Co-op had 280 shareholders in County Sligo and had the support of two Sligo TDs, Tony McLoughlin and John Perry. Perry was not re-elected in 2016. However, a major study by the NWRA (Northern and Western Regional Assembly) of future recreational developments in the area of outdoor pursuits in Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon has rejected the idea that the Western Rail Corridor be turned into a walking or cycling route. The \\"Study of Outdoor Recreation in the West\\" (2014) stated: \\"The Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs) for the West Region 2010-2022 seek the full reinstatement of the Western Rail Corridor as a long-term strategic sustainable transport route. Greenways are not mentioned in the RPGs, though the development of suitable long-distance walking and cycling routes (subject to environmental assessment) are supported. It is not the purpose of the Regional Planning Guidelines to see such routes provided at the expense of long-term strategic infrastructure so it is critical that the goals are not hampered even in the short term particularly when other more suitable greenway options could be explored taking account of environmental, social and economic considerations.\\" Supporters of the Greenway claim that use of a Greenway will protect the trackbed from adverse possession claims and will not preclude reinstatement of the disused sections of line as a working railway in the future. Sligo to Derry The last phase of the Western Rail Corridor is the suggested construction of a railway connecting Sligo, Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Donegal, Letterkenny, Strabane and Derry where it will connect with the Belfast-Derry railway line. This proposal however is not included in the TEN-T European Transport policy. However, a study on future rail lines commissioned by Iarnr√≥d √âireann by consultants AECOM in 2011 found that an extension of the Belfast-Derry railway line to Letterkenny was one point away from being regarded as a viable prospect.

It began as an independent record label, founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to help create a unified music scene of Athens. After the dissolution of the record label, Lewis and Geller partnered with Cash Carter and Bill Fortenberry to revive Kindercore as a vinyl pressing plant. Kindercore Vinyl is the only vinyl pressing plant in the state of Georgia.  Record label  Kindercore Records began in the mid-1990s by musicians Lewis and Geller in response to the variety of musicians in Athens, but no unifying music culture. Early releases of the label include music by of Montreal and Kincaid (Geller's own band), singles from various Athens musicians, and bigger bands such as Japancakes. Kindercore's scope grew from a regional to national level as their records could be heard on radio stations and their bands networked with other touring bands. In 1998, the label moved to New York and joined with Emperor Norton records, creating better finances and more national exposure for Kindercore. In 2000, Kindercore moved back to Athens.  Pressing plant  The idea of creating a record pressing plant began in 2015. Cash Carter suggested reviving the label, to which Lewis refused. Carter then suggested a pressing plant. Lewis at first rebuffed the idea, but soon agreed upon further consideration. They then partnered with Geller and Bill Fortenberry to begin plans for the plant. After struggling to find financial backing, the group found a local investor interested in their idea to use plant-based PVC for the records. With a $1,000,000 investment, the plant acquired three brand new pressing machines, each costing $200,000, created by Canadian company Viryl Technologies. The presses, named ‚ÄúWarm Tone‚Äù, are fully automated, contrasting with former manual pressing machines; Kindercore is among the first factories to use such machines. Kindercore pressed its first record on Halloween of 2017 and presently can press up to 3,000 records in one day. Their focus continues to stay on local music artists of the Athens area as well as national indie bands who are often overlooked in the music industry.

The property had a main residence and a guest house. The main house had been occupied by various famous Hollywood and music industry figures. In 1994, both houses were demolished and a new house was constructed on the site, and the street address was changed to 10066 Cielo Drive. Architecture The original house was designed by Robert Byrd in 1942 and completed in 1944 for French actress Mich√®le Morgan. It was extremely similar, but not exactly identical, to the house which sat on its own plateau directly below 10050, 10048 Cielo Drive, which was often called the Twin House. They were originally built on land called The Bedrock Properties and were built at the same time. The French country-style structure was located on , and included a private drive on Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, an area west of Hollywood in the Santa Monica Mountains that overlooks Beverly Hills and Bel Air. The hillside structure faced east and featured stone fireplaces, beamed ceilings, paned windows, a loft above the living room, a swimming pool and a guest house, and was surrounded by thick pine and flowering cherry trees. History Mich√®le Morgan, French actress for RKO Radio Pictures, arranged for architect Robert Byrd to design a home and J.F. Wadkins to build the luxury home resembling an early 19th-century European style farmhouse. The house was completed in 1944, with an address of 10050 Cielo Drive. It was on a 3.3-acre level lot above Benedict Canyon in Beverly Hills. The home included a 3,200 square foot main residence and 2,000 square foot guest cottage. According to the Los Angeles Times, Morgan paid $32,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). By the end of World War II, Morgan had returned to France. The house was later sold to Dr. Hartley Dewey and his wife Louise who rented it to Lillian Gish in 1946, while she was filming Duel in the Sun. Rudolph Altobelli (1929‚Äì2011), a music and film industry talent manager, bought the house for $86,000 in the early 1960s (equivalent to $ million in ) and often rented it out. Residents included Cary Grant and Dyan Cannon (it was their honeymoon nest in 1965), Henry Fonda, George Chakiris, Mark Lindsay, Paul Revere & the Raiders, Samantha Eggar, and Olivia Hussey. Charles Manson visited the house in late 1968, when it was occupied (from May 1966 to January 1969) by couple Terry Melcher (the son of actress Doris Day) and Candice Bergen with roommate/talent-manager Roger Hart. The couple split in early 1969, with Melcher relocating to Malibu. In February 1969, Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate began renting the home from Altobelli. On August 8-9, 1969, the home became the scene of the murders of Tate, Wojciech Frykowski, Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring, and Steven Parent at the hands of the Manson \\"Family\\". William Garretson, Altobelli's caretaker and an acquaintance of Parent, lived in the guest house behind the main house and was unaware of the murders until the next morning, when he was taken into custody by police officers who had arrived at the scene. He was later cleared of all charges. Altobelli moved into the house just three weeks after the murders and resided there until 1988. During an interview on ABC's show 20/20, he said that while living there, he felt \\"safe, secure, loved and beauty.\\" The house was then sold to John Prell, a real estate investor. The purchase price was $1.6 million in 1989 (equivalent to $ million in ). In 1992, Prell sold the property to Alvin Weintraub, another real estate investor. Nine Inch Nails The final resident of the original house was the musician Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Reznor rented the house from 1992 and set up a recording studio there. This studio, dubbed \\"Pig\\" (sometimes called \\"Le Pig\\") in a reference to murderer Susan Atkins' writing \\"Pig\\" in Tate's blood on the front door of the house, was the site of recording sessions for most of the Nine Inch Nails album The Downward Spiral (1994). The band also recorded the EP Broken and filmed the video for \\"Gave Up\\" at 10050 Cielo Drive. Marilyn Manson recorded sections of the album Portrait of an American Family at the in-house studio in 1992. Reznor moved out in December 1993, later explaining \\"there was too much history in that house for me to handle.\\" Reznor made a statement about working in the Tate house during a 1997 interview with Rolling Stone: Reznor took the front door of the house with him when he moved out, installing it at Nothing Studios, his new recording studio/record label headquarters in New Orleans. Nothing Studios was later sold and the fa√ßade of the building changed. The front door Reznor removed from 10050 Cielo Drive is currently preserved in the possession of the owner of the building. Destruction After renting out the house, Alvin Weintraub had it demolished in 1994, and construction on a new home began later that same year. In 1996 the newly constructed home was completed, that he named Villa Bella, and obtained a new address for the property, 10066 Cielo Drive. The home does not resemble the residence in which the Tate murders occurred. It is an 18,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style mansion. When he listed Villa Bella for sale in 1998, Weintraub assured Los Angeles magazine that this was certainly not the Manson murder house. \\"We went to great pains to get rid of everything ... There‚Äôs no house, no dirt, no blade of grass remotely connected to Sharon Tate.\\" The owner of the property as of December 2013 was Hollywood producer Jeff Franklin. In 2010, he had made this comment to Architectural Digest: \\"What I fell in love with here was the setting, the view, the privacy and the amount of flat land\\" but complained that the design of the house was badly conceived. The property was on the market in August 2019, showing an estimated price of $9.7 million.

Tomyris led her armies to defend against an attack by Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire, and, according to Herodotus, defeated and killed him in 530 BC.  History  The names of Tomyris, and her son Spargapises, who was the head of her army, are of Iranian origins. Since the historians who first wrote of her were Greek, the Hellenic form of her name is used most frequently. Many Greek historians recorded that she \\"defeated and killed\\" Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire, during his invasion and attempted conquest of her country. Herodotus, who lived from approximately 484 to 425 BC, is the earliest of the classical writers to give an account of her career, writing almost one hundred years later. Her history was well known and became legendary. Strabo, Polyaenus, Cassiodorus, and Jordanes also wrote of her, in De origine actibusque Getarum (\\"The origin and deeds of the Goths/Getae\\"). According to the accounts of Greek historians, Cyrus was victorious in his initial assault on the Massagetae. His advisers suggested laying a trap for the pursuing Scythians: the Persians left behind them an apparently abandoned camp, containing a rich supply of wine. The pastoral Scythians were not used to drinking wine‚Äî\\"their favored intoxicants were Hasheesh with fermented mare's milk\\"Mayor, Adrienne. Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, and Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World. New York, Overlook Duckworth, 2003; p. 158.‚Äîand they drank themselves into a stupor (with the alcohol deliberately left behind by Cyrus). The Persians attacked while their opponents were incapacitated, defeating the Massagetae forces, and capturing Tomyris' son, Spargapises, the general of her army. Of the one third of the Massagetae forces that fought, there were more captured than killed. According to Herodotus, Spargapises coaxed Cyrus into removing his bonds, thus allowing him to commit suicide while in Persian captivity. Tomyris sent a message to Cyrus denouncing his treachery, and with all her forces, challenged him to a second battle. In the fight that ensued, the Massagetae got the upper hand, and the Persians were defeated with high casualties. According to Herodotus, Cyrus was killed and Tomyris had his corpse beheaded and then crucified,Mayor, pp. 157‚Äì9. and shoved his head into a wineskin filled with human blood. She was reportedly quoted as saying, \\"I warned you that I would quench your thirst for blood, and so I shall\\"Herodotus Book One (205)-(214) (Hdt 1.214) Xenophon, on the other hand, says that Cyrus died peacefully in his bed,Xenophon, Cyropaedia VII. 7; M.A. Dandamaev, \\"Cyrus II\\", in Encyclopaedia Iranica, p. 250.

Eustache Deschamps added Tomyris to his poetry as one of the nine Female Worthies in the late 14th century. In Shakespeare's earliest play King Henry VI (Part I), the Countess of Auvergne while awaiting Lord Talbot's arrival speaks these lines (Act II, Sc.iii): Shakespeare's reference to Tomyris as 'Queen of the Scythians', rather than the usual Greek designation 'Queen of the Massagetae', points to two possible likely sources, Marcus Junianus Justinus' \\"Abridged Trogus Pompeius\\"https://archive.org/stream/iustinihistoria00unkngoog#page/ in Latin, or Arthur Golding's translation (1564).The Reader's Companion to The Death of Shakespeare By Jon Benson https://books.google.de/books?id=ekygCwAAQBAJ&pg; The history of Tomyris has been incorporated into the tradition of Western art; Rubens, Allegrini, Luca Ferrari, Mattia Preti, Gustave Moreau and the sculptor Severo Calzetta da Ravenna are among the many artists who have portrayed events in the life of Tahm-Rayi≈° and her defeat of Cyrus and his armies.

The series functions both as a social satire on real-life Gothic subculture and as a supernatural fantasy. Gloomcookie is irregularly published by Slave Labor Graphics. As of July 2008, 28 issues have been published, as well as a one shot special, Gloomcookie: A Monster's Christmas Color Special. Five volumes of reprints have been published, each of the first four including six issues of the series in trade paperback form, and the last one including five issues of the series. Characters=Main characters * Lex: The primary female protagonist, Lex is a novelty-shop employee and avid goth clubgoer. Lex eventually discovers that she and Damion are star-crossed lovers. * Sebastian: A lonely boy who sometimes suspects that he is confusing his dreams with reality. In truth, Sebastian has the ability to manipulate reality at will, either deliberately or accidentally. However, his powers often create unpredictable and dangerous side-effects. Sebastian also has true sight, which allows him to see monsters for what they are and to have prophetic dreams. * Chrys: Sebastian's girlfriend. Chrys was originally an inanimate waxen sculpture, brought to life accidentally by Sebastian's powers. Chrys was, for a time, possessed by the Monster, who made her bring boys home and eat them. She eventually coughed up the Monster and went back to her normal self. * Damion: Lex's cursed lover, Damion is doomed to fall in love with incarnation after incarnation of Lex, and to watch her die. Damion was originally a gargoyle, brought to life by Isabella to keep her company. He has the ability to take on the form of either a normal human being or a winged gargoyle, allowing him to fly among other things. * Isabella: The main villain of the series, Isabella is perceived as selfish, cold and manipulative. It is revealed that she in fact feels very lonely and miserable because she is a monster. Isabella used to be a part of the Carnival Macabre. She is also responsible for Lex and Damion's curse. Like Damion, she can either take the form of a human being, or that of a winged monster. * The Monster: Sebastian's fearsome-looking guardian lives beneath his bed. For some time, the Monster ate all the girls Sebastian brought home, until Chrys, in turn, ate him. The Monster used to be part of the Carnival Macabre. Secondary characters * Max: Another staple at the club, Max shares an on-again, off-again relationship with Lex, to which he refuses to commit himself. Lex and Max drift apart as Lex pursues a relationship with Damion. * Vermillion: A wealthy, spoiled, socially awkward young man with a tenuous grip on reality. Vermillion enjoys reading his terrible poetry in goth clubs and is obsessed with a roleplaying game called 'Nosferatu: The Charade' (an obvious parody of Vampire: The Masquerade) * Lyndi: A mutual friend of Chrys and Lex, with whom they often commiserate over coffee. * Moonraven: Self-proclaimed \\"Queen of San Francisco\\", who pines for Vermillion's love and affection so much that she deceives him into believing she possesses 'Nosferatu' powers. * Vincent: Sebastian's father. Vincent is the ringleader of the Carnival Macabre, and looks strikingly like Vincent Price, which leads Sebastian (who always wished Vincent Price were his father) to wonder whether Vincent is another product of his imagination. * Lucy: Lucy is Sebastian's mother. She ran away from the Carnival with Sebastian shortly after his birth, causing the Carnival's partial dismantling. * Jezebel and Gretchen: the conjoined twins Jezebel and Gretchen were members of the Carnival Macabre until Isabella left with them and employed them as her servants. Isabella later returned them to the Carnival. * Artemus: Artemus is Isabella's lover, he is a werewolf, he was a member of the Carnival Macabre until Isabella left, upon his return he helped Isabella break the curse. * Sarah: Sarah is a mutual friend of Lex and Lyndi, she was also Sebastian's ex-girlfriend, she was eaten by the monster, but Sebastian brought her from another dimension from which she was not eaten by the monster, in that dimension she was going out with Max.  Development  Each 6-issue run has featured a different artist, beginning with Ted Naifeh, followed by John Gebbia, Breehn Burns, Harley Sparx and currently Vincent Batignole. Recently it was revealed on Serena Valentino's LiveJournal page that she intended to end the individual issue release of the series, in favour of releasing a series of complete graphic novels at an undisclosed time.

The original line-up consisted of Barry Cawley (bass), Emyr Davies (vocals), Dylan Hughes (drums) and Mark Roberts (lead guitars). They performed on Welsh language television, and internationally, until they broke up in 1991. Afterwards, Roberts formed Catatonia, with Jones joining the band a while later. Cawley was also a guitar technician for the band. History Y Cyrff were formed by Mark Roberts in the fifth year of secondary school. The initial line-up had Barry Cawley on bass, Emyr Davies on vocals, and Dylan Hughes on drums. They were influenced by Joe Strummer and The Clash. Managing the band was Tony Schiavone, who was also their Geography teacher. Many of their earliest performances were at their school, Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy, but they also played at the Llanrwst community centre. After the school years, Emyr left the band, and Roberts took over as vocalist. Around the same time, Cawley switched position to rhythm guitarist, allowing Paul Jones, a friend of Roberts' from outside school, to join the band as bassist. He was older than the other boys, and was working in a dog food factory at the time. The band performed Welsh language songs, and began to get noticed by the fanzines of the genre. They would often work with Yr Anhrefn, either supporting them in their concerts or doing the reverse, when Y Cyrff were booked as the lead act. Their first recorded work was on the Cam O'r Tywyllwch compilation album on Anhrefn Records in 1985 and their track Lebanon was described by reviewer Neil Crud as being \\"head and shoulders above\\" other songs on the album. Y Cyrff formed their own record label to release the single \\"Pum Munud\\" (\\"Five Minutes\\") in 1986, and later that year they were offered the chance to perform on the S4C television channel. When they later performed in front of English speaking student unions, the band received some criticism from some Welsh speakers according to Rhys Mwyn. Y Cyrff were signed to the Sain record label and recorded the seven track long album, Y Testament Newydd (\\"The New Testament\\") in 1987. Dylan left the band shortly afterwards to join Yr Anhrefn, and was replaced by Mark Kendall. Through connections with the Welsh television programme Fideo 9, they were able to make music videos and performed overseas in Warsaw, Poland. They also played at concerts arranged by the Welsh Language Society. It was at one of those performances where Y Cyrff played for the last time in 1991 at the Pavilion in Pontrhydfendigaid. The band broke up as they realised that they couldn't get mainstream success singing only in Welsh. After the band split up, Mark Roberts went on to form Catatonia with Cerys Matthews. When the band signed to the Crai label, Roberts brought Jones into the band from Y Cyrff. Barry Cawley, who later worked as a guitar technician with Catatonia, was killed in 2000 when his cycle was hit by a car near Llanrwst.

Brought up to follow in his father's footsteps, he spent his spare time carving off-cuts and soon showed a precocious talent for art. He had been impressed as a boy with so-called living statues who displayed themselves at fairs. He used to peek through the cracks of the tents. At home he began to \\"do the statues before the looking-glass.\\" (Chums boys' annual, 1896, page 135). He started to carve butter stamps and a foreman plasterer in the next street suggested he went to art school to study anatomy. At nineteen he pawned his overcoat to pay for evening classes at the local Lambeth School of Art in Kennington Park Road. In Chums Boys Annual of 1896 Tinworth explained: \\"I had to keep the whole affair dark from my father. Indeed, I went to Lambeth School of Art of a night for months before he knew anything about it. He used to ask my mother where I was, but happily for me she always refused to gratify his curiosity.\\" (Chums, 1896). Before he sold any work he made money by mending cart wheels. He also worked in a fireworks factory earning half a crown per week. From there he moved to a hot presser's where for four shillings per week he worked from seven in the morning until nine at night. In the same year that he began study at Lambeth he created 'The Mocking of Christ', now on show at the Cuming Museum on the Walworth Road, Southwark. From the Lambeth School of Art (now the City and Guilds of London Art SchoolCity and Guilds of London Art School web site) he went on to the Royal Academy Schools in 1864, winning various medals for his work. Doulton & Co After the Royal Academy he got a job with Doulton, the Lambeth stoneware manufacturer, Tinworth had previously been one of a group of students from the Lambeth School of Art who assisted its principal, John Sparkes in the making of a terracotta frieze for an extension to Doulton's premises. He began work at the Doulton factory making cases for water filters, but soon moved on to making the new range of salt- glazed stoneware that became known simply as \\"Doulton Ware\\". About thirty examples of his work were shown at the 1867 Paris Exhibition. His father died in the same year, and he was left as the main supporter of his mother and family. Saul throws a spear at David by Tinworth St. Alban's Anglican Church in Copenhagen, Denmark, donated by Doulton and designed by Tinworth The City of Refuge by Tinworth, alt= Four decorative panels by Tinworth, from alt= At Doulton, he produced vases, jugs, humorous figures and animals and larger pieces. Through his engagement with Doulton, Tinworth also designed an altarpiece, a pulpit and a font for St. Alban's Anglican Church which was consecrated in 1887 in Copenhagen, Denmark. They were donations from the factory to the church and manufactured in terra cotta with salt glazed details to Tinworth 's design. Notable work Detail: The Fountain of Life The Cuming Museum, Southwark, has three examples of his life-sized clay heads and a terracotta scene entitled The Jews making bricks under Egyptian Taskmasters. This last was presented to the museum by Doulton and Co in 1914 as a memorial to Tinworth; they seem not to have recognised that it could be interpreted as an allegory of the exploitation of his fellow clayworkers. Many of his pieces were shown at the Royal Academy where they were admired by John Ruskin, amongst others. The first to be exhibited there, in the year he joined the school, was a group of children fighting called \\"Peace and Wrath in Low Life\\".Doulton Artists A large scale terracotta fountain, \\"The Fountain of Life\\", was donated to Kennington Park by Henry Doulton in 1872 (or 1869?). This was vandalised in the 1980s and The Friends of the Park are seeking funding for its restoration. Other pieces by Tinworth are to be found in the Museum of Garden History in Lambeth; adjacent to the main entrance of St Bede's College, Manchester; in the panel above the entrance to the former Doulton WorksDetail of former Doulton's works, Black Prince Road in Black Prince Road,Black Prince Road and Doris Street  Survey of London; vol. 23 Lambeth; the Baptist Chapel in Wraysbury;The Doulton Lambeth Wares, Desmond Eyles and Louise Irvine: Richard Dennis, Shepton Beauchamp, 2002, p. 49. in Truro Cathedral, Cornwall; in St Mark's Church in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent; and in St Mary's Church in Burton, Wiltshire. In 1870, Tinworth was commissioned to produce two stone friezes for the royal parish church at Sandringham, Norfolk. The works, entitled The Brazen Serpent and Descent from the Cross were later removed from the church and in 1930 were donated by The Royal Collection to St Gabriel's Church, North Acton, following a national appeal for assistance in completing the church, after its construction costs exceeded the available funds. They remain on public display in Acton. The Cuming Museum has Tinworth's major independent art project in storage. This is a model of a project for an elaborate memorial to Southwark's connection with Shakespeare, made in 1904. Enough public donations were never achieved to realise it. Though this was Tinworth's most ambitious autonomous art project, he also made a number of complex figure compositions in relief, including The Release of Barabas and Saul attacking David. The Southwark Local Studies ArchiveSouthwark Local Studies Library ‚Äì 24 Hour Museum ‚Äì official guide to UK museums, galleries, exhibitions and heritage at www.24hourmuseum.org.uk has his manuscript (and unpublished) autobiography. At York Minster, the reredos of St Stephen's Chapel in terracotta is due to Tinworth. It was added in 1937. Death Tinworth died in London on 11 September 1913 and was buried in his mother's plot at West Norwood Cemetery. The monument on the tomb was one of many destroyed by the London Borough of Lambeth, who reused the grave for new burials in the 1980s. After a legal protest by a descendant, Lambeth placed a simple plaque commemorating the people buried in the plot.Friends of West Norwood Cemetery Newsletter 52 His name is commemorated in Tinworth Street, Lambeth.

She was named for The Hermitage, President Andrew Jackson's estate just outside Nashville, Tennessee. Hermitage was laid down on 11 April 1955, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Miss.; launched on 12 June 1956; sponsored by Mrs. Alfred M. Pride, wife of Vice Admiral Alfred M. Pride, and commissioned on 14 December 1956, Captain Leonard A. Parker in command. Service history While on shakedown in the Caribbean, Hermitage was informally inspected by Admiral Arleigh Burke, then Chief of Naval Operations. After training operations out of Naval Station Norfolk, she sailed for the Mediterranean Sea in late August to join the 6th Fleet. Hermitage participated in exercises with NATO units and visited Sicily, Crete, Turkey, Italy, Greece, and Spain before returning to the States on 16 November 1957. Operations primarily with fast amphibious helicopter assault equipment and tactics occupied her until November 1959. With a cargo of Presidential helicopters embarked, Hermitage sailed to Karachi on 2 December via the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Suez Canal, and Red and Arabian seas to furnish transportation for President Dwight D. Eisenhower on his Asian and European tour. Mission successfully completed, she returned home via Barcelona on 17 January 1960. Hermitage sailed on 28 November as flagship for Admiral A. L. Reed, COMSOLANT, for a good will cruise to South America and Africa. In the midst of this important cruise, Hermitage was diverted on 19 January 1961 to carry grain to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to help the United Nations combat starvation in that country. Relieved as flagship on 3 May by , Hermitage returned to Virginia on 16 May and soon resumed her pattern of operations and exercises off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean. When the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba threatened war in October 1962, Hermitage sailed to Guantanamo Bay to transport Marines to that threatened base and underline America's determination to maintain her position there. A second cruise to the Mediterranean from May to October 1963 took Hermitage to Naples, Athens, Genoa, Cannes, Sardinia, Malta, and Rota, Spain as well as other ports in the 6th Fleet's area. After an assignment in February 1964 to the Caribbean Ready Squadron 12 based in Panama, early in May Hermitage undertook a logistics lift to Bermuda, and Sydney and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in the fall took part until late November in the Navy-Marine Corps peacetime exercise \\"Operation Steel Pike I\\", visiting ports of M√°laga and Gibraltar. In June 1965 she participated in a three-month deployment to the Caribbean area during the later stages of the Dominican Republic crisis, making practice amphibious landings at Vieques Island. After completion of overhaul in February 1966 followed by refresher training and amphibious training, Hermitage transported a marine battalion to the Caribbean in May. Through 1967 she continued in her assignment to the Atlantic Fleet.  NDD Cear√° (G-30)  Hermitage was decommissioned on 2 October 1989. She was transferred to the Brazilian Navy as NDD Cear√° (G30) the same day. The ship was sold outright to Brazil and struck from the US Naval Vessel Register on 24 January 2001.

As a player Carey spent most of his career at Manchester United, where he was team captain from 1946 until he retired as a player in 1953. He was also a dual internationalist, playing for and captaining both Ireland teams ‚Äì the FAI XI and the IFA XI. In 1947 he also captained a Europe XI which played a Great Britain XI at Hampden Park. In 1949 he was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year and in the same year captained the FAI XI that defeated England 2‚Äì0 at Goodison Park, becoming the first non-UK team to beat England at home. Carey was also the first non-UK player and the first Irishman to captain a winning team in both an FA Cup Final and the First Division. Like his contemporary Con Martin, Carey was an extremely versatile footballer and played in nine different positions throughout his career. He even played in goal for United on one occasion. Early years As a schoolboy, Carey played football for Home Farm. As a youth, he also played Gaelic football and was selected for the Dublin county team at minor level before he signed for St James's Gate at the start of the 1936‚Äì37 season. After just two months of League of Ireland football, he was spotted by Billy Behan, a Dublin-based Manchester United scout. Behan convinced the United chief scout, Louis Rocca, to check him out and in November 1936 United signed him for a then League of Ireland record fee of ¬£250. He made his debut as an inside-left for United on 23 September 1937 against Southampton. During his first season with United, Carey, together with Harry Baird, Jack Rowley, Tommy Bamford, Tommy Breen and Stan Pearson, helped United gain promotion to the First Division.Manchester United fansite Second World War During the Second World War, Carey continued to play for Manchester United and between 1939 and 1943 he played 112 games and scored 47 goals in the wartime regional leagues. He also played as a guest for several other clubs including Cardiff City, Manchester City, Everton, Liverpool and MiddlesbroughWho's Who Of Liverpool (2006): Tony MatthewsSoccer at War ‚Äì 1939 ‚Äì 45 (2005): Jack Rollin On 28 April 1940, Carey guested for a League of Ireland XI against a Scottish League XI in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Dalymount Park. His teammates on the day included Jimmy Dunne, Paddy Bradshaw and John Feenan. He also guested for Shamrock Rovers in a League of Ireland game against Limerick on 6 April 1941. He gave a good performance at inside left, scoring in a 5‚Äì0 win. He guested again for Rovers in April 1942 and scored twice in a 7‚Äì1 win against Shelbourne. He also played and scored again for Rovers in a League of Ireland Shield game at Milltown against Waterford United on 11 November 1945.The Hoops by Paul Doolan and Robert Goggins () Carey also served with the British Army in both Italy and the Middle East and while in Italy, he also played part-time for several different clubs using the nickname Cario. When the war ended Carey received several offers to stay on in Italy. Return to Manchester United On his return to Manchester United, Carey began playing as a midfielder and defender. He was also appointed team captain by Matt Busby. He captained United to victory in the 1948 FA Cup final and to second place in the First Division four times before eventually winning the title in 1952. His teammates at United during this era included among others, Jack Rowley, Charlie Mitten and John Aston. During his career with United, Carey played 304 league games, scoring 17 goals. He played a further 38 games in the FA Cup and scored one further goal. Carey also played twice for United in the FA Charity Shield. He also gained the distinction of being the first player from Ireland to win a major trophy with Manchester United. Irish international When Carey began his international career in 1937 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland- based IFA and the Ireland-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Carey played for both teams. In September 1946 Carey, along with Bill Gorman, even played for both teams within three days of each other, both times against England. On 28 September at Windsor Park he played for the IFA XI in a 7‚Äì2 defeat. Then on 30 September at Dalymount Park he played for the FAI XI in a 1‚Äì0 defeat. FAI XI Between 1937 and 1953 Carey made 29 appearances and scored 3 goals for the FAI XI, making his debut against Norway on 7 November 1937 in a team that also included Jimmy Dunne and fellow debutant, Kevin O'Flanagan. The game which was a qualifier for the 1938 FIFA World Cup finished as a 3‚Äì3 draw. He scored his first goal for the FAI XI in a 3‚Äì2 win against Poland on 13 November 1938 and scored his second in the very next game, a 2‚Äì2 draw with Hungary on 19 March 1939. Carey captained the XI on 19 occasions. On 21 September 1949, he was captain when an FAI XI defeated England 2‚Äì0 at Goodison Park, becoming the first non-UK team to beat England at home. Carey scored his third goal, a penalty, for the FAI XI in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Norway on 26 November 1950. He played his last game for the FAI XI on 25 March 1953 in a 4‚Äì0 win over Austria.The Boys In Green ‚Äì The FAI International Story (1997): Sean Ryan IFA XI Carey also made 9 appearances for the IFA XI between 1946 and 1949. In 1946 he played in the Victory Internationals against Scotland and Wales On 27 November 1946 he played for the IFA XI in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Scotland. Together with Peter Farrell, Con Martin, Bill Gorman, Tommy Eglington, Alex Stevenson and Davy Walsh, he was one of seven players born in the Irish Free State to play for the IFA XI that day. The draw helped the team finish as runners-up in the 1947 British Home Championship. Coaching career One of Carey's earliest experiences as a coach came when he was still an active player; he took charge of the Ireland team at the 1948 Olympics. Ireland lost 3‚Äì1 to the Netherlands in the opening round in a game played at Fratton Park. Carey retired as a player in 1953 and almost immediately accepted the position as manager of Blackburn Rovers. In 1958 he guided Rovers into First Division. He then became manager at Everton but, despite leading them to fifth place in the 1960‚Äì61 season, their highest post-war position, he was sacked in the back of a taxi by director John Moores. As a result, the jibe, 'Taxi for ...!' has become a staple insult offered to any manager facing the threat of the sack. He next managed Leyton Orient and took them into the First Division in 1962, their only season in the top division. However his greatest success as a manager came with Nottingham Forest. In 1967, he guided them to the FA Cup semi-finals and to second place in the First Division behind his former club Manchester United. Between 1955 and 1967 Carey also served as team manager of the Republic of Ireland. However Carey had very little power as the team itself was chosen by a selection committee. In October 1970, Carey returned to the manager's role at Blackburn, after a spell as administrative manager. He was sacked on 7 June 1971.

The company was started in 1865 by Georges Favre-Jacot at the age of 22, in Le Locle in the canton of Neuch√¢tel. Zenith was purchased by LVMH in November 1999, becoming one of several brands in its watch and jewellery division which includes TAG Heuer and Hublot. Julien Tornare is the current CEO after Jean-Claude Biver (Interim CEO) in 2017, replacing CEO Aldo Magada, who had replaced Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Dufour in 2014. Zenith is one of the Swiss watch manufacturers that still produce their own movements in-house. History George Favre-Jacot was born 1843 and died 1917. He was an apprentice within the watchmaking industry while still a youth. Favre-Jacot at some time requested that a house be built for himself at Le Locle, by the architect Le Corbusier. He was also closely involved with another prominent architect, named Alphonse Laverri√®re. His relationship with this latter architect was the source of influence upon the Werkbund movement. The two men collaborated with a shared artistic vision of the nature of production, to the extent to which they themselves somewhat reformed the artistic situation within francophone Switzerland at the time.

Zenith's El Primero movement was used by Rolex from 1988 to 2000 for the Rolex Daytona chronograph. The El Primero movement's high rate allows a resolution of of a second and a potential for greater positional accuracy over the more common standard frequency of 28,800 vibrations per hour (8 Hz). The El Primero was honoured with a 2012 release of the El Primero Stratos Flyback Striking 10th, limited to 1,969 pieces (in honour of the original 1969 release date), that housed the same 36,000 vph movement and a sub-dial measuring in tenths of a second to make a complete rotation every ten seconds.https://www.timepiecechronicle.com/features/2017/10/3/thehistoryofthezenithelprimerohttps://www.watchtime.com/featured/on- the-cusp-a-brief-history-of-the-zenith-el- primero/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-carbon-is-giving-watches-a-well- needed-makeoverhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/fashion/watches-la-chaux-de- fonds-switzerland.html Photo gallery File: Zenith El Primero.jpg Chronograph El Primero, first version 1970 File:Zenith img 0988.jpg  Zenith El Primero File:Zenit img 0985.jpg  Zenith El Primero File:Zenith img 0987.jpg  Zenith El Primero File:Zenith El Primero 36000.jpg Zenith El Primero File:CameraZOOM-20101010135432.jpg  Zenith pocket watch c. 1900‚Äì1910 (original mechanism, but no original casing) File:Zenith pocket watch inside.jpg  Inside of Zenith pocket watch c. 1900‚Äì1910 (original mechanism, but no original casing) Image:MIH-film126.jpgZenith Grande Chronomaster XXT, Quanti√®me perp√©tuel  Notable patrons and owners  Mahatma Gandhi owned a Zenith pocket watch with alarm function, which was given to him by Indira Nehru, the 3rd Prime Minister of India.

It is the southern variation of the \\"northern broadsword\\", or Beidao. Its blade bears some resemblance to the butterfly sword, also a southern Chinese single-bladed weapon; the main difference is the size, and the fact that the butterfly swords have D-shaped knuckle guards. The main difference with the beidao is that the nandao is mostly used two- handed due to its larger amount of weight, and it has a large metal crossguard useful in deflecting blows and hooking the opponent's weapon; also, although it is single-edged, the nandao is not curved like the northern broadsword. The differentiation between beidao and nandao appear to be rather modern. There is no historical usage of the term and few antique weapons have been found with a shape that resembles a \\"nandao\\". Therefore, it can never have been a major form as widely used as niuweidao, yanmaodao, liuyedao and the Butterfly swords.

Among the Lepcha, it is called Chi. Geographical prevalence Chhaang is consumed by ethnically Nepalese and Tibetan people, and to a lesser degree, by the neighboring nations of India and Bhutan. It is usually drunk at room temperature in summer, but is often served piping-hot in brass bowls or wooden mugs when the weather is colder. The Limbu people of eastern Nepal call the drink Tongba. Ingredients and drinking A commercially produced Tibetan chang brewed from barley Chhaang is a relative of beer. Barley, millet (finger-millet) or rice grains are used to brew the drink. Semi-fermented seeds of millet are served, stuffed in a barrel of bamboo called a dhungro. Boiling water is then poured in and sipped through a narrow-bore bamboo tube called a pipsing. When the boiled barley has cooled, some yeast or dried barm is added and it is left to stand for two or three days after fermentation begins. This concoction is called glum. The barm consists of flour and, in Balti, often has ginger and aconite added to it.Jaschke, H. √Ñ. A Tibetan- English Dictionary. (1881). Reprint: (1987). Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi. . After fermentation is complete, water is added to the brew and it is then ready for consumption.Das, Sarat Chandra. (1902). Lhasa and Central Tibet, p. 23 and note. Reprint: (1988). Mehra Offset Press, Delhi. In Lahaul the glum is pressed out by hand instead of by filtering, yielding a rather cloudy drink. The residue of malt can be pressed through a strainer and then mixed with water or milk and used in baking bread or cakes. Near Mount Everest of Nepal, chhaang is made by passing hot water through fermenting barley, and is then served in a large pot and drunk through a wooden straw.Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael. (2005) Tibet. 6th Edition, p. 75. . This beverage is similar to the traditional drink of the Limbus, mandokpenaa thee.P.75 Handbook of Plant- Based Fermented Food and Beverage Technology, Second Edition By Y. H. Hui, E. √ñzg√ºl Evranuz CRC Press, 17 May 2012 Nepalese jand refers to the turbid liquor which is obtained by leaching out the extract with water from the fermented mash. Unlike chhang or tongba, jand is served in large mugs. These alcoholic beverages are generated using a traditional starter called murcha. Murcha itself is prepared by using yeast and mold flora of wild herbs in cereal flours. The brew tastes like ale. The alcohol content is quite low, but it produces an intense feeling of warmth and well-being, ideal for enduring the temperatures which go well below freezing in winter. Aconite and potential toxicity Chhaang The plant name Aconite may refer to two plant genera in the family Ranunculaceae, namely Aconitum and Eranthis, although Eranthis is known more usually as Winter Aconite. The plants used in the brewing of Chhaang in Baltistan and Ladakh are, however, almost certainly referable to Aconitum species, which have a long history of use in the folk medicinal systems of Asia. Aconitum species are amongst the most virulently poisonous plants known, containing a variety of extremely toxic alkaloids, including aconitine and pseudaconitine. The use of Aconitum as an additive in beer-brewing is therefore a practice fraught with the danger of fatal poisoning and should on no account be undertaken by any individual attempting to replicate a traditional Chhaang recipe. Although individual Aconitum species vary somewhat in the degree of their toxicity, all are poisonous and, when used in traditional herbal medicine, are invariably pre-treated in various ways intended to minimise their toxicity, while retaining their assumed therapeutic properties. Nevertheless, numerous fatalities have occurred resulting from such medicinal use e.g. in certain Chinese medicinal soups consumed for their supposed tonic effects, which include augmenting physical strength, boosting the immune system, and dispelling 'wind' and 'dampness'. Myth Chhaang is said to be the best remedy to ward off the severe cold of the mountains. It reputedly has many healing properties for conditions like the common cold, fevers, allergic rhinitis, and alcoholism among others. According to legend, chhaang is also popular with the Yeti, or Himalayan Snowmen, who often raid isolated mountain villages to drink it. Social correlates Drinking and making offerings of chhaang are part of many pan-Tibetan social and religious occasions, including settling disputes, welcoming guests, and wooing.

Biography Birthhouse of Alfred Krupp and his father Friedrich Krupp in Essen, around 1850‚Äì1880 Alfred Krupp, son of Friedrich Krupp and his wife Theresa Helena Johann Wilhelmi (1790-1850), was born in 1812. His father did not manage to put the factory he founded in 1811 on its feet during his lifetime. He died in 1826 when Alfred Krupp was 14 years old and left to his son the secret of making high-quality cast steel, together with a small workshop in which production had come almost to a standstill. At this time, the family lived with the aunt in Metternich. The company, which at that time had only seven jobs and a debt of 10,000 thalers, was inherited by the wife of Friedrich Theresa. Together with Friedrich Krupp's sister, Helena von M√ºller, n√©e Krupp, a steel company was founded. The founding agreement was signed by all the heirs of Friedrich and his sister Helena. Alfred dropped out of school and took over the firm, although the firm was officially owned by his mother. By 1830 the situation had changed. With the development of rail transport in Germany and Europe, the demand for steel for the production of rails and steam locomotive axles has greatly increased. On 26 August 1830, after overcoming some difficulties in steel production, Krupp supplies cast steel rolls for the first time to H√ºseken in Hagen-Hohenlimburg. The creation of the German Customs Union facilitated freight transport in Germany. In 1836, Krupp already employed 60 people. Alfred Krupp took care of his \\"Kruppians\\", as they were later called, all his life. He introduced sickness insurance and built apartments for workers. In exchange, he demanded loyalty from them to the firm. Alfred Krupp won new customers, extended his firm's purchases of raw materials, and secured funds to finance the expansion of his works. At the first world exhibition, the Great Exhibition, in London in 1851, he exhibited the largest steel ingot ever cast up to that time (4,300 pounds). In 1851, another successful innovation, no-weld railway tyres, began the company's primary revenue stream, from sales to railways in the United States. Alfred enlarged the factory and fulfilled his long-cherished scheme to construct a breech-loading cannon of cast steel. He strongly believed in the superiority of breech-loaders, on account of improved accuracy and speed, but this view did not win general acceptance among military officers, who remained loyal to tried-and-true muzzle-loaded bronze cannon. Alfred soon began producing breech loading howitzers, one of which he gifted to the Prussian court. Indeed, unable to sell his steel cannon, Krupp gave it to the King of Prussia, who used it as a decorative piece. The king's brother Wilhelm, however, realized the significance of the innovation. After he became regent in 1859, Prussia bought its first 312 steel cannon from Krupp, which became the main arms manufacturer for the Prussian military. Prussia used the advanced technology of Krupp to defeat both Austria and France in the German Wars of Unification. The French high command refused to purchase Krupp guns despite Napoleon III's support. The Franco-Prussian war was in part a contest of \\"Kruppstahl\\" versus bronze cannon. The success of German artillery spurred the first international arms race, against Schneider-Creusot in France and Armstrong in England. Krupp was able to sell, alternately, improved artillery and improved steel shielding to countries from Russia to Chile to Siam. In the Panic of 1873, Alfred continued to expand, including the purchase of Spanish mines and Dutch shipping, making Krupp the biggest and richest company in Europe but nearly bankrupting it. He was bailed out with a 30 million Mark loan from a consortium of banks arranged by the Prussian State Bank. In 1878 and 1879 Krupp held competitions known as V√∂lkerschiessen, which were firing demonstrations of cannon for international buyers. These were held in Meppen, at the largest proving ground in the world; privately owned by Krupp. He took on 46 nations as customers. At the time of his death in 1887, he had 75,000 employees, including 20,200 in Essen. In his lifetime, Krupp manufactured a total of 24,576 guns; 10,666 for the German government and 13,910 for export. Krupp established the Generalregulativ as the firm's basic constitution. The company was a sole proprietorship, inherited by primogeniture, with strict control of workers. Krupp demanded a loyalty oath, required workers to obtain written permission from their foremen when they needed to use the toilet and issued proclamations telling his workers not to concern themselves with national politics. In return, Krupp provided social services that were unusually liberal for the era, including \\"colonies\\" with parks, schools and recreation grounds - while the widows' and orphans' and other benefit schemes insured the men and their families in case of illness or death. Essen became a large company town and Krupp became a de facto state within a state, with \\"Kruppianer\\" as loyal to the company and the Krupp family as to the nation and the Hohenzollern family. Krupp's paternalist strategy was adopted by Bismarck as government policy, as a preventive against Social Democratic tendencies, and later influenced the development and adoption of F√ºhrerprinzip by Adolf Hitler. The Krupp social services program began about 1861, when it was found that there were not sufficient houses in the town for firm employees, and the firm began building dwellings. By 1862 ten houses were ready for foremen, and in 1863 the first houses for workingmen were built in Alt Westend. Neu Westend was built in 1871 and 1872. By 1905, 400 houses were provided, many being given rent free to widows of former workers. A cooperative society was founded in 1868 which became the Consum-Anstalt. Profits were divided according to amounts purchased. A boarding house for single men, the M√©nage, was started in 1865 with 200 boarders and by 1905 accommodated 1000. Bath houses were provided and employees received free medical services. Accident, life, and sickness insurance societies were formed, and the firm contributed to their support. Technical and manual training schools were provided. Krupp was also held in high esteem by the kaiser, who dismissed Julius von Verdy du Vernois and his successor Hans von Kaltenborn for rejecting Krupp's design of the C-96 field gun, quipping, \\"I‚Äôve canned three War Ministers because of Krupp, and still they don‚Äôt catch on!\\" Krupp proclaimed he wished to have \\"a man come and start a counter-revolution\\" against Jews, socialists and liberals. In some of his odder moods, he considered taking the role himself. According to historian William Manchester, his great grandson, Krupp would interpret these outbursts as a prophecy fulfilled by the coming of Hitler. Krupp's marriage was not a happy one. His wife Bertha (not to be confused with their granddaughter), was unwilling to remain in polluted Essen in Villa H√ºgel, the mansion which Krupp designed. She spent most of their married years in resorts and spas, with their only child, a son.  The personality of Alfred Krupp  Alfred Krupp was an unusual person. On the one hand, he was a tireless worker who never rested on his laurels. On the other hand, he was an extreme hypochondriac who suffered from depression and did not leave his bed for weeks and months. He envisioned the employer as a patriarch, demanding from his workers not only respect, but also obedience and providing them with a secure existence for this. He thought highly of himself as an entrepreneur. In his villa Hugel, he received the leaders of Europe. Kings and emperors came to visit him not for receptions, but as clients. Therefore, in 1865, he refused the title of nobility granted to him by the King of Prussia as \\"inappropriate to his wishes.\\" His name was Krupp, and that was enough.William Manchester.

It is thought that butterfly swords date from the early 19th century. Several English language accounts from the 1840s describe local militia in Guangdong being trained in the \\"double swords\\", short swords with a hook extending from the guard, and fitting into a single scabbard. The blade of a butterfly sword is roughly as long as a human forearm, which allows easy concealment inside loose sleeves or boots, and allows greater maneuverability when spinning and rotating during close-quarters fighting. Butterfly swords are usually wielded in pairs. A pair of swords will often be carried side by side within the same scabbard, so as to give the appearance of a single weapon. The butterfly sword has a small crossguard to protect the hands of the wielder, similar to that of a sai, which can also be used to block or hook an opponent's weapon. In some versions the crossguard is enlarged offering a second handhold, held in this position the swords can be manipulated in a manner akin to a pair of tonfa. They may also be used as brass knuckles when non-lethal application of the weapon is desired. Traditionally, the blade of a butterfly sword is only sharpened along half of its edge ‚Äì from the middle of the blade to the tip; this can be seen in all vintage specimens from the Qing dynasty. The blade from the midpoint down is left blunt so that it can be used to deliver non-lethal strikes and to block without damaging the sharpened edge. Butterflies were generally commissioned for individual martial artists, not mass-produced, so every set of swords is different; however, an average blade today is about \\" long with a 6\\" handle. Other terms Butterfly swords are usually called 'butterfly knives' in English. However, they should not be confused with the folding balisong, which is also commonly called a butterfly knife. The Chinese word dao is used to designate any blade whose primary function is to cut and slash regardless of length. In some branches of Kung Fu, such as Wing Chun, butterfly knives are known as Baat Jaam Do (named after the system's form, literally 'Eight Chopping/Slashing Knives' in Cantonese). Use Butterfly swords are used in several Chinese martial arts, notably Wing Chun, Hung Ga, and Choy Li Fut. In Wing Chun, one notable aspect of butterfly sword combat is that its principles are the basis for all other weaponry. In theory, any object that can be held in the hands of a Wing Chun practitioner will follow the same basic principles of movement as the butterfly swords. This is because the use of butterfly swords is simply an extension of empty-handed combat. The design of the weapon, including the quillon (crossguard) shape, blade profile and blade length, are specific to each style of martial arts, the precise lineage, and individual. For example, some martial arts lineages flip the butterfly swords between the forward and reverse grip like a Sai, and consequently need a quillon that will fit the hand during a reverse grip. Some lineages trap the opponent's staff or blade between the quillon and spine, and they need a longer quillon closer and more parallel to the spine than would fit a hand after flipping. Some schools like a hybrid quillon design that is adequate for both flipping and trapping, but optimal for neither. Some butterfly swords had a long narrow blade that emphasized stabbing. While a deadly stabbing blade with a sharpened point‚Äîknown as \\"Red Boat\\" knives‚Äîwas used by Chinese revolutionaries in the Wing Chun lineage, modern Wing Chun practitioners tend to prefer a blade profile with a wider belly that emphasizes chopping and slashing. Wing Chun lore attributes this to the desire of Monks to maim rather than kill. These knives generally have a quarter circle style tip suitable only for chopping/slashing and not stabbing, or a shallower curve to a more pointed tip that will accommodate both. The appropriate length of the blade is a combination of the lineage and individual. For a Hung Gar stylist, the length should be a few inches past the elbow when the knife is held in a reverse grip. Wing Chun schools that use techniques which twirl the knives inside the arm need a reverse grip blade length based on the distance to the interior of the bicep. Other Wing Chun schools measure to the outside of the bicep.

It was adopted into service due to the need for a grenade with smaller destructive radius than the No. 36M \\"Mills bomb\\". This allowed the thrower to use a grenade even when there was little in the way of defensive cover. In contrast, the much greater destructive radius of the Mills bomb than its throwing range forced users to choose their throwing point carefully, in order to ensure that they would not be wounded by the shrapnel explosion of their own grenade. Externals and internals The shell of the No. 69 grenade was composed entirely of the hard plastic, Bakelite, which shattered without producing fragments like a metal bodied grenade. Metal fragmenting sleeves were available to increase the grenade's lethality. Using the No. 69 bomb was very simple: the screw-off cap was removed and discarded, and the grenade was then thrown. When the grenade was thrown, a linen tape with a curved lead weight on the end automatically unwrapped in flight, freeing a ball-bearing inside the fuze. In this manner the \\"all ways\\" action impact fuze was armed in flight and the grenade exploded on impact; and like the Gammon grenade, which used the same fuze design, it was withdrawn from service soon after the Second World War ended.  All-ways fuze  The No. 69 was the first British device to make use of the \\"all-ways fuze\\" later seen in the No. 82 Gammon bomb, the No. 73 Thermos bomb and the No. 77 smoke grenade. The \\"all-ways\\" fuze is an impact-only fuze. The term \\"all-ways\\" refers to the fact that all of the possible ways in which the grenade could hit a target were guaranteed to trigger detonation. Normally, impact-detonated munitions must hit the target with a particular point of impact (i.e. perpendicular to the fuze mechanism) in order to detonate. In contrast, no matter which way the No. 69 grenade hit the target (e.g. landing on its base, or sideways or upside down) it would still explode. The all-ways fuze was composed of a free-floating striker and detonator combination held apart by a weak spring. On top of this assembly was a steel ball bearing pressed against a conical housing by the striker. Any impact in the vertical axis would impart acceleration to either the striker or the detonator, causing the firing pin to contact and ignite the detonator. Any impact in the horizontal axis would cause the ball bearing to follow the slope of the conical housing converting the horizontal acceleration into a vertical one, touching off the detonator as before. The fuze was worked by the user first unscrewing a plastic cap to expose a long, narrow cloth streamer with a curved lead weight attached to the end. Upon release from the hand or projector the weighted streamer, would catch the air and quickly unwind from the top of the grenade, eventually withdrawing a loose safety pin from the fuze. With the pin removed the striker and detonator would be free to come into contact, which would happen due to the force of impact when the grenade struck a hard surface. The all-ways fuze had a minor design defect in that the hard steel ball bearing would be propelled away from the explosion as a piece of shrapnel. When used in an \\"offensive\\" application such as the No. 69 grenade, where the user was not required to take cover before throwing, there was a chance that the user could be struck and injured by the fast-moving ball bearing.http://www.inert-ord.net/brit/no69/index.html According to military author Ian V. Hogg, this problem led to restrictions in the use of the grenade as practice ordnance.Hogg, Ian (1974). Grenades & Mortars. Ballantine Books, p. 47?.

This work is the third of three of his \\"Razumovsky\\" cycle of string quartets, and is a product of his \\"middle\\" period. It consists of four movements: Discussion The introductory andante con moto section of the first movement is not directly related to the rest of the movement and serves a similar function to the introduction of his Op. 74 quartet. Thereafter, the movement's main thematic material is exposed and developed. The relation (or apparent lack thereof) between the slow, sombre and dissonant introduction and the bright allegro which follows, is similar to what is found in Mozart's \\"Dissonance\\" Quartet, also in the key of C. The quartet's second movement makes use of an augmented second in the descending scale first played by the first violin at the beginning of the movement. This interval, repeated through the movement, gives it an association with the Hungarian scale. Unlike the other two opus 59 quartets, this one does not have an explicit \\"Theme Russe\\" in any of its movements. Nevertheless, it can be argued that this second movement with its sparse texture and comfortless melodies, evokes a Russian feel by bringing to mind the vast, barren and desolate landscape of the Siberian tundra. The quartet's third movement is a lighter menuetto which provides the motif that is subsequently turned upside down for the last movement, a fugal allegro molto that begins with the viola and adds the second violin, cello and first violin in that order. The movement is in alla breve time and is almost a perpetuum mobile in quavers. The fugue is semi-rigorous, somewhere between the fugato of Mozart's string quartet K.387 and the rigorous fugue of his Adagio and Fugue K.546. About halfway into the movement, a contrasting theme is introduced, which moves in minims. The movement concludes with an enormous Mannheim crescendo, peaking at an implicit .

Biography In 1946, Proh√≠as was given the Juan Gualberto G√≥mez award, recognizing him as the foremost cartoonist in Cuba. By the late 1940s, Proh√≠as had begun working at El Mundo, the most important newspaper in Cuba at the time. In January 1959, Proh√≠as was the president of the Cuban Cartoonists Association; after Fidel Castro seized power, he personally honored the cartoonist for his anti-Batista political cartoons. But Proh√≠as soon soured on Castro's actions of muzzling the press. When he drew cartoons to this effect, he was accused of working for the CIA by Fidel Castro's government. Consequently, he resigned from the newspaper in February 1959. With his professional career in limbo, Proh√≠as left Cuba for New York on May 1, 1960, working in a garment factory by day and building a cartoon portfolio for Mad by night. Ten weeks later, he walked into Mad's offices unannounced. He spoke no English, but his daughter Marta acted as an interpreter for him. Before he'd left, he had an $800 check and had sold his first three Spy vs. Spy cartoons to Mad. In late 1986, he sold his 241st and last Spy strip before retiring due to illness. Proh√≠as also wrote and drew six paperback collections featuring the Spies. During an interview with the Miami Herald in 1983, Proh√≠as gloated, \\"The sweetest revenge has been to turn Fidel's accusation of me as a spy into a moneymaking venture.\\"\\"Spy vs. Spy: The Complete Casebook\\", Proh√≠as, A. Watson-Guptill, 2001 Two years after Proh√≠as' debut in the magazine, cartoonist Sergio Aragon√©s made the trek from Mexico to New York in search of work. Because Aragon√©s' command of English was then shaky, he asked that Proh√≠as be present to serve as an interpreter. According to Aragon√©s, this proved to be a mistake, since Proh√≠as knew even less English than he did. When Proh√≠as introduced the young artist to the Mad editors as \\"Sergio, my brother from Mexico,\\" the Mad editors thought they were meeting \\"Sergio Proh√≠as.\\" Twelve years later, Mad writer Frank Jacobs reported that Proh√≠as' conversational English was limited to \\"Hello\\" and \\"How are you, brother?\\" Said Aragon√©s, who speaks six languages, \\"Even I could not understand him that well.\\" The Mad staff occasionally took group vacations, traveling en masse to other countries. Proh√≠as took part in these vacations when possible, but as a Cuban exile, he had trouble gaining admission into some countries. At the airport before a Mad vacation to Italy, an airport official said, \\"You can leave if you want, but you can never come back.\\" He later presented a drawing to MAD publisher William M. Gaines which showed himself being blocked by angry airport officials, letting his heart fly over their heads to the rest of the MAD gang. A note at the bottom translates to: \\"Mr. Gaines, my heart will always travel with you.\\" Although he is most famous for Spy vs. Spy, the majority of his comic strips, such as El Hombre Siniestro, La Mujer Siniestra, and Tovarich, were published mostly or only in Cuba. Altogether, only about 20 of his roughly 270 contributions to Mad were of subjects and gags other than his spy series. One of those was the iconic cover image for issue #154 in 1972, depicting Alfred E. Neuman eating an ear of corn while leaving a single row of kernels unscathed due to the gap in his upper teeth. Most of the available information on Proh√≠as' other work can be seen in the Spy Vs Spy Complete Casebook (Watson-Guptill, 2001) and the Spy vs. Spy Omnibus (DC Comics, 2011). He died of lung cancer at age of 77 and is buried in Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum (now Caballero Rivero Woodlawn North Park Cemetery and Mausoleum) in Miami, Florida. Characters other than Spy vs. Spy * El Hombre Siniestro: (The Sinister Man) wore a wide-brimmed hat and overcoat and had a long pointed nose, becoming the prototype for the Spies. His description from the Spy Vs Spy Complete Casebook says it best: \\"A dark and dastardly character, El Hombre Siniestro thought nothing of chopping the tails off of dogs, or even the legs off of little girls. . . [he] was born out of the national psychosis of the Cuban people.\\" At the time right after Castro rose to power, there was a pronounced feeling of fatality and sinisterness in Cuba, and Proh√≠as depicted this through his twisted El Hombre Siniestro strip. He and La Mujer Siniestra can be easily compared to the Spies‚Äîalthough, instead of fighting against a set rival, they simply do horrible things to anyone they can find. El Hombre Siniestro debuted in Bohemia in 1956, although in later years Proh√≠as created new strips for Zig- Zag Libre after he moved to Miami. * La Mujer Siniestra: (The Sinister Woman) Like her counterpart, La Mujer Siniestra is about the titular character causing misery for everyone else. However, unlike El Hombre Siniestro's mostly unrelated crimes, many of her strips involve either her attempt to find love (like, for example, cuckolding someone else's lover) or to ruin other women. * Tovarich: Tovarishch is Russian for \\"comrade,\\" and so Tovarich was meant to be both a representation of the Communist Soviet government and of Fidel Castro. He is a corrupt Soviet dictator meant to parody Fidel. However, since Castro had not yet announced he was a Communist, nobody could complain about the comic. Since the setting was Russia and not Cuba, it could not be explicitly found as criticism. When his Communist colleagues complained, he would reply, \\"What? What's wrong with it? It's not about Cuba, it's about Russia.\\" Tovarich's appearance changed through the years; originally he wore a military cap with a star and had longer hair, but in the \\"funeral for Agapito\\" picture in the Complete Casebook, he wears a typical Russian ushanka (round rabbit fur hat) with a hammer and sickle on it. Tovarich first appeared in Prensa Libre in 1959, with a sampling of strips shown in the \\"Nyets to You Department\\" in MAD #68 of January 1962. Like the Sinister Man and Woman, he was usually up to nasty tricks and getting away with them: in one strip, drawn at the height of the Cold War, he offers the hand of friendship to Uncle Sam; Uncle Sam is delighted and takes it, unaware that he is shaking the hand of a dummy while the real Tovarich is literally about to stab him in the back. Another such cartoon showed the materialism of the Politburo while denouncing the materialism of everyone else and preventing native people from acquiring wealth: A man is envisioning himself driving a luxury car, to which Tovarich dunks his head in ice water, from which the man emerges comatose and now only thinking of the hammer and sickle, supposedly now an obedient Communist who knows better than to think of acquiring wealth for himself. The man is then ordered to be a driver, where he is then shown chauffeuring Tovarich in a luxury car, who is smugly smoking a cigar. * The Diplomat: An extremely minor character, but noteworthy for the fact that he had his own small feature of comic strips in MAD's Big Book of Spy vs Spy Capers and Other Surprises (Warner Books, 1982) and appeared in the MADtv \\"Spy vs. Spy\\" short, \\"Defection\\". He also appeared in the Fall 1970 Special, in a group of strips that might be said to bear a slight resemblance to Otto Soglow's more benign The Little King. He wears a waistcoat, black jacket with coattails, a medal and a top hat, and also sports a long, pointed nose somewhat similar to that of the Spies. * Erizo: A character who appears in the \\"funeral\\" picture in the Complete Casebook, although nothing about him or his comic is explained. He debuted in the magazine Carteles in 1948. Some comic pages can be found online. http://havanajournal.com/gallery/image_full/226/ * Oveja Negra: Also known as Black Sheep. A young boy wearing a propeller beanie, T-shirt and shorts. He appears in some of the artwork for the Complete Casebook, including the \\"funeral\\" picture. (It's worth noting that, in the aforementioned funeral picture, Oveja Negra is the only one who appears to be mourning.) He debuted in Informacion in 1949. * Anti-Communist and Anti-Castro cartoons: Featured in The Complete Spy vs. Spy Casebook, shows arguably Proh√≠as' most serious cartoons, such as depicting Castro as a mermaid singing a siren song to lure sailors to their deaths, or a skeleton having difficulty eating meals with the caption \\"Gentlemen, it is very difficult to eat with a hammer and sickle!\\" Other items published in Mad * \\"One-Shot Dept.: Vengeance\\" (#66, October 1961, p. 13) :A caveman kills another caveman with an arrow to the head.

He had studied at Oxford and later popularized Newtonian theories and their practical applications in public lectures. Desaguliers's most important patron was James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos. As a Freemason, Desaguliers was instrumental in the success of the first Grand Lodge in London in the early 1720s and served as its third Grand Master. Biography=Early life and education Desaguliers was born in La Rochelle, several months after his father Jean Desaguliers, a Protestant minister, had been exiled as a Huguenot by the French government. Jean Desaguliers was ordained as an Anglican by Bishop Henry Compton of London,Ordination Records MS. 9535/3 folio 33. Guildhall Library, London and sent to Guernsey. Meanwhile, the baby was baptised Jean Th√©ophile Desaguliers in the Protestant Temple in La Rochelle,Registers of l‚ÄôEglise reform√©e de La Rochelle. Archives municipals de La Rochelle, France and he and his mother then escaped to join Jean in Guernsey. In 1692 the family moved to London where Jean Desaguliers later set up a French school in Islington. He died in 1699. His son, who now used the anglicised name John Theophilus, attended Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton ColdfieldDesaguliers wrote in an autobiographical account that he was educated under \\"Wm Saunders A. M. at his school of Sutton Cofield\\". Saunders was master at Bishop Vesey‚Äôs Grammar School. See Bodleian Library, Oxford: Rawlinson MS J f3 fols 29‚Äì34. until 1705 when he entered Christ Church, Oxford and followed the usual classical curriculum and graduated BA in 1709. He also attended lectures by John Keill, who used innovative demonstrations to illustrate difficult concepts of Newtonian natural philosophy. When Keill left Oxford in 1709 Desaguliers continued giving the lectures at Hart Hall, the forerunner of Hertford College, Oxford. He obtained a master's degree there in 1712. In 1719 Oxford granted him the honorary degree of Doctor in Civil Laws, after which he was often referred to as Dr Desaguliers. His doctorate was incorporated by Cambridge University in 1726. Desaguliers was ordained as a deacon in 1710, at Fulham Palace, and as a priest in 1717, at Ely Palace in London. Lecturer and promoter of Newtonian experimental philosophy In 1712 Desaguliers moved back to London and advertised courses of public lectures in Experimental Philosophy. He was not the first to do this, but became the most successful, offering to speak in English, French or Latin. By the time of his death he had given over 140 courses of some 20 lectures each on mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, optics and astronomy. He kept his lectures up to date, published notes for his auditors, and designed his own apparatus, including a renowned planetarium to demonstrate the solar system, and a machine to explain tidal motion. In 1717 Desaguliers lodged at Hampton Court and lectured in French to King George I and his family. Demonstrator at the Royal Society In 1714 Isaac Newton, President of the Royal Society, invited Desaguliers to replace Francis Hauksbee (1660 ‚Äì 1713) as demonstrator at the Society's weekly meetings; he was soon thereafter made a Fellow of the Royal Society.Fellows of the Royal Society: Sackler Archive Desaguliers promoted Newton's ideas and maintained the scientific nature of the meetings when Hans Sloane took over the Presidency after Newton died in 1727. Desaguliers contributed over 60 articles to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. He received the Society's prestigious Copley Medal in 1734, 1736 and 1741. The last award was for his summary of knowledge to date on the phenomenon of electricity. He had worked on this with Stephen Gray, who at one time lodged at the Desaguliers' home. Desaguliers's \\"Dissertation concerning Electricity\\" (1742), in which he coined the terms conductor and insulator, was awarded a gold medal by the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences. Patronage of the Duke of Chandos James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos appointed Desaguliers as his chaplain in 1716,D W, 'A Document Rescued from Oblivion. Accurate Autobiographical Details of the Career of Bro. the Rev. J. T. Desaguliers, Grand Master of England, 1719; Deputy Grand Master, 1722-23 and 1725', The Freemason, 1925, 472-4; Bodleian Library, Rawlinson MS J f3 (fols 29‚Äì34), dated 8 July 1736. but probably as much for his scientific expertise as his ecclesiastic duties. He was also gifted the living of St Lawrence Church, Little Stanmore, which was close to the Duke's mansion called Cannons, then under construction at nearby Edgware. The church was rebuilt in the baroque style in 1715. As the chapel at Cannons was not completed until 1720, the church was the location of first performances of the so-called Chandos Anthems by George Frideric Handel who was, in 1717/18, like Desaguliers, a member of the Duke's household. The Cannons estate benefited from Desaguliers' scientific expertise which was applied to the elaborate water garden there. He was also technical adviser to an enterprise in which Chandos had invested, the York Buildings Company, which used steam-power to extract water from the Thames. In 1718 Desaguliers dedicated to the Duke his translation of Edme Mariotte's treatise on the motion of water. It is perhaps no coincidence that in the summer of 1718 Handel composed his opera Acis and Galatea for performance at Cannons. In this work the hero Acis is turned into a fountain, and since, by tradition, the work was first performed outside on the terraces overlooking the garden, a connection with Desaguliers' new water works seems probable. Desaguliers advised the Duke of Chandos on many projects and appears to have been distracted from his parochial duties by his other interests. The Duke once complained that there were unreasonable delays in burying the dead but this was attributed to the curate who was left in charge of the church. Engineering interests Desaguliers applied his knowledge to practical applications. As well as his interest in steam engines and hydraulic engineering (in 1721 he cured a problem in the Edinburgh city water supplyWinant, E. H. and Kemp, E. L. Edinburgh‚Äôs First Water Supply: The Comiston Aquesduct, 1675‚Äì1721, Civil Engineering, 120 (1997) , pp 119‚Äì124) he developed expertise in ventilation. He devised a more efficient fireplace which was used in the House of LordsHouse of Lords Journal, 5 Geo I (1718), 38 and 43 and also invented the blowing wheel which removed stale air from the House of Commons for many years. Desaguliers studied the movements made by the human body when working as a machine. He befriended the strong man, Thomas Topham, and although there is no firm evidence that he used Topham as a body guard, Desaguliers recorded several of the feats that he performed. Desaguliers was a parliamentary adviser to the board concerned with the first Westminster Bridge. This much-needed second crossing of the Thames was not completed until 1750, after his death, but construction work resulted in the demolition of Desaguliers's home in Channel Row. Freemasonry Desaguliers was a member of the Lodge which met at the Goose and Gridiron tavern,. This Lodge, later known as the \\"Lodge of Antiquity\\", joined with three others lodges on 24 June 1717 to form what would become the Premier Grand Lodge of England. The new Grand Lodge grew rapidly as more lodges joined and Desaguliers is remembered as being instrumental in its early success. He became the third Grand Master in 1719 and was later three times Deputy Grand Master. He helped James Anderson draw up the rules in the \\"Constitutions of the Freemasons\\", published in 1723, and he was active in the establishment of masonic charity. During a lecture trip to the Netherlands in 1731 Desaguliers initiated into Freemasonry Francis, Duke of Lorraine (1708 ‚Äì 65) who later became Holy Roman Emperor. Desaguliers also presided when Frederick, Prince of Wales, became a Freemason in 1731, and he additionally became a chaplain to the Prince. Family On 14 October 1712 John Theophilus Desaguliers married Joanna Pudsey, daughter of William and Anne Pudsey of Kidlington, near Oxford. For most of their married life the couple lived at Channel Row, Westminster where Desaguliers gave the majority of his lectures. When forced to leave due to work on Westminster Bridge they separated and John Theophilus took lodgings at the Bedford Coffee House in Covent Garden and carried on his lectures there. The Desaguliers had four sons and three daughters, for most of whom they acquired aristocratic godparents, but only two children survived beyond infancy: John Theophilus jnr (1718‚Äì1751) graduated from Oxford, became a clergyman, and died childless, while Thomas (1721‚Äì1780) had a distinguished military career in the Royal Artillery, rising to the rank of General. He became chief firemaster at the Arsenal, Woolwich, and seems to have been the first to be employed by the English army to apply scientific principles to the production of cannon and the powers of gunnery, for which he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. It was Thomas Desaguliers who in part designed and supervised the fireworks for the first performance of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks in Green Park.Board of Ordnance, A Description of the Machine for the Fireworks, with all its Ornaments, and a Detail of the Manner in which they are to be Exhibited in St James's Park, Thursday 27 April 1749 (London: W. Bowyer, 1749) He later became an equerry to King George III. Final years John Theophilus Desaguliers had long suffered from gout. He died at his lodgings in the Bedford Coffee House on 29 February 1744 and was buried on 6 March 1744 in a prestigious location within the Savoy Chapel in London. The chapel was probably chosen for its Huguenot associations and in memory of Desaguliers's origins. The press announcements of his death referred to him as 'a gentleman universally known and esteemed'. In his will Desaguliers left his estate to his elder son who organised the publication of the second edition of his \\"Course of Experimental Philosophy\\". Although never a wealthy man, he did not die in poverty as suggested by the oft-quoted but inaccurate lines of the poet James Cawthorn: How poor neglected Desaguiliers fell! How he who taught two gracious kings to view All Boyle ennobled, and all Bacon knew, Died in a cell, without a friend to save, Without a guinea, and without a grave. These are taken from a long poem entitled \\"The Vanity of Human Enjoyment\\" (1749) in which the poet attempted to draw attention to the general lack of funding for men of science and not Desaguliers in particular. Portraits There are two known engravings, by Peter Pelham and by James Tookey, taken from a lost portrait of Desaguliers painted in about 1725 by Hans Hysing, and an engraving by R. Scaddon of a Thomas Frye painting, also apparently lost, which showed the subject as an old man in 1743. An engraving by Etienne-Jehandier Desrochers was almost certainly made in 1735 when Desaguliers was on his only visit to Paris. There is also an oil attributed to Jonathan Richardson.Art UK Publications Desaguliers wrote on many topics for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, produced several editions of notes for the auditors of his lectures and wrote occasional poetry. He translated technical works from French and Latin into English, often adding his own comments.

According to the Random House books, the character's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. *George Roberts (1960‚Äìpresent) He has a wife named Margaret and children: Barbara, Skipper, Stacie, Todd, Tutti, Chelsea, Kelly, and Kristine. Originally just a book character, he has not been issued in doll form but has appeared for the first time in animation as Barbie's father in the digital series Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. He was originally described as an engineer, but his job was changed to documentary filmmaker in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. *Margaret Rawlins Roberts (1960‚Äìpresent) Margaret is the wife of George Roberts and the mother of Barbie and her various siblings. Also originally a book character, she has not been issued in doll form, however, she made her first on-screen appearance in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. She was initially a homemaker, but in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, she is a computer engineer and the designer of the Roberts family dreamhouse. She has a sister named Millicent. * Kenneth Sean \\"Ken\\" Carson (1961‚Äì1967, 1969‚Äìpresent) The second character added to the line, Ken has been Barbie's boyfriend for much of the character's existence. After a short break, they got back together. According to the 1960s Random House books, Ken's full name is Kenneth Sean Carson. In Barbie Fashion Comic #34 (1993), Ken's mother is named Edna. In Barbie Fashion Comic #51 (1995), Edna's father is named Kenneth, hinting at the fact he was most likely named after him. In Brazil in the 1980s, the Estrela company named the doll Bob instead of Ken (from the book, Barbie Doll Around the World). In Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, he is one of Barbie's best friends and next-door neighbor. * Skipper Roberts (1964‚Äì2003, 2009‚Äìpresent) The first character added to Barbie's family, Skipper is Barbie's younger sister, originally seeming the age of ten when she debuted from now ranging at different teenage ages through the years. She was first introduced with blue eyes and a variety of hair colors like blonde, brown, and titian. Starting in 1996 Skipper was re-branded as Barbie's 'teen' sister, with her looking much older than before and raising her height to almost the same as Barbie's. After not being made since 2003, Skipper came back in 2009 as part of Barbie's 2009 camping line. She returned to her height before she was 'teen' Skipper but this time with a purple streak in her hair. In 2010 Barbie's sisters got revamped once again, this time Skipper was given brown hair and colored streaks in her hair (sometimes purple, blue, or pink), and she was given a new head mold and body. She was one of the main characters in the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse series and now stars along with Barbie in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. * Tutti and Todd (Tutti: 1965‚Äì1971, Todd: 1965-1996) Twins, both Tutti and Todd were younger siblings of Barbie and Skipper, and had seamless 'bendy' bodies. Tutti's packaging did not mention Todd, but many sets were made for both. The two were only sold together in one set. They debuted in 1966 and were available in the US until 1971; remaining on the European market until 1980. The Tutti doll was also available in Mexico from 1968 to 1970 through Lili Ledy in agreements with Mattel. They appeared to be small school children and had bendable bodies. On Todd's box it said, \\"twin of stacie\\" though on Stacie's box she didn't give a reference to Todd. Tutti had a friend named Chris. Additionally, a \\"Buffy\\" version (with miniature Mrs. Beasley doll), after the '60s/'70s television sitcom Family Affair, was marketed due to the show's popularity. Todd was reintroduced in 1991 as part of the wedding party for Barbie's best friend Midge Hadley. The new Todd had a new head mold with a copyright date of 1990. This new Todd was dressed in a tuxedo and packaged in a large giftset of six dolls that included Midge as the bride, Alan as the groom, Barbie as the maid of honor, Ken as the best man, Todd as the ring bearer, and a doll named Kelly as the flower girl. Todd and Kelly as ring bearer and flower girl were also packaged together as a pair. This Kelly doll, not to be confused with today's toddler Kelly from the Barbie line, was the same size/age as Todd. Indeed, she was made with exactly the same body and head molds. The next year, the Todd-sized Kelly doll was replaced by Stacie Roberts, who had a brand new head mold with a cheerful smile. Tutti was not reintroduced; Stacie is believed to be a modern incarnation of Tutti. Mattel produced several more of the new Todd dolls over the next few years, some in both white and African-American versions. But Todd was dropped from the Barbie line and was not brought back with Stacie when she reappeared in the Wee 3 Friends series. The latest version of Todd is the 2008 Todd and Stacie Mary Poppins boxed set, with a comment on the back that \\"Todd and Stacie are dressed as Michael and Jane from Disney's Mary Poppins\\". * Stacie Roberts (1990‚Äìpresent) Introduced as Kelly in the 1990 Wedding Day Midge gift set as the flower girl, this doll is often confused with Tutti, though the Tutti character had been discontinued for years at this time. Kelly was renamed and introduced as Stacie shortly thereafter in 1992, and the Kelly name was used for a younger character. Todd then became the twin brother of Stacie until he was discontinued in 1996. * Francie Fairchild (1966‚Äì1977) Marketed as \\"Barbie's Modern Cousin,\\" Francie paved the way for Barbie's transition into the MOD era. Francie appeared to be only slightly younger than Barbie, and had a straight, streamlined figure. The Francie doll was the first to feature rooted eyelashes. In the March 1966 issue of Barbie Magazine, she is the daughter of Claude and Lily Fairchild. * Jazzie (1988‚Äì1992) Another cousin of Barbie and part of a small group of high school age dolls. She was taller than Barbie's other cousin Francie, with Jazzie being almost the same height as Barbie. * Kelly/Shelly Roberts (1995‚Äì2010) This character is of toddler age, and is a sister to Barbie. Originally the baby of the family, Kelly seemed to be older in the 2000s with Krissy now being the 'baby' sister. Kelly starred in most of Barbie's computer animated films, up until Barbie in a Christmas Carol as her last film appearance. In Europe, she is known as Shelly. Kelly dolls ceased production in late 2010 and were replaced by Chelsea. Excluding a brief period when the design of the Kelly doll was changed to have an oval-shaped head, larger eyes, and longer limbs, Kelly dolls have stayed true to their original design. A doll named Kelly was introduced in 1992 as part of the Midge and Allan Wedding Day Set, this Kelly doll is 7 1/2 inches tall, exactly the same size as the ring bearer, Todd, who is wearing a Tuxedo. She wore a peach dotted Swiss dress and carries a white basket of flowers as she is the flower girl. This \\"Kelly\\" was later renamed and ‚Äúturned into‚Äù the Stacie doll. The Todd doll which is made from the same mold has fuzzy brown hair. \\"Kelly\\" is mentioned in the web series, Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse when Raquelle refers to Chelsea as Kelly instead, referencing the confusion involving whether Kelly or Chelsea is Barbie's younger sister. * Chelsea Roberts, (2010‚ÄìPresent) Barbie's younger sister. She replaced Kelly after 2010. She appears to be approximately 5‚Äì6 years old and is slightly taller than Kelly. The doll was first produced in 2011 as part of the \\"My Fab Sisters\\" line. She is the youngest sister of Barbie currently sold (Mattel discontinued Kelly shortly before Chelsea was produced). She has blonde hair and blue eyes (very similar to Kelly). Mattel has also made African American versions of Chelsea. She was a main character in the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse series and now appears in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures and her own series Barbie: Dreamtopia. * Kristine \\"Krissy\\" Roberts (1998‚Äì2001) This character is an infant, and was Barbie's youngest sibling to date. * Blaine Gordon (2004) Barbie's Australian ex-boyfriend, whom she dated during her much-publicized \\"breakup\\" with the Ken character. Blaine is said to be the brother of Summer, one of Barbie's friends. Blaine does not show in any of the Barbie series but was originally a character from Generation Girls and showed interest in Ana. * Millicent Rawlins is Barbie's aunt and Margaret's sister. Her first appearance was in Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale. * Lillian Roberts Fairchild is Francie's mother, Barbie's aunt, George's sister and Margaret's sister-in-law. * Claude Fairchild is Francie's father, Barbie's uncle and Margaret and George's brother-in-law. * Marlene Roberts is Barbie's aunt, George's sister and Margaret's sister-in-law. * Grandmother Rawlins is Barbie's grandmother and Margaret Roberts' mother. She passed her love of reading onto Barbie. She is encouraging and supportive of her granddaughter. She gave Barbie a book to read that Barbie related to. Her first appearance is in Barbie and the Secret Door as Alexa's grandmother. Note: Alexa is Barbie's Role in Barbie and the Secret Door. She also appears in The Great Puppy Adventure as herself. * Max and Marie Roberts are the twin children of Marlene Roberts, cousins of Barbie and her siblings, and niece and nephew of Margaret Roberts and George Roberts. They showed up in Barbie and Her Sisters in A Pony Tale. * Kristen Rawlins is a cousin of Barbie, appearing in the picture book, The Wedding Party. * Adele (2019‚ÄìPresent) Barbie's aunt and the owner of the Windy Willows Inn in Barbie's hometown, Willows, Wisconsin. She first appeared in season 3, episode 3 of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, The Ballad of Windy Willows. Her most recent appearance was in season 5, episode 7 of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, The Curse of the Miner's Ghost. Her design is very similar to Margaret's, suggesting that she is Margaret's sister.  Female Barbie-sized friends  * Midge Hadley Sherwood (1963‚Äì1966, 1988‚Äì2004, 2013‚Äì2015) This character was Barbie's best friend according to promotional materials and packaging. She was the third character introduced to the Barbie line, following Barbie and Ken. In the Random House novels, her last name is Hadley. She was paired with Allan Sherwood, Ken's best friend, when Allan was introduced in 1964. After she married Allan/Alan in 1991, she became Midge Hadley Sherwood. In the 1990s Price Stern Sloan series Adventures with Barbie, she and Alan are married, and in book 5, The Phantom of Shrinking Pond, by Suzanne Weyn, copyright 1992, it's implied that she is named after her Aunt Margaret (not the same person as Margaret Roberts). She is named Viky in Brazil (from the book Barbie Doll Around the World, by J. Michael Augustyniak, copyright 2008 Collector Books). In 2001 she was given her own line named Happy Family. Midge was released with a magnetic belly and a baby. Also in the line was Alan and their son Ryan, and Midge's parents though they were never given real names. In 2013, she was brought back in the \\"Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse\\" web series. In the series, she undergoes a makeover to look more modern, though the character tends to act like she is still in the 1960s. There is no mention of Allan/Alan in the series. Since 2015 Midge has not appeared in doll form or in any of Barbie's movie/shows. * Christie (1968‚Äì2005, 2015) Barbie doll's first African-American friend character, Christie was part of the new group of Talking dolls for 1968. Christie was later issued as a Twist 'N Turn version. The character appeared in the product line continuously for many years, though the original Christie face sculpt was discontinued in 1978. Christie is notable in that she has been romantically linked with several male characters over the years. In 1970, she was linked with Brad, the Talking Brad doll even said \\"Christie is the greatest\\". In 1982, the Sunsational Malibu Christie doll had a boyfriend named Ken who used the Brad face sculpt with rooted hair. In the late 80s, Christie was paired with Steven. The surname O'Neil is associated with the Nikki character, who is purported to be Christie's sister, but the surname has not been associated directly with Christie. The doll has been criticized as following American beauty standards instead of representing African cultural body image, representing only one tone of skin color, and because her sculpted features were seen to symbolize white standards of beauty. Christie was discontinued when Barbie got Nikki as her new African-American friend, though Nikki uses Christie's face for a little, the change in name of almost the same doll was never stated. In the 2015 Barbie movie Barbie and her Sister in a Puppy Rescue, Christie is the name of one of Barbie's old friends from Willows, Wisconsin. On the back of the 1999 Beyond Pink Christie box, her birthday is listed as August 9. * Teresa (1988‚Äìpresent) Originally used the 1983 Spanish Barbie face sculpt for the Island Fun Teresa doll and the Beach Blast Teresa doll. Starting with the Wet 'N Wild Teresa doll, the character began using the 1972 Steffie face sculpt. Beginning with the Rollerblade Teresa doll, the character began using an all-new face sculpt that has become known as the Teresa face sculpt. In the Grolier book High Sea Adventure from 1999, her last name is Rivera. Teresa is of Hispanic heritage. She is named Debora in Brazil (from the book Barbie Doll Around the World, by J. Michael Augustyniak, copyright 2008 Collector Books). She was featured in the 2008 film as Barbie's best friend, where she told a story about her and Barbie (as Liana and Alexa) as two girls closer than most friends living in the forest. She appeared in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and now stars in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures as one of Barbie's best friends. She also starred in the 2016 movie, Barbie: Spy Squad alongside Barbie and Renee. On the back of the 1999 Beyond Pink Teresa box, her birthday is listed as Oct. 2. * Summer Gordon (2004‚Äì2015) This doll used an all-new face sculpt. Summer is Blaine's little sister with strawberry blonde hair and had green/brown eyes. She was a frequent character in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. She was originally from Australia when she was first introduced in 2004. * Nicole \\"Nikki\\" O'Neil/Watkins (2006‚Äìpresent) This doll appears as one of Barbie's current friends, and is closer to her, Barbie is often seen hanging out with just Teresa and Nikki. She has used multiple different head sculpts through the years. Her last name is O'Neil in the 2010 Random House book, \\"Barbie: I Can be a Movie Star,\\" but her last name was established as Watkins in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. Nikki is Christie's little sister. She was introduced in 1997 as part of the \\"Teen Skipper\\" line. She was a frequent character in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and now stars in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures as one of Barbie's best friends. * Raquelle (2007‚Äì2015) This doll used the Summer face sculpt with her original debut. In 2011, she appeared with an all-new face sculpt in the Barbie Fashionistas line. She is Barbie's frenemy as shown in Barbie: A Fairy Secret and the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, and has a twin brother named Ryan. * Grace (2009‚Äì2015) This doll made its first appearance in the 2009 SIS Line, she used to be a friend of Barbie who moves to Chicago and makes new Friends. She also appears in Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale. In 2014 she moved back to Malibu. Her backstory was rebooted when she started appearing in Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. She is very smart and interested in science. Barbie's friends Left: Walk Lively Steffie, from 1972. Right: Free Moving PJ, from 1974. The Steffie face sculpt was used for decades, for several different Barbie-related Mattel dolls. Her eye colour, hairstyle and hair colour changed as well. * Stacey (1968‚Äì1971) Introduced as \\"Barbie's British chum\\" during the musical British Invasion of the US, Stacey first appeared with long hair, either blonde, brunette, or redhead, tied in a side ponytail. A second edition had much shorter hair, styled in a curly flip. It is the Stacey face sculpt that is used for Malibu Barbie. * PJ (1969‚Äì1983) Fully representing the \\"groovy\\", \\"hippie\\" era of the late 1960s, PJ originally appeared using Midge's face sculpt, but with much longer hair, tied into beaded pigtails. In 1972, with PJ's addition to the Malibu Barbie line (consisting at that time of Barbie, Ken, Skipper, and Francie), she changed to the Steffie face sculpt, which continued until the end of her production. She was billed as Barbie's best friend, again replacing Midge. One of the final iterations of the doll, \\"Dream Date PJ\\", erroneously lists her as Barbie's cousin. It is the only such reference, and should not be considered canon. * Steffie (1972) Although only three versions of Steffie were produced, all of which appeared in 1972, her face sculpt was used for several Barbie-family dolls for decades after, primarily the PJ doll. Some Barbies of that era, issued outside the US, use the Steffie face sculpt. In at least one Mattel advertisement from 1972, Busy Steffie is pictured, but is referred to as \\"Busy PJ\\", indicating that, even though Barbie fans refer to her as having the Steffie face sculpt, it is actually Steffie that has the PJ face sculpt. However, because PJ had used the Midge face sculpt for three years prior, Steffie was the first Mattel doll to use it as her only face sculpt, hence the name \\"Steffie face\\". * Whitney (1986-1991) Described on her debut as ‚ÄúBarbie doll‚Äôs glamorous best friend‚Äù in the Jewel Secrets Barbie line of 1986 ( Princess Laura in Europe ). This doll uses the Steffie face mold and always featured brunette hair. Returned in 1987 as Nurse Whitney in the Doctor Barbie line, and Perfume Pretty Whitney the same year. Made a return for 1988 in the Style Magic Barbie line. She made her last appearance as European exclusive Ultra Hair Whitney. * Kira/Miko (Marina in Europe) (1985‚Äì2001) Barbie doll's first Asian friend character, The first appearance was in the line of Tropical Barbie in 1985 as Miko. Kira was later introduced looking similar to Miko and with the same head sculpt. Several other dolls have come out with appearance to Kira and Miko with several names, as Dana in Barbie and the rockers, as Becky in the Barbie and the sensations, as Nikki in the line of Animal Lovin'. The character appeared in the product line continuously for many years, the original Kira/Oriental face sculpt was created in 1980. * Becky (1997-1999) A friend of Barbie who uses a wheelchair. She used the Teen Skipper head mold but there were only three dolls ever made. * Kayla/Lea * Harper (2016-2017) A friend of Barbie who has only appeared in vlogs on Barbie's YouTube channel. She is plus-sized and has blue hair, and Barbie describes her as 'easygoing.'

Trey dislikes the Roberts family and often participates in his mother's plans to get rid of them. As the series progresses, Trey grows as a person. He begins to stand up to his parents and becomes more open to helping others. His best friends are Ned and Ted. * Tammy Bounceaway (2018‚ÄìPresent) Barbie's frenemy in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures.

SFU 1.0 and 2.0 used the MKS Toolkit; starting with SFU 3.0, SFU included the Interix subsystem, which was acquired by Microsoft in 1999 from US-based Softway Systems as part of an asset acquisition. SFU 3.5 was the last release and was available as a free download from Microsoft. Windows Server 2003 R2 included most of the former SFU components (on Disk 2), naming the Interix subsystem component Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA). In Windows Server 2008 and high-end versions of both Windows Vista and Windows 7 (Enterprise and Ultimate), a minimal Interix SUA was included, but most of the other SFU utilities had to be downloaded separately from Microsoft's web site. The Interix subsystem included in SFU 3.0 and 3.5 and later released as SUA Windows components provided header files and libraries that made it easier to recompile or port Unix applications for use on Windows; they did not make Linux or other Unix binaries (BSD, Solaris, xenix etc ) compatible with Windows binaries. Like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that Interix replaced, it is best thought of as a distinct Unix-like platform. It is replaced by Windows Subsystem for Linux in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. Components Korn shell running on SUA C shell running on SUA As of SFU 3.5, it contained: * Over 350 Unix utilities such as vi, ksh, csh, ls, cat, awk, grep, kill, etc. * GCC 3.3 compiler, includes and libraries (through an MS libc) * A cc-like wrapper for Microsoft Visual Studio command- line C/C++ compiler * GDB debugger * Perl * NFS server and client * A pcnfsd daemon * X11 tools and libraries * Tools for making NFS mount-points appear as Windows shares, and vice versa (gateway services) * A NIS server capability linked with Active Directory (AD) * Some Windows/Unix authentication information-synchronization tools SFU did not contain the following: * bash, OpenSSH, sudo, CVS, ClamAV, bzip2, gmake, curl, emacs, Apache, XView, Ruby, Tcl, Python Although SFU includes X Window System client libraries and applications, it does not contain a native X server. Administrators may configure any of the numerous third-party Windows X servers. Fully featured free options include Cygwin/X, Xming and WeirdX. Releases=1.0 Microsoft produced at least one beta release of the initial version of SFU before its final release in February 1999. This release, in English only, was supported on the Windows NT 4.0 SP3+ for x86 and Alpha platforms. This is the only known release to support Alpha. It included a demonstration version of the MKS Toolkit along with the following components: * Telnet server * Telnet client * UNIX Utilities (from MKS) * Client for NFS * Server for NFS * Server for NFS Authentication * Windows NT to UNIX password-synchronization * Help files and documentation 2.0 This second installment of SFU was released April 2000 and was also for English; however, a Japanese-language release appeared just two months later in June 2000. Both ran on Windows NT 4.0 SP4+ and Windows 2000 on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 4.01+. SFU 2.0 supported the following UNIX versions: Solaris 2.6+, HP-UX 10.2+, AIX 4.2+, Tru64 UNIX 5.0+, and Red Hat Linux 5.1+. It included the following components: * Server for NFS (NFSServer) * Client for NFS (NFSClient) * Gateway for NFS (NFSGateway) * Server for PCNFS (Pcnfsd) * User Name Mapping (Mapsvc) * Server for NFS Authentication (NFSServerAuth) * Server for NIS (NIS) * Telnet Client (TelnetClient) * Telnet server (TelnetServer) * Password synchronization (PasswdSync) * ActiveState ActivePerl (Perl) * UNIX utilities (UnixUtilities) * Cron service (CronSvc) * Rsh service (RshSvc) There were subsequent updated OEM releases SFU 2.1, SFU 2.2, and SFU 2.3. 3.0 This version, released in May 2002, was the first release to include the Interix subsystem. Previously Microsoft had released Interix 2.2 (actually version 2.2.5) as a separate product around the same time frame as SFU 2.0. This SFU release included Interix release 3.0 (commonly called the \\"version\\" as reported by uname -r) with an internal Microsoft version of 7.0 that relates to internal build sequences. This Interix release contained significant technical extensions from the Interix 2.2 release such as a rooted file system and setuid functionality that were entirely based on the Softway Systems' Interix development codenamed \\"Firebrand\\". This was also released in English and followed by a later release in Japanese in October 2002, adding internationalization support. Both supported Windows NT 4.0 SP6a+, Windows 2000, and Windows XP Professional on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 5.0+. The MKS Toolkit was no longer included. It included the following components: * Base Utilities for Interix (BaseUtils; including X11R5 utilities) * UNIX Perl for Interix (UNIXPerl) * Interix SDK (InterixSDK; including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for Visual Studio compiler) * GNU Utilities for Interix (GNUUtils, about 9 utilities in total) * GNU SDK for Interix (GNUSDK; including gcc and g++) * NFS Client for Windows (NFSClient) * NFS Gateway for Windows (NFSGateway) * NFS Server for Windows (NFSServer) * NIS Server for Windows (NIS) * Password Synchronization (PasswdSync) * Windows Remote Shell Service (RshSvc) * Telnet Server for Windows (TelnetServer) * NFS User Name Mapping (Mapsvc) * NFS Authentication Server (NFSServerAuth) * PCNFS Server (Pcnfsd) * ActiveState Perl (Perl) 3.5 This was the final release of SFU and the only release to be distributed free of charge. It was released January 2004 and included both English and Japanese versions for Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and Windows Server 2003 (original release only) on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 5.0+. It included Interix subsystem release 3.5 (build version 8.0) adding internationalization support (at least for the English version which did not have such until now) and POSIX threading. This release could only be installed to an NTFS file system (earlier versions supported FAT; this was for improved file-security requirements in Interix 3.5). The following UNIX versions were supported for NFS components: Solaris 7 and 8, Red Hat Linux 8.0, AIX 5L 5.2, and HP-UX 11i. It included the following components: * Base Utilities for Interix (BaseUtils; including X11R6 and X11R5 utilities) * UNIX Perl for Interix (UNIXPerl) * Interix SDK (InterixSDK; including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for Visual Studio compiler) * GNU Utilities for Interix (GNUUtils, again about 9 utilities) * GNU SDK for Interix (GNUSDK; including gcc and g++) * NFS Client for Windows (NFSClient) * NFS Gateway for Windows (NFSGateway) * NFS Server for Windows (NFSServer) * NIS Server for Windows (NIS) * Password synchronization (PasswdSync) * Windows Remote Shell Service (RshSvc) * Telnet Server for Windows (TelnetServer) * NFS User Name Mapping (Mapsvc) * NFS Authentication Server (NFSServerAuth) * PCNFS server (Pcnfsd) * ActiveState Perl (Perl) Microsoft does not intend to produce any further standalone versions of SFU, opting instead for the integrated SUA.

SUA was deprecated in Windows 8 Enterprise and Windows Server 2012, and completely removed in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. The NFS server is still supported in Windows Server 2012 R2. The NFS client feature and server features are separate from the SUA in Windows 7 and 2008,, and remained supported until Windows Subsystem for Linux replaced it.

In Windows 8, the NFS client gained krb5p (Kerberos 5 with full data encryption) support. In Windows 7, Kerberos 5 was supported for authentication, but only packet integrity checking was available for data. The maximum block/buffer size was also increased from 32 KB to 1 MB in Windows 8.http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sfu/archive/2012/08/01/client-for-nfs-in- windows-8.aspx Windows Server 2012 added support for NFS 4.1 server.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/05/01/microsoft_nfs/ The new implementation is kernel-based (RPC/XDR-wise) but many optional features from NFS4 are not implemented, including ACLs, pNFS etc. There is however support in PowerShell for mapping user identities.

Background and education  Soskice's father, was from a family of Russian Jewish merchants. David Soskice became involved in the Russian Revolution as part of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and was the personal secretary to Alexander Kerensky. He had briefly edited the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom's newspaper Free Russia, briefly replacing Feliks Volkhovsky (the publication had financial support from the likes of Jacob Schiff and other anti-Tsarist elements). Caught in the Winter Palace during the October Revolution, Soskice fled to Britain as the Kerensykites were ousted and the Bolsheviks came to power. He became a British citizen in 1924. He was married to Frank Soskice's mother Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer, who was the daughter of Catherine Madox Brown and Francis Hueffer, and so granddaughter of artist Ford Madox Brown, niece of Lucy Madox Brown (her mother's older half-sister) and her husband William Michael Rossetti, sister of Ford Madox Ford and Oliver Madox Hueffer and cousin of Olivia Rossetti Agresti. Soskice was educated at the Froebel Demonstration School, St Paul's School, London, and Balliol College, Oxford. He studied law and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1926. He served in the British Army with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry during World War II. His son David Soskice is an economist. Political career Following the war, he was elected to parliament as a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Birkenhead East in the 1945 general election, and became Solicitor General, receiving the customary knighthood, in the government of Clement Attlee, serving in that office throughout Attlee's government. He was also, briefly, UK delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. As Solicitor General, Soskice was viewed as an important advocate for the government in the House of Commons. His constituency was abolished in the 1950 election, when he unsuccessfully fought Bebington, but he was soon returned to the House of Commons at a by-election in the Sheffield Neepsend constituency, where the sitting MP Harry Morris stood down to make way for Soskice. In April 1951, he became Attorney General. In 1952, Soskice joined the shadow cabinet, and his fortunes rose in 1955 with the election of his close ally Hugh Gaitskell as party leader, although he continued his legal practice as well. His Sheffield Neepsend constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, but in 1956 he won a by-election in the Newport seat in Monmouthshire that he would hold until he retired. When Labour returned to government in 1964 under Harold Wilson, Soskice became Home Secretary. In this office he did not impress Wilson ‚Äì he was in poor health, and he botched the response to an electoral boundary change dispute in Northamptonshire and accepted weakening amendments to the Race Relations Act of 1965. In December 1965, Soskice was relieved of his Home Office responsibilities and made Lord Privy Seal. He had, though, ensured Government support for Sydney Silverman's Private Members Bill, passed on 28 October 1965, which suspended the death penalty in the United Kingdom for five years (except for treason). This reform is sometimes erroneously included with the Jenkins reforms which followed. In fact when the death penalty for murder was finally abolished in 1969,The abolition of hanging in Britain James Callaghan was Home Secretary. In 1966, Soskice retired, and was created a life peer as Baron Stow Hill, of Newport in the County of Monmouth on 7 June 1966.

Works in this category were written by Byzantine Greeks of the Eastern Roman Empire during the 12th century. History Under the Comnenian dynasty, Byzantine writers of twelfth century Constantinople reintroduced the ancient Greek romance literature, imitating its form and time but somewhat Christianizing its content. Hence the Byzantine stories are traditional in their plot structure and setting (featuring complex turns of events taking place in the ancient Mediterranean, complete with the ancient gods and beliefs) but are also medieval, clearly belonging to the era of the Crusades as they reflect customs and beliefs of that time. A break of eight centuries exists between the last surviving romance work of late antiquity and the first of this medieval revival.The Medieval Greek Romance by Roderick Beaton, 1996, 2nd Revision, a work describing in detail all four twelfth century Byzantine romances, as well as those of later centuries, including complete plot summaries. Only four of these works exist today, just one of which is written in prose: Hysimine and Hysimines by Eustathios Makrembolites. Two are in the dodecasyllable metre: Rodanthe and Dosikles by Theodore Prodromos and Drosilla and Charikles by Niketas Eugenianos. And one is in \\"political verse,\\" Ar√≠standros and Kallith√©a by Constantine Manasses, but exists only in fragments. Of these four romances, one had been translated into English before the twenty-first century: Ismene and Ismenias, a Novel by L.H. Le Moine, (London and Paris: 1788).. Le Moine, however, had made his translation from the 1756 French translation, Les amours d'Ismene et d'Ismenias, of Pierre- Fran√ßois Godart de Beauchamps , which had in turn been made from a Latin rather than a Greek text. More recently, however, interest in these works by English readers has increased, resulting in new translations directly from the Greek. *A Byzantine Novel: Drosilla and Charikles by Niketas Eugenianos translated by Joan Burton (Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, Inc., 2004) . *Four Byzantine Novels translated by Elizabeth Jeffreys (Liverpool University Press, 2012), which includes Rhodanthe and Dosikles by Theodore Prodromos, Hysmine and Hysminias by Eumathios Makrembolites, Aristandros and Kallithea by Constantine Manasses, and Drosilla and Charikles by Niketas Eugenianos Later medieval romance works from around the fourteenth century continued this literary tradition.

Since 1985 it is officially named the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Party of Nicaragua (Partido Marxista-Leninista de Nicaragua), but the original name MAP-ML is far more known and has been used when participating in elections. The party was founded in 1967 by pro-Chinese members of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party. When Albania broke with China, the MAP-ML followed Albania. The party has a trade union wing, Frente Obrero (FO, Workers' Front) that was founded in 1974. The wing organized Milicias Populares Antisomocistas (MILPAS), which fought against the dictatorship of the Somoza regime. As of 1980, MAP-ML had only about 25 members, but through FO and El Pueblo, the daily newspaper of the party, it exerted much influence in the society. One of the founders of MAP-ML, Marvin Ortega, had belonged to the national leadership of FSLN. MAP-ML built up a militant trade union activism and in urban areas had its own armed militias, Milicias Populares Antisomocistas (MILPAS). In the struggle against the Somoza regime, MILPAS forces fought under the command of the FSLN. When the Sandinista Revolution succeeded in 1979, MAP-ML condemned it as \\"not a workers' but a bourgeois revolution\\". It organized strikes and land seizures. The Sandinistas reciprocated by disarming MILPAS and temporarily closing down El Pueblo. Several members were also imprisoned. MAP-ML was generally critical against the mixed economy during the FSLN government. MAP-ML was the only party that voted against the Sandinista constitution in the National Assembly. In 1984 MAP-ML was one of the parties that contested the general elections. The party got 2.1% of the votes in the parliamentary election and two seats in the national assembly. In the presidential election the MAP-ML candidate was Isidro T√©llez Toru√±o, the general secretary of FO, and vice-presidential candidate was Juan Alberto Henr√≠quez. Isidro and Henr√≠quez got 11 352 votes (1%). An electoral slogan of MAP-ML was \\"¬°Ni un voto a la burgues√≠a! ¬°Balas para el imperialismo!\\" (Not one vote for the bourgeoisie! Bullets against imperialism!). In 1985 the MAP-ML conference decided to officially change its name to Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Party of Nicaragua (Partido Marxista-Leninista de Nicaragua). MAP-ML opposed the Esquipulas Peace Agreement, which it saw as an imperialist scheme by the United States. In the 1990 presidential election, the PMLN candidates (Isidro T√©llez for president, Carlos Cuadra for vice- president) got 8 135 votes (0.6%). PMLN lost its parliamentary representation that year. PMLN lost their registration after the 1996 elections. In the 2001 presidential elections, PMLN supported FSLN candidate Daniel Ortega.

Early life and education Brooke was born in Oxford,1911 England Census the son of artist Leonard Leslie Brooke and his cousin Sybil Diana Brooke. He was educated at Marlborough College, where he was a classmate of Rab Butler, and Balliol College, Oxford. He had an elder brother, 2nd Lt. Leonard Stopford Brooke, who was killed in Germany in 1918 while serving with the Army Cyclist Corps. Political career After teaching philosophy at Balliol College for a year, Brooke worked at a Quaker settlement for the unemployed in the Rhondda Valley in 1927‚Äì28. This experience led him to turn down the offer of a Fellowship in philosophy at Balliol in favour of a lifetime in politics. After a year on the Economist, Brooke became one of the original members, and subsequently Deputy Chairman, of the Conservative Research Department (1929‚Äì37) under the chairmanship of Neville Chamberlain.See John Ramsden, The Making of Conservative Party Policy, Chapter 4 (Longmans, 1980) for a full description of Brooke's work at the Research Department. The impetus for the pre-war \\"special areas\\" legislation was derived from his unsigned articles on \\"Places without a Future\\" which he wrote for The Times in 1934.See Tory Policy-Making, edited by Alistair Cooke (Conservative Research Department, 2009), Chapter 2, pp 12-13. \\"A year spent in a Quaker settlement for the unemployed in the Rhondda Valley before joining the CRD had instilled in Brooke a deep commitment to economic and social progress which made him a natural Chamberlain man: and, like Chamberlain ... he enjoyed asking the tough questions about how progress could be achieved within an evolving framework of Tory policy which allotted no place to high taxation as the basis of extended state activity.\\" Cooke, op. cit., at p. 13 describes him as the linchpin of the Research Department until his departure in 1937 to prepare for a Parliamentary career. He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewisham West in a 1938 by-election. He spoke at the request of the Whips in support of Neville Chamberlain in the debate of May 1940, just before the prime minister's fall from power,John Ramsden, op.cit,. at p. 66 writes of the \\"real admiration that was felt for Chamberlain as a politician by almost everyone who worked for him - the same loyalty was generated at the Ministry of Health and the Treasury when he was in charge.\\" and Brooke himself was defeated in the 1945 general election. The next year he was elected to the London County Council, and served as Conservative leader on the council until 1951, continuing to serve on the Council and the Hampstead borough council until 1955. In 1949 he led the Conservative party on the London County Council to the brink of seizing power for only the third time in its history.Badly beaten in 1946, the Conservatives obtained 64 seats in 1949, the Labour Party 64 and the Liberals one. They received comfortably the largest number of votes ‚Äì 1,523,499 to 1,405,543 ‚Äì and would have gained power if 12 voters in Stoke Newington had voted for one of their candidates, and not for Labour. In the event, Labour retained power by deploying the votes of those aldermen who continued in office to elect a new chairman from outside the Council (who, in turn, voted in favour of the election of six more Labour aldermen). From 1946 to 1948 he was the last deputy chairman of the Southern Railway before nationalisation. Brooke returned to parliament in 1950 as MP for Hampstead, and entered Winston Churchill's government in 1954 as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, serving under Rab Butler and Harold Macmillan when they were Chancellors of the Exchequer.Harold Macmillan, in his memoirs Riding the Storm, wrote that Brooke was an experienced politician, destined, as he could see, to reach high office. \\"A good scholar he was sound rather than brilliant, and was absolutely reliable and loyal.\\" He continued in this job until 1957, when he became Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentHis Parliamentary Secretary Reginald Bevins (1957-1959), in his Memoirs The Greasy Pole (Hodder & Stoughton 1965) wrote at p. 50 of the intense workload, but added: \\"A number of people, however, combined to make life tolerable, even enjoyable. Henry Brooke for one. He was as straight as a die, the most honest politician I have ever known. Confronted by any problem, most ministers ask themselves, first, what is the right course to take and, in the light of this, what is politically expedient. I know of some who only asked the second question. Henry Brooke only asked himself the first question. To him politics is not the art of the possible; it is simply doing what he considers right. This is his character, and there is nothing priggish in it.\\" He also wrote, at p. 103: \\"I have always respected Henry Brooke‚Äôs judgment. His detractors are very bad judges of character, for he was, as I have already said, the most honest man in British politics and a man who, as Home Secretary, was most unfairly traduced.\\" and Minister of Welsh Affairs in the Macmillan government, entering the Cabinet. In the former job he was the main driving force behind making London a smokeless zone.In The Times, 3 April 1984, Lord Molson wrote in a supplementary obituary notice: \\"There were many who told him that to change so completely the London atmosphere was impossible, practically and financially. His persistence and his deep knowledge of government, central and local, achieved a change in the London environment which only the rapidly diminishing number of us who can remember the old ‚Äòpea soup‚Äô fogs can appreciate.\\" Lord Molson was a former chairman of the Committee for Environmental Conservation. He attracted controversy when steering the Rent Bill through Parliament after it had already secured a Second Reading in the House of Commons under his predecessors.See Simon Heffer, Like the Roman, A Life of Enoch Powell (Hutchinson, 1996) at p. 211: \\"On 18th February 1958 the Labour-supporting Daily Herald reported gossip that Brooke and Bevins were saying bluntly that they had been saddled with the Rent Bill, which they were finding it hard to defend.\\" The aim of the Act, to attract investment into the private rented market, was thwarted by the Labour Party‚Äôs announcement that it would repeal the Act as soon as it took office (as indeed it did, in 1965). In the latter job he caused anger throughout Wales through his crucial support of Liverpool Council's bid to secure Westminster's approval of an Act of Parliament to flood Cwm Tryweryn in Meirionydd, thereby by-passing Welsh local authority opposition to the scheme. However, largely in response to the protests over Tryweryn, he subsequently attracted investment to Wales, including such projects as the Severn Bridge, the steelworks at Llanwern, and the Heads of the Valleys Road. In 1961 he became the first Chief Secretary to the Treasury in modern times.Richard Davenport-Hines, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, wrote: \\"His hard-working and orthodox character was appreciated in the Treasury, where he helped to prepare some unpopular policies associated with the chancellor of the exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd.\\" In 1962 he reached his highest level in government, becoming Home Secretary following Harold Macmillan's \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" when many senior ministers were sacked. As Home Secretary, Brooke was not particularly successful, and his actions caused controversy on several occasions, including his response to the noisy demonstrations against the state visit by King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece.Brooke is reported as saying: \\"The demonstrators were shouting 'fascist police' at masses of splendid London policemen who had to be taken off their proper work of fighting crime to quell their filthy abuse.\\" (The Times, 15 July 1963). In his Obituary in The Times,The Times, 30 March 1984. This obituary added: \\"In private life his quiet manner, friendliness and utter reliability ensured him a host of friends, and his loyalty and devotion to Marlborough College, to Balliol, to London local government, and to the Conservative Party will cause him to be long remembered among innumerable people.\\" the author wrote: \\"His tenure of this difficult post was not a particularly happy one, and although his integrity and fairness were generally admired, there was a feeling in some quarters that he lacked the sensitiveness and flexibility required in the handling of difficult individual cases.\\" In the Dictionary of National BiographyThe Dictionary of National Biography (Missing Persons), Oxford University Press 1993, p. 92. Lord Blake wrote that Brooke had to take a number of decisions in the field of immigration and deportation which infuriated libertarians, and that he seemed to display a certain insensitivity in these cases ‚Äì an impression enhanced by his somewhat pedantic way of speech. In the Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Philip Knightley-Smith wrote, of his two years at the Home Office: \\"His declared priorities were to confront the crime wave and to reduce prison over-crowding by a new building programme: but his deliberative pragmatism was ill-suited to his new responsibilities. Brooke's 27 months as home secretary proved peculiarly unsuccessful.\\" He was plunged into controversy at the very beginning of his term of office because of his initial reaction to the case of Carmen Bryan.Miss Carmen Bryan (Deportation Order) Hansard, HC Deb 19 July 1962 vol 663 cc 635-41. The actual decision had been taken by Brooke's predecessor R.A.Butler, but he loyally defended it. Bryan was a 22-year-old Jamaican woman and first offender, who pleaded guilty to petty larceny (shoplifting goods worth ¬£2) and was recommended for deportation by Paddington magistrates. Brooke's acquiescence to the court order and her six-week detention in Holloway Prison pending deportation was seen as both unnecessary and unjust. Neither bail or the opportunity for her to appeal were offered directly to her. Standing firm, Brooke told the House of Commons, \\"I think it would be a great act of injustice if I were to stand in the way of her returning to Jamaica. I am not prepared to look at this case again\\". However, criticism in Parliament and in the media combined to force a speedy review where, four days later, Brooke recanted, freeing Bryan and allowing her to remain. Deportations for misdemeanours were subsequently suspended. There had been more than eighty recommendations for deportation in the seven weeks following the Conservative Government's introduction of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act (1962). Brooke was one of many politicians to receive unprecedented criticism on That Was The Week That Was on BBC Television in 1962‚Äì63, which called him \\"the most hated man in Britain\\" and ended a mock profile of him with the phrase \\"If you're Home Secretary, you can get away with murder\\".See Robert Shepherd, Iain Macleod (Hutchinson, 1994), at p. 287: \\"The time was ripe for the satirists. The notion that modern society should be ruled by its elders and betters was increasingly rejected, yet Macmillan‚Äôs Government had about it the aura of rule by elders and betters. Inevitably, ministers (especially the hapless Home Secretary Henry Brooke) became the butt of some harsh satirical comment.\\" He was also involved in the passage of various new anti-drug laws, including ones banning possession of amphetamines and the growing of cannabis. As the final arbiter in death penalty cases he was the last Home Secretary to allow a death sentence to go ahead. Sir Alec Douglas-Home kept Brooke in office as Home Secretary when he became Prime Minister in October 1963, and his last 12 months in office, which saw the introduction of the Police Act 1964 and the creation of a Royal Commission on Crime and Punishment, attracted much less controversy.In September 1964, a month before the General Election, he agreed with the Prime Minister that the 1957 Homicide Act was \\"'unworkable' and that the next Home Secretary, of whatever party, would have to abolish the death penalty.\\" Richard Lamb, The Macmillan Years 1957-1963, p 410. His speech from the Opposition back benches in the death penalty debate in December 1964, and the tributes it received, have been republished by his son Sir Henry Brooke (a former Lord Justice of Appeal) at https://sirhenrybrooke.me/2016/01/31/my-fathers-speech-in- december-1964-in-the-death-penalty-debate/ Brooke went into opposition following the Conservative defeat in 1964, and he lost his seat in the subsequent election in 1966. Having been appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1964, he was created a life peer as Baron Brooke of Cumnor, of Cumnor in the Royal County of Berkshire on 20 July 1966, and acted as a Conservative front bench spokesman in the House of Lords until 1970. The onset of Parkinson's disease then led him to retire gradually from public life. Personal life and family Brooke married Barbara Muriel, daughter of the Reverend Alfred Mathews, in 1933. As she was made a life peer, too, they were one of the few couples who both held titles in their own right. The couple had four children: *Peter Leonard Brooke (b. 1934), later The Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, a Conservative politician. *Sir Henry Brooke (1936‚Äì2018), a judge and Lord Justice of Appeal. *Honor Leslie Brooke (b. 1941), married Dr. Thomas Nigel Miller. *Margaret Hilary Diana Brooke (b. 1944), married Dr. James Pulfer. Lord Brooke of Cumnor died from Parkinson's disease in March 1984, aged 80. One biographer has written of him: \\"He was a quiet, friendly, honest and steadfast man, who was regarded by his detractors as a cruel, deceitful, ogre. His gentle, affectionate memoir of his father Leslie Brooke and Johnny Crow (1982) belies the public's view of him\\".Richard Davenport-Hines, op cit. His wife died in September 2000, aged 92.

Built in June 1945, she carried ammunition and other cargo from U.S. West Coast ports to Southeast Asia, then ferried cargo, equipment and troops back to the U.S. after the war ended. She survived two typhoons and one hurricane. She sailed around the world twice. American Victory spent half of the period between 1946 and 1966 chartered to commercial carriers and the other half in two stints in U.S. reserve fleets. From 1966 to 1969 she delivered cargo to Southeast Asia in the Vietnam War, then three decades again in reserve. In April 1999, she was turned over to a preservation organization to serve as a museum ship. Today she is the main feature of the American Victory Ship & Museum, also known as the American Victory Mariners Memorial & Museum Ship in Tampa, Florida's, Channel District. History=World War II era Named after the American University in Washington, D.C., the ship was built at the California Shipbuilding Yard (Calship) in Los Angeles, California in just 55 days and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 20 June 1945.www.americanvictory.org History American Victory, a United States Merchant Marine ship, was operated for WSA under a general agency agreement by Hammond Shipping Company, Ltd. She loaded Army cargo at Fort Mason then took on cargo at Los Angeles and other west coast ports before steaming to Manila in the Philippines. Manila had been liberated on 3 March 1945, and was in need of supplies. She took her remaining cargo to Shanghai, China. In November 1945, American Victory sailed to Calcutta and Port Said, Egypt, and loaded military cargo to be returned to the USA. She arrived in New York in January 1946, and unloaded her cargo, having completed her around the world trip. At the end of the war she ferried more cargo, equipment and troops stateside. Post-World War II From 29 June 1946 until November 1947, American Victory was bareboat chartered by American Export Lines. The ship was engaged in carrying foodstuffs and machinery exported from the United States to Europe, Russia, and the Near East under the Marshall Plan, the Post-War reconstruction of the European Continent. Some of her Ports of call were: Trieste, in Italy, Constanza, in Romania, Piraeus, in Greece, and Antwerp, in Belgium. Departing Odessa, Ukraine, to Boston, in January 1947, the Black Sea had already iced up, not waiting for the Soviet icebreaker Turgenev to clear the ice, Captain, A. D. Cushman, knowing American Victory decided to use her as an icebreaker, backing up and ramming the ice so both her and other ships could depart the Black Sea. She was then laid up in the Hudson River Reserve Fleet until she was again chartered by commercial shipping lines, U.S. Navigation Company, during the Korean War, from 1951 until January 1954, when she entered the Sabine River Reserve Fleet in Texas. In 1963, plans were made to convert American Victory and 14 other ships in her class to \\"forward depot\\" vessels, to be loaded with materiel and stationed near potential flashpoints to provide American forces with pre-positioned supplies. This scheme was cancelled in February 1966, after only three conversions had been carried out. Had American Victory been converted, she would have been renamed USNS Carthage and assigned pennant AG 185. American Victory was removed from the reserve fleet in 1966, and chartered to the Hudson Waterways Corporation who used her to ferry military equipment to American forces in South Vietnam. She was deactivated again in October 1969, and placed in the James River Reserve Fleet in Lees Hall, Virginia, where she remained until 1985. American Victory was then renovated as part of a program to determine the efforts needed to reactivate mothballed Victory ships. In June, after US$2.5 million had been spent to bring her up to fully operational condition, she sailed for just 26 hours before returning to the Naval Reserve Fleet.Ship's Story: The History of the American Victory - 1950'sShip's Story: The History of the American Victory - 1960's Today Name plaque SS American Victory Engine room One of several World War II Victory ships due to be scrapped in the late 1990s, American Victory was rescued by preservation efforts which began in October 1998. She arrived at Tampa, Florida, under tow to begin her new life as a museum ship and memorial on 16 September 1999. Following extensive overhaul with the ship brought to Fully Operational status in 2003, she is now on display and included on the National Register of Historic Places. Guided and self-guided tours of the ship are available, though some areas are off-limits for tours, such as the lower areas of the engine room (but visible from a catwalk), and the wheelhouse of the command bridge, as well as the cargo hold next to the receptionist desk. Photos of her drydock restoration are hanging in the mess hall. Several rooms, such as the captain's quarters and galley cold storage, have been restored and are decorated in original period memorabilia. American Victory has been upgraded with modern VHF radio and radar (visible on the command deck). More modern electronics have been added to the electricians' quarters and radio room, Victory is generally in her historic form, her bow mounted deck gun is still in place as well as the stern gun and another 3-inch gun next to it. American Victory is a fully operational, seaworthy vessel which usually carries out two cruises a year, however, none were scheduled for 2015 due to costs. On 10 June 2015, the U.S. Coast Guard performed a safety inspection of the ship. Docked to starboard In addition to her floating museum role, American Victory still sails for \\"Living History Day Cruises\\". Of the 534 Victory ships completed, only three remain working: American Victory at Tampa, at Los Angeles, and at Richmond, California. Until November 2012, a fourth, USNS Range Sentinel, originally , was in storage, but she was sold for scrapping. The ship is also used as an operating base for a local United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps unit. Exhibits The ship has many notable exhibits in the No.3 cargo hold, which was converted to a museum exhibit area and receptionist desk. It includes an original submarine propeller from the , sunk in May 1942, by the U.S. Coast Guard cutter , and recovered in 1979. It includes photos of the shipwreck, a mannequin of a Kriegsmarine sailor in uniform, and a diagram of . She also has numerous ship models, including a , a , a German Type XXI U-boat, and . There are also numerous vintage Merchant Marine recruiting posters, and a collection of Victory and Liberty ship's plaques, all of them sunk or scrapped. They date from 1844 to 1956. There is also a mock-up of the ships wheelhouse, and a lifeboat and Maritime Signal Flag exhibit.

It concerns two siblings, Elisabeth and Paul, who isolate themselves from the world as they grow up, an isolation which is shattered by the stresses of their adolescence. It was first translated into English by Samuel Putnam in 1930 and published by Brewer & Warren Inc. A later English translation was made by Rosamond Lehmann in 1955, and published by New Directions () in the U.S., and Mclelland & Stewart in Canada in 1966, with the title translated as The Holy Terrors. The book is illustrated by the author's own drawings. It was made into a film of the same name, a collaboration between Cocteau and director Jean-Pierre Melville in 1950,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042436/ and inspired the opera of the same name by Philip Glass. The ballet La Boule de Neige by the choreographer Fabrizio Monteverde with music of Pierluigi Castellano is based on this novel. The story was adapted by the writer Gilbert Adair for his 1988 novel The Holy Innocents,http://filmstore.bfi.org.uk/acatalog/info_113.html which was the basis for the 2003 film The Dreamers directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Summary The story concerns the siblings Paul and Elisabeth who start this story without a father and with a bed-ridden mother, whom Elisabeth looks after. At school Paul is obsessed with the stud looking Dargelos, while Paul‚Äôs school friend Gerard is enthralled by the siblings. However, after Paul becomes ill when Dargelos throws a snowball with a stone inside at him, Elisabeth cares for both him and their mother. While Elisabeth nurses Paul it is revealed that the siblings enjoy a relationship characterised by a psychodrama known in the book as \\"The Game\\", which can only be played in their shared bedroom, elevated by the Game-play into \\"The Room\\". The game devised by Paul and Elisabeth often involves the siblings trying to annoy or irritate each other, by histrionic behaviour on the part of Elisabeth and by a taciturn refusal to be affected by Paul, where the winner is the one that leaves the contest with the last word, a sense of superiority and ideally having caused a display of angry frustration from the other. This game continues after Paul recovers and their mother has died. Elisabeth soon takes up a job as a model, where she meets Agathe, a girl who was orphaned at a young age after her drug- addicted parents committed suicide. Agathe, characterised by her strong resemblance to Dargelos, soon moves in with Paul and Elisabeth. Elisabeth is first to get married. She weds a wealthy young man who dies on his way to a business meeting before the married couple can even enjoy a honeymoon. As a result of his death, the siblings inherit a large house which they move into. Paul soon finds himself in love with Agathe. Elisabeth cannot stand to see her brother happy, and knows she must draw him back into their shared private world. Writing of his love to Agathe, Paul stakes his life on her reciprocation. Elisabeth intercepts the letter and prevents it from reaching Agathe. She tells her that Gerard is in love with her. Elisabeth then manages to bully Gerard, who is in love with her, into marrying Agathe and as a result helps break her brother‚Äôs heart. She feels herself condemned and pursued by the Furies thereafter, for the crime of having destroyed Paul and Agathe's happiness through deceit. After Agathe and Gerard's marriage, Gerard meets with Dargelos, now a collector of poisons, who sends one of these poisons to Paul, also an enthusiast, as a gift. The poison is opium, which Jean Cocteau, the author of this book, was addicted to himself. Paul takes most of the opium in despair. As Paul lies dying he is attended by Agathe, who reviving Paul temporarily, confesses her love to him, and the plot is laid bare. At this moment, knowing that Paul is dying, Elisabeth senses that this is yet another twist in the game and by dying he has beaten her to the final move. She then shoots herself and by a matter of seconds beats Paul, leaving a frightened Agathe with two dead bodies.

In 1931 he served as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Political career Bridgeman entered a career in politics early, becoming assistant private secretary to Lord Knutsford, the Colonial Secretary (1889‚Äì1892), and then to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1895 to 1897. In 1897 he became a member of the London School Board, and in 1904 he was elected to the London County Council. In 1906 he was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for Oswestry, staying in this seat until his retirement in 1929. In 1909 he was appointed a member of a Royal Commission on the selection of Justices of the Peace. In 1911, Bridgeman became an opposition whip, and became a government whip in the Asquith coalition government in 1915. From 1915 to 1916, he was Lord of the Treasury and Assistant Director of the War Trade Department.

In these roles, Bridgeman became a devoted opponent of strikes and socialism, although he came to admire more moderate trade unionists. He was appointed to the Privy Council on 13 October 1920. In October 1922, Bridgeman was one of the leaders of the Conservative revolt against the coalition's leadership, and he became Home Secretary in the new Conservative governments of Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin from 1922 until January 1924. He developed here a reputation for harshness and resolve, which continued in his time as First Lord of the Admiralty from November 1924 to June 1929. Throughout, he was one of Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin's closest allies. Bridgeman retired from the Commons in 1929, and on 18 June that year was created Viscount Bridgeman, of Leigh in the County of Shropshire. Later life In his later years, he served as chairman of various commissions and committees, as well as, briefly, Chairman of the BBC.

Background and education Sotheron-Estcourt was the eldest son of Thomas Grimston Estcourt, Member of Parliament (MP) for Devizes and Oxford University, son of Thomas Estcourt, Member of Parliament for Cricklade. His mother was Eleanor, daughter of James Sutton. He was educated at Harrow and Oriel College, Oxford. Political career Estcourt was elected to Parliament as MP for Marlborough in 1829. He was elected to parliament again in 1835 as MP for Devizes, switched to North Wiltshire in 1844, and continued in the Commons until 1865. Sotheron resumed the name Estcourt in 1855, and entered Lord Derby's second government in 1858 as President of the Poor Law Board. The next year, he became Home Secretary, but the government soon fell. He had been sworn of the Privy Council in 1858. Family Sotheron-Estcourt married Lucy Sarah, daughter of Admiral Frank Sotheron, in 1830. In 1839 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Sotheron in lieu of his patronymic in order to inherit his father-in-law's property. However, in 1853 he resumed by Royal licence the surname of Estcourt in addition to that of Sotheron. He retired from public life in 1863 after a paralytic seizure. He died in January 1876, aged 74. His wife had died in 1870. Sotheron-Estcourt's estates passed to his nephew George Bucknall-Estcourt, who assumed the surname of Sotheron-Estcourt and was created Baron Estcourt in 1903.

He was briefly Home Secretary under George Canning in 1827. Background and education Born William Sturges, he was the only son of the Reverend John Sturges and his wife Judith (n√©e Bourne). He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1793. In 1803, Sturges inherited property from his uncle Francis Bourne, requiring him to add the surname Bourne to his own. Political career At Oxford he became good friends with George Canning, who helped him become elected to parliament for Hastings in 1798. In Pitt's second government, Sturges Bourne became Secretary to the Treasury, and, after a period out of government during the Ministry of All the Talents, he became a Lord of the Treasury from 1807 to 1809, retiring along with his ally Canning from the government. Sturges Bourne left parliament after the 1812 general election, but, due again to Canning's influence, became a Privy Councillor in 1814, and returned to parliament for Bandon Bridge in 1815. In 1814 he became a commissioner on the Board of Control, remaining in this office until 1822. He also served from 1818 to 1819 as Chairman of a Committee to reform the Poor Laws, which was successfully carried out as the Sturges Bourne Acts. Although he retired from government in 1822 due to a large inheritance, he returned to government as Home Secretary when Canning became prime minister in April 1827. He only served briefly in this post, becoming instead First Commissioner of Woods and Forests when the Whig grandee Lord Lansdowne joined the ministry as Home Secretary a few months later. He was offered the Chancellorship of the Exchequer several times by Canning's successor Lord Goderich, but turned it down, leading Colonial Secretary William Huskisson to accuse him of sabotaging the ministry. Sturges Bourne retired from government with Wellington's accession as premier in February 1828. Sturges Bourne supported Catholic emancipation, but opposed the Whig Reform Bill, and retired from parliament in 1831. In his later career, he served as a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1826 Family Sturges Bourne married Anne, third daughter of Oldfield Bowles, in 1808. He died at Testwood House, New Forest, Hampshire, in February 1845, aged 75.

It takes place in New York City in 1896, and includes appearances by many famous figures of New York society in that era, including Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan. The sequel to the novel is The Angel of Darkness. The story follows Roosevelt, then New York City police commissioner, and Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, as their investigative team attempts to solve gruesome murders through new methods including fingerprinting and psychology. The first murder victim investigated is a 13-year-old immigrant who has had his eyes removed, his genitals removed and stuffed in his mouth, and other injuries. The investigators deal with various interest groups that wish to maintain the status quo regarding the poor immigrant population in New York City. The book made best-sellers lists of Publishers Weekly and The New York Times the month it was published, and film rights to the story were purchased by producer Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures. The film studio has since moved the rights over to its television division, where a 10-part event TV series adaptation began its run on January 22, 2018 on TNT. The Alienist received generally positive reception. Booklist described it as \\"superbly atmospheric and compelling\\", Forbes called the work a \\"fascinating, fast-paced spine-tingler\\", and author Paul Levine wrote in the Chicago Tribune \\"at the end the reader thirsts for another tale of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler\\". The Houston Chronicle characterized it \\"an out-and-out page-turner\\", and The Seattle Times noted \\"Carr brings the dual sensibilities of historian and novelist to the story.\\"  Plot summary  Narrated from the first-person perspective of John Moore, a crime reporter for The New York Times, the novel begins on January 8, 1919, the day that Theodore Roosevelt is buried. Moore has dinner with Laszlo Kreizler, the famous alienist. Kreizler is surrounded by those he has rescued, including his black servant, Cyrus Montrose, and a boy named Stevie \\"Stevepipe\\" Taggert. (Mary Palmer, another patient and Kreizler's housekeeper, is deceased by the time of this dinner.) Together, they reminisce about their times with Roosevelt, but they focus on one moment: the spring of 1896 and their efforts to catch a serial killer on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The novel is narrated in retrospect, with Moore commenting on the events and how they impacted later history. At 2 AM on March 3, 1896, Moore is awakened by one of Kreizler's servants banging incessantly on his door. Stevie, a young boy whom Kreizler had saved from being institutionalized and who is dedicated to Kreizler, brings Moore to the scene of a crime that Kreizler wants Moore to see. Roosevelt, the police commissioner, is already at the scene. When Moore sees the nature of the brutal murder, he is appalled. The victim, Georgio \\"Gloria\\" Santorelli, is a 13-year-old boy who prostituted himself by dressing up as a girl; the boy's wrists are tied behind his back, and he is kneeling with his face pressed on the steel walkway where he was found. Though makeup paint and powder on his face are still intact, his eyes are gouged out, his right hand is chopped off, his genitals are cut off and stuffed between his jaws, he has huge gashes across his entire body, his throat has been slashed, and his buttocks are \\"shorn off\\". The policeman at the scene, Detective Sergeant Connor, makes it clear that murders of such victims are usually ignored. At Roosevelt's request, Moore, Kreizler, and he meet the following morning in Roosevelt's office to discuss the case. Kreizler has examined the body and disagrees with the official coroner's report. He connects the Santorelli killing to that of a second case in which two children, Benjamin and Sofia Zweig, were killed and had their eyes gouged out. Roosevelt announces that there are two more murders that match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an alienist, and because the investigation will become politically difficult, he establishes a base of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically, Roosevelt cannot afford to be associated with the investigation and is not involved with the day-to-day operations. Kreizler asks for some young detectives who are open to new methods and receives the help of Sara Howard, the first woman to be hired by the police department, and Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, two Jewish brothers who were hired when Roosevelt began removing corrupt police officers from the force. The Isaacsons bring sophisticated methods, such as the Bertillon system and fingerprinting, to the investigation, although these were not popular in New York City police departments at the time nor accepted in courts of law. The group begins to investigate the victims, hoping to understand the mind of the murderer by understanding his victims. They interview Georgio Santorelli's mother and discover, for example, that there was discord in his family. Georgio's parents had learned of his being manipulated into performing sexual acts for older boys in school, and the father's response was to try to beat it out of the boy. Georgio eventually left home and lived on the streets as a male-for-male prostitute. They also read the emerging science of psychology, such as the works of William James. Another body is discovered, and the evidence suggests that the victim knew his attacker. The team also deduces that the killer's agility on rooftops suggests that he is familiar with mountain- or rock- climbing. Kreizler, Roosevelt, Moore, and Howard must deal with various interest groups during their investigation who wish to maintain society's status quo, including a corrupt police force, which takes bribes from owners of the brothels whose prostitutes include poor immigrants; the Catholic Church, which is wary of the potential power of an organized immigrant population; the Episcopal Church; and J. P. Morgan.

He also spent a lot of time researching his book at the J. P. Morgan Library. Carr pitched the book as non-fiction, because he was afraid his agent and editor would not accept a fiction book from a non-fiction author. Only when the publisher was on the verge of buying the book did he reveal the truth. The novel \\"allowed him to exorcise some of his demons, mostly centered on his relationship with his father, which was stormy and sometimes violent.\\" Carr will not reveal specific details of his family history, but he has said, \\"It's safe to assume that I know something about family violence....\\" and he told New York magazine, \\"I'm the only kid in my family who never tried to kill himself...I kind of figured somebody else was going to kill me anyway.\\" Carr's natural father, Lucien Carr, was a writer, who in the 1940s was at the center of a group of as-yet unknown writers (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs). In the summer of 1944, he killed his former scoutmaster, a man who was enamored with him. One night, the scoutmaster supposedly made a move on Lucien Carr, and Carr stabbed him in the chest with his boy scout knife. Carr disposed of the body in the Hudson River, and together he and Kerouac got rid of the knife. Carr was sentenced to two years' jail time and Kerouac a few days. Caleb Carr was \\"fascinated with the psychology of killers, who were subliminally acting out the pain of being controlled by monstrous parents by controlling and killing victims, seeking a release that would never come.\\" As he explains, \\"For me it began in New York with the Son of Sam killings while I was in college...I think I can understand some of the kind of rage that's behind what they do. I can't understand the major portion of it because that's what leads to the violence they commit. But I can understand the germ of it.\\" Genre and style The Alienist has been called a detective novel, an historical novel, and a mystery novel. It is set in 1896, \\"the moment in history when the modern idea of the serial killer became available\\", eight years after the Jack the Ripper case, and at a time when the word \\"psychopath\\" was new to scientists. Like E. L. Doctorow's 'Ragtime', the novel combines fact with fiction. Historical figures such as Lincoln Steffens, Jacob Riis, Anthony Comstock, and J. Pierpont Morgan appear briefly in the novel and interact with the fictional characters. Carr includes period details, such as descriptions of \\"sumptuous meals of turtle soup au clair, Creole eggs, broiled squab, saddle of lamb a la Colbert and 'a liter of smooth, dark Wurzburger (beer) that had a head as thick as whipped cream'\\". Themes In an interview with The Record, Carr stated he wanted to entertain the reader, while also staying faithful to the time period. Carr, a historian by training, wanted to find a form of writing where he could meld his interest in fiction with his knowledge of history. \\"The one thing I wanted to show was that people back then are a lot more like people today than we realize,\\" said Carr. Carr researched the science and literature of the time period and noted, \\"The biggest challenge was to study the psychological literature of that day so that none of my characters would not know more than they could have known in terms of psychology. We're talking about a time when Sigmund Freud had just published his first book.\\" Author Paul Levine compares Kreizler to Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud. He likens The Alienist to Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow; both stories fuse historical fiction with real characters from the time period. Levine notes the story serves as a \\"painless history lesson\\", and comments that the juxtaposition of J.P. Morgan's lifestyle with \\" the teeming tenements where police dare not enter\\", serve as \\"reminders that crime and class distinction are hardly new\\". Carr has said that \\"The Alienist is about how violent behavior is perpetuated from one generation to the next.\\" The Alienist \\"explores the causes of insanity and criminality, and ultimately the nature of evil\\". Another theme is destiny, and the novel investigates New York City's destiny, \\"saying its basic character and problems have endured over history\\". Reception=Sales and marketing Random House paid Carr an advance of $60,000 for the book. Paperback rights were sold at auction to Bantam for $1,001,000. The book made Publishers Weekly's list of best-sellers in April 1994, and during the summer of 1994 reached between no. 4 and no. 7 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Reviews The book has received generally favorable reviews; \\"while most critics found it entertaining, some said it was sometimes flabby with historical detail and its prose was less than literature.\\" In a review published in Booklist, Brad Hooper calls The Alienist and Caleb Carr's sequel, The Angel of Darkness, \\"superbly atmospheric and compelling\\". A review of The Alienist in Forbes comments: \\"Wonderfully evocative of the age, this fascinating, fast-paced spine-tingler never flags.\\" Writing for The Record, Laurence Chollet notes: \\"The story feels like a Sherlock Holmes tale, reads like a modern thriller, and is historically accurate.\\" In his review in The Gazette of Colorado Springs, Victor Greto wrote: \\"Through his research into the New York of the late 19th century, [Carr] has also fleshed out an atmosphere and a time that, on the one hand, seems grimly real and unapproachably evil, but, on the other, is within our intellectual grasp.\\" In her review for Tulsa World, Patricia Ann Jones wrote that the novel \\"breaks new ground on several fronts. As a historical novel it paints an unrivaled picture of New York. As a thriller it sets a new pace. But as a psychological study it stands completely on its own. The writing is quite simply, superb.\\" In his review of the book for the Chicago Tribune, Mortal Sin author Paul Levine writes: \\"the long story never becomes tedious, and at the end the reader thirsts for another tale of Dr. Lazlo Kreizler\\". Kathye Self of the Houston Chronicle characterizes the work as \\"an out-and-out page-turner about the first time a 'psychological profile' was used to track down a serial murderer\\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt writes in The Tampa Tribune: \\"Carr has lovingly evoked not only a physical sense of old New York but the spirit of the time as well, when the powers in charge were worried about unrest among the masses of cheap immigrant labor.\\" In a review for The Seattle Times, Deloris Tarzan Ament comments: \\"A contributing editor to Military History Quarterly, Carr brings the dual sensibilities of historian and novelist to the story.\\" In his review for The Washington Post, novelist Jack Katzenbach argued that Carr's impeccable research and rich detail hindered the work's pace but rewarded readers by portraying \\"the excitement of a world on the verge of change, where invention was the stuff of daily miracle,\\" specifically when it came to forensics. According to The New York Times, \\"the only real weakness of the book lies in the stringent rationality of Kreizler's investigation. The more his logic makes sense the less threatening his quarry seems, at least to the reader....The story's fatalism grows tedious....Nor does it help that throughout most of the story none of the major characters are directly threatened by the killer. Of course, it is deplorable that children are being murdered. But none of them figure strongly enough in the story to arouse the reader's visceral identification.\\" Scott Eyman of The Palm Beach Post was critical of the \\"flaccid dialogue\\" and \\"vague characters\\". Hary Levins from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted that the novel does include a few notable anachronisms. For example, the \\"heroes display an early (and highly improbable) political correctness toward blacks and homosexuals. And his detective team anticipates the feminist movement by enlisting a tough-minded career woman who's unafraid to pack a pistol and spout a bit of scatological English.\\" Adaptations=Film Carr told The Orange County Register he had envisioned a film adaptation of his work while writing the story. \\"I was always aware that if done correctly, this could end up being a great movie. I grew up with the movies. I've written scripts. Movies are something I've always loved,\\" he said. Carr thought of Emma Thompson to play Sara, and Anthony Hopkins or Sam Neill to play Kreizler. Before the book was published, film producer Scott Rudin purchased the film rights to the novel for $500,000. In June 1993, Paramount Pictures bought the film rights to the novel for $750,000. In January 1995, The River Wild director Curtis Hanson was reported to have been in the process of final negotiations with Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures to direct The Alienist. By May 1995, Hanson was signed on as the film's director. Variety reported that the film's producers planned for filming to start in Spring 1995, with an intended Christmas release date in mind. Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang adapted the book for film. Scouts for the film visited Philadelphia in May 1995 to consider location shooting in the city. Film scouts for The Alienist were particularly interested in Philadelphia's Academy of Music, Eastern State Penitentiary, and Waterworks. Paramount Pictures was concerned with the film's budget, which reportedly was almost $50 million. By 1997, multiple script drafts from three writers brought costs to approximately $2 million. After delays in production, Paramount Pictures told the group behind the film they had two months to set the project up at another studio. In a review of Carr's sequel The Angel of Darkness, Malcolm L. Johnson of The Hartford Courant cited concerns over how to depict the mutilation of the murdered prostitutes in the film, writing: \\"Questions about how to treat this gruesome element has perhaps delayed the film of The Alienist.\\" When in a 1999 online chat with fans, set up by Time and Yahoo!, Carr was asked if there were film plans for The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness, he responded: \\"Only 'The Alienist,' and the attempts have been so bad that I have not yet sold 'Angel' to the movies. What happened was that a producer bought the rights and then decided he had to completely change the characters in the book. We got into a huge conflict, one that is actually ongoing.\\" TV series In April 2015, Deadline Hollywood reported that Paramount Television had decided to use a three-year, first-look production deal they made with Anonymous Content productions to adapt The Alienist as an event TV series. Jakob Verbruggen was chosen to serve as director after Cary Fukunaga had to withdraw.

Painting by Anders Zorn. A homburg is a semi-formal hat of fur felt, characterized by a single dent running down the centre of the crown (called a \\"gutter crown\\"), a wide silk grosgrain hatband ribbon, a flat brim shaped in a \\"pencil curl\\", and a ribbon-bound trim about the edge of the brim. It is traditionally offered in black or grey. The name comes from Bad Homburg in Hesse, German Empire, from where it originated as hunting headgear. It was popularised in the late 19th century by the future King Edward VII as a less formal alternative to the prevalent top hat along with the bowler hat and the boater hat. The original homburg conceived in the 19th century was of slightly more generous proportions than seen in 21st-century versions. Although the homburg is traditionally associated with semi-formal wear, it has been extensively applied also to informal attire. As with other hats, it largely fell out of everyday use of Western dress codes for men in the 1960s. Use The Homburg was popularised in the 1890s by the future Edward VII after he visited Bad Homburg in Hesse, Germany, and brought back a hat of this style. He was flattered when his hat style was mimicked, and at times he insisted on being copied. Anthony Eden made the black homburg so fashionable in the 1930s that it became known as \\"the Anthony Eden hat\\" on Savile Row in London. At his 1953 inauguration, Dwight D. Eisenhower broke with tradition by wearing a black homburg instead of a top hat. He also wore a homburg at his second inauguration, a hat that took three months to craft and was dubbed the \\"international homburg\\" by hatters, since workers from ten countries participated in its making. Like other formal Western male headgear, the homburg ceased to be as common in the 21st century as it once was. Al Pacino gained some renewed fame for the homburg by wearing a grey one in the film The Godfather, for which reason the hat is sometimes called a \\"Godfather\\". Some Orthodox Jewish rabbis wear black homburgs to the rekel, though this practice is also in decline. The homburg was always considered to be more traditional and distinguished than the fedora.

This followed the French invasion in 1635 and its conquest of the people on the Caribbean island that made it part of the French West Indies. History The Carib people had migrated from the mainland to the islands about 1200 AD according to carbon dating of artifacts.Sweeney, James L. (2007). \\"Caribs, Maroons, Jacobins, Brigands, and Sugar Barons: The Last Stand of the Black Caribs on St. Vincent\\", African Diaspora Archaeology Network, March 2007, retrieved 26 April 2007 In 1635 the Carib were overwhelmed by French forces led by the adventurer Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and his nephew Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who imposed French colonial rule on the indigenous Carib peoples. Cardinal Richelieu of France gave the island to the Saint Christophe Company, in which he was a shareholder. Later the company was reorganized as the Company of the American Islands. The French colonists imposed French Law on the conquered inhabitants, and Jesuit missionaries arrived to convert them to the Roman Catholic Church.\\"Institutional History of Martinique\\" , Martinique Official site, French Government (translation by Maryanne Dassonville). Retrieved 26 April 2007 Because the Carib people resisted working as laborers to build and maintain the sugar and cocoa plantations which the French began to develop in the Caribbean, in 1636 King Louis XIII proclaimed La Traite des Noirs. This authorized the capture or purchase of slaves from Africa, who were then transported as labor to Martinique and other parts of the French West Indies. In 1650, the Company liquidated and sold Martinique to Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who became governor until his death in 1658. His widow then took control of the island for France. As more French colonists arrived, they were attracted to the fertile area known as Cabesterre (leeward side). The French had pushed the remaining Carib people to this northeastern coast and the Caravalle Peninsula, but the colonists wanted the additional land. The Jesuits and Dominicans agreed that whichever order arrived there first, would get all future parishes in that part of the island. The Jesuits came by sea and the Dominicans by land, with the Dominicans' ultimately prevailing. When the Carib revolted against French rule in 1660, the Governor Charles Houel sieur de Petit Pr√© retaliated with war against them. Many were killed; those who survived were taken captive and expelled from the island. On Martinique, the French colonists signed a peace treaty with the few remaining Carib. Some Carib had fled to Dominica or St. Vincent, where the French agreed to leave them at peace. However, following the British conquest of these islands, the Caribs would eventually be expelled to Central America after losing the Second Carib War.

It is one of the methods by which parties to a contract may terminate their agreement. The release is completed by the transfer of valuable consideration that must not be the actual performance of the obligation itself. The accord is the agreement to discharge the obligation and the satisfaction is the legal \\"consideration\\" which binds the parties to the agreement. A valid accord does not discharge the prior contract; instead it suspends the right to enforce it in accordance with the terms of the accord contract, in which satisfaction, or performance of the contract will discharge both contracts (the original and the accord). If the creditor breaches the accord, then the debtor will be able to bring up the existence of the accord in order to enjoin any action against him. If a person is sued over an alleged debt, that person bears the burden of proving the affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction. Illustration Accord and satisfaction is a settlement of an unliquidated debt. For example, a builder is contracted to build a homeowner a garage for $35,000. The contract called for $17,500 prior to starting construction, to disburse $10,000 during various stages of construction, and to make a final payment of $7,500 at completion. At completion, the homeowner complained about inferior work quality and refused to make the final payment. After a mutual settlement agreement, the builder accepted $4,000 as full payment. Thereby, a new contract was formed by offer, acceptance, and consideration. The consideration is that for a $3,500 savings, the homeowner gives up that which he is entitled, a well-constructed garage. The builder gives up his right to full price to avoid suit for inferior performance. When accord and satisfaction has occurred, the homeowner has given up his right to sue for inferior performance, and the builder has given up his right to sue for the full $7,500 due under the original contract. Another example would be where a lender agrees to lend $100,000 at 5.0% interest for 30 years, and at the closing the loan documents are all drawn up for a loan with a 6.0% interest rate. If the lender agrees to reduce the closing costs by an extra $1000 and the borrowers agree, then there has been an accord and satisfaction. If the borrowers later sue for breach of contract, the settlement (offer and acceptance of the $1000) constitutes an accord and satisfaction and is a valid defense to the borrower's lawsuit. The accord agreement must be transacted on a new agreement. It must therefore have the essential terms of a contract, (parties, subject matter, time for performance, and consideration). If there is a breach of the accord there will be no \\"satisfaction\\" which will give rise to a breach of accord. In this instance the non-offending party has the right to sue under either the original contract or the accord agreement. Consideration In an accord contract it is typical that the consideration supplied is less than bargained for in the original contract. In accord contracts that require an amount of consideration that is less than the original, the consideration must be of a different type, e.g. instead of money, debtor offers a car or a boat.

Colors show the quantum phase of the highly excited electron. Figure 2: Energy levels in atomic lithium showing the Rydberg series of the lowest 3 values of orbital angular momentum converging on the first ionization energy. A Rydberg atom is an excited atom with one or more electrons that have a very high principal quantum number, n. The higher the value of n, the farther the electron is from the nucleus, on average. Rydberg atoms have a number of peculiar properties including an exaggerated response to electric and magnetic fields, long decay periods and electron wavefunctions that approximate, under some conditions, classical orbits of electrons about the nuclei. The core electrons shield the outer electron from the electric field of the nucleus such that, from a distance, the electric potential looks identical to that experienced by the electron in a hydrogen atom. In spite of its shortcomings, the Bohr model of the atom is useful in explaining these properties. Classically, an electron in a circular orbit of radius r, about a hydrogen nucleus of charge +e, obeys Newton's second law: : \\\\mathbf{F}=m\\\\mathbf{a} \\\\Rightarrow { ke^2 \\\\over r^2}={mv^2 \\\\over r} where k = 1/(4œÄŒµ0). Orbital momentum is quantized in units of ƒß: : mvr=n\\\\hbar . Combining these two equations leads to Bohr's expression for the orbital radius in terms of the principal quantum number, n: : r={n^2\\\\hbar^2 \\\\over ke^2m}. It is now apparent why Rydberg atoms have such peculiar properties: the radius of the orbit scales as n2 (the n = 137 state of hydrogen has an atomic radius ~1 ¬µm) and the geometric cross-section as n4. Thus Rydberg atoms are extremely large with loosely bound valence electrons, easily perturbed or ionized by collisions or external fields. Because the binding energy of a Rydberg electron is proportional to 1/r and hence falls off like 1/n2, the energy level spacing falls off like 1/n3 leading to ever more closely spaced levels converging on the first ionization energy. These closely spaced Rydberg states form what is commonly referred to as the Rydberg series. Figure 2 shows some of the energy levels of the lowest three values of orbital angular momentum in lithium.  History  The existence of the Rydberg series was first demonstrated in 1885 when Johann Balmer discovered a simple empirical formula for the wavelengths of light associated with transitions in atomic hydrogen. Three years later, the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg presented a generalized and more intuitive version of Balmer's formula that came to be known as the Rydberg formula. This formula indicated the existence of an infinite series of ever more closely spaced discrete energy levels converging on a finite limit. This series was qualitatively explained in 1913 by Niels Bohr with his semiclassical model of the hydrogen atom in which quantized values of angular momentum lead to the observed discrete energy levels. A full quantitative derivation of the observed spectrum was derived by Wolfgang Pauli in 1926 following development of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg and others.  Methods of production  The only truly stable state of a hydrogen-like atom is the ground state with n = 1. The study of Rydberg states requires a reliable technique for exciting ground state atoms to states with a large value of n.  Electron impact excitation  Much early experimental work on Rydberg atoms relied on the use of collimated beams of fast electrons incident on ground-state atoms. Inelastic scattering processes can use the electron kinetic energy to increase the atoms' internal energy exciting to a broad range of different states including many high-lying Rydberg states, : e^- + A \\\\rarr A^* + e^- . Because the electron can retain any arbitrary amount of its initial kinetic energy, this process always results in a population with a broad spread of different energies.  Charge exchange excitation  Another mainstay of early Rydberg atom experiments relied on charge exchange between a beam of ions and a population of neutral atoms of another species, resulting in the formation of a beam of highly excited atoms, : A^+ + B \\\\rarr A^* + B^+ . Again, because the kinetic energy of the interaction can contribute to the final internal energies of the constituents, this technique populates a broad range of energy levels.  Optical excitation  The arrival of tunable dye lasers in the 1970s allowed a much greater level of control over populations of excited atoms. In optical excitation, the incident photon is absorbed by the target atom, absolutely specifying the final state energy. The problem of producing single state, mono-energetic populations of Rydberg atoms thus becomes the somewhat simpler problem of precisely controlling the frequency of the laser output, : A + \\\\gamma \\\\rarr A^*. This form of direct optical excitation is generally limited to experiments with the alkali metals, because the ground state binding energy in other species is generally too high to be accessible with most laser systems. For atoms with a large valence electron binding energy (equivalent to a large first ionization energy), the excited states of the Rydberg series are inaccessible with conventional laser systems. Initial collisional excitation can make up the energy shortfall allowing optical excitation to be used to select the final state. Although the initial step excites to a broad range of intermediate states, the precision inherent in the optical excitation process means that the laser light only interacts with a specific subset of atoms in a particular state, exciting to the chosen final state.  Hydrogenic potential  Figure 3. A comparison of the potential in a hydrogen atom with that in a Rydberg state of a different atom. A large core polarizability has been used in order to make the effect clear. The black curve is the Coulombic 1/r potential of the hydrogen atom while the dashed red curve includes the 1/r4 term due to polarization of the ion core. An atom in a Rydberg state has a valence electron in a large orbit far from the ion core; in such an orbit, the outermost electron feels an almost hydrogenic, Coulomb potential, UC from a compact ion core consisting of a nucleus with Z protons and the lower electron shells filled with Z-1 electrons. An electron in the spherically symmetric Coulomb potential has potential energy: :U_\\\\text{C} = -\\\\dfrac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0r}. The similarity of the effective potential ‚Äúseen‚Äù by the outer electron to the hydrogen potential is a defining characteristic of Rydberg states and explains why the electron wavefunctions approximate to classical orbits in the limit of the correspondence principle. In other words, the electron's orbit resembles the orbit of planets inside a solar system, similar to what was seen in the obsolete but visually useful Bohr and Rutherford models of the atom. There are three notable exceptions that can be characterized by the additional term added to the potential energy: *An atom may have two (or more) electrons in highly excited states with comparable orbital radii. In this case, the electron-electron interaction gives rise to a significant deviation from the hydrogen potential. For an atom in a multiple Rydberg state, the additional term, Uee, includes a summation of each pair of highly excited electrons: :U_{ee} = \\\\dfrac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0}\\\\sum_{i < j}\\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j}. *If the valence electron has very low angular momentum (interpreted classically as an extremely eccentric elliptical orbit), then it may pass close enough to polarise the ion core, giving rise to a 1/r4 core polarization term in the potential. The interaction between an induced dipole and the charge that produces it is always attractive so this contribution is always negative, :U_\\\\text{pol} = -\\\\dfrac{e^2\\\\alpha_\\\\text{d}}{(4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0)^2r^4}, :where Œ±d is the dipole polarizability. Figure 3 shows how the polarization term modifies the potential close to the nucleus. *If the outer electron penetrates the inner electron shells, it will ‚Äúsee‚Äù more of the charge of the nucleus and hence experience a greater force. In general, the modification to the potential energy is not simple to calculate and must be based on knowledge of the geometry of the ion core.  Quantum-mechanical details  Figure 4. Semiclassical orbits for n=5 with all allowed values of orbital angular momentum. The black spot denotes the position of the atomic nucleus. Quantum- mechanically, a state with abnormally high n refers to an atom in which the valence electron(s) have been excited into a formerly unpopulated electron orbital with higher energy and lower binding energy. In hydrogen the binding energy is given by: : E_\\\\text{B} = -\\\\dfrac{Ry}{n^2}, where Ry = 13.6 eV is the Rydberg constant. The low binding energy at high values of n explains why Rydberg states are susceptible to ionization. Additional terms in the potential energy expression for a Rydberg state, on top of the hydrogenic Coulomb potential energy require the introduction of a quantum defect, Œ¥l, into the expression for the binding energy: :E_\\\\text{B} = -\\\\dfrac{Ry}{(n-\\\\delta_l)^2}.  Electron wavefunctions  The long lifetimes of Rydberg states with high orbital angular momentum can be explained in terms of the overlapping of wavefunctions. The wavefunction of an electron in a high l state (high angular momentum, ‚Äúcircular orbit‚Äù) has very little overlap with the wavefunctions of the inner electrons and hence remains relatively unperturbed. The three exceptions to the definition of a Rydberg atom as an atom with a hydrogenic potential, have an alternative, quantum mechanical description that can be characterized by the additional term(s) in the atomic Hamiltonian: *If a second electron is excited into a state ni, energetically close to the state of the outer electron no, then its wavefunction becomes almost as large as the first (a double Rydberg state). This occurs as ni approaches no and leads to a condition where the size of the two electron‚Äôs orbits are related; a condition sometimes referred to as radial correlation. An electron-electron repulsion term must be included in the atomic Hamiltonian. *Polarization of the ion core produces an anisotropic potential that causes an angular correlation between the motions of the two outermost electrons. This can be thought of as a tidal locking effect due to a non- spherically symmetric potential. A core polarization term must be included in the atomic Hamiltonian. *The wavefunction of the outer electron in states with low orbital angular momentum l, is periodically localised within the shells of inner electrons and interacts with the full charge of the nucleus. Figure 4 shows a semi-classical interpretation of angular momentum states in an electron orbital, illustrating that low-l states pass closer to the nucleus potentially penetrating the ion core. A core penetration term must be added to the atomic Hamiltonian.  In external fields  The large separation between the electron and ion-core in a Rydberg atom makes possible an extremely large electric dipole moment, d. There is an energy associated with the presence of an electric dipole in an electric field, F, known in atomic physics as a Stark shift, :E_\\\\text{S} = -\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}. Depending on the sign of the projection of the dipole moment onto the local electric field vector, a state may have energy that increases or decreases with field strength (low-field and high-field seeking states respectively). The narrow spacing between adjacent n-levels in the Rydberg series means that states can approach degeneracy even for relatively modest field strengths. The theoretical field strength at which a crossing would occur assuming no coupling between the states is given by the Inglis‚ÄìTeller limit, :F_\\\\text{IT} = \\\\dfrac{e}{12\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0a_0^2n^5}. In the hydrogen atom, the pure 1/r Coulomb potential does not couple Stark states from adjacent n-manifolds resulting in real crossings as shown in figure 5. The presence of additional terms in the potential energy can lead to coupling resulting in avoided crossings as shown for lithium in figure 6.  Applications and further research = Precision measurements of trapped Rydberg atoms  The radiative decay lifetimes of atoms in metastable states to the ground state are important to understanding astrophysics observations and tests of the standard model.  Investigating diamagnetic effects  The large sizes and low binding energies of Rydberg atoms lead to a high magnetic susceptibility, \\\\chi. As diamagnetic effects scale with the area of the orbit and the area is proportional to the radius squared (A ‚àù n4), effects impossible to detect in ground state atoms become obvious in Rydberg atoms, which demonstrate very large diamagnetic shifts. Rydberg atoms exhibit strong electric-dipole coupling of the atoms to electromagnetic fields and has been used to detect radio communications.  In plasmas  Rydberg atoms form commonly in plasmas due to the recombination of electrons and positive ions; low energy recombination results in fairly stable Rydberg atoms, while recombination of electrons and positive ions with high kinetic energy often form autoionising Rydberg states. Rydberg atoms‚Äô large sizes and susceptibility to perturbation and ionisation by electric and magnetic fields, are an important factor determining the properties of plasmas. Condensation of Rydberg atoms forms Rydberg matter, most often observed in form of long-lived clusters. The de-excitation is significantly impeded in Rydberg matter by exchange-correlation effects in the non-uniform electron liquid formed on condensation by the collective valence electrons, which causes extended lifetime of clusters.  In astrophysics  It has been suggested that Rydberg atoms are common in interstellar space and could be observed from earth. Since the density within interstellar gas clouds is many orders of magnitude lower than the best laboratory vacuums attainable on Earth, Rydberg states could persist for long periods of time without being destroyed by collisions.  Strongly interacting systems  Due to their large size, Rydberg atoms can exhibit very large electric dipole moments. Calculations using perturbation theory show that this results in strong interactions between two close Rydberg atoms. Coherent control of these interactions combined with their relatively long lifetime makes them a suitable candidate to realize a quantum computer. In 2010 two-qubit gates were achieved experimentally. Strongly interacting Rydberg atoms also feature quantum critical behavior, which makes them interesting to study on their own.  Current research directions  Since 2000's Rydberg atoms research encompasses broadly three directions: sensing, quantum optics and quantum simulation . High electric dipole moments between Rydberg atomic states are used for radiofrequency and terahertz sensing and imaging, including non- demolition measurements of individual microwave photons. Electromagnetically induced transparency was used in combination with strong interactions between two atoms excited in Rydberg state to provide medium that exhibits strongly nonlinear behaviour at the level of individual optical photons . The tuneable interaction between Rydberg states, enabled also first quantum simulation experiments. In October 2018, the United States Army Research Laboratory publicly discussed efforts to develop a super wideband radio receiver using Rydberg atoms.Army researchers make giant leap in quantum sensing, United States Army Research Laboratory, 2018-10-25 In March 2020, the laboratory announced that its scientists analysed the Rydberg sensor's sensitivity to oscillating electric fields over an enormous range of frequencies‚Äîfrom 0 to 10^12 Hertz (the spectrum to 0.3mm wavelength). The Rydberg sensor can reliably detect signals over the entire spectrum and compare favourably with other established electric field sensor technologies, such as electro-optic crystals and dipole antenna-coupled passive electronics.Scientists create quantum sensor that covers entire radio frequency spectrum, Phys.org/United States Army Research Laboratory, 2020-03-19  Classical simulation  Figure 7. Stark - Coulomb potential for a Rydberg atom in a static electric field. An electron in such a potential feels a torque that can change its angular momentum. Figure 8. Trajectory of the electron in a hydrogen atom in an electric field E = -3 x 106 V/m in the x-direction. Note that classically all values of angular momentum are allowed; figure 4 shows the particular orbits associated with quantum mechanically allowed values. See the animation. A simple 1/r potential results in a closed Keplerian elliptical orbit. In the presence of an external electric field Rydberg atoms can obtain very large electric dipole moments making them extremely susceptible to perturbation by the field. Figure 7 shows how application of an external electric field (known in atomic physics as a Stark field) changes the geometry of the potential, dramatically changing the behaviour of the electron. A Coulombic potential does not apply any torque as the force is always antiparallel to the position vector (always pointing along a line running between the electron and the nucleus): :\\\\mathbf{\\\\tau}=\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\sin\\\\theta , :\\\\theta=\\\\pi \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mathbf{\\\\tau}=0 . With the application of a static electric field, the electron feels a continuously changing torque. The resulting trajectory becomes progressively more distorted over time, eventually going through the full range of angular momentum from L = LMAX, to a straight line L=0, to the initial orbit in the opposite sense L = -LMAX. The time period of the oscillation in angular momentum (the time to complete the trajectory in figure 8), almost exactly matches the quantum mechanically predicted period for the wavefunction to return to its initial state, demonstrating the classical nature of the Rydberg atom.

A part of the Baj√≠o region, the city lies from Mexico City, 86 km (53 mi) from Quer√©taro, and from the state capital of Guanajuato. The city's name derives from two persons: 16th-century friar Juan de San Miguel, and a martyr of Mexican Independence, Ignacio Allende, who was born in a house facing the city's central plaza. San Miguel de Allende was also a critical epicenter during the historic Chichimeca War (1540‚Äì1590) where the Chichimeca Confederation defeated the Spanish Empire in the initial colonization war. Today, an old section of the town is part of a proclaimed World Heritage Site, attracting thousands of tourists and new residents from abroad every year. At the beginning of the 20th century, the town was in danger of becoming a ghost town after an influenza pandemic. Gradually, its Baroque/Neoclassical colonial structures were \\"discovered\\" by foreign artists who moved in and began art and cultural institutes such as the Instituto Allende and the Escuela de Bellas Artes. This gave the town a reputation, attracting artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, who taught painting. This attracted foreign art students, especially former U.S. soldiers studying on the G.I. Bill after the Second World War. Since then, the town has attracted a significant number of foreign retirees, artists, writers and tourists, which has shifted the area's economy from agriculture and industry to commerce catering to outside visitors and residents. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the Protective town of San Miguel and the Sanctuary of Jes√∫s Nazareno de Atotonilco as a World Heritage Site in 2008. The area of designation includes part of the town San Miguel de Allende and part of the town of Atotonilco, which are about 14 kilometers apart. The World Heritage Site is highlighted by a core zone of 43 hectares in San Miguel de Allende's well-preserved historic center, filled with buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries. The other part of the World Heritage Site fourteen kilometers north, at the Sanctuary of Atotonilco, has a core zone of .75 hectares surrounded by a buffer zone of about 4.5 hectares.  History =Founding of the city Before the arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century, San Miguel was an indigenous Chichimeca village called Izcuinapan. Then a small chapel was built near Izcuinapan by Juan de San Miguel. He decided to dedicate the Spanish town to the Archangel Michael. However, Spanish colonization and attempts to enslave women, men, and children to work the silver mines quickly created a hostile environment with the Chichimeca Confederation natives. The Chichimecas began defending their ancestral lands against invasion by Spanish soldiers and colonizers. In 1551, the Guamare people of the Chichimeca Confederation attacked Spanish military posts and settlements. This overt hostility, along with multiple failed attempts by the Spanish to provide water to their own settlements in the area, caused the original location to be pushed out. The village was officially re-established in 1555 by Juan de San Miguel's successor, Bernardo Cossin, and indigenous leader Fernando de Tapia. It was refounded both as a mission and as a military outpost. The new site was a mile east of the old one at a place with two fresh water springs (called Bat√°n and Izcuinapan) and with terrain better suited for defense. The two springs supplied all of the town's water until the 1970s. Colonial period The House of the Counts of the Canal, built in the 18th century and currently owned by Banamex. By the mid-16th century, silver had been discovered in Guanajuato and Zacatecas, and a major road between this area and Mexico City passed through San Miguel. Indigenous attacks on caravans continued and San Miguel became an important military and commercial site. This led to the forty-year Chichimeca War. The viceroy in Mexico City granted lands and cattle to a number of Spaniards to motivate them to settle the area. He also gave indigenous groups limited self-rule and excused them from taxation. The location of the town would make it a melting pot as Spanish, indigenous peoples, and later criollos exchanged cultural influences. Eventually, major roads would connect the town with the mining communities in San Luis Potos√≠, Zacatecas, and the rest of the state of Guanajuato. Serving travelers' needs and providing supplies to mining camps made the town rich. Textile manufacture was a major industry in the town. Locals claim that the serape was invented here. By the mid-18th century the city was at its height, and this was when most of its large mansions, palaces, and religious buildings were constructed. Most still remain. The town was also home to the area's wealthy hacienda owners. At that time, it was one of the most important and prosperous settlements in New Spain with a population reaching 30,000. By comparison, in the mid-18th century Boston had a population of only 16,000 and New York 25,000. The town's apogee came during the transition period between Baroque and Neoclassical architecture, and many of the mansions and churches show both influences. Mansions built in San Miguel are larger than normal for a settlement of its size. Independence Statues of Allende and Hidalgo in the municipal palace The prominence of the city declined at the beginning of the 19th century, mostly due to the Mexican War of Independence. However, it played an important early role in this conflict. It is the birthplace of two significant figures of the war, Juan Aldama and Ignacio Allende. Both were involved in a conspiracy against the colonial government in Mexico City, along with Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and Josefa Ortiz de Dom√≠nguez. When this conspiracy was discovered, the warning to Hidalgo and Allende passed through this town and onto Dolores (Hidalgo), just to the north. This prompted Hidalgo's \\"Grito de Dolores\\" assembling the insurgent army on 15 and 16 September 1810. The new insurgent army first came to San Miguel, stopping at a religious sanctuary in Atotonilco just outside. Hidalgo took a standard bearing an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe from here; this standard is now in the Museo del Ejercito in Spain. Then the army entered San Miguel proper, to name officers and to free prisoners in the local jail. San Miguel was the first Mexican town to gain its independence from Spain. While there was no further military action in the immediate area, economically the town waned as agriculture suffered and the population declined. This continued for most of the rest of the 19th century as the country was torn between Liberal and Conservative factions vying for power. After the war, the town was declared a city by the state congress in 1826 and its name was modified to San Miguel de Allende in honor of Ignacio Allende. There was some economic recovery near the end of the 19th century during the rule of Porfirio D√≠az. During this time, dams, aqueducts and railroads were built. Agriculture made a comeback with the introduction of fruit orchards. However, decline returned with the end of mining in almost all of the state of Guanajuato. Between this and the beginning of the Mexican Revolution, San Miguel almost became a ghost town. What remained was preserved as the new Mexican government, under the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH), declared San Miguel a \\"Historic and Protected Town\\" in 1926, establishing guidelines and restrictions aimed at keeping its colonial appearance. Historian Lisa Pinley Covert denies that such an event occurred in 1926, yet acknowledges that a federal law of 1926 nationalized many Catholic properties in the city, even if historic preservation had not been the motivation.Covert (2017), pp. 1314. 20th century to the present Angela Peralta Theater, built in the early 20th century American artist and writer Stirling Dickinson arrived in 1937 and should be credited with creating the first wave of advertising abroad about San Miguel's virtues. Dickinson met Peruvian intellectual, author and painter, Felipe Cossio del Pomar who had the idea of establishing an art colony in the heart of Mexico. The first art school was established in 1938 in an old convent‚Äîstill in use provisionally as a school, after having been soldiers' barracks‚Äîwhich Cossio del Pomar secured from then Mexican president L√°zaro C√°rdenas. The school was called Bellas Artes, and continues to exist today, locally known as Bellas Artes or Centro Cultural El Nigromante. In the 1940s, Dickinson would also assist Cossio del Pomar and Enrique Fern√°ndez Martinez, the former governor of the state of Guanajuato, to establish what became the Instituto Allende. Despite their rural location, both schools would find success after the World War II. U.S. veterans studying under the G.I. Bill were permitted to study abroad, and these schools took advantage of that fact to attract former soldiers as students. Enrollment at the schools rose and this began the town's cultural reputation. This attracted more artists and writers, including Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado and David Alfaro Siqueiros, who taught painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. This, in turn, spurred the opening of hotels, shops and restaurants to cater to the new visitors and residents. Many of the American veterans who came to study in San Miguel would later come back to retire, some marrying and raising international families such as the Vidargas, Andre, Maxwell, and Breck families. The town's cultural, foreign and cosmopolitan nature has continued since that time. The city took on a Bohemian quality starting in the 1950s with the party ambiance of many resident expats and artists. In the 1960s, Cantinflas promoted the area among his friends in the film industry. Hippies were taken in for haircuts by the authorities in the 1970s, and now the town is generally too expensive for the backpacking travelers of the 21st century. The growing attraction of the town and its colonial buildings created a vibrant real estate market, which until recently has not been affected by Mexico's fluctuating economy. Many of the old \\"ruins\\" of colonial houses have been sold for more than a house in Mexico City. The city and nearby sanctuary were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2008. It was chosen both for its well-preserved Baroque colonial architecture and layout and for its historic role in the Mexican War of Independence. The area that has been inscribed includes 64 blocks of the historic center and the sanctuary of Atotonilco with the title \\"Villa Protectora de San Miguel el Grande y el Santuario de Jesus Nazareno de Atotonilco\\". Demographics View of calle Umaran in the downtown. Gato Negro bar, Mesones street Despite being less than 5% of the total municipal population, foreign residents have considerable cultural and economic impact. Most foreign residents are retirees from the United States, Canada, and Europe attracted by the mild climate, cultural opportunities, and low crime. It is only a ten-hour drive from the U.S. border. Many of the home buyers are from this segment of the population as well. Estimates of foreign residents range from 20,000 to 25,000, with at least half of these from the United States. The large foreign presence has established a number of institutions here, most notably the Biblioteca P√∫blica in the former convent of Santa Ana, which has the second-largest English-language book collection in Mexico and serves as a community center for foreigners. There is also a chapter of the Lion's Club ( 1987). A post of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars is located there, as well as Mexico's only Audubon Society chapter. While the town and municipality have grown since the coming of foreigners in the 1940s, the highest rates of growth occurred between 1980 and 2000, rising from 77,624 to 110,692, or about 43%. However, since that time growth has slowed and as of the 2005 census, the population stood at 139,297. Most of the drop has been due to the fall in birthrates. However, the overall population of the municipality is young: about 40% is under the age of 15, with those between 15 and 64 making up about 54% of the population. While the majority of the population of the municipality of Allende lives in a collection of small rural communities that do not exceed 2,500 people, the largest single population center is the town of San Miguel de Allende, which houses 59,691 people, about 44% of the municipality's population. The next three largest towns each have populations smaller than 3,000 people: Los Rodr√≠guez (2,768), Colonia San Luis Rey (1,850), and Corral de Piedras de Arriba (1,701). These smaller communities are populated by the municipality's indigenous groups, mostly Otomi and Nahuas. The Otomi are the largest group, accounting for just under 38% of the municipal population. The Nahuas follow at about 20%. Other groups include the Mazahua, Huasteca and Pur√©pecha. However, according to the 2002 census, only 520 people speak an indigenous language, 472 of whom also speak Spanish. Catholicism is practised by 96% of the population, with most others being Protestants, among them Evangelicals. The municipality is home to three institutions of higher education, the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico SSC, a campus of the Universidad Tecn√≥logica de Le√≥n, and the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de San Miguel de Allende. The city also has bilingual schools that follow the curriculum of the American educational system. As of 2000, 17.5% of the population is considered to be illiterate, compared to 12.1% for the rest of the state. Landmarks=Historic core zone Hernandez Macias street The historic core zone of San Miguel was defined by the federal government in 1982 and adopted by UNESCO in 2008. This is a 43 hectare area, partly defined by Insurgentes to the north, Quebrada to the west, and Terraplen and Huerta to the south. Two buffer zones totaling about forty hectares are adjacent to the core zone. At the entrance of the city stand the statues of Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama, Miguel Hidalgo and Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez, with one of the Archangel Michael in the center. While the outlying areas of the town and municipality have changed over time, the historic center remains much as it was 250 years ago. The layout of the center of the city is mostly a straight grid, as was favored by the Spanish during colonial times. However, due to the terrain, many roads are not straight. There are no parking meters, no traffic signals and no fast food restaurants. These roads are lined with colonial-era homes and churches. With a few exceptions, the architecture is domestic rather than monumental, with well-tended courtyards and rich architectural details. The houses have solid walls against the sidewalks, painted in various colors, many with bougainvillea vines falling down the outside and the occasional iron-grated window. Many of the larger structures have large entrances that once accommodated horses and carriages. Jard√≠n Allende (Allende Garden) is the town's main plaza, which serves as a venue for music concerts and other cultural activities. The plaza includes formal landscaping and wrought-iron benches throughout, and is a center of social activity in San Miguel. In the historic center, there are an estimated two thousand doors, behind which there are at least two thousand courtyards of various sizes. Many of these have been restored to their former colonial state, with fa√ßades of ochre, orange and yellow, windows and doors framed by handcrafted ironwork and made of hewn wood. The interior roofs are flat, of heavy mortar supported by large beams. Very few structures have atriums or front yards; instead, open private space is behind the main fa√ßade in courtyards. These courtyards are where the private gardens were, protected from dust, excess water and crime. The town is noted for its streetscapes with narrow cobblestone lanes, that rise and fall over the hilly terrain. It is still a small city, and at night, many wander the narrow streets in relative safety. Several publications have named it one of the top 10 places to retire. The town has attracted residents such as Jose Guadalupe Mojica, Pedro Vargas and Cantinflas. Additionally, indigenous Otomis and Nahuas (Chichimecas) can be seen on the streets, as they come from rural communities to trade and attend church. Since the 1920s, steps have been taken to preserve the historic center's charm. The first set of protections was put into place by the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) when it was declared a national monument. This required all restoration and new construction to conform to the area's colonial architecture. To preserve the city's trademark colonial look, a civil society regulates the renovation and maintenance of the city, especially its historic center. This includes aspects such as traffic, garden spaces and the kinds of social events that may be held. The town has also put effort into preserving the cobblestone streets. The most recent designation is that of a World Heritage site, along with the religious sanctuary in nearby Atotonilco, which also puts restrictions and protections into place. About half of the colonial buildings have been partially or fully converted into businesses such as stores, restaurants, galleries, workshops and hotels. Since there is no zoning, residential and commercial establishments are mixed. Although it is small and rural, it has a wide variety of restaurants, specialty shops and art galleries. Around the historic center there are over 80 bars and cantinas as well as various nightclubs. In September 2010, the first contemporary architectural structure arrived in the historic colonial center with the opening of Hotel Matilda. The hotel's four buildings have a modern design, with public areas decorated with the art works of contemporary Latin artists, many of them very large pieces. Only the exterior street wall, along Calle Aldama, reflects the colonial style. The oldest part of the town is the El Chorro neighborhood. This is where the village of San Miguel was moved to in 1555. The Nahuatl name for the area was Izcuinapan or \\"place of dogs\\", and according to legend, dogs led Juan de San Miguel to this area to find this spring. This area is the home of the Parish of San Miguel, the Jardin Principal () and an earlier church called the San Rafael or Santa Escuela Church. La Parroquia, parish church of San Miguel La Parroquia de San Miguel Arc√°ngel, the current parish church of San Miguel, is unique in Mexico and the emblem of the town. It is one of the most- photographed churches in Mexico and the two tall towers of its neo-Gothic fa√ßade can be seen from most parts of town. The church was built in the 17th century with a traditional Mexican fa√ßade. The current Gothic fa√ßade was constructed in 1880 by Zeferino Gutierrez, an indigenous bricklayer and self- taught architect. It is said Gutierrez's inspiration came from postcards and lithographs of Gothic churches in Europe; however, the interpretation is his own and more a work of imagination than a faithful reconstruction. In front of this fa√ßade is a small atrium, which is guarded by a wrought iron fence. There is a monument in the atrium dedicated to Bishop Jos√© Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Diez de Sollano y Davalos. The San Rafael or Santa Escuela Church is located to the side of the parish. It was founded by Luis Felipe Neri de Alfaro in 1742. The main fa√ßade has two levels with arches, pilasters, floral motifs and a frieze on the first level. The second level has a choir window framed by pink sandstone. The bell tower is Moorish. According to legend, this older chapel was the site of the first Christian ceremony in San Miguel. At the entrance of the main church, there is an inscription which states that Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and his brother Jose Joaquin served as priests here. There is another one acknowledging Gutierrez's work on the fa√ßade. The interior of the church still has the original 17th-century layout and interior design, but the church was looted several times during Mexico's history so much of its decoration is lost. However, one significant image here is the \\"Se√±or de la Conquista\\", which was made of cornstalk paste by indigenous people in Michoac√°n. The sacristy contains a painting depicting the founding of the town in 1542 and its subsequent move to Izcuinapan in the El Chorro neighborhood. There is a small crypt under the altar with access through a small door to the right. This crypt contains the remains of former bishops of the church and other dignitaries, including a former president of Mexico. It is opened to the public one day each year, on 2 November, Day of the Dead. In front of the church complex is the Plaza Allende, popularly known as Jardin Principal (), but most often referred to simply as el jardin. It was designed in French style, with wrought iron benches and filled with Indian laurel trees. It is a popular place to sit and relax and bands often play in the kiosk on weekends. In addition to the parish, other important structures, such as the Ignacio Allende House, the Canal House and the municipal palace overlook the garden. Courtyard of the Centro Cultural with the dome of the Church of the Nuns in the background. The Centro Cultural Ignacio Ramirez, also called the Escuela de Bellas Artes or El Nigromante, is housed in the former Hermanas de la Concepci√≥n () convent. The Concepcion convent and adjoining church were founded in 1775 by a member of the De la Canal family, Mar√≠a Josefina Lina de la Canal y Herv√°s. In the latter 19th century, the convent was closed by the Reform Laws and it remained empty until the mid-20th century. The Escuela de Bellas Artes was established in 1938 by Peruvian Felipe Coss√≠o del Pomar and American Stirling Dickinson. This and other art institutions began to attract American exchange students who came to study and live. The cultural center today is part of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) and is often referred to by locals as \\"Bellas Artes\\". It is a two-story cloister surrounded an extremely large courtyard with large streets and a large fountain in the middle. It houses art exhibits, classrooms for drawing, painting, sculpture, lithography, textiles, ceramics, dramatic arts, ballet, regional dance, piano and guitar. One hall of the old convent is dedicated to a mural by David Alfaro Siqueiros along with students from the art school, but it was never finished. The complex has a museum, an auditorium, two art galleries and the Las Musas restaurant. Next to the cultural center is the Inmaculada Concepcion Church, locally known as Las Monjas (). It was originally constructed as part of the convent. The church was constructed between 1755 and 1842 with an elegant cupola added by Zeferino Gutierrez in 1891, inspired by the Les Invalides in Paris. The cupola is octagonal and decorated with Corinthian columns in the lower area and the upper area has a window with a balustrade and statues of saints. Topping the cupola is a lantern window with a statue depicting the Immaculate Conception. Inside, there are paintings by Juan Rodriguez Juarez. Corner of the Allende House with a statue of Ignacio Allende The Casa de Allende (Allende House) museum was the home of Ignacio Allende, who was a principal figure in the early part of the Mexican War of Independence. The structure was built in 1759 with Baroque and Neoclassical elements, located next to the San Miguel parish church. The museum it houses is officially called the Museo Hist√≥rico de San Miguel de Allende, and it is one of many \\"regional museums\\" of Mexico. This kind of museum focuses on the history of the local area from the prehistoric period to the present, especially the area's role in Mexico's national history. The lower floor contains exhibits about the founding of the town, its role in protecting the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Road and more. The upper floor contains exhibits related to Ignacio Allende and some of the rooms are preserved as they looked when he lived there. There are 24 rooms that chronicle the history of the area from the foundation of the town to the Ruta de la Plata (), the genealogy of Ignacio Allende and the Mexican War of Independence. It was remodeled as part of the preparations for Mexico's Bicentennial. The restored museum was re- inaugurated by President Felipe Calderon in 2009. The Casa del Mayorazgo de la Canal dates from the 18th century, constructed by Mariano Loreto de la Canal y Landeta. During the late colonial period, this house was the most important secular building, being home to the De la Canal family, one of the wealthiest in New Spain. The original construction was inspired by French and Italian palaces of the 16th to 18th centuries. The house is considered to be a transitional work between Baroque and Neoclassical, as its fa√ßade was redesigned by Manuel Tols√° in the early 19th century. The fa√ßade is Neoclassical with the coat of arms of the family. The main portal has two levels with an arch and a relief of an eagle on the keystone. The main door is profusely decorated with high reliefs. Today, it houses the Casa de Cultura de Banamex (Banamex Cultural Center), which houses a collection of historic paintings and offers diverse expositions during the year. On the north side of the Jardin Principal is the municipal palace. It was first constructed in 1736 and called the Casa Consistorial. However, this building was heavily damaged several times since then and little of the original structure remains. The current building has two floors. It is home to what is considered to be the first \\"independent\\" or modern municipal government formed after the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. This reestablishment of the city government under Liberal principles was done by Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende and Ignacio Aldama on 17 September 1810. Very close to the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salud and Oratorios de San Felipe Neri churches is the Plaza Civica or Civic Plaza. This plaza was originally constructed in 1555 and was supposed to be the original center of the town. It is next to the Plaza de la Soledad and served as the main marketplace. Today, it has an equestrian statue of Ignacio Allende that dominates it. Church in San Miguel de Allende. The San Francisco Church was begun in 1778 and was finished more than twenty years later, when architectural styles were changing. The fa√ßade is pure Churrigueresque with stone figures and fine columns. The later bell tower was constructed in 1799 in Neoclassical style by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras. The Biblioteca P√∫blica () serves as the community center for San Miguel's large foreigner population. This library was established by Helen Wale, a Canadian, who wanted to reach out to local children. It is the largest privately funded, publicly accessible library in Mexico with the second- largest English-language book collection. The library has a caf√©, sponsors tours and prints a bilingual newspaper. While self-supporting, it also sponsors educational programs for local youth including scholarships, donations of school supplies and free English and computer classes for children. Its \\"Club de Amigos\\" promotes friendship between Mexicans and foreigners. To the far south of the historic center is Parque Ju√°rez (Juarez Park). This park was established at the beginning of the 20th century on the banks of a river in French style with fountains, decorative pools, wrought iron benches, old bridges and footpaths. There is an area for children with playground and basketball. The garden area is filled with plants and trees of the region, chirimoyos, various berries and walnuts. The water areas host a large number of herons. After dark on many days, it is possible to catch an impromptu concert by local amateur musicians. Nearby there is a small commercial center on Zacateros Street where typical of the area such as objects made of brass and glass can be found. Near here there is a fountain dedicated to Ignacio Allende. Entrance to the Mercado de Artesanias Another important market is the Mercado de Artesanias, which sells a wide variety of items such as those made from wool, brass, paper mache and blown glass, tin and silver. One figure that features prominently on merchandise is that of a frog, as the state's name of Guanajuato means \\"place of frogs\\". The market is located in a narrow alley filling three blocks behind the city's main fruit and vegetable market. The merchandise here is more authentic and cheaper than that found around the main square. The Institute Allende is located in an enormous complex, which the De la Canal family built as a retreat and hacienda. The old house is filled with various courtyards, a private chapel with colonial-era frescos, modern art gallery and restaurant. In 1951, it was converted into an art institute, offering courses in silverwork, ceramic and Spanish, and attracting hundreds of students each year. Other important churches in the town include the Santo Domingo church, the Santa Cruz del Chorro Chapel, Tercera Orden Church and the San Juan de Dios Church. The Santo Domingo church was part of a monastery complex. The church has a sober fa√ßade and dates from 1737. The Santa Cruz del Chorro Chapel is one of the oldest religious buildings. The Tercera Orden Church dates from the beginning of the 17th century. The San Juan de Dios Church and San Rafael Hospital are attributed to Juan Manuel de Villegas in 1770. The complex has a main portal in sandstone with two auxiliary portals. The first has an access arch and a door made of mesquite wood, with reliefs of geometric shapes and fish, along with a hand with pomegranate in sandstone. These symbolize the Archangel Raphael and John of God. Recent research establishes the founding of San Juan de Dios complex in 1546 per maps from the Royal Library in Seville, Spain. The royal cartographers did not understand the native Mexican mapmaking methods and they had been forgotten in storage for centuries until they were brought to Mexico and San Miguel de Allende's exhibition at the Centro Cultural Los Arcos. The Camino Real ( is the theme of the maps, San Juan de Dios being its port-of-entry into San Miguel de Allende. The Casa de Inquisidor () is located between Hernandez Macias and Hospicio streets. It was built in 1780 with an elaborate French fa√ßade and was the seat of the inquisition in the late 18th century. The Angela Peralta Theater was originally designed to host opera. It was inaugurated in 1873 with a performance by the most-prominent soprano of Mexico at that time, Angela Peralta. It continues to host a variety of musical events such as the Jazz Festival and the Chamber Music Festival. Other cultural venues include the Otra Cara de Mexico, the bullring, the old train station now restored with a native market on Sundays, the casa de Marqu√©s de Jaral de Berrio, the Casa de los Condes de Loja and the Museo de la Esquina‚Äîfor traditional toys with a collection that comes from all parts of the Mexican Republic, which was gathered over 50 years' time‚Äîand Museo Interactiveo Fragua de la Independencia. La Otra Cara de Mexico (The Other Face of Mexico) is a small private museum sponsored by Bill Levasseuro, which has a large number of masks from Mexico's traditional cultures. On Calle de Recreo is the bullring that was constructed at the end of the 19th century. The old train station was part of the Mexico City‚ÄìLaredo (Tamaulipas) line of the Ferrocarril Nacional Mexicano. This line was constructed in the 1880s with service beginning in 1888. The Casa del Marqu√©s de Jaral de Berrio was constructed at the end of the 17th century as well as the Casa de los Condes de Loja. The Museo Interactivo Fragua de la Independencia (Fire of Independence Interactive Museum) is dedicated to the Mexican War of Independence and San Miguel's role in it. Outside the core zone Main portal of the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salud Church The Oratorio de San Felipe Neri Church was built by Juan Antonio Perez Espinosa in 1712. This church was partially built by incorporating a former chapel used by the mulatto population of the town. That church became the chapel on the east side. The fa√ßade is of pink sandstone in Baroque style with profuse vegetative ornamentation. The decorative work of the portal also contains indigenous influences. The interior of the church has a number of paintings by Miguel Cabrera, including one of the Virgin of Guadalupe signed by him. The sacristy contains this last painting along with others depicting the life of Philip Neri. This room is cordoned off by a grate covered with leather from C√≥rdoba, Spain. At the back there is a Baroque chamber/chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Loreto. This chapel was sponsored by Manuel Tom√°s de la Canal in 1735. It is richly decorated with three altars covered in gold leaf and is a replica of the Basilica della Santa Casa () of Loreto, Italy. The Nuestra Se√±ora de la Salud Church was built by Luis Felipe Neri in the 18th century. The main portal is in Churrigueresque (Spanish Baroque) style with two levels and a crest in the shape of a large seashell. The first level has an arch flanked by pilasters and niches with sculptures of the Sacred Heart and John the Evangelist. The interior has a layout of a Latin cross covered with vaults with side walls covered in oil paintings done by Agapito Ping between 1721 and 1785. One altar contains an image of Christ, the Good Shepherd, defending his sheep from various dangers including a group of unicorns. The church served as the chapel of the Colegio de San Francisco de Sales next door. The Colegio de San Francisco de Sales was as important as the college of San Ildefonso in Mexico City in the 18th century. Both Ignacio Aldama and Ignacio Allende attended school here. Geography The city San Miguel de Allende is in the state of Guanajuato, and lies 74 miles east of Guanajuato, Guanajuato. It is centrally located within the municipality of San Miguel de Allende, forty miles northwest of Queretaro and 179 miles northwest of Mexico City. The city is located at a nexus of four arroyos: El Atascadero, Las Cachinches, La Ca√±adita, and El Obraje. The last of these, El Obraje, collects in a dam of the same name. Several dams are employed in the municipality to control the floor of rivers and manage the water supply. The most of important of these is the Ignacio Allende Dam. Climate Former Mayor of San Miguel de Allende, Luz Mar√≠a N√∫√±ez Flores (spring 2012) Culture Entrance to a crafts store in the historic center of the town Foreign influence According to biographer John Virtue, \\"Stirling Dickinson is without doubt the person most responsible for San Miguel de Allende becoming an international art center\\". Although only an amateur painter himself, Dickinson became co-founder and director of the Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes, an art institute that he opened in a former convent only a few months after his arrival.Smithsonian Magazine, December 2010 Due to its growth as a tourist destination, some of the most obvious culture seen on the streets of the town relates to visitors, both foreign and Mexican. To cater to these visitors, the town contains cafes, boutiques, art galleries, upscale restaurants and hotels, and a wide variety of bars and nightclubs. Bars and nightclubs range from DJs or loud bands catering to young people, to jazz clubs, sports bars and even those that specialize in traditional Mexican music such as mariachi. Some were founded by foreigners and reflect that ownership, for example the Berlin Bar & Bistro.Berlin Bar & Bistro Just outside Centro, the avant-garde 'black box', Shelter Theater offers Open Mic, live concerts, films and intimate theater shows, mostly in English. Shops around the Jardin Principal sell art, handcrafts, furniture and decorative items. The Fabrica La Aurora is an old textile mill that has been converted into galleries and shops selling art, furnishings and antiques; it has a lot of open space along with a caf√© and restaurant. San Miguel has several schools for learning Spanish, most catering to foreign visitors. These include the Instituto Allende (with credits transferable to U.S. or Canadian colleges), Language Point and Warren Hardy Spanish. Some universities such as the University of Texas-Pan American offer study abroad programs in the city, not only in Spanish but also in arts and literature, and creative writing. Festivals Youths with bulls at the Sanmiguelada Fiesta de San Miguel Arc√°ngel. Desfile de los Locos Many of the festivals here are purely Mexican, combining social activity with religious expression. Throughout the year there are pilgrimages, all-night vigils, ringing church bells, processions and fireworks. The largest celebration of the year is that of the town's patron saint, the Archangel Michael. The angel's feast day is 29 September, but festivities take place for an entire week. Activities include private parties, sporting events, cultural events, indigenous dance and more. The week is popularly called the Fiestas de San Miguel de Allende. The finale is a procession of the actual image of St. Michael usually high on the main altar of La Paroquia, and he is taken on a flower-covered dais to \\"visit\\" the main churches in the historic district. Fireworks are a part of all festivities. Elaborate structures that spin and light in sequence, called \\"castillos\\"‚Äîcastles‚Äîare installed in the esplanade at the Jard√≠n, and sometimes at other churches in town. Holy Week begins with an exhibition of altars dedicated to the Virgin of Sorrows and end with the Procession of Silence. Prior to the Procession of Silence, there is a reenactment of the judgment of Jesus by Pontius Pilate, on one side of the San Miguel Parish. Then the procession begins, which represents the fourteen scenes of the Passion before his crucifixion. Many of the townspeople participate in the event, with children dressed as angels and adults in period clothing carrying statues of Jesus. The procession winds its way along the main streets of the historic center completely in silence. Another large religious celebration is the feast of Nuestro Se√±or de la Columna There are also secular and cultural festivals during the year. The annual Festival de M√∫sica de C√°mara or Chamber Music Festival occurs each year in August in the city's historic center. One of the purposes of the event is to bring this type of music to streets and other public venues as well as traditional concert halls such as the event's home, the Angela Peralta Theater. Other events include the Jornada de Cultura Cubana in March, the Festival de T√¨teres in April, the Festival de Convivencia y Hermandad Universal in May, the Desfile de Locos in June, the Festival Expressiones Cortos in July, the Feria Nacional de Lana y Lat√≥n and the festival de Jazz y Blues in November and the Festival de San Miguel de Allende in December. The most-important political celebration is the reenactment of the \\"Grito de Dolores\\", as the original occurred in the nearby town of Dolores Hidalgo, marking the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. As the birthplace of Ignacio Allende, the town was a focal point of 2010s Bicentennial celebrations, with reenactments of events such as the arrival of the message from Quer√©taro from Josefa Ortiz. Bicentennial celebrations also included events such as the Ballet Mazatl. Festivities were concentrated in and around the Jardin Principal, the Ignacio Allende House and the Centro Cultural. SMART is a multi-media cultural festival, held annually in May, that combines exhibits by Mexican artists with a variety of culinary and social events at local hotels, including the festival founder Hotel Matilda, Dos Casas Hotel and L'Otel. Arts, music and literature View of the room containing the unfinished Siqueiros mural San Miguel de Allende has long had a reputation as a haven for visual artists. In the Spanish colonial period, San Miguel was the largest recipient of funding for the arts. The city was full of rich arts patrons from the start in the 1500s. Rich Spanish families like the Condes de la Canal paid for the sumptuous Chapel of Loreto and employed artists in all aspects including baroque music compositions. A fragment of that musical past is used in the Holy Week music accompanying the celebration of mass around Easter. Religious and secular music continues to be a town focal point, with the English composer and pianist Michael Hoppe performing frequently in San Miguel de Allende. Since the 1950s, when Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros worked there, it has attracted professional and amateur painters, sculptors and printmakers to the classes and workshops frequently held. In addition to two major art institutions (Instituto Allende and Bellas Artes), artists and art venues can be seen in various parts of the town. It is not unusual to see sketch artists working on the street and selling their work. Some notable expat painters associated with San Miguel are Canadians Mai Onno, principal painting professor in the Bellas Artes founding school of the arts, Toller Cranston, Marion Perlet, Gary Slipper, Mack Reynolds, and Andrew Osta. More recently, the town has been attracting writers, film makers, and musicians. The town annually hosts an important free film festival, the GIFF. One annual event that caters to the writing community is The Writers' Conference, which brings together authors, editors and literary agents. The 2009 event attracted names such as Erica Jong, Todd Gitlen and Josephine Humphreys. Writers have lived here since the mid 20th century. Beat poet Neal Cassady died on the railroad tracks just outside town. Other writers who have lived or spent time here include W.D. Snodgrass, Beverly Donofrio, Sandra Gulland, Tony Cohan, Joe Persico, Gary Jennings, Vance Packard, Lynette Seator, Richard Gabrio and Dianna Hutts. Some have written books about the town, such as Elisa Bernick who wrote The Family Sabbatical Handbook: The Budget Guide To Living Abroad With Your Family and Rue who wrote \\"My Favorite Second Chance\\" (Book 2 of The Lake Effect Series). Another writing event is Poetry Week, which began in 1997. Barbara Faith, a well-known author of romance books lived in San Miguel with her husband Alfonso Covarrubias. The biggest writers' conference in Latin America takes place in San Miguel annually, SMWC is celebrating its 14th anniversary in 2018. The San Miguel Poetry Week was founded in 1997 by Jennifer Clement and Barbara Sibley and takes place in early January. Leading poets from Mexico, the US and UK meet for poetry workshops and readings. Film San Miguel began hosting film and television production in the 1940s. Columbia Pictures produced the first Hollywood film to feature the town, filming The Brave Bulls in 1950. Disney set The Littlest Outlaw in San Miguel, and MGM filmed scenes for two westerns, Guns for San Sebastian and Hour of the Gun. Mexican productions included the telenovela Los caudillos and Jose Mojica's Yo pescador. In addition to Mojica, Cantinflas and Anthony Quinn established residences in San Miguel.Covert (2017), pp. 9294. Economy=Tourism and commerce Much of the municipality's economy is tied to the influx of tourists and foreigners who come to live, mostly retirees. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about million at the town's attractions, but those who live here contribute far more to the economy. Most of this is concentrated in the town of San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside. This began in the mid-20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it no longer is. This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the US or Europe. Despite not having a casino or an airport and being from the nearest beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Travel and Leisure and Cond√© Nast Traveler as a preferred place to live and visit. Hotel occupancy typically reaches 80% on weekends with about 50% occupancy on weekdays, when rates can be about half. Most visitors are vacationers and about 60% are domestic visitors, interested in the town's history and role in the Mexican War of Independence. Another attraction for visitors are the two main art/cultural institutions of Instituto Allende and Bellas Artes as well as a number of Spanish-language schools. Most domestic visitors come from Mexico's large urban centers like Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Quer√©taro. This growth has spurred the development of newer hotels, resort and vacation home developments, especially on the corridor between San Miguel and Atotonilco. There are 149 hotels, 9 of which are 5-star. The town has just over 9% of all hotel rooms in the state, and this percentage is growing. Another important sector is restaurants. In 2006, the town invested 800,000 pesos to implement an online marketing plan to increase services to potential tourists. Agriculture Outside of the town of San Miguel, the economy is more traditional. A bit over half of the land is used for grazing with 37% used for crops. Over 80% of the crops are grown during the rainy season with less than 20% grown on irrigated lands. Forestry is minimal. Agriculture produces 25% of the employment in the municipality. Principal crops include corn, beans, wheat, and alfalfa, which account for 84% of harvests. Another important agricultural activity is fruit orchards. The most important livestock is domestic fowl, especially poultry. The municipality raises over 12% of the state's chickens. Another important product is honey, of which the municipality provides 7.5% of the state's total. Since the 1990s, there have been active reforestation efforts to replace much of what was lost previously to logging. Industry Industry is not as well developed here as in other parts of the state although it provides about 33% of the jobs. One important industry is the production of electrical energy. Other industries include metal products, food processing, wood products and mineral processing. The area is known for the crafting of objects from brass and glass. Two notable artisans here are the brothers Marcelino and Abeck Leon Rosa, who produce handmade glass items. They began producing pieces in the courtyard of their home, but today they have a studio with two large workshops and operate a school for glassmakers, which trains about 50 people per year. One of their specialties is Tiffany-style lamps. Since at least the 1950s, San Miguel de Allende is a backdrop for the production of films and television programs. Both Mexican and foreign productions and advertisements have been filmed there. Projects that have been filmed here include Once Upon a Time in Mexico, a television biopic of the Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa, and The Mask of Zorro II. A group of entrepreneurs is working to increase the town's reputation as a film location, opening a privately financed studio complex called The Film Colony. Recently, U.S. television series Royal Pains, Top Chef and Million Dollar Listing have filmed episodes in the town.

It is part of the California Community College system. It is operated by the Antelope Valley Community College District, with a primary service area of covering portions of Los Angeles and Kern counties. Instruction is offered at several sites, including Palmdale and Lancaster, and through online and instructional television courses. The college offers Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degrees in 71 fields as well as certificate programs in 59 vocational areas. The main campus in Lancaster hosts the satellite location of California State University, Bakersfield-Antelope Valley (CSUB-AV), where students can obtain bachelor's and master's degrees in select subjects.  History  The institution began classes on September 10, 1929, as a department of Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster. It was established as Antelope Valley Junior College, providing the first two years of a college education for those living in what was then a remote, rural area. The name was later modified to Antelope Valley College to reflect it comprehensive nature. The average daily attendance at the college was 13 during the 1929‚Äì30 school year. There was little growth in enrollment at the college during the depression years that followed. Alfalfa farmers in Antelope Valley were hard hit during the 1930s, and the smallest junior college in California suffered serious financial difficulties. Teachers took a 20 percent cut in salaries, which ranged from a state-mandated minimum of $1,350 a year to a $1,595 maximum. Average daily attendance (ADA) at the college reached 100 by 1939, but with World War II, attendance plummeted. Attendance reached a low of 13 during the war, the same ADA as the year the school was founded. There were pressures to close the junior college, but trustees and staff held out until veterans returned from the war. Enrollment grew steadily during the postwar years, partly because of the GI Bill of Rights and partly because Antelope Valley began developing an aircraft industry. In 1959, groundbreaking was held for a new college campus on at Avenue K and 30th Street West, designed by the architect Henry L. Gogerty (1894-1990). The college campus has expanded to approximately through land purchases.  Academics  Antelope Valley College has grown to a student population of approximately 16,000. It is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges. Among the many programs offered through the college are an associate degree program in registered nursing approved by the Board of Registered Nursing, an airframe and powerplant technician program certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, and a lower division engineering program that co-ordinates with an engineering degree program offered locally through California State University, Long Beach. Other programs include aircraft fabrication and assembly (including composite materials), computer graphics, respiratory therapy, Firefighter I Academy and wildland fire technology. In conjunction with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Lancaster campus hosts the Sheriff's Training Academy, which meets the requirements of the Peace Officer Standards and Training for training members of the sheriff's department and other law enforcement agencies. The community college district is governed by a locally elected Board of Trustees consisting of five members serving four-year terms, plus a student trustee elected annually by members of the student body. Palmdale campus The college maintains a temporary leased site in the City of Palmdale, which serves nearly 2,000 students. Plans call for creation of a full campus on of land in southern Palmdale on 25th Street East, south of Avenue S. College officials are working toward a sustainable enrollment of 1,000 full-time equivalent students to qualify Palmdale for center status‚Äîa key step in developing a permanent campus. Officials in April 2009 expressed their intent to submit an initial project proposal for a campus to the state in June 2010.  Athletics  The college's athletic teams are known as the Marauders. The college currently fields eight men's and eight women's varsity teams. It competes as a member of the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) in the Western State Conference (WSC) for all sports except football, which competes in Southern California Football Association (SCFA).

It is used as a measure of accuracy in numeric calculations.David Goldberg: What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic, section 1.2 Relative Error and Ulps, ACM Computing Surveys, Vol 23, No 1, pp.8, March 1991. Definition One definition is: In radix b with precision p, if be ‚â§ x < be+1, then ULP(x) = bmax(e,emin)‚àíp+1. Another definition, suggested by John Harrison, is slightly different: ULP(x) is the distance between the two closest straddling floating-point numbers a and b (i.e., those with a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b and a ‚â† b), assuming that the exponent range is not upper-bounded.Muller, Jean-Michel (2005-11). \\"On the definition of ulp(x)\\". INRIA Technical Report 5504. ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. V, No. N, November 2005. Retrieved in 2012-03 from http://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Carine.Lucas/TPScilab/JMMuller/ulp-toms.pdf. These definitions differ only at signed powers of the radix. The IEEE 754 specification--followed by all modern floating-point hardware--requires that the result of an elementary arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root since 1985, and FMA since 2008) be correctly rounded, which implies that in rounding to nearest, the rounded result is within 0.5 ULP of the mathematically exact result, using John Harrison's definition; conversely, this property implies that the distance between the rounded result and the mathematically exact result is minimized (but for the halfway cases, it is satisfied by two consecutive floating-point numbers). Reputable numeric libraries compute the basic transcendental functions to between 0.5 and about 1 ULP. Only a few libraries compute them within 0.5 ULP, this problem being complex due to the Table-maker's dilemma. Examples=Example 1 Let x be a positive floating-point number and assume that the active rounding attribute is round to nearest, ties to even, denoted RN. If ULP(x) is less than or equal to 1, then . Otherwise, or , depending on the value of the least significant digit and the exponent of x. This is demonstrated in the following Haskell code typed at an interactive prompt: > until (\\\\x -> x  x+1) (+1) 0 :: Float 1.6777216e7 > it-1 1.6777215e7 > it+1 1.6777216e7 Here we start with 0 in single precision and repeatedly add 1 until the operation does not change the value. Since the significand for a single-precision number contains 24 bits, the first integer that is not exactly representable is 224+1, and this value rounds to 224 in round to nearest, ties to even. Thus the result is equal to 224. Example 2 The following example in Java approximates as a floating point value by finding the two double values bracketing : : // œÄ with 20 decimal digits BigDecimal œÄ = new BigDecimal(\\"3.14159265358979323846\\"); // truncate to a double floating point double p0 = œÄ.doubleValue(); // -> 3.141592653589793 (hex: 0x1.921fb54442d18p1) // p0 is smaller than œÄ, so find next number representable as double double p1 = Math.nextUp(p0); // -> 3.1415926535897936 (hex: 0x1.921fb54442d19p1) Then is determined as : // ulp(œÄ) is the difference between p1 and p0 BigDecimal ulp = new BigDecimal(p1).subtract(new BigDecimal(p0)); // -> 4.44089209850062616169452667236328125E-16 // (this is precisely 2**(-51)) // same result when using the standard library function double ulpMath = Math.ulp(p0); // -> 4.440892098500626E-16 (hex: 0x1.0p-51) Example 3 Another example, in Python, also typed at an interactive prompt, is: >>> x = 1.0 >>> p = 0 >>> while x != x + 1: ... x = x * 2 ... p = p + 1 ... >>> x 9007199254740992.0 >>> p 53 >>> x + 2 + 1 9007199254740996.0 In this case, we start with and repeatedly double it until . Similarly to Example 1, the result is 253 because the double-precision floating-point format uses a 53-bit significand. Language support The Boost C++ libraries provides the functions \`boost::math::float_next\`, \`boost::math::float_prior\`, \`boost::math::nextafter\` and \`boost::math::float_advance\` to obtain nearby (and distant) floating-point values, and \`boost::math::float_distance(a, b)\` to calculate the floating-point distance between two doubles. The C language library provides functions to calculate the next floating-point number in some given direction: \`nextafterf\` and \`nexttowardf\` for \`float\`, \`nextafter\` and \`nexttoward\` for \`double\`, \`nextafterl\` and \`nexttowardl\` for \`long double\`, declared in \`\`. It also provides the macros \`FLT_EPSILON\`, \`DBL_EPSILON\`, \`LDBL_EPSILON\`, which represent the positive difference between 1.0 and the next greater representable number in the corresponding type (i.e. the ULP of one). The Java standard library provides the functions and . They were introduced with Java 1.5. The Swift standard library provides access to the next floating-point number in some given direction via the instance properties \`nextDown\` and \`nextUp\`. It also provides the instance property \`ulp\` and the type property \`ulpOfOne\` (which corresponds to C macros like \`FLT_EPSILON\`) for Swift's floating-point types.

Bush The Slovakia Summit 2005 was a summit meeting between United States President George W. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin (hence also known as the Bush-Putin summit). It took place on February 24, 2005, in Bratislava, Slovakia. This marked the first occasion when a sitting President of the United States visited Slovakia since its independence in 1993. The previous \\"Bush-Putin summit\\" had taken place in Slovenia on 16 June 2001. Also attending was Condoleezza Rice (U.S. Secretary of State) and Sergey Lavrov (Russian Foreign Minister) as well as the first ladies of both presidents, Laura Bush and Liudmila Putina.  Bush's European trip before the summit  Prior to the summit, Bush had travelled to Brussels and met with several European leaders and councils of the European Union and NATO, including Tony Blair, Silvio Berlusconi, Jacques Chirac, and Javier Solana. He also met with Viktor Yushchenko, the new President of Ukraine, and gave a public speech directed at citizens of Europe outlining his policies. He then travelled to Germany and met with Gerhard Schr√∂der. In preparation for the summit, Condoleezza Rice spent a week visiting officials in European capitals.  The summit  President George W.

Topics of discussion at the summit are partly private, but included Russian democracy (this was the main topic at the subsequent press conference), the situation in Iran, the North Korean nuclear talks and other international topics. One of the objects of the summit activities was to improve relations between the U.S. and Europe. Notably, Slovakia is an ally of the U.S. in the Iraq War and contributed troops to the Coalition of the willing. In conjunction with the summit, a conference, \\"A New Quest for Democracy\\", was held in Bratislava by the Marshall Fund in conjunction with Slovak partners, to which mainly past or contemporaneous \\"fighters\\" for democracy from Eastern Europe (incl. Belarus, Serbia etc.) were invited. Both first ladies visited the famous Primate's Palace. The US first lady opened a department of the University Library in Bratislava (which was being restored and modernized at that time) that was devoted to US literature and studies. The Russian first lady opened a similar department for Russian literature in the same library one day later. Among other things, Bush promised that US administration will prepare a \\"road map\\" for Slovakia (and probably also the neighbouring Central European countries) aiming at abolishing the need of US entrance visa for the citizens of Slovakia and those countries.

It is a hypothetical future level of technological manipulation of matter, on the scale of trillionths of a metre or picoscale (10‚àí12). This is three orders of magnitude smaller than a nanometre (and thus most nanotechnology) and two orders of magnitude smaller than most chemistry transformations and measurements. Picotechnology would involve the manipulation of matter at the atomic level. A further hypothetical development, femtotechnology, would involve working with matter at the subatomic level. Applications Picoscience is a term used by some futurists to refer to structuring of matter on a true picometre scale. Picotechnology was described as involving the alteration of the structure and chemical properties of individual atoms, typically through the manipulation of energy states of electrons within an atom to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties, producing some form of exotic atom. Analogous transformations known to exist in the real world are redox chemistry, which can manipulate the oxidation states of atoms; excitation of electrons to metastable excited states as with lasers and some forms of saturable absorption; and the manipulation of the states of excited electrons in Rydberg atoms to encode information. However, none of these processes produces the types of exotic atoms described by futurists. Alternatively, picotechnology is used by some researchers in nanotechnology to refer to the fabrication of structures where atoms and devices are positioned with sub- nanometre accuracy. This is important where interaction with a single atom or molecule is desired, because of the strength of the interaction between two atoms which are very close. For example, the force between an atom in an atomic force microscope probe tip and an atom in a sample being studied vary exponentially with separation distance, and is sensitive to changes in position on the order of 50 to 100 picometres (due to Pauli exclusion at short ranges and van der Waals forces at long ranges).

Life Fritz K√∂berle was born in Eichgraben, Austria, and studied medicine at the University of Vienna, Austria, graduating magna cum laude in 1934. He began to work in the Institute of Pathology while he was a student and, soon after his 1935 graduation, he was admitted as an assistant professor. With the annexation of Austria to Germany (Anschluss), K√∂berle was drafted into the Army as a medical lieutenant and worked as a pathologist in the Central Army Hospital of Vienna. With the outbreak of the Second World War hostilities, K√∂berle was attached as field pathologist to the XII Army Group of the Wehrmacht in 1940 and served in the fronts of France, Belgium, Poland and Russia. He was able to acquire during this period an enormous experience on the pathology of infectious diseases (bacterial dysentery, typhus, typhoid fever, tularemia and malaria) as well as war-inflicted wounds, and performing more than four thousand autopsies. After the war, K√∂berle returned to the University of M√ºnster as Privatdozent, continuing his activities as professor and researcher of medical pathology until 1945. He returned shortly to the University of Vienna, and, in 1946, accepted a post as director of the Serological and Pathological Institute of the General Hospital of St. P√∂lten, Lower Austria. In 1952, he received an invitation which would radically change his personal and scientific life. A new medical school was being established by the University of S√£o Paulo in Ribeir√£o Preto, in the hinterland of the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The main objective of the state government was to increase the number of physicians in the rapidly developing hinterland, and its first dean, Dr. Zeferino Vaz, a parasitologist, medical research and professor of the University, wished to create a favorable environment for high quality medical research and teaching in the new school. With this in mind, Vaz invited a number of foreign researchers to become chairmen of the basic and clinical departments, and Fritz K√∂berle had a good recommendation by Prof. Henrique da Rocha Lima, a Brazilian medical researcher who had studied in Germany. Dr. K√∂berle accepted an invitation and moved with his family to the Medical School of Ribeir√£o Preto in 1953. He soon organized the Department of Pathology, became its chairman, and began to assemble a small group of Brazilian researchers. Works While in Ribeir√£o Preto, K√∂berle noted that a promising field of research in pathology for the new department and himself could be Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, which had been discovered by another Brazilian physician named Carlos Chagas, in 1910. Even though 40 years had passed since its discovery, little was known about the peculiar manifestations of the chronic phase of the disease, such as megaesophagus, megacolon, cardiomegaly, heart ventricular aneurysm, achalasia, etc., and the mechanism of the causation of these several pathologies. By making good use of the extensive caseload of fatalities due to Chagas disease in the region of Ribeir√£o Preto and Southern Minas Gerais, where it was endemic and widely prevalent at the time, K√∂berle studied initially the dilation pathologies of the digestive tract and proved, by extensively quantifying the number of neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the Auerbach's plexus, that: 1) they were strongly reduced all over the digestive tract; 2) that megacolon and megaesophagus appeared only when there was a reduction of over 80% and 55% of the number of neurons, respectively; 3) these pathologies appeared as a result of the disruption of the neurally integrated control of peristalsis (muscular annular contraction) in those parts where a strong force is necessary to impel the luminal bolus of food or feces; and 4) European idiopathic megaesophagus and Chagas megaesophagus appeared to have the same etiology, namely the degeneration of the Auerbach's myoenteric plexus. Studying the typical features of the Chagasic myocardium pathology, characterized by damage to its electrical conduction pathways, heart arrythmia, aneurysm of the ventricular apex, cardiomegalia and sudden death by ventricular fibrillation, K√∂berle and his group of collaborators were able to prove that they were caused also by an extensive denervation of the parasympathetic (55%) and sympathetic (35%) intrinsic cardiac nervous networks, leading to a control imbalance of contraction, cardiac failure, cardiomegalia and hypoxia. He named this constellation of effects as cardiopathia parasympathicopriva. Other less typical phenomena observed in Chagas disease, such as bronchiectasis and myelopathy were also studied by K√∂berle under the new prism of his neurogenic theory. Thus, with his classical and detailed scientific studies, K√∂berle proposed for the first time a unified and radically different (and polemical) view of the etiopathogeny of Chagas disease, characterizing it as a disease of the autonomic nervous system, which establishes itself during the acute phase and provokes long term and slowly installing denervation. Since the trypanosoma does not seem to damage neurons directly, K√∂berle and other researchers have hypothesized the action of a neurotoxin, cytotoxic factors or autoimmune mechanisms. K√∂berle retired from the University of S√£o Paulo in 1976, but soon moved as visiting professor to the Medical School, of the State University of Campinas, in Campinas, S√£o Paulo, where one of his sons, Gottfried K√∂berle, is a professor of Orthopedics. He worked there until his death, in 1983, in Americana. Another son, Roland K√∂berle, is a professor in Physics at the University of S√£o Paulo at S√£o Carlos. Miscellaneous The square in front of the main entrance to the USP campus at Ribeir√£o Preto is named in his honor. Bibliography * Koeberle, F. Cardiopathia parasympathicopriva. Munch. Med.

This is a smaller scale in comparison with nanotechnology and picotechnology which refer to 10‚àí9 m and 10‚àí12 m respectively. Theory Work in the femtometer range involves manipulation of excited energy states within atomic nuclei, specifically nuclear isomers, to produce metastable (or otherwise stabilized) states with unusual properties. In the extreme case, excited states of the individual nucleons that make up the atomic nucleus (protons and neutrons) are considered, ostensibly to tailor the behavioral properties of these particles. The most advanced form of molecular nanotechnology is often imagined to involve self-replicating molecular machines, and there have been some speculations suggesting something similar might be possible with analogues of molecules composed of nucleons rather than atoms. For example, the astrophysicist Frank Drake once speculated about the possibility of self- replicating organisms composed of such nuclear molecules living on the surface of a neutron star, a suggestion taken up in the science fiction novel Dragon's Egg by the physicist Robert Forward.neutron star, life on It is thought by physicists that nuclear molecules may be possible,Physics News Update Number 29 - DO NUCLEAR MOLECULES EXIST? but they would be very short-lived, and whether they could actually be made to perform complex tasks such as self- replication, or what type of technology could be used to manipulate them, is unknown. Applications Practical applications of femtotechnology are currently considered to be unlikely. The spacings between nuclear energy levels require equipment capable of efficiently generating and processing gamma rays, without equipment degradation. The nature of the strong interaction is such that excited nuclear states tend to be very unstable (unlike the excited electron states in Rydberg atoms), and there are a finite number of excited states below the nuclear binding energy, unlike the (in principle) infinite number of bound states available to an atom's electrons. Similarly, what is known about the excited states of individual nucleons seems to indicate that these do not produce behavior that in any way makes nucleons easier to use or manipulate, and indicates instead that these excited states are even less stable and fewer in number than the excited states of atomic nuclei.

It is issued by Gremi Media SA. The paper's title may be loosely translated as \\"commonwealth\\" or \\"republic\\", a part of the traditional full name of the Polish state ‚Äì Rzeczpospolita Polska. In 2016, Rzeczpospolita had a circulation of 274,000; 75% of its readers were reported to have higher education.  History  A daily newspaper with this title was issued for the first time in 1920 as a medium of the conservative Christian National Party. It was Initially owned by its founder Ignacy Jan Paderewski and after 1924 by Wojciech Korfanty, two prominent politicians of that time. The editor-in-chief Stanis≈Çaw Stro≈Ñski sought to maintain quality of the content by cooperating with a group of authors, including Adolf Nowaczy≈Ñski, Kornel Makuszy≈Ñski, and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Witwicki. The last issue of Rzeczpospolita in the Second Polish Republic appeared on the last day of 1931. During the war (1940‚Äì1943), an irregular paper associated with one of the Polish resistance groups ‚Äì Polish People's Independence Action ‚Äì was issued under the same title. In 1944 an administration dependent on the Soviet Union started activities behind the lines of the Red Army, within the territory of Poland. Initially the activity was directed only against former Nazi German forces, in order to gain the favour of Polish society. On 23 July 1944, when the war had not been over yet, the first issue of Rzeczpospolita ‚Äì the newspaper of the Polish Committee of National Liberation ‚Äì was published in Che≈Çm. The editor-in-chief was Jerzy Borejsza, a communist activist and journalist in the interwar years, who after the outbreak of war collaborated with the Russians before they entered Polish territory. His articles in Rzeczpospolita presented the opinions in line with the position of the Kremlin. The newspaper began strenuous endeavours as to form a positive image of the new government. The Home Army commanders and their decision to commence the Warsaw Uprising were criticised, while nationalisation and land reform were supported. After the war, Rzeczpospolita was issued by \\"Czytelnik\\" cooperative publishing house, whose president was Borejsza himself. He delegated the editorial duties to Pawe≈Ç Hoffman, who soon changed the title to Rzeczpospolita. Dziennik Gospodarczy, later changing it again to Rzeczpospolita. Dziennik Polityczno-Gospodarczy. In 1949, the editor- in-chief was Henryk Koroty≈Ñski, and newspaper joined the campaign against the Roman Catholic Church. In 1949, the state authorities had established another newspaper ‚Äì People's Tribune () as an organ of a newly formed political party, the Polish United Workers' Party (colloquially: party). Rzeczpospolita had been issued still by nearly two years, until the beginning of 1951, when it was discontinued because coexistence of the party and government newspapers was considered at that time unfavorable for a consolidated one-party state. Part of the team joined G≈Ços Pracy, while several journalists, including Koroty≈Ñski, moved to ≈ªycie Warszawy. In 1980 the state had faced a crisis, and consequently the party's overall image deteriorated significantly. This prompted the idea to relaunch a separate government newspaper. In the spring of 1981, thus during the rise of Solidarity, Edmund Osma≈Ñczyk, member of parliament of the Polish People‚Äôs Republic, proposed to revive Rzeczpospolita as a \\"governmental medium presenting the position of the state on a daily basis‚Äù. J√≥zef Barecki, former editor of Trybuna Ludu, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and of the parliament, as well as a government spokesman for a year, was appointed as the editor-in-chief. The first issue of the new Rzeczpospolita appeared during the martial law, on 14 January 1982. The state, as an entity, had become officially independent from the party (even though this independence was still largely fictitious within a communist state). Thus, from 1982 onwards, Rzeczpospolita and Trybuna Ludu resumed their parallel existence as the official bulletins of the government and the party apparatus respectively. This dualism corresponded to the situation in the Soviet Union, where the government newspaper Izvestia functioned alongside the party's Pravda, and where Izvestia has steered a course strikingly similar to Rzeczpospolita in the 1990s. After the partially free elections of 4 June 1989 and after Tadeusz Mazowiecki became Prime Minister, the management of the newspaper changed as well. Rzeczpospolita was no longer a government medium and became an independent newspaper. Its new editor-in-chief was Dariusz Fikus (until 1996). The new Polish government made Rzeczpospolita legitimately independent. In February 1991, Pa≈Ñstwowe Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Wydawnicze \\"Rzeczpospolita\\", a state publishing company, with Maciej Ceg≈Çowski as the new CEO, together with the French Robert Hersant press group, Presse Participations Europennes, established Presspublica company. Its first CEO was the then editor-in-chief of Rzeczpospolita, Dariusz Fikus. Initially, the Polish shareholder held 51% of company shares, while the French owned 49%. In 1993, Rzeczpospolita was named the Newspaper of the Year by the Pheidippides Committee. In the mid-1990s, the Polish party sold the additional 2% of shares to the French. In 1996, the Norwegian Orkla Media corporation acquired shares held by the Robert Hersant group. During the next 10 years, 51% of shares were held by the subsidiary of Orkla Press Polska, Presspublica Holding Norway, while 49% belonged to Pa≈Ñstwowe Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Wydawnicze \\"Rzeczpospolita\\" (from 1 March 2000, to Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Wydawnicze ‚ÄúRzeczpospolita‚Äù SA). In October 2006, the shares of Orkla Press Polska were taken over by Mecom Poland Holdings SA forming part of the British Mecom Group. In October 2011 Gremi Media, owned by the Polish entrepreneur Grzegorz Hajdarowicz, purchased the shares from Mecom Poland and the shares belonging to PW Rzeczpospolita (the State Treasury), becoming a 100% shareholder of Presspublica publishing house. The publishing house changed its name to Gremi Media, after which, in January 2017, it was transformed into a joint stock company operating under the business name of Gremi Media SA.  Contents  Rzeczpospolita newspaper cover from 1945 The basic edition of Rzeczpospolita is divided into four sections: the main one, dedicated to general news; the economic one (Ekonomia i rynek), the legal one (Prawo co dnia); and the regional one (≈ªycie Region√≥w). The general news section features, e.g., information on current political events, reports from Poland and abroad, commentaries and essays, expert opinions, as well as news relating to culture, science, lifestyle, or sports. Prawo co dnia (\\"Law Every Day\\") focuses on the changes in regulations and legislation and on legal analyses, including articles on labour law, analyses and expert opinions, or industry-related communications. Ekonomia i rynek (\\"Economy and Market\\") provides information about markets, enterprises, finance, current stock quotes, analyses of the economic situation and trends in Poland and abroad, as well as opinions of economists, experts and representatives of the business world. The nationwide issue of the newspaper includes a series of regional monthly supplements entitled ≈ªycie Region√≥w (\\"Life of the Regions\\"). They are dedicated to important investments, business and education in the regions, as well as matters related to local politics, sports, and culture. ≈ªycie Region√≥w is the organiser of public debates that are crucial for local communities, as well as the media partner of major regional events. On Saturdays, Plus Minus, the weekend edition of Rzeczpospolita, appears, containing articles related to civilisation, literature, lifestyle and metapolitics. It mainly includes essays, commentaries and feature articles, as well as reviews of books and cultural and sporting events. Interviews form a particularly important part of Plus Minus.  Supplements  Newspaper subscription includes such specialised supplements as Podatki (taxes), Administracja (administration), Rzecz o prawie (law), Ekspert Ksiƒôgowego (accounting), Praca i ZUS (labour and social security matters), or Prawo w Biznesie (law in business). Dobra Firma (\\"Good Company\\") is a daily supplement to the main issue. It is primarily addressed to entrepreneurs from the SME sector. In an easy-to-understand manner, it covers both the legal issues relevant to business owners (taxes, social security, contracts, employment), and business matters (marketing of new products, business ideas, available solutions relating to company vehicles). Nieruchomo≈õci (\\"Real Estate\\") appears on Mondays and Fridays. On Mondays, topics relating to construction and housing are presented, while on Fridays, matters related to the commercial real estate market are covered. Every Tuesday, Rzeczpospolita Cyfrowa (\\"Digital Republic\\") is issued with Rzeczpospolita, dedicated to new technologies, with particular focus on their application in running a business and in developing new business branches. Moje PieniƒÖdze (\\"My Money\\") is a Thursday supplement devoted to personal finance. It offers tips on saving and investing money, buying shares and choosing insurance. The Friday supplement is Rzecz o Historii (\\"The thing about History\\"), offering informative articles and historical analysis.  Lists and rankings  Regular publications of Rzeczpospolita include lists and rankings of companies, brands and institutions operating on the Polish market. The best known are: the 500 List, the 2000 List, the Ranking of the Most Valuable Polish Brands, and the Ranking of Law Firms.  The 500 List  The list of the largest Polish companies by revenue, first published in 1999. Modelled on the Fortune list, it is now the only such ranking in Poland. The best developing companies on the list receive the prestigious Rzeczpospolita Eagles awards.  The 2000 List  The list of the best companies according to Rzeczpospolita, first published in 2002. It takes into account their revenues, employment, and results. The ranking of the largest exporters is published as a supplement. Outstanding enterprises from the list receive the Good Company, Exports Eagle and Exports Brand awards.  The Ranking of the Most Valuable Polish Brands  The Ranking of the Most Valuable Polish Brands provides a professional valuation of over 300 brands created specifically for the needs of the Polish market. Apart from value, the strength of brands in separate industry categories is also estimated. The ranking has been published since 2003.  The Ranking of Law Firms  The ranking includes law firms servicing enterprises and operating on the Polish market. Law firms are broken down, among others, in terms of the number of lawyers and legal counsels, the generated revenues and profits, the servicing of the leading market transactions, or the best lawyers in respective areas of law. The ranking has been published since 2003. Until 2007, Rzeczpospolita was published in the classic broadsheet format. The format then changed to compact, a modern and more functional one.  Style  In 2005, the newspaper received the Grand Front award, and in 2006, during the 27th edition of the competition organised by the Society for News Design, Rzeczpospolita was named \\"The best designed newspaper in the world\\". Rzeczpospolita received the Grand Front award also in 2013, for the best cover (dedicated to the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI).  External links  rp.pl was one of the first online news services in the Polish media. In 2017 the service will have operated for 20 years, having been launched in March 1997.

Records and record executive Irving Azoff. Currently, this name is used for Swedish label owned by Warner Music Sweden, a Swedish branch of Warner Music Group. In 1990, Giant became a subsidiary label for Warner Music Group. Its first release, in early 1991, was the Gulf War all-star tribute song \\"Voices That Care,\\" assembled by producer David Foster. That spring, \\"Hold You Tight\\" by Tara Kemp was released and went on to become a Top 5 single. In the months that followed, Giant Records released the soundtrack album for the film New Jack City, selling 16 million copies worldwide. The label signed such acts as MC Hammer, Jade, Lord Finesse, and teen pop star Jeremy Jordan. Giant also signed established acts such as Big Car, Miles Zuniga, Steely Dan, Warren Zevon, Oingo Boingo, Chicago, Deep Purple, Morbid Angel, Brian Wilson, and Kenny Rogers. The label also operated a country music division in Nashville; the first act signed was Dennis Robbins. In 1993, Giant became dissatisfied with Warner Music Group's practice of international affairs, so it made a deal with BMG to distribute its recordings outside the U.S. By the mid- to late 1990s, the company had replaced most of its staff and launched a subsidiary label called Revolution Records; Brian Wilson signed with the new label in 1997. The company later reverted to its original name and distributed Paladin Records, which included singer-songwriter Steve Forbert. In 2001, Warner Music Group ended its joint venture with Giant, which was absorbed into Warner Bros. Records. Since then, BMG no longer repressed and distributed any previous releases of Giant. Distribution of current reissues are done by Warner Music's reissue division, Rhino, in conjunction with Warner Records, and many reissues still include Giant logo on packaging. In February 2015, Warner Music Sweden announced that it would reactivate Giant's name; the first single released under the new Giant Records banner was Simon Erics' \\"Waiting for the Sun.\\" Giant Records recording artists * Artists on Giant Records were primarily distributed by Warner Bros.

She has worked as a singer in the folk scene and the women's movement and as a trainer in social and youth work. Her repertoire ranges from traditional ballads to music-hall and contemporary songs, often focusing on the lives of women. She is a key mover of the natural voice and community choirs movements and is the president of the natural voice network and has been a voice coach for theatrical groups, including at the National Theatre for 18 years. Involved with folk and political songs from the 1950s, she has performed and/or recorded with Blowzabella, The Orckestra (with Henry Cow and the Mike Westbrook Brass Band), Ken Hyder's Talisker, John Kirkpatrick, Brian Pearson, Leon Rosselson, Dave Van Ronk and Maddy Prior. She is blind from glaucoma. Biography Frankie Armstrong moved to Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, as a young child. She began singing in a group with her brother singing Elvis Presley and Little Richard numbers, and in 1957 joined the Stort Valley Skiffle Group which a few years later changed its name to the Ceilidh Singers as its repertoire moved towards folk music. The group founded the Hoddesdon Folk Club. In 1963 she qualified as a social worker for blind people and began working with Louis Killen and performing solo (Louis Killen's advice led to her developing the harder voice quality for which she is noted.Lifton, Sarah (1983) The Listener's Guide to Folk Music. Poole: Blandford Press; p. 23). In 1964, at Killen's suggestion she joined The Critics Group directed by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger. In 1965 sang at the Edinburgh Festival \\"Poets in Public\\", with John Betjeman, Stevie Smith and Ted Hughes. Her first recording, in 1965, was at the invitation of Bert Lloyd who as director of Topic Records was putting together an album of erotic songs with Anne Briggs, released as The Bird in the Bush (12T135, 1966). In 1968 she recorded songs for the radio programme The Blind Set produced by Charles Parker about the treatment of visually impaired people which led to the formation of the Blind Integration Group. In 1973 she spent several weeks in the US and met Ethel Raim. She was inspired by Raim's Balkan singing workshops and in the mid-1970s pioneered her own workshops developing her own approach to singing with a natural voice. Her conviction that singing is for everyone has underpinned her approach. She was an initiating member of the NVPN ‚Äì Natural Voice Practitioners' Network, and \\"The key figure behind the development of the network...\\". The key figure behind the development of the network... was English folksinger Frankie Armstrong, who continues to act as the movement's most revered mentor. She was a member of the Feminist Improvising Group (FIG), co-founded in 1977 by vocalist Maggie Nicols, bassoonist Lindsay Cooper, keyboardist Cathy Williams, cellist and bassist Georgina Born, and trumpeter Corinne Liensol. Armstrong collaborated within the accomplished FIG after 1978, and also with free jazz pianist (and partly percussion playing) Ir√®ne Schweizer, saxophonist (and film maker) Sally Potter, trombonist and violist Annemarie Roelofs, flutist and saxophonist Ang√®le Veltmeijer, and saxophonist and guitarist Fran√ßoise Dupety. The accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten has a dust jacket picture of Frankie with Louis and The Crafty Maid's Policy from Lovely on the Water is the seventh track on the second CD in the set. In 2018, she was awarded a Gold Badge Award from the :English Folk Dance and Song Society for outstanding contributions to folk music. She wrote and recorded a song for Stick in the Wheel which is included in their second \\"From Here: English Folk Field Recordings, Volume 2\\" recording project and joined Lankum on stage at new year in Bristol singing Old Man from over the Sea. In 2019, Folk Radio UK announced that Frankie had formed a new band called :Green Ribbons with Alasdair Roberts (musician), :Jinnwoo and Burd Ellen. In July 2019, the band released their self-titled debut album consisting of purely unaccompanied singing through Matiere Memoir Records.

He played as a centre back for Aberdeen, Manchester United and Oldham Athletic. He also played in 34 international matches for Scotland between 1971 and 1978 including at two World Cups. Buchan later managed Burnley. Personal life Buchan's father, Martin senior, and brother George both played for Aberdeen. Martin Buchan's son, Jamie, played with Aberdeen, Dundee United and Partick Thistle. Playing career=Aberdeen Buchan started his career with his home town club, Aberdeen. He captained the team when they won the 1970 Scottish Cup Final 3-1 against Jock Stein's Celtic. Manchester United Buchan was signed by Manchester United manager Frank O'Farrell on 29 February 1972 for ¬£120,000, and at the time was the club's record signing. His first game for United came on 4 March 1972 against Tottenham in the First Division. He was unable to prevent United from suffering relegation to the Second Division in 1973‚Äì74, his first season as club captain following the retirement of Bobby Charlton. However, United bounced back at the first attempt as Second Division champions. Buchan helped United win the 1977 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, which they won 2‚Äì1. This meant that Buchan became the only player to captain both Scottish and English FA Cup-winning sides. He also helped United reach another FA Cup final in 1979, where they lost 3‚Äì2 to Arsenal. He was still with United when they beat Brighton 4‚Äì0 in the replayed 1983 FA Cup Final, but he did not make the team for the final. Buchan left the club in August 1983 after injuries caught up with him, signing for Oldham Athletic on a free transfer. He had played in 456 games, scoring 4 goals, one of which was a superb, yet somewhat uncharacteristic, long-range drive against Everton. International Buchan won 34 caps for Scotland, making his international debut in 1971 against Portugal and his last appearance in 1978 against the same country. He played in the 1974 World Cup finals and 1978 World Cup finals and captained Scotland twice: in 1975 against Romania and in 1977 against Argentina. After playing On 22 June 1985, Buchan was appointed manager of Burnley, who had just been relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history ‚Äì 25 years after being league champions. Buchan lasted less than four months at Turf Moor, resigning on 10 October 1985.Martin Buchan managerial career Buchan currently works for the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in Manchester.

London beginnings Born in Mitcham, Surrey, Stepney had unsuccessful trials with Fulham and joined Tooting & Mitcham United. From there, he was spotted by Millwall, who signed him as an amateur in 1963, but quickly realised his potential and made him a professional within two months of his arrival. Stepney was ever-present for almost three seasons, making 158 appearances, only missing the last game of the 1965‚Äì66 season. During this period, he earned three England under-23 caps. In May 1966, Stepney joined Chelsea for ¬£50,000. Manager Tommy Docherty initially intended to play Stepney and fellow goalkeeper Peter Bonetti in alternate weeks, but just three months later Stepney was sold to Manchester United for a record fee of ¬£55,000, having made just one appearance for the club. With Harry Gregg's career virtually ended by injury, the Manchester United manager, Matt Busby, opted for Stepney after deciding that neither Pat Dunne nor the injury-prone David Gaskell was up to the job. Stepney made his debut for United later the same year against Manchester City at Old Trafford, and he kept a clean sheet as United won 1‚Äì0 through a first-half goal from Denis Law. League and European exploits With Stepney in goal, Manchester United won the First Division title in 1967, earning them entry into the European Cup the following season, a competition that no English club had yet won. Stepney featured throughout United's progress to the final at Wembley Stadium, during which he made a memorable close-range save from Benfica striker Eus√©bio in the closing stages with the score at 1‚Äì1. Eus√©bio was so astonished at Stepney's save that he stopped to applaud the keeper as Stepney threw the ball back into play. United eventually won 4‚Äì1 after extra time. At the start of that season, Stepney had conceded a goal to his opposite number at Tottenham Hotspur, Pat Jennings, in the 1967 FA Charity Shield at Old Trafford. With Tottenham leading 1‚Äì0, Jennings punted the ball upfield from the Stretford End; the ball bounced over the stranded Stepney into the net. The game ended 3‚Äì3 with United's goals coming from Bobby Charlton (2), and Denis Law. International recognition Although a highly talented keeper, Stepney was a distance down the pecking order when it came to the England team. Gordon Banks was the undisputed number one, with Peter Bonetti of Chelsea, Gordon West of Everton and the more experienced Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Ron Springett all in Stepney's way. When England qualified for the final stages of the 1968 European Championships, coach Alf Ramsey selected Stepney and West as the two back-up keepers to Banks and, in what turned into a momentous week for Stepney, he made his England debut in a friendly win over Sweden in May 1968, seven days before the European Cup final. England won 3‚Äì1. Ramsey kept Stepney in his thoughts in his preparations for England's defence of the FIFA World Cup in 1970, for which England did not have to qualify having won the previous tournament, but did not give him another cap as the likes of Bonetti and West added to their meagre tallies of appearances. However, when the preliminary squad of 27 was announced, Stepney was in, along with Banks, Bonetti and uncapped rookie Peter Shilton, with no sign of West. When the final 22 who would travel to Mexico was confirmed, Shilton was the goalkeeper sent home. Nevertheless, Stepney was clearly the third-choice goalkeeper in the squad and the chances of his appearing on the pitch in Mexico were small. When Banks went down with food poisoning prior to the quarter-final with West Germany, it was the slightly more experienced Bonetti ‚Äì who had six caps to Stepney's one ‚Äì to whom Ramsey turned, although Stepney did make it onto the substitutes' bench. England squandered a two-goal lead to lose 3‚Äì2 and it was Stepney who told the groggy, ill Banks the scoreline in his hotel room by holding up three fingers on one hand and two on the other. United's fall and rise Stepney in 1976 (against Ajax) Stepney was occasionally recalled by Ramsey but would ultimately not add to his solitary England cap, with Shilton emerging as the new deputy and ultimate long-term replacement. He continued to play in goal for Manchester United in a period of significant underachievement for the club, which culminated in their relegation to the Second Division in 1974, a season which saw Stepney, unusually for a goalkeeper, score two goals from penalties thus making him the (joint) leading scorer at Christmas. For half a season he was replaced by Jimmy Rimmer. By now, with Stepney's former Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty in charge, they bounced back as Division Two champions the following season (1974‚Äì75). During this time, Stepney suffered a freak injury when he dislocated his jaw barking instructions at his disorganised defence. The next two seasons saw Stepney as the wise head behind a new, youthful team collated by Docherty courtesy of some astute purchases and a prolific youth set-up. During this period, Stepney had to compete with Paddy Roche for a regular starting position. Stepney was the only player with any Wembley experience at club level at all when United reached the 1976 FA Cup Final and the nerves of the youngsters got the better of them as Southampton, a division below United but containing some experienced heads of Stepney's generation, won 1‚Äì0. Stepney had no chance with the goal from Bobby Stokes, a late, low, crossfield shot which United claimed fruitlessly was from an offside position. United reached the Cup Final again in 1977 and this time were successful. Stepney got a hand to a bullet shot on the turn from Jimmy Case but couldn't stop it entering the net and levelling the match after Stuart Pearson had scored for United. Jimmy Greenhoff quickly restored United's lead and Stepney made some good saves in the closing stages as Liverpool, chasing an unprecedented 'treble' of trophies (having already won the league title, and just days later going on to win the European Cup), piled on the pressure. Stepney was the only player in the 1977 FA Cup winning team remaining from the European Cup winning side of nine years earlier. Stepney was also the last remaining player to play for the club under manager Sir Matt Busby. End of an era The following year, Stepney was again not an automatic choice, playing fewer than half of United's games in the League. He played the last of his 546 games for Manchester United in April 1978, prior to leaving for Dallas Tornado in the North American Soccer League in the United States, where he remained until he retired from professional football in 1980. He kept 175 clean sheets, made a club record 92 consecutive appearances (later broken by Steve Coppell) and, with those two goals, remains United's top scoring goalkeeper. Aside from Peter Schmeichel (who scored in a UEFA Cup game in the 1995‚Äì96 season), no other Manchester United goalkeeper has scored in a competitive game for the club in the post Second World War years. Towards the end of his career, he turned out for non-league side Altrincham in the early 1980s, when they were competing in the Alliance Premier League (which became the Football Conference in 1986). He helped them win the Alliance Premier League title in 1980‚Äì81 (they had won it the 1979‚Äì80 season as well), but they did not win promotion to the Football League as the re-election system was still in place and the majority of the league's members voting against them joining the Football League, ending Stepney's hopes of a professional comeback. Stepney became a coach specialising in goalkeeping after he stopped playing, including a spell at Manchester City in 2000‚Äì01. He also works as an after-dinner speaker and currently hosts The Legends Football Phone in on 105.4 Century Radio in Manchester, replacing Mickey Thomas ‚Äì another former Manchester United player. Style of play Stepney was never a flashy performer and perhaps his most impressive quality was his positioning, though he could also demonstrate agility when required. Alex was a good 'talker' who expected ‚Äì and usually got ‚Äì the final say in his penalty box, and was a constructive user of the ball who would never 'hoof it' upfield when he could throw to a well-placed colleague.

Retrieved November 23, 2019 Work in the White House Speakes in 1976 The White House tapped Speakes in 1974 as a Staff Assistant and soon became the Press Secretary to the Special Counsel to the President at the height of the Watergate scandal. Upon Nixon's resignation, President Ford appointed Speakes to be Assistant Press Secretary to the President. Speakes served as Bob Dole's press secretary during his unsuccessful vice-presidential run with Ford. After briefly serving as President Ford's personal press secretary in 1977, Speakes ventured into the private sector as vice president of the international public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton until 1981. After the 1980 presidential campaign, he worked on the staff of the Reagan-Bush team, helping to \\"straighten out\\" the press operation, eventually becoming deputy spokesman for the President-elect during the transition. Before the 1988 presidential election, Speakes had considered working for the campaigns of George H. W. Bush, Jack Kemp, and Alexander Haig; however, Bush's people never got back to him, Speakes decided that Kemp was \\"too hot\\" (meaning too quick with an answer) for television, and was advised by another Washington insider, \\"You can do that [join the Haig team] if you want to, but let me tell you one thing: Al Haig ain't going to be President.\\" Presidential spokesman When James Brady was shot in the assassination attempt on President Reagan on March 30, 1981, he was unable to return to work, though he retained the title of \\"Press Secretary\\" for the duration of Reagan's presidency. In Brady's absence, Speakes took over the job of handling the daily press briefings. On June 17, 1981, Speakes was appointed \\"Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Press Secretary.\\" On August 5, 1983, Speakes was appointed \\"Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy Press Secretary,\\" and remained in that post until January 1987, when he resigned and Marlin Fitzwater took over the role.https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/research/speeches/120486b On January 30, 1987, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Reagan.https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/research/speeches/013087a Speakes wrote in his 1988 memoir Speaking Out that he twice invented statements himself and attributed them to President Reagan. These statements included ones after the KAL 007 shootdown in 1983 and during the Geneva Summit of 1985. Speakes thought that Gorbachev's remarks at the summit had been highly quotable while Reagan's were \\"disappointingly lackluster\\", so he asked his aides to make up some quotes, polished them himself, then issued them to the press as President Reagan's statements. Speakes' revelations, something of a side note in the book, touched off a minor controversy; reporters were annoyed at having been fooled, and Marlin Fitzwater, Speakes's successor, called it a \\"damn outrage\\" and complained that they unfairly called into question the veracity of other presidential statements. Speakes said \\"I was representing his thought if not his words\\", but also apologized to Reagan, saying he had \\"provided fodder for those who would aim the cannons of criticism at the President I served loyally for 6 years.\\" Speakes left a job at Merrill Lynch which he had held for a short time as a result of the controversy. In 2017, Speakes became a target of controversy surrounding the Reagan administration's handling of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. During press briefings over the course of several years, reporter Lester Kinsolving asked Speakes what response, if any, the administration had to the developing crisis. On most of these occasions, Speakes and the White House press corps responded with homophobic jokes, laughter, and disinterest; responses that have been largely pointed to as symbols of the Reagan administration's slow response to the disease. Personal life Speakes was married to the former Laura Christine Crawford (born 1945), whom he met in high school. Long ago divorced, she resides in Oxford, Mississippi. They had three children. Speakes was also married to the former Betty J. Robinson and in 2001 Aleta Sindelar, a registered nurse from Bethesda, Maryland, who claims that Speakes gave her control of his $1 million estate, an issue that has pitted her in legal dispute with Speakes' children. Ultimately, the Mississippi courts sided with Speakes' daughter and oldest child, Sondra \\"Sandy\\" Lanell Speakes Huerta of Cleveland, Mississippi. Sindelar's visitation with her husband was restricted. The Speakes' children said that Sindelar had deserted Larry and left him to care for himself in a condominium in Arlington, Virginia. Death Speakes died in Cleveland, Mississippi, on January 10, 2014, at the age of 74, of Alzheimer's disease.

The station is situated on both the Northern and Wirral Lines of the Merseyrail network. It is the third-busiest station on the Merseyrail network, and the largest underground station. It is also the only station on the network having services to all other Merseyrail stations.  History  Liverpool's rail network in 1977, showing Moorfields in relation to Liverpool Exchange Shortly after the station opened in 1977 The station was built in the 1970s, as a replacement for Liverpool Exchange railway station, opening on 2 May 1977. The station was opened by British Rail and is accessed via entrances at Moorfields and on the corner of Old Hall Street and Tithebarn Street. The Old Hall Street entrance is open from only 5.30am until 7pm on weekdays. Services from the north had previously terminated at nearby Liverpool Exchange terminus station. The newly created north‚Äìsouth crossrail Northern Line runs through Moorfields. Liverpool Exchange was closed and the line extended underground to the new Moorfields station. The line from the north continued through a new tunnel to Liverpool Central, continuing south to terminate at Garston. The line was later extended to Hunts Cross and opened in 1983. At the same time, another new tunnel was built, carrying the Wirral Line in a loop from James Street via Moorfields, Lime Street, and Liverpool Central before returning to James Street; the Wirral Line platform opened on 30 October 1977. There are three platforms (two for the Northern Line and one for the Wirral Line) in two levels of tunnel. The Wirral Line platform is at a much deeper level to pass under the Queensway road tunnel. Passengers must, curiously for an underground station, go up an escalator from the Moorfields entrance to reach the ticket office - the station was originally intended to connect with a pedestrian walkway system, designed to separate pedestrians from traffic. Only a small section of the system was constructed in the 1970s and the scheme eventually fell by the wayside. From the ticket office, another escalator leads down to the main pedestrian tunnel which links the Northern and Wirral Line platforms and the Old Hall Street entrance. The usage of the station Monday to Friday is much greater than the statistics show, since they credit \\"Liverpool\\" passengers to Lime Street station, and do not include day or season ticket holders. The station is however significantly quieter at weekends, since it is primarily used by people working in the business quarter and is less convenient for most of the city centre retail areas. The ashes of Roy Vivian Hughes, the civil engineer who played a major part in the development of the Merseyrail system, are interred behind in a plaque on the wall of the main corridor.http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool- news/look-behind-scenes-12m-moorfields-10924500 Recent history The station underwent an extensive refurbishment in 2015/16 as part of a ¬£40 million investment from Network Rail to allow improvement works to take place at Merseyrail's underground stations, with the refurbishment of Moorfields costing ¬£8 million. The refurbishment was completed in three phases, with each of the three platforms closing in turn for the work to be carried out. Additional funding for replacement of the station's escalators meant that the work was extended from the original April 2016 end date to July 2016. Moorfields Station Refurbishment Update] On 21 March 2016, an extensive track renewal programme was announced for the Wirral Line Loop, requiring the closure of the Loop (and, as a result, the station's Wirral Line platform) between 3 January and 18 June 2017 whilst works take place. Facilities The station is staffed, 15 minutes before the first train and 15 minutes after the last train, and has platform CCTV. There is an M to Go shop, toilet and live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information. The station a 32-space cycle rack and secure indoor storage for 32 cycles. The Old Hall entrance has no disabled-access facilities. The Moorfields entrance has lifts but they have narrow entrances with openings of 800mm.  Services  Both lines on the Merseyrail network - the Northern Line and the Wirral Line - serve the station.

He also has a cousin named Gabriel Lujan who lives in Round Rock, Texas. He attended Florida State University in Tallahassee on an academic scholarship, but never graduated. He lived in the Pacific Northwest and at one time worked as a truck driver frequently traveling up and down the West Coast.

He appeared with his boa and tiara at mayoral debates, but spoke about real issues. Cochran showed up for a mayoral campaign interview in 2003 wearing a women's business suit. \\"He looked like a stewardess from the golden age of air travel,\\" said the Austin Chronicle editor. Cochran talked about problems ahead for a city that was creative and fun, but growing so fast that it could become big and bland. \\"He was talking about issues we are still talking about today, nearly a decade later, as Austin has grappled with change. He had actually thought about real issues that were facing the city, and not all of his ideas were particularly out there.

He did occasional odd jobs for local businesses and appeared in an ad for Pinky's Pagers that aired locally during the 2001 Super Bowl. He also worked as a model, and a local business lent him a three-wheeler bicycle with advertising to pedal around town. Merchandising Cochran was featured in a set of collectible Leslie dress-up refrigerator magnets, with outfits like a leopard-print dress, cheerleader uniform and a miniskirt. The magnets were sold in local bookstores beginning in 2006, and Cochran received 20 percent of sales. In 2007, Cochran bought a large storage shed with his magnet earnings. He cut a deal with a woman in South Austin to put the shed in her yard, furnished the shed and moved into it.

When he was released, on October 23, 2009, Cochran reported that he had been attacked after commenting to a group of people about the dangers of drug abuse. On February 27, 2012, St. David's South Austin Hospital confirmed Cochran was in their hospital in critical condition. The circumstances of his illness/injury were not known. Cochran had been in declining health since suffering his head injury in October 2009. On March 4, 2012, he regained consciousness after undergoing brain surgery two weeks prior. However, that was not considered a sign of improvement in his overall condition. Cochran was then moved to a local hospice,Leslie is conscious, in hospice care (KVUE, March 4, 2012) where he died on March 8, 2012, aged 60. Cochran's death produced an outpouring of strong emotion and condolences.Austin remembers Leslie (KVUE News, March 8, 2012) The Austin City Council observed a moment of silence in his honor. Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell proclaimed March 8, 2012 and every March 8 forward Leslie Day in Austin.

CBOL's Secretariat Office is hosted by the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, DC. Barcoding was proposed in 2003 by Prof. Paul Hebert of the University of Guelph in Ontario as a way of distinguishing and identifying species with a short standardized gene sequence. Hebert proposed the 648 bases of the Folmer region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-C oxidase-1 as the standard barcode region. Dr. Hebert is the Director of the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, and the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL), all headquartered at the University of Guelph. The Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) is also located at the University of Guelph. CBOL was created in May 2004 with support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, following two meetings in 2003, also funded by the Sloan Foundation, at the Banbury Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Since then, more than 200 organizations from more than 50 countries have joined CBOL and agreed to put their barcode data in a public database. CBOL promotes DNA barcoding through workshops, working groups, international conferences, outreach meetings to developing countries, planning meetings for barcoding projects, and production of outreach material to raise awareness of barcoding. CBOL's Database Working Group developed the data standard that GenBank, the European Bioinformatics Institute, and the DNA Data Bank of Japan have endorsed. CBOL's Plant Working Group proposed matK and rbcL as the standard barcode regions for land plants; CBOL approved this proposal in late 2005. The Fungal Working Group has identified ITS as the best barcode region for fungi, and CBOL's Protist Working Group is analyzing candidate regions for protistan groups. CBOL has also created Connect, a social network for the barcoding community. CBOL helped to plan and launch the global campaigns to barcode all species of fish and birds, and socioeconomically important groups like fruitflies. One of CBOL's primary contributions to the success of barcoding has been its outreach efforts to government agencies (agriculture, environment, conservation, and others) and international organizations (CITES, Convention on Biological Diversity, Food and Agriculture Organization) that could benefit from barcoding.

Biography=Professional career Cruickshank holds a BA in Art, Design and Architecture and was formerly a Visiting Professor in the Department of Architecture at the University of Sheffield and a member of the London faculty of the University of Delaware. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Artists, a member of the Executive Committee of the Georgian Group and on the Architectural Panel of the National Trust, and is an Honorary Fellow of RIBA. He has served as Historic Buildings Consultant for ADAM Architecture since 1999 and has been involved in the repair and restoration of many historical buildings including Spencer House in St James's, Heveningham Hall in Suffolk and numerous early 18th-century houses in Spitalfields and other parts of London. In 2014 he was appointed President of Subterranea Britannica, a UK-based society for all those interested in man- made and man-used underground structures and space. His professional publications include London: the Art of Georgian Building (1975), The National Trust and Irish Georgian Society Guide to the Georgian Buildings of Britain and Ireland (1985) and Life in the Georgian City (1990). He edited the 20th edition of Sir Banister Fletcher's History of Architecture and Timeless Architecture: a study of key buildings in architectural history and is a contributing editor to Architects' Journal, The Architectural Review and Perspectives on Architecture. Television work Cruickshank began his career with the BBC as consultant, writer and presenter on the architectural programmes One Foot in the Past and The House Detectives. He also contributed films to the Timewatch https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074pmc and Omnibus strands. In 2001 he wrote and presented the series Invasion in which he examined attempts and plans to invade Britain and Ireland over the years by exploring coastal fortresses and defensive structures around the coast of the country to discover their military heritage. Further series included Britain's Best Buildings examining architecturally ‚Äì or culturally-significant buildings in Great Britain, Under Fire visiting museums and buildings in Afghanistan, Iraq and Israel to see how recent warfare has affected the country's historic artefacts, and What the Industrial Revolution Did for Us focusing on the scientific, technological and political changes of the 19th century. In 2003, Cruickshank presented a documentary entitled Towering Ambitions: Dan Cruickshank at Ground Zero following the debate and discussion that led to the selection of Daniel Libeskind's design for the World Trade Center site in New York City; while in 2005 he presented a documentary on the Mitchell and Kenyon collection ‚Äì rolls of nitrate film shot in the early 20th century, depicting everyday life in Britain, which were discovered in 1994 in Blackburn. In 2004, Cruickshank was at the centre of a controversy when historian Marc Morris pointed out that a documentary about Harlech Castle shown on BBC4 and billed as \\"written and presented by Dan Cruickshank\\" contained obvious borrowings from Morris's earlier Channel 4 series, Castle. The BBC subsequently stated that Cruickshank was not responsible and that it was an error by researchers.\\"Broadcaster gets apology from BBC as history repeats itself\\", The Guardian, 28 May 2004. Accessed 16 January 2014 Channel 4's head of history programming, Hamish Mykura, commented that \\"When a programme claims to have an author's voice, it should be that author's voice and no one else's\\". The BBC subsequently made a \\"goodwill payment\\" to Morris in recognition of the error. Perhaps his greatest success to date came with Around the World in 80 Treasures, charting Cruickshank's five-month trip around the world to visit eighty man-made artefacts or buildings that he had selected, in order to chart the history of mankind's civilisation. In 2006, Cruickshank presented Marvels of the Modern Age, a series focusing on the development of modernism in design, from Greek and Roman architecture, to Bauhaus and the present. Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture, a 2008 series in which he travelled around the world visiting what he considered to be the world's most unusual and interesting buildings. In 2010, he embarked on a 3 part series on the history of the railways in Britain for National Geographic TV channel, including visits to Chester to examine the events surrounding the Dee bridge disaster of 1847, and Manchester for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. The series was entitled \\"Great Railway Adventures\\" and first appeared on UK television in the spring of 2010. In 2014, he appeared in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as himself. Personal life Cruickshank lives in a Georgian house in Spitalfields, London, which he shares with his partner, the painter Marenka Gabeler, their son, and his daughter from a previous marriage. The house was among those he featured when presenting the BBC television programme Ours to Keep - Incomers in 1985, when he discussed the role of the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust, a charity of which he was a co-founder in the 1970s.

Hard Drives are mounted on proprietary hot- swappable caddies. Single Connector Attachment, or SCA, is a type of connection for the internal cabling of Parallel SCSI systems. There are two versions of this connector: the SCA-1, which is deprecated, and SCA-2, which is the most recent standard. In addition there are Single-Ended (SE) and Low Voltage Differential (LVD) types of the SCA. SCA is no longer in widespread use, having been superseded by Serial attached SCSI. Since hard disk drives are among the components of a server computer that are the most likely to fail, there has always been demand for the ability to replace a faulty drive without having to shut down the whole system. This technique is called hot- swapping and is one of the main motivations behind the development of SCA. In connection with RAID, for example, this allows for seamless replacement of failed drives. Normally, hard disk drives make use of two cables: one for data and one for power, and they also have their specific parameters (SCSI ID etc.) to be set using jumpers on each drive. Drives employing SCA have only one plug which carries both data and power and also allows them to receive their configuration parameters from the SCSI backplane. The SCA connector for parallel SCSI drives has 80 pins, as opposed to the 68 pin interface found on most modern parallel SCSI drives. Some of the pins in SCA connectors are longer than others, so they are connected first and disconnected last. This ensures the electrical integrity of the whole system. Otherwise, the angle at which the plug is inserted into the drive could be the reason for damage because, for instance, the pin carrying the voltage could get connected before its corresponding ground reference pin. The additional length also provides what is known as a pre-charge which provides a means whereby the device is alerted to a pending power surge. That allows a slower transition to full power and thereby makes the device more stable. SPARCstation 20 drive in cradle To make better use of their hot-plugging capability, SCA drives usually are installed into drive bays into which they slide with ease. At the far end of these bays is the backplane of the SCSI subsystem located with a connector that plugs into the drive automatically when it is inserted. Full hot- swappable functionality still requires the support of other software and hardware components of the system. In particular the operating system and RAID layers will need hot-swap support to enable hard drive hot-swapping to be carried out without shutting down the system.

Corner was a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College from 1959. Early life Corner was born in London in 1906. He was the son of Edred Moss Corner, a surgeon and surgical author, and Henrietta Corner. At the age of five he developed a stammer which persisted through elocution lessons. From the age of six to nine, he attended Arnold House, a day school in London, where he studied Greek and Latin. From ten to 13, he went to boarding school in Hertfordshire where he focused on the classics and math. Here, his athletic prowess dominated, but a bout of polio temporarily crippled his abilities. He attended Rugby school during his high school years where he studied the classics, but soon grew bored and switched to science. He gave up playing sports to take botanical excursions where his fascination with mushrooms began. His father joined the British Mycological Society and took his 14-year-old son on one of the forays where Corner had the chance to rub shoulders with pre-eminent mycologists of the time such as Carleton Ray and AHR Buller. In 1923 he went to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He continued studying science and realised how much there was yet to learn. This realisation was lifelong and drove him in the relentless pursuit of knowledge until the day when he could no longer see. At Sidney Sussex College, Corner met and became the disciple of Arthur Harry Church. He initially focused his research on microfungi and the association between fungi and bryophytes. Singapore Because of his stammer, Corner believed he could never hold a teaching position; this led him to enroll in the Colonial Service and he took a position as a mycologist at the Botanical Gardens in Singapore. He was appointed Assistant Director in 1929 and remained in this position until 1946. As the Malaysian forests were being logged for timber, he took several trips there to study the diversity of fungi and plants. It was in these forests that he was first exposed to fig trees. This was the beginning of his systematic reorganisation of the genus Ficus based on breeding systems. From 1934 to 1938, he took several journeys to Malaysia where he discovered many new species of plants. During this period, the value of the Botanical Gardens was being called into question; to illustrate the value of the collection and the diversity of the region as a whole, Corner took it upon himself to write the Wayside Trees of Malaya‚Äîa two volume, 800-page book aimed at amateur naturalists as an aid to identifying trees in the region. The book was the culmination of many years of effort that drew upon his knowledge of flora, months of field activity, examination of herbarium collections and other scientific documentation‚Äî-an effort that encompassed the work of many scientists before him. Corner found help with his collecting from an unusual source: to obtain specimens from the tops of trees that he could not safely reach, Corner trained coconut-collecting macaque monkeys to do the climbing and collect specimens for him while at the Botanic Gardens. In 1942 Singapore surrendered to the invading Japanese forces during WWII. Japan would occupy the region until 1945. Corner went to enlist in the Singapore Volunteer Force, but an attack by one of his collecting monkeys left him unable to participate. Corner was conscripted by the Japanese to protect and preserve the Botanical Gardens' herbarium collection and various library contents from looters during the time of occupation. The Japanese Emperor Hirohito was an orchid enthusiast and approved the decision to keep Corner at his post at the Gardens. While most British subjects were detained in overcrowded prisoner camps and suffered from severe food shortages, Corner was allowed to live outside the prison camps and to lead a somewhat ordinary life. The caveat was that the Japanese identified Corner as an enemy alien and required him to wear a red star. Because of these freedoms, Corner was accused by some of collaborating with the enemy, while in reality he cooperated just enough to keep the herbarium collection safe. Additionally, he smuggled food and other goods to the people detained in the prison camps. He later wrote about his experiences during wartime in his book, \\"The Marquis ‚Äî A Tale of Syoyan-to\\". Post-Singapore When the war ended, Corner returned to England, but two years later, he was off to South America working for UNESCO as Principal Field Scientific Officer for Latin America. He planned to set up a field institute; but this fell through due to conspiracies about breaches of natural security. Undoubtedly, the most important scientific contribution to come from this time was the formation of Corner's Durian Theory. The Durian Theory was Corner's way of explaining how forests evolved to their present form. This theory was based on observations of a suite of morphological anomalies of tropical plants in Malaysia. The morphological features on which his theory was based were fruits with fleshy arils, fruits with distinct black and red coloration and seeds hanging away from the fruit. These features were relatively rare in forest plants as a whole, but they occurred across a broad range of plant families. He postulated that the peculiar characters he observed were ancestral, making them anomalies in present-day forests. For instance, it was his view that the pachycaul tree form, or stumpy little-branched tree with big leaves, was ancestral compared to the leptocaul form, or tall tree with many branches, slender twigs and small leaves. He thought that an increase in tree height was in response to feeding by ground-dwelling animals. An increase in tree height also resulted in an explosion of biodiversity in the canopy due to new niches to fill. Corner returned to England in 1949 when he was appointed Lecturer in Taxonomy and Tropical Botany at the Botany School in Cambridge. Here he was able to work on the botanical and mycological groups he had collected in Singapore. For research on the phytogeography of Ficus he visited Bougainville in 1960 and took part in the Royal Society Expedition to Solomon Islands in 1965. In 1973 he retired as Emeritus Professor. During his retirement, he generated over 2200 printed pages of accepted publications‚Äîmostly in mycological research. Contributions to mycology Corner started his career studying microfungi and published five papers on discomycetes. He then moved on to nectriaceous fungi and was likely the first person to demonstrate the intimate relationship between fungi and bryophytes. Further research regarding the fungal/bryophyte relationship has uncovered many more such associations, and researchers now estimate that more than 2000 exist. One of the qualities that made Corner such a remarkable scientist was his analytical skills; his legacy in mycology resides in the conclusions he was able to draw on fungal morphology and development as well as systematics. During his internment in Singapore, he published on Malaysian wood-rotting polypores, especially economically important ones such as Phellinus noxius. He also worked through the hyphal structure of polypores with descriptions and illustrations of monomitic, dimitic and trimitic hyphal construction. He also made major strides in the systematics of clavarioid fungi. As it stood in 1950, the genus Clavaria was a polyphyletic assemblage of coral-shaped fungi. Corner determined that many species of \\"Clavaria\\" were actually members of different genera, families and even orders. Using spore characteristics, he determined that a genus of clavarioid fungi‚ÄîRamaria‚Äîis closely related to a genus of cantharelloid fungi‚ÄîGomphus. In his research, Corner stressed the importance of understanding the development and anatomy of fungi, which he realised could not be known just by observing one stage of the specimen. Arguably, his most important contribution on fungal development was determining the role of the basidium as a charged ampoule. He also observed basidiospore development in boletoid and tricholomatoid fungi. In addition to working out systematic relationships of many groups of macrofungi, he also wrote monographs of large groups present in southeast Asia. His work on boletes led to the description of 123 new species and culminated in his classic monograph Boletus in Malaysia as well as a supplement which included species in the genus Phylloporus. Corner also wrote monographs on tricholomatoid, cantharelloid, clavarioid and polyporoid fungi, as well as the genus Thelephora. Corner's monographic work has not only aided those who work in tropical mycology but also those working on the groups in temperate ecosystems. Additionally, these monographs provide the framework for helping mycologists understand the extent of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems. Most of his collections, annotated books and illustrations are housed at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. His other collections remain at Cambridge or at the United States National Fungus Collection in Beltsville, MD. Personal life In February 1939, Corner married Sheila Kavanagh in Cambridgeshire. Their first child, John Kavanagh, was born in Singapore in January 1941. The couple also had two daughters, Stephanie Christine Corner born in 1947 in Hanover, New Hampshire, and Dorothy Lindsay Helga Corner in 1948 in Essex. Corner and his wife ultimately divorced in 1952, but he retained custody of his children. He remarried in April 1953 to his daughters' nanny, Helga Dinesen Sondergaard (John K Corner). In 1975, he was diagnosed with glaucoma and then cataracts in both eyes, and by 1983 he was unable to do any more microscopy. Even though his physical capacities declined sharply due to muscular paralysis and he was near blindness, Corner's mental faculties remained sharp until his death in 1996. Corner's son, John, left home at 19, never to see his father again. In 2013 he published a memoir of his father's life and their relationship, My father in his suitcase: In search of E.J.H. Corner, the relentless botanist (Landmark Books, Singapore, 2013, 413 pages, photographs, notes and bibliography, ), based on letters, pictures and other memorabilia his father had saved for him in a suitcase. Although Corner reportedly detested the idea of naming new species after people, he currently has three fungal species and the fungal genera Corneroboletus and Corneroporus named after him, as well as 30 plant species including: Anisophyllea corneri, Calamus corneri, Bulbophyllum corneri, and Platyscapa corneri.

In classical music from Western culture, an augmented second is an interval that, in equal temperament, is sonically equivalent to a minor third, spanning three semitones, and is created by widening a major second by a chromatic semitone.Benward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.54. . Specific example of an A2 not given but general example of major intervals described.Hoffmann, F.A. (1881). Music: Its Theory & Practice, p.89-90. Thurgate & Sons. Digitized Aug 16, 2007. Archaically: redundant or extreme sharp second. For instance, the interval from C to D is a major second, two semitones wide, and the interval from C to D is an augmented second, spanning three semitones.  Usage  Augmented seconds occur in many scales, most importantly the harmonic minor and its various modes. They also occur in the various Gypsy scales (which consist almost entirely of augmented and minor seconds). In harmonic minor scales, the augmented second occurs between the sixth and seventh scale degrees. For example, in the scale of A harmonic minor, the notes F and G form the interval of an augmented second. This distinguishing feature of harmonic minor scales occurs as a consequence of the seventh scale degree having been chromatically raised in order to allow chords in a minor key to follow the same rules of cadence observed in major keys, where the V chord is \\"dominant\\" (that is, contains a major triad plus a minor seventh). Tuning An augmented second is enharmonically equivalent to a minor third () in equal temperament, but is not the same interval in other meantone tunings.

The five flavors were Berry Mixed Up, Chocolate Caramel Craze, Chocolate Insanity, Jamocha Frenzy, and Pi√±a Colada Chaos. The mascot of the beverage, an angry cow fed up with \\"boring milk\\", was also known as The Raging Cow.  Marketing controversy  After the introduction of the beverage in March 2003, there was controversy over the strategy of marketing agency Richards Interactive to capitalize on the then-novel weblog phenomenon. Along with whimsical blogs \\"authored\\" by the product's barnyard mascots, six teenagers were hired to promote the drink in otherwise authentic blogs. Although the intent was to gain a stronger, more credible connection with the young target audience, adult observers saw the tactic as disingenuous and subversive and staged a boycott, which attracted press coverage. The campaign is now regarded as a failure.  Status of the beverage  Since the protest began, the official Raging Cow website has gone offline. An official webpage about the beverage still existed at the Dr Pepper/Seven Up website until mid-2006. At first, the Raging Cow beverages were only available in a few cities across the United States, an example of test marketing. Additional information about the distribution of the beverage was never released. Currently, many Raging Cow vending machines are stocked with other Dr Pepper/Seven Up products.

The band split up in 1993. Their lead singer was Scottish-born Lesley Rankine. The band had a high octane, indie punk metal sound that was set alight by Rankine's distinctive vocals and strongly feminist views.. Famous lyrics \\"Hips, Tits, Lips, Power\\" from the single \\"Big Bad Baby Pig Squeal\\" adorned a popular T-shirt of the time. The other members of the band were; guitarist Andrew \\"Fuzz\\" Duprey; bassist Chris P Mowforth; and drummer Stuart Watson. Founding member Fuzz was a regular \\"face\\" at London indie gigs of the time, and is now a regular DJ at the Dublin Castle pub in Camden Town, London. The band stood out from many of their scene-contemporaries with a lineup that was mixed in terms of both gender and ethnicity and a setlist that was more liberally strewn with expletives than that of anyone else. Silverfish were the main focus of the so- called Camden lurch scene, a term invented by the music press to describe the fact that many of the prominent indie bands (outside of the dominant alternative dance and shoegazing scenes) of the time resided in Camden, and that they lurched. The band's 1980s EPs were collected in a 1990 compilation album called Cockeye. The following year, they released their debut album, Fat Axl, and toured with the band Pigface. In 1992, the group gained wider acclaim with their second album, Organ Fan and supported the band 7 Year Bitch. During the broadcast of a Peel session, BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel summed up their level of success: \\"If they were from New York, we'd be mad for them of course\\". When the band split up in 1993, Rankine moved to Seattle and formed the band Ruby with Mark Walk.

Each heart is printed with a message such as \\"Be Mine\\", \\"Kiss Me\\", \\"Call Me\\", \\"Let's Get Busy\\", or \\"Miss You\\". Sweethearts were made by the New England Confectionery Company, or Necco, before being purchased by the Spangler Candy Company in 2018. They were also previously made by the Stark Candy Company. Necco manufactured nearly 8 billion Sweethearts per year. Similar products are available from Brach's and other companies. A similar type of candy is sold in the UK under the name Love Hearts. History Necco SweetheartsOliver R. Chase invented a machine in 1847 to cut lozenges from wafer candy, similar to Necco Wafers, and started a candy factory.NECCO History Daniel Chase, Oliver's brother, began printing sayings on the candy in 1866. He designed a machine that was able to press on the candy similar to a stamp. The candy was often used for weddings since the candies had witty saying such as: \\"Married in pink, he will take a drink\\", \\"Married in White, you have chosen right\\", and \\"Married in Satin, Love will not be lasting\\". Boxes of Spanish-language Sweethearts The heart-shaped conversation candies to be called Sweethearts got their start in 1901. Other styles were formerly produced such as lozenges, postcards, horseshoes, watches, and baseballs. Line extensions carrying the Sweethearts brand include chocolates and sugar-free hearts. A Sweetheart with the phrase \\"LOL\\", a relatively new phraseIn the 1990s, Necco vice-president Walter Marshall wanted to update some of the sayings and retire others, including \\"Call me\\", \\"Email me\\", and \\"Fax me\\". The romantic expressions continue to be revised for young Americans. Necco received hundreds of suggestions a year on new sayings. Necco produced the hearts year-round, but mixing of colors and packaging were ramped up beginning in September to meet the demand for the product at Valentine's Day. Approximately of hearts were made per day, which sells out in about six weeks.New England Confectionery Comp (2010): Sweethearts The company produces 8 billion hearts per year. Flavor Change In 2010 the classic pastel candy formula was abandoned. Sweethearts were made softer candies with vivid colors and all new flavors, which are more intense and even a bit more sour. These new flavors include sour apple, strawberry, and \\"spring fresh.\\" The drastic changes to the flavors and messages were unpopular with some fans.  Bankruptcy and Return  In 2018 Necco declared bankruptcy. The original plant closed and their candy brands were sold off. The rights to Sweethearts were acquired by Spangler Candy Company. With the purchase of the brand by Spangler, Sweethearts were unavailable for Valentine's Day 2019 as Spangler set up production of the confections in a new plant. Sweethearts returned in 2020 with the original flavors from before Necco's 2010 change, but due to equipment problems the familiar sayings were largely either incomplete or missing entirely.

Breca defeated Beowulf in what, by consensus,R.D. Fulk, ‚ÄúAfloat in Semantic Space: Old English sund and the Nature of Beowulf‚Äôs Exploit with Breca√è, Journal of English & Germanic Philology, vol.104, nr.4 (Oct. 2005) p.458. is described as a swimming match. While dining, Unferth alludes to the story of their contest as a reproach to Beowulf's impulsiveness and foolhardiness, and Beowulf then relates it in detail, explaining how he needed to stop and defeat multiple sea monsters (nicors) during the match, so, although he arrived at the goal after Breca, his was the more worthy journey. In line 522 of Beowulf, Breca is identified as lond Brondinga (‚Äúof the Brondings‚Äô land\\"). Breca is also mentioned in Widsith, an Anglo-Saxon poem (also known, usually by the translations of Benjamin Thorpe, as The Sk√¥p, or The Gleema's Tale, or The Skald's Tale) known only from a 10th-century copy, as the ruler (in some unspecified previous century) of the Brondings (line 25 of Widsith): :: Cassere weold Creacum, ond Caelic Finnum, ... Caesar rules the Greeks, and Caelic the Finns, ... :: Meaca Myrgingum, Mearchealf Hundingum, Meaca the Myrinings, Marchalf the Hundings, :: √æeodric weold Froncum, √æyle Rondingum, Theodoric ruled the Franks, Thyle the Rondings, :: Breoca Brondingum, Billing Wernum, ..... Breca the Brondings, Billing the Wernas, ..... This is presumably the same Breca as mentioned in Beowulf. In Beowulf, Breca is further identified, in line 524, as sunu BƒìanstƒÅnes (‚ÄúBeanstan‚Äôs son‚Äù), as if the name Breca and the mention of Beanstan would be familiar enough to Unferth's audience to adequately identify him (although Beanstan is not otherwise mentioned in any surviving documentTom Shippey, ‚ÄúNames in Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon England‚Äù, in Leonard Neidorf, ed., The Dating of Beowulf: A Reassment (2014, Suffolk, UK, D.S. Brewer) pp.63-64. ). It was long ago theorized that the Brondings and Breca lived on the island of Br√§nn√∂ outside of modern Gothenburg (the second largest city in Sweden).Benjamine Thorpe, Codex Exoniensis: A Collection of Anglo-Saxon Poetry with an English Translation (1842, London, Society of Antiquaries of London) p.514; R.W. Chambers, Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend (1912, Cambridge Univ. Press) p.111. On the other hand, from the mention in Widsith, with the Brondings mentioned immediately before the Wernas (and the Wernas supposedly being the Varini on the Elbe), it has been suggested that the Brondings might have located near them, perhaps in Mecklenburg or Pomerania.Thomas Arnold, Notes on Beowulf (1898, London, Longmans, Green & Co.) p.61. It has even been suggested that the Brondings, whose name suggests the crashing of waves, are entirely mythical.R.W. Chambers, Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend (1912, Cambridge Univ. Press) p.111. The nature of the contest Some scholars have debated whether Beowulf and Breca competed in a swimming match or a rowing match. Ambiguities in the translation of Beowulf have left scholars with multiple interpretations for the Beowulf-Breca ‚Äúswimming‚Äù episode. Karl P. Wentersdorf of Xavier University writes, ‚ÄúAn adventure in which two youths spend seven days and nights swimming at sea is more than extraordinary, particularly since they are carrying heavy iron swords and wearing cumbersome coats of chain mail.‚ÄùKarl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca‚Äù, Studies in Philology 72, no. 2 (spring 1975) p.141; James W. Earl, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Rowing-Match‚Äù, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.285. Such a remarkable feat would not, however, be very incongruous with the poem's other portrayals of Beowulf's heroic prowess. Unferth describes this as a foolhardy contest or race, but when Beowulf offers his own version of events, it becomes a youthful confidence-building or team- building shared challenge, much like a camping or mountaineering trip, in which the two participants endeavored to stay together rather than one leave the other far behind. According to Wentersdorf, the trouble with translation ‚Äúresults from the ambiguity of the word sund in the lines ymb sund flite (line 508) and he √æeaet sunde oferflat (lines 517-518).‚ÄùKarl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca‚Äù, Studies in Philology 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.155; it has been suggested, e.g. by Roberta Frank, that the ambiguity is deliberate. R.D. Funk, Robert E. Bjork, & John D. Niles, Klaeber's Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg (4th ed. 2008, Univ. of Toronto) p.152. Sund, though often translated by scholars as ‚Äúswim‚Äù could, through evolution of language, be interpreted as ‚Äúrowing‚Äù.Karl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca,‚Äù Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.159; James W. Earl, \\"Beowulf's Rowing-Match\\", Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.286. Beowulf and Breca could have been rowing together or competing to see who was the more prodigious rower. The Old English term rƒìon, used twice in this portion of Beowulf (namely lines 513 and 540), is not translated as ‚Äúswim‚Äù in any other Anglo-Saxon poetry.Karl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca‚Äù, Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.159; Scott Gwara, Heroic Identity in the World of Beowulf (2008, Leiden, Netherlands, Brill) p.124. The kennings earmum √æehton (line 514, √æeccean ‚Äúto cover, conceal‚Äù) and mundum brugdon (line 515a, bregdan ‚Äúto pull, move quickly, swing, draw‚Äù), used by Unferth to describe Beowulf's match against Breca, are applicable to both swimming and rowing.Karl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca‚Äù, Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.160; R.D. Fulk, ‚ÄúAfloat in Semantic Space: Old English sund and the Nature of Beowulf‚Äôs Exploit with Breca‚Äù, Journal of English & Germanic Philology, vol.104, nr.4 (Oct. 2005) p.460. Twice in this portion (lines 514 and 540) that sund is used is in the same lines as rƒìon, and both times forming the three-word phrase on sund rƒìon, which would seem to mean \\"rowing on the sea\\"In Frederick M. Biggs, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Fight with the Nine Nicors‚Äù, Review of English Studies, vol.53 n.s., nr.211 (2002) p.312, these are considered to be an ‚Äúunambiguous reference to rowing‚Äù; also James W.

Vitellius Axv in the British Museum, with a Transcription and Notes (1882, London, Early English Text Society) pages 25-26 and the photographs facing those pages. The line numbers assigned by Zapitza are used throughout this article. Onsund is found in a lot of other Anglo-Saxon artifacts.Joseph Bosworth, An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, edited & enlarged by T. Northcote Toller (1882, Oxford, Clarendon Press) vol.1, p.759, s.v. on-sund. In Icelandic, at least, sund requires a preposition, not found here in Beowulf, to mean swimming rather than merely something aquatic.James W. Earl, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Rowing-Match‚Äù, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.287. Unferth also uses the phrases wada cunnedon (line 509), ‚Äúmade trial of the waters‚Äù, and glidon ofer garsecg (line 515), ‚Äúglided over the sea‚Äù during his description of Beowulf's match against Breca.Karl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca,‚Äù Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.161. Both terms are equally applicable to swimming and rowing. Rowing was, as much as swimming or water-wrestling, an essential skill for warriors during the Anglo-Saxon era, so a rowing competition between Beowulf and Breca would not have been out of the question. Although there are Nordic tales of swimming competitions, no other has characteristics of such extreme duration and danger as this - which, strictly speaking, was not a race but merely a testing of their own strength.Martin Puhvel, \\"The Aquatic Contest in Halfdanar Saga Bronufostra and Beowulf's Adventure with Breca\\", Neuphilologische Mitteilungen, vol.99, nr. 2 (1998) p.131 et seq.; James W. Earl, \\"Beowulf's Rowing-Match\\", Neophilogus, vol. 63, nr. 2 (April 1979) pp.287-288; Peter A. Jorgensen, \\"Beowulf's Swimming Contest with Breca: Old Norse Parallels\\", Folklore, vol.89 nr.1 (1978) p.52 et seq.; Karl P. Wentersdorf, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Adventure with Breca,‚Äù Studies in Philology 72, no. 2 (spring 1975) p.140 et seq. Moreover, the duration of the challenge seems to make rowing more likely than swimming; seven days and nights immersed in Scandinavian waters, in winter no less (line 516), evidently without food nor an opportunity to go ashore for sleep or warmth, seems lethal (and certainly more arduous than Diana Nyad‚Äôs five attempts - only the last one successful - to swim from Cuba to Miami, each effort lasting only 2¬Ω days). Additionally, the text refers to Beowulf as fleotan (line 543) - ‚Äúfloating‚Äù,William Nelles, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Sorhfullne Si√∞ with Breca‚Äù, Neophilologus, vol.83 nr.2 (April 1999) page 300. and being on sidne s√¶ (line 508), and on de√≥p w√¶ter (line 510) - ‚Äúupon the wide sea‚Äù and ‚Äúupon the deep water‚Äù and similar expressions‚Äîputting him consistently atop or above the water, rather than in or under the water. In line 515, he is described as having glidon ofer garsecg - ‚Äúglided over / above the surf‚Äù; again, an image more in keeping with rowing than swimming. Further, in line 581, fatigued from his struggles with the sea monsters, Beowulf was carried by the currents to the land of the Finns (presumably a great distance) - and here the original manuscript's text clearlyVery clearly. Julius Zupitza, Beowulf, Autotypes of the Unique Cotton MS. Vitellius Axv in the British Museum, with a Transcription and Notes (1882, London, Early English Text Society), after providing both a photograph and printed transcript of the manuscript page, says for the reading wudu weallendu, ‚Äúwudu, not wadu, without the least doubt; an a open at the top does not occur so late in English MSS.‚Äù (p.28); and quoted by Fred C. Robinson, ‚ÄúElements of the Marvelous in the Characterization of Beowulf: A Reconsideration of the Evidence‚Äù, in Peter S. Baker, ed., The Beowulf Reader (2000, NY, Routledge) page 94. reads wudu weallendu - wudu, a word related to ‚Äúwood‚Äù and often meaning ‚Äúboat‚Äù (or perhaps ‚Äúraft‚Äù), as it does in lines 216, 298 and elsewhere, so that Beowulf was carried to the Finns on a tossing, quaking boat;James W. Earl, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Rowing-Match‚Äù, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.286; Frederick M. Biggs, ‚ÄúBeowulf‚Äôs Fight with the Nine Nicors‚Äù, Review of English Studies, vol.53 n.s., nr.211 (2002) p.313, not necessarily the boat he started with, but perhaps a raft or boat found or hastily constructed after his struggle with the sea monsters. however, several editors and translators saw an obscure difficulty (between the masculine wudu and the neuter weallendu) and insisted on changing the wudu (‚Äúboat‚Äù) to wadu (‚Äúwater‚Äù), making it appear that Beowulf was carried to the Finns on ‚Äúsurging water‚Äù (and, naturally, translators relying on the printed Anglo-Saxon text worked up by such editors were innocently led to the same result).R.D. Fulk, ‚ÄúAfloat in Semantic Space: Old English sund and the Nature of Beowulf‚Äôs Exploit with Breca‚Äù, Journal of English & Germanic Philology, vol.104, nr.4 (Oct. 2005) pp.463-464; James W.

Significance of the story  The story of the aquatic adventure with Breca is introduced into the Beowulf saga for a number of reasons. First, we are introduced to Unferth, evidently a significant member of Hrothgar's court, but we are immediately encouraged to dislike him, because we are told he is motivated by envy and wishes to embarrass Hrothgar's honored guest. Second, it enables the introduction of a separate story (coming before the confrontation with Grendel) attesting, after a fashion, to Beowulf's strength, courage, and resourcefulness. Third, it tells us that Beowulf has already overcome monsters other than Grendel - several of them - so that he is suited for the challenge he faces. When he tells his side of the story, Beowulf manages to include some rude rebuffs to Unferth (the mention of Unferth killing his kin may be nothing more than slanging, just as modern American patois uses an accusation of ‚Äòa particular form of incest‚Äô). Further in the saga, when Heriot is being attacked by Grendel's Mother, we shall see Unferth approach Beowulf in humility, offering his own family's heirloom sword. In popular culture * Breca appears as a main character, portrayed by G√≠sli √ñrn Gar√∞arsson, in Beowulf: Return to the Shieldlands, which depicts him and Beowulf as having become companions as adults after Beowulf saved Breca from a lynch mob.
