It is found at an elevation of . The lake occupies three distinct basins. A public access is co-located at the Clinton Converse DNR Forestry Campground at the south end of the eastern basin. Based on 2009 data, development is considered moderate, with 17.2 homes/cabins per shoreline mile. The maximum depth is and about 48% of the lake is deep or less. Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble, boulders and muck are also present. The aquatic plant community is quite diverse and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants such as bulrush are common along much of the shoreline, however just as common are numerous gaps in these beds along shorelines with developed lots. The remaining emergent plants should be protected as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and providing essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. Washburn Lake was named for an early lumberman.

Biography  Jean Yves Lechevallier grew up surrounded by blueprints, sketches and models, as his father was an architect. His first known carving was of a stone brought back from a holiday trip to Les Baux-de-Provence. A few years later, he held his first solo exhibition in 1961 at age 15, a showing of hand carved animal sculptures (Proven√ßal Stone) at the Prigent Gallery in Rouen. In 1966, at age 20, he got his first commission from a family friend and urban architect (Robert Louard) who was in charge of new construction on an island in Rouen. He graduated from the Regional School of Fine Arts in Rouen and the ENSAD, Higher School of Visual arts and Design in Paris. His first job was as a scale model builder/creator for the architect Badini.  Art  Jean Yves Lechevallier is influenced by the thoughts of sculptor and poet Jean Arp, especially his Nature in Sculpture and Sculpture in Nature. His work is rather diverse in terms of materials, composition, and style: he creates low reliefs, high reliefs, murals, mosa√Øcs, caryatids and monumental pieces. His preferred materials are: exotic woods, stone and marble; metals such as copper, aluminium, bronze or stainless steel; polyester and concrete, sometimes reinforced with fiber inclusion. In fact, his particularities motivated a cement manufacturer to create a special mixture called cridofibre which is a registered trademark today. Beginning in the post-WWII reconstruction years, thanks to culture-promoting politics and subsidized support for the arts in France, Lechevallier's work was commissioned by both municipal government and the French State. These works are part of the architectural landscape today in many cities throughout France, mainly in Normandy, Paris and the Riviera. They can be seen in public gardens, public squares, schools, fire and police stations, institutions of higher education, residential complexes as well as in some preserved natural areas such as La Croix des Gardes forest parkland above the city of Cannes. Lechevallier specializes in monumental open-air pieces. As Corinne Schuler says in Sentiers de la Sculpture: \\"By forcing art into confined spaces, you lose so much in terms of its beauty.\\" Two specific examples of this are Point d'orgue and Croix des Gardes: * Point d'orgue hangs on the rocks at the entrance to the tunnel, on the main highway leading to Monaco. Its convex polished steel surfaces reflect the changing colors of it natural light environment, from the soft dawn to the bright glare of high noon, but reflects the car headlights and road signals once the sun begins to set. * Croix des Gardes is a sparkling steel structure atop a hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and represents the ancient tradition of horizon- dominating high-altitude constructions. Because of its altitude, warning lights attached to its upper framework indicate its presence to planes landing at the nearby Nice airport. Another one of Lechevallier's specialties is Fountains, demonstrating how water movement and sound can make a sculpture sing. Among these: * Fountain Cristaux, in Paris, an homage to the musician B√©la Bart√≥k is a sculptural transcription of the composer's research on tonal harmony. * Fountain Polypores in Paris, featured in the musical film by Alain Resnais, Same Old Song.  Notable works  * Voile (sail), Isle Lacroix, Rouen, 1966 * Fountain Fleurs d'eau (Water Flowers) on the banks of the Seine river, Rouen, 1975 * Fountain Cristaux, Homage to B√©la Bart√≥k in square B√©la Bart√≥k, Paris, 1980 * Fountain Polypores inspired by the Polyporus mushrooms, Paris, 1983 *Fountain Concretion, Th√©oule-sur-Mer, 1987 *Humakos V, Peymeinade, 1989 *La Croix des Gardes where religious services are held on occasions, 1990 *Aile Entrav√©e (Fettered Wing) designed during the Gulf War, Gardens of the Fine Arts Museum in Menton, 1991 *Point d'orgue, Tunnel to Monaco, 1992 *Structuration F1 for Ferrari in Maranello Italie, incorporating the F1 body created for Michael Schumacher, 2002 *Fountain Spirale, Saint- Tropez, 2007 *Fountain Fungia, Draguignan, 2007 * Red Love, 2009 More commissioned works exist, being held by private companies and collectors in Germany, France, Monaco, and the US.

History The first recorded mention of Bhutan Clearing competing at any level of football in Bhutan is in 2012, when they competed in the B-Division, the third tier of football in Bhutan, when RSSSF reported a team known as Bhutan Clearance competing, though their final position is not recorded. The B-Division is the division below the A-Division, the competition which provides the Thimphu-based qualifiers for the National League. Despite this being a traditionally Thimphu-centred competition, Bhutan Clearing competed and were the only team from outside Thimphu to do so. Their final position is not known, although they can have finished no higher than third, as the final play-off match was contested by BMW FC and Motithang. The only known results for the club from this season are a 4‚Äì2 victory over Rigzung and a 3‚Äì0 defeat of the Bhutan national under sixteen team. In 2014, they entered the National League for the first time, one of two teams in addition to Ugyen Academy from outside Thimphu who did. Unfortunately, their first appearance in the National League was a disappointing one, as they finished last in the league, their only point coming from a 2‚Äì2 draw with Druk Star. Additionally, outside of this draw, they only scored two more goals, one each against Druk Pol and Druk United and also suffered a 0‚Äì16 defeat to Thimphu City. In 2017 they dissolved due to financial reasons.

The film was followed by the controversial Let Me Tell Ya 'bout Black Chicks in 1985. Synopsis A group of African-American men, mostly petty criminals, gathered in a room are talking about their experiences with white women. It is soon revealed that one of them (Tony El-Ay) never had sex with a white woman. Furthermore, he rejects the very idea and his friends try to convince him by praising white women.

Thousands of them are still freely roaming forested areas on the Island of Hawai ªi. It was listed as \\"extinct\\" in The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, published by the FAO in 2007; it is not among the cattle breeds reported to DAD-IS by the National Animal Germplasm Program of the USDA Agricultural Research Service. History The Great Wall of Kuakini protecting from wild cattle roaming through Kailua (expanded older wall originally built to stop pigs and dogs). In 1793 and in 1794 Captain George Vancouver gave four bulls and eight cows to Hawaiian king Kamehameha I. Kamehameha placed a kapu (Hawaiian taboo), which was not lifted until 1830, on the hunting of the feral cattle . As a consequence by 1846 25,000 cattle were roaming the countryside in addition to 10,000 semi-domesticated cattle. The huge herds were destroying crops and sometimes even killing people so hunting was begun to reduce numbers of animals. In 1832 Kamehameha III invited vaqueros from California, then part of Mexico, to train native Hawaiians in managing the wild livestock, which led to the development of Hawaiian cowboys - paniolos. The trampled dead body of Scottish botanist David Douglas (discoverer of the Douglas fir) was found in 1834 in a bullock pit on Mauna Kea. Those traps were known for catching people, but the possibility of murder was considered in this case. Feral cattle contributed significantly to the decline of many plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. Today the Department of Land and Natural Resources' (DLNR) Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) is involved in feral cattle eradication, organizing lotteries for special access feral cattle control. The hunt is not easy as animals have, over the generations, become smaller and wild. Similarly the local feral sheep have developed longer legs. Vehicles frequently hit cows congregated on roads enjoying the sun heated asphalt. The local legend of \\"invisible cows\\" on Mauna Kea originates from these crashes. Road signs warning against cows in darkness or fog are common.

Formerly in the Hundred of Cilgerran, Capel Colman is a small, rural parish of some surrounded by the larger parishes of Cilgerran, Manordeifi, Clydau, Penrydd and Llanfihangel Penbedw. The parish is in the Manordeifi group in the Church in Wales Diocese of St David's. The parish is named in some historical sources as Llangolman, but this is not to be confused with Llangolman, a village a few miles to the south of Capel Colman. History The recorded history of Capel Colman can be traced back at least to the 14th century, when it was a chapelry in the parish of Manordeifi. It was marked on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. In 1594 it was a Crown property which was subsequently abandoned until it was re-endowed by the Anglican Church in the 18th century. There was a parish school in Capel Colman: David Jones is listed as schoolmaster in 1737. The population of the parish in 1801 was 71, the majority of whom worked in agriculture. In Liber ecclesiasticus, an 1835 report on the state of the established church, Capel Colman is described as a parish with a population of 130, valued at ¬£72, patron Morgan Jones Esq. In the mid-19th century about of the parish were woodland with the rest split between arable land and pasture. Corn, butter and cheese were the principal produce. The Lord of the Manor in 1849 was Pryse Pryse. Wilson's Gazeteer of 1872 described Capel Colman as a parish of 770 acres with a population of 157 living in 30 houses with Miss Jones of Cilwendeg the patron. By 1961 the population of the parish had risen to 171. Church of St Colman The church is dedicated to St Colman, an Irish saint of the 6th or 7th century; however, as there were several saints of the same name it is not clear which is referred to. The present building dates from around 1720, having previously been abandoned; it was later rebuilt and restored, and is now a listed building. The font is mediaeval. The church was rebuilt in 1837 for Morgan Jones of Cilwendeg but was reported as in need of repair in 1859. It was refurbished again in the 1890s. Some sources describe St Colman as a chapel (hence the name of the parish), and some a church, and it may have been a chapel for Cilwendeg (see below) as it stands at the edge of Cilwendeg Park. It is referred to as a chapelry in tithe documents of the mid-18th century, and church appointments for 1771-2 are listed on the CCE database. Extant parish records include Bishops Transcripts (1806‚Äì1878), baptisms (1813‚Äì1987), marriages (1770‚Äì1970) and burials (1824‚Äì1991), all held at the National Library of Wales. Capel Colman parish is in the benefice of the Manordeifi Group in the Church in Wales. The parish was a joint perpetual curacy with the rector of Llanfihangel Penbedw from the 19th century. The Clergy List for 1841 notes that A. Brigstoke had been curate since 1833. In 1866 T Rogers was the incumbent, followed in 1888 by David Worthington, replacing David Lewis. In 1878 a Harvest Thanksgiving Service was held in the church in the morning, and at Llanfihangel Penbedw in the afternoon with sermons and services in English and Welsh by clergy from several neighbouring parishes. All the clergy were invited to dinner by Mrs Lloyd of Kilrhue. A major improvement in the church was made in 1895. The Western Mail reported: :\\"One of the very few remaining old churches of the upper portion of Pembrokeshire...Capel Colman, near Boncath, is being replaced by a new and handsome sacred edifice, which will be opened at the end of June. Since the appointment of the Rev. W.G. Phillips to the living of Capel Colman and Llanfihangel Penbedw, rapid strides have been made, until at the present time the number of communicants have reached 80. Mr Phillips has not only succeeded in raising a very handsome vicarage, but he has also taken in hand the restoration of his Parish Church with a like success, and in aid thereof a most successful and well-attended bazaar and open-air fete was held in the beautiful grounds of Cilwendeg...which was opened by Mrs Wodehouse (Pentre) in the presence of a large number of spectators.\\" In 1897 Rev. Morris James Marsden BA was appointed to the Perpetual Curacy of Capel Colman and Rectory of Llanfihangel Penbedw. Cilwendeg House Lodges at one of the entrances to Cilwendeg Cilwendeg Shell House Hermitage Cilwendeg House, described as one of the most important mansions in Pembrokeshire, dates from the late 18th century and was built on the site of a former property dating back to the 1500s. It is a Grade-II listed building, along with other structures associated with it, either Grade-II or Grade-II*. The earliest recorded incumbents in the early 16th century were named Llewelyn, and in the early 17th century it was acquired by lawyer Jacob Morgan. In the 18th century it passed by marriage to the Jones family. In 1780 the house was rebuilt by Morgan Jones senior. Lewis's Topographical Dictionary (1849) describes Cilwendeg as: :\\"...an elegant mansion, erected within the last seventy years, is ornamented with a receding portico in good taste, and occupies the centre of an extensive demesne, beautifully laid out in plantations and pleasure-grounds, to which are entrances by two handsome lodges, more recently built; the lawn in front of the house embraces a view of some of the finest scenery in the county, including the luxuriant woods around Fynnonau.\\" One of the features of the property is the Grade II* listed Shell House built in the late 1820s which was restored with the support of local residents and the Temple Trust in 2004. A more detailed description of the house and extensive array of outbuildings is given in the 2004 book Pembrokeshire. The 21 bedroom mansion was a care home from 1952 to 2010. Cilwendeg Park is the venue for Teifi Valley Motor Club's annual Rali Cilwendeg, and Cilwendeg Farm hosted the 2013 Urdd Eisteddfod. The estate was sold into private ownership in 2015, and the house has undergone a restoration for opening in 2019 as a residential and event venue.

Career Nik Speakman started a finance company, Personal Money Management, aged 17 and was working as a success coach at the time of his and Eva's 2005 appearance in That's Rich, a Granada Television series focusing on entrepreneurs in the north west of England. Eva Speakman ran the Heavenly Bodies gym in Oldham, at the time of the show. The Speakmans were subsequently hosts of a Living TV show, A Life Coach Less Ordinary, and in 2007 published a book, You Can Be Fantastic, Too!. The couple hosted a television pilot for the American FOX network, Panic Attack, in 2010. A second daytime television show, The Speakmans, was broadcast by ITV. In The Speakmans they attempted to 'successfully treat ordinary people with extraordinary problems'. The show aired for 20 episodes, beginning on 14 July 2014. The couple are resident therapists on ITV's This Morning, hosting a segment about issues and anxiety disorders ranging from Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder to fears, phobias and Post-traumatic stress disorder. The Speakmans use 'schema conditioning psychotherapy' to 'find and tackle the root cause of anxiety disorders'. Nik Speakman said of their approach on their television series that \\"We're really hoping people will look at it and think: 'I can apply that to my life.' Even if it‚Äôs an entirely different problem, ultimately our therapy is the same...That‚Äôs what we want. There's no need for anyone to suffer. There is absolute hope for everyone.\\" The Speakmans also believe in \\"practising gratitude\\", asserting that \\"Everybody‚Äôs got problems and issues but equally everybody has got amazing things to be thankful for.\\" Therapeutic techniques utilized by the couple include putting clients into a DeLorean sports car in order to 'travel 'back to the future' to confront past demons', a reference to the DeLorean time machine from the Back to the Future film series. The Speakmans presented a DeLorean car to the former Liberal Member of Parliament for Rochdale, Sir Cyril Smith, to help raise over ¬£3,000 for Rochdale Childer Charity at his 80th birthday party in 2008. Noted celebrity clients of the Speakmans have included Vicky Pattison, Peter Andre, Kerry Katona, Kym Marsh, Liz McClarnon, Katie Price, Holly Willoughby and Jeremy Kyle. The Speakmans have diplomas in an unspecified subject from Newcastle University, but are not accredited psychotherapists. The Speakmans developed their own therapy, Visual Schema Displacement Therapy (VSDT) and the first research study into this was carried out by academics at Utrecht University and Amsterdam University, who tested it against eye movement desentization and reprocessing (EDMR), which is recommended by the NHS as one of the main treatments for Post-traumatic stress disorder. The results showed that VSDT was superior to both EMDR and a control condition. In December 2015, The Speakmans appeared on BBC Radio 2's Breakfast Show with Sara Cox Personal life The Speakmans have lived in Littleborough near Rochdale in Greater Manchester since 2000. The Speakmans converted their house from a former pub and restaurant into a nine-bedroomed house. The couple put their house up for sale in 2010 as they worked on the Panic Attack pilot in the United States, and planned to move to the south of England owing to their work in London and America.

This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as \\"At Risk, Naturally Uncommon\\" by the Department of Conservation. Taxonomy This species was first described by Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1877 and named Zelotherses robusta. Butler used specimens from James Hector that were collected on the Canterbury Plains. Later in the same publication, thinking he was describing a separate species, Butler also named this moth Steganoptycha negligens. In 1883 Edward Meyrick placed the species within the genus Eurythecta and synonymised both names given to the species by Butler. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1928 publication The Moths and Butterflies of New Zealand. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description Butler described the species as follows: Meyrick noted that the species is extremely variable in colour. Distribution E. robusta is endemic to New Zealand. The species has been found in North, Mid and South Canterbury. The type locality of this species is likely Yaldhurst/West Melton in Christchurch and this area is now largely modified by the development of lifestyle blocks. The species has occurred at Kaitorete Spit, Gore Bay, Porters Pass, McLeans Island, and has surviving populations at Ashburton, and at the mouths of the Rangitata and Hinds rivers. Hudson stated that the species had been collected at Alexandra and Ben Lomond but there is some doubt as to whether this is the case. Biology and behaviour The females of E. robust are flightless. Adult males are on the wing from September until January. Host plants and habitat The larvae feed on low mat-forming herbs and turf plants. The favoured habitat of the species consists of open stony grounds or coastal grassland habitat. Conservation status This species has been classified as having the \\"At Risk, Naturally Uncommon\\" conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The main threat to this species is the destruction of its original habitat both by urban development and by farming practises.

Missions  Today, the UIA is an association open to all lawyers from around the world,Jacques Attali, Demain, qui gouvernera le monde ?, √âditions Fayard, 2011, p. 418 general or specialized, and brings together several thousand members and 200 bar associations, federations, and associations from 110 countries. Multilingual and multicultural, the UIA is the only major international lawyers organisation to have eight official languages (French, English, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Arabic, and Chinese) and to work in three working languages: French, English, and Spanish. Moreover, the UIA has built more than 43 commissions composed of lawyers from jurisdictions spanning the globe. These lawyers practice in law firms, businesses, or public institutions. Each commission monitors the evolution occurring in a particular legal field (or practice)\\" R√®glement des conflits: Les avocats y planchent - Leconomiste.com \\" and determines how these changes will affect or be affected by other legal fields. All UIA commissions collaborate to keep each other informed of their respective developments and findings. The UIA's commissions and working groups are divided into two principal fields: Business Law and General Practice and Human Rights  Business Law  The UIA commissions and working groups in business law focus on competition law, contracts, bankruptcy, corporate law, labour, intellectual property law, tax, banking, mergers and acquisitions, mediation, the international sale of goods, and foreign investments, among many other practice areas. The UIA collaborates with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and notably presented a proposition for the definition of a \\"center of principal interests\\" (articles 2b) and 16-3 of the UNCITRAL law on international insolvency. Every year, the UIA organises numerous seminars on international subjects. The UIA's events allow participants to meet colleagues, establish professional contacts and to debate questions about current events and controversial legal topics. For its annual congress, the UIA creates working sessions for its commissions. These commissions produce reports accessible to all UIA members and organise congressional joint-sessions. Each year, one or more principal themes are established for the Congress, inciting national and international legal and economic experts to engage in fruitful debate.  Protection of lawyers and Human Rights  The UIA intervenes throughout the world in favour of lawyers who are imprisoned or persecuted for practising their profession. Since 1971, the UIA has benefited from its special consultative status in the United Nations and the European Council. Through the European Council, the UIA produced a policy recommendation concerning money launderingCHAPPUIS, Benoit., \\" Le secret de l'avocat face aux exigences de la lutte contre le blanchiment d'argent : l'avis de la Cour europ√©enne des droits de l'homme. \\", Forum poenale, vol.

Since its creation, the UIA has organised annual congresses in locations all over the world for members and non-members to discuss legal topics in an international forum. According to UIA Statutes, the organisation must convene a Congress at least once every two years. Between 1929 and 1938, UIA congresses were mainly annual.

Biography  Najm was born during the 15th-century in Isfahan, and belonged to a prominent family which could trace its existence in Isfahan back to the 1440s. He had a brother named Mahmud Beg Khuzani. In 1509/10, Najm succeeded Amir Najm al-Din Mas'ud Gilani in the vakil office, and later in 1512, he, along with the Timurid prince Babur attacked the marauding Uzbeks, who had although suffered a heavy defeat in 1510 by Shah Ismail I, kept making incursions into the eastern Safavid province of Khorasan. It is disputed whether Najm led the attack without approval from Ismail I or not. After having crossed the Oxus River, Najm seized Qarshi, and had the city sacked and its inhabitants brutally massacred, which resulted in the death of over 1,500 men, and even children and women. A small Sayyid community was also massacred by the army of Najm, the prominent poet Maulana Binai being one of them. Najm then attacked Ghazdewan, a town near Bukhara, but was unable to capture the town. Babur then advised Najm to retreat to Qarshi in order to wait for reinforcements. Najm, however, declined, which resulted in the mutiny of several Qizilbash chieftains who had been with him during his campaign. On November, a battle ensured at Ghazdewan between the Uzbeks and what was left of the army of Najm, which resulted in his defeat and capture. He was shortly executed, and was succeeded by Abd al-Baqi Yazdi in the vakil office.

Built in 1901, it is a surviving reminder of a short-lived trolley service that served the town until 1930. The building now houses the town's police and fire departments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Plaistow Carhouse is located in Plaistow's central village, at the southeast corner of Elm Street and Palmer Avenue. It is a brick structure, consisting of a large structure in which trolleys were serviced, and a smaller area originally used as an office and waiting room. The service area measures , and is covered by a flat roof with a monitor section at the center. The office is two stories in height, also with a flat roof, and is five bays wide and two deep. The carhouse was built in 1901 for the Haverhill, Plaistow & Newton Street Railway, which introduced service that year between Plaistow, Haverhill, and Amesbury, Massachusetts. This company was eventually consolidated into one providing service as far as New Hampshire's seacoast. The company provided year-round service to the industrial employment centers of Haverhill and Amesbury, with seacoast service running mainly in the warmer months. Coastal service was abandoned in 1920, and altogether by 1930. The Plaistow carhouse is one of several to survive in southern New Hampshire, but is one that is the least altered. It was designed by the New York City firm Sheaff & Jaastad. After trolley service was discontinued, the building was used as a storage facility by an amusement company, and was purchased by the town in 1979, which has since adapted it to house the town's fire and police services.

She was the only child of Pedro I born out of wedlock who was officially legitimized by him. On 24 May 1826, Isabel Maria was given the title of \\"Duchess of Goi√°s\\", the style of Highness and the right to use the honorific \\"Dona\\" (Lady). She was the first person to hold the rank of duke in the Empire of Brazil. These honors did not confer on her the status of Brazilian princess or place her in the line of succession. In his will, Pedro I gave her a share of his estate. She later lost her Brazilian title and honors upon her 17 April 1843 marriage to a foreigner, Ernst Fischler von Treuberg, Count of Treuberg. Pedro I wished for Isabel to be treated as a Princess of Brazil at the same level with his legitimate daughters. He accorded her equivalent official honors, such as having her greeted by the Imperial guard and in naming her protector of the province of Goi√°s. He unsuccessfully tried to have her raised among his legitimate children in the Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, but both his first, and later his second empress, refused.

Offloading to a coprocessor can be used to accelerate applications including; image rendering and mathematical calculations. Offloading computing to an external platform over a network can provide computing power and overcome hardware limitations of a device, such as limited computational power, storage, and energy.  History  The first concepts of stored-program computers were developed in the design of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose digital computer. The ENIAC was limited in performance to single tasks which led to the development of the EDVAC which would become the first computer designed to perform instructions of various types. Developing computing technologies facilitated the increase in performance of computers, and subsequently has led to a variety of configurations and architecture. The first instances of computation offloading were the use of simple sub-processors to handle Input/output processing through a separate system called Channel I/O. This concept improved overall system performance as the mainframe only needed to set parameters for the operations while the channel processors carried out the I/O formatting and processing. During the 1970s, coprocessors began being used to accelerate floating-point arithmetic faster than earlier 8-bit and 16-bit processors which used software. As a result, math coprocessors became common for scientific and engineering calculations. Another form of coprocessor was the graphics coprocessor. As image processing became more popular, specialized graphics chips began being used to offload the creation of images from the CPU. Coprocessors were common in most computers, however, declined in usage due to the development in microprocessor technologies which integrated many coprocessor functions. Dedicated graphics processing units, however, are still widely used for their effectiveness in many tasks including; image processing, machine learning, parallel computing, computer vision, and physical simulation. The concept of time-sharing, the sharing of computing resources, was first implemented by John McCarthy. At the time, mainframe computing was not practical due to the costs associated with purchasing and maintaining mainframe computers. Time-sharing was a viable solution for this problem as computing time could be available to smaller companies. In the 1990s telecommunications companies started offering virtual private network (VPN) services. This allowed companies to balance traffic on servers which resulted in an effective use of bandwidth. The cloud symbol became synonymous with the interaction between providers and users. This computing extended past network servers and allowed computing power to be available to users through time- sharing. The availability of virtual computers allowed users to offload tasks from a local processor. In 1997 distributed.net sought to obtain volunteer computing to solve computational intensive tasks by using the performance of networked PCs. This concept known as grid computing was associated with cloud computing systems. The first concept of linking large mainframes to provide an effective form of parallelism was developed in the 1960s by IBM. Cluster computing was used by IBM was to increase hardware, operating system, and software performance while allowing users to run existing applications. This concept gained momentum during the 1980s as high-performance microprocessors and high-speed networks, tools for high performance distributed computing, emerged. Clusters could efficiently split and offload computation to individual nodes for increased performance while also gaining scalability.  Concept  Computational tasks are handled by a central processor which executes instructions by carrying out rudimentary arithmetic, control logic, and input/output operations. The efficiency of computational tasks is dependent on the instructions per seconds that a CPU can perform which vary with different types of processors. Certain application processes can be accelerated by offloading tasks from the main processor to a coprocessor while other processes might require an external processing platform. = Hardware Acceleration = Hardware offers greater possible performance for certain tasks when compared to software. The use of specialized hardware can perform functions faster than software processed on a CPU. Hardware has the benefit of customization which allows for dedicated technologies to be used for distinct functions. For example, a graphics processing unit (GPU), which consists of numerous low-performance cores, is more efficient at graphical computation than a CPU which features fewer, high power, cores. Hardware accelerators, however, are less versatile when compared to a CPU. = Cloud Computing = Cloud Computing refers to both the applications transported over the Internet and the hardware and software in the data centers that provide services; which include data storage and computing. This form of computing is reliant on high- speed internet access and infrastructure investment. Through network access, a computer can migrate part of its computing to the cloud. This process involves sending data to a network of data centers that have access to computing power needed for computation. = Cluster Computing = Cluster computing is a type of parallel processing system which combines interconnected stand-alone computers to work as a single computing resource. Clusters employ a parallel programming model which requires fast interconnection technologies to support high-bandwidth and low latency for communication between nodes. In a shared memory model, parallel processes have access to all memory as a global address space. Multiple processors have the ability to operate independently but they share the same memory, therefore, changes in memory by one processor are reflected on all other processors. = Grid Computing = Grid computing is a group of networked computers that work together as a virtual supercomputer to perform intensive computational tasks, such as analyzing huge sets of data. Through the cloud, it is possible to create and use computer grids for purposes and specific periods. Splitting computational tasks over multiple machines significantly reduces processing time to increase efficiency and minimize wasted resources. Unlike with parallel computing, grid computing tasks usually have no time dependency associated with them, but instead, they use computers that are part of the grid only when idle, and users can perform tasks unrelated to the grid at any time.  Advantages  There are several advantages in offloading computation to an external processor: * External processing units can offer greater computational performance, storage, and flexibility when compared to a local computer. * Computational limitations of a device could be ignored by offloading the workload to other systems with better performance and resources. Other aspects of the device could be improved including; energy consumption, cost, and portability. * Enterprises that require hardware to perform business do not have to allocate resources towards information technology and infrastructure development. * Cluster computing is more cost-effective than a single computer and is much more flexible in terms of adding more processing units.  Limitations  There are several limitations in offloading computation to an external processor: * Cloud computing services have issues regarding downtime, as outages can occur when service providers are overloaded with tasks. * External computing requires network dependency which could lead to downtime if a network connection runs into issues. * Computing over a network introduces latency which is not desired for latency-sensitive applications, including autonomous driving and video analytics. * Cloud Providers are not always secure, and in an event of a security breach, important information could be disclosed. * Modern computers integrate various technologies including; graphics, sound hardware, and networking within the main circuit board which makes many hardware accelerators irrelevant. * Using cloud services removes individual control over the hardware and forces users to trust that cloud providers will maintain infrastructure and properly secure their data.  Application  = Cloud Services = Cloud services can be described by 3 main cloud service models: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Software as a service (SaaS) is an externally hosted service which can be easily accessed by a consumer through a web browser. Platform as a service (PaaS) is a development environment where software can be built, tested, and deployed without the user having to focus on building and maintaining computational infrastructure. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is access to an infrastructure's resources, network technology, and security compliance which can be used by enterprises to build software. Cloud computing services provide users with access to large amounts of computational power and storage not viable on local computers without having significant expenditure. = Mobile Cloud Computing = Mobile devices, such as smartphones and wearable devices, are limited in terms of computational power, storage, and energy. Despite the constant development in key components including; CPU, GPU, memory, and wireless access technologies; mobile devices need to be portable and energy efficient. Mobile cloud computing is the combination of cloud computing and mobile computing, in which mobile devices perform computation offloading to balance the power of the cloud for accelerating application execution and saving energy consumption. In this computation offloading, a mobile device migrates part of its computing to the cloud. This process involves application partitioning, offloading decision, and distributed task execution. = Video Gaming = Video games are electronic games that involve input, an interaction with a user interface, and generate output, usually visual feedback on a video display device. These input/output operations rely on a computer and its components, including the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage. Game files are stored in a form of secondary memory which is then loaded into the main memory when executed. The CPU is responsible for processing input from the user and passing information to the GPU. The GPU does not have access to a computer's main memory so instead, graphical assets have to be loaded into VRAM which is the GPU's memory. The CPU is responsible for instructing the GPU while the GPU uses the information to render an image on to an output device. CPU's are able to run games without a GPU through software rendering, however, offloading rendering to a GPU which has specialized hardware results in improved performance.

Built about 1751, it is a well-preserved example of a Portsmouth gambrel-roofed double house, and has been home to a number of prominent individuals. Now housing residential condominiums, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The General Porter House is located on the east side of Livermore Street, a short residential street facing Haven Park south of downtown Portsmouth. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboarded exterior. A \\"Portsmouth double house\\", it is five bays wide and two deep, with additions on either side, and an ell to the rear. The main entrance is at the center of the facade, topped by a rounded pediment and flanked by pilasters. The roof is pierced by five dormers, all but the center one with gabled roofs. The center one matches the entry trim in having a rounded roof. The right-side projecting has a secondary entrance, also flanked by pilasters. The house was built c. 1751 by Matthew Livermore, who was New Hampshire's first formally- educated lawyer, and was a representative to New Hampshire's provisional government during the American Revolutionary War. The house has been moved twice, both times in the 19th century. Another major owner was Samuel Coues, a leader of the shipbuilding industry in Portsmouth during the 19th century, and leader of the American Peace Party in the 1840s. Its most recent notable resident was General Fitz John Porter, a United States Army general who served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War. The building was converted into condominiums in 1983, at which time the doorways were reconfigured, removing one in the left projection.

It is a Unitarian chapel, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The chapel was built in 1822‚Äì23 by a mill owner for his workers, and was extended by his son in 1867. Further additions were made in 1906. The chapel is built in brick, and is in Gothic Revival style. Since 1977 it has been in the ownership of the National Trust, but continues to function as an active Unitarian chapel. History The chapel was built at a cost of nearly ¬£308 in 1822‚Äì23. It was paid for by Samuel Greg, the founder and owner of Quarry Bank Mill, and was for the use of his workers. Greg was a Unitarian but many of his workers were Baptists. The chapel originally served the latter denomination, but since 1833 it has been Unitarian. The chapel was a simple structure with a rectangular plan, rectangular windows, a flat roof, and a small belfry. It also had a full-sized baptismal pool. The chapel had no chancel or porch. Samuel Greg died in 1834, and ownership of the chapel passed to his son, Robert Hyde Greg, who was also a Unitarian. In 1867 he commissioned improvements to the chapel. A chancel, a porch, buttresses, and a plinth were added, the door was moved, the flat roof was replaced by a pitched roof, Gothic-style windows containing stained glass were inserted, and a larger bellcote was built. The improvements cost ¬£1,000. Robert Hyde Greg died in 1878, and in the following year a trust was set up to administer the chapel. In 1906 a council room and a vestry were added, which were designed by Thomas Worthington. The chapel continued to be administrated by the trust, but by 1977 the Styal estate, other than the chapel, was owned by the National Trust. The chapel was in need of repairs that could not be afforded by the chapel trust, and its ownership passed to the National Trust. The chapel continues in use as an active Unitarian chapel. Architecture Norcliffe Chapel is built in brick on a stone plinth with stone dressings, and has a roof of Kerridge stone-slate with a stone ridge. It consists of a five- bay nave, a three-bay chancel, a southeast porch and a council (or club) room to the north. The bays are divided by buttresses, and each bay contains a pair of lancet windows in a rectangular surround. The east window has three lights, with a rose window in its apex. The porch is timber-framed, open and gabled. On the ridge of the nave is a square open bellcote with a pyramidal roof. Inside the church are memorials to the Greg family. There is also a font that was designed by Henry Russell Greg. The pipe organ was installed in 1884, and made by Foster and Andrews of Hull at a cost of ¬£272. It has two manuals, a pedal keyboard, and 13 stops. The chapel was designated as a Grade II listed building on 6 June 1984.

They originally competed in the second tier of football, but eventually won promotion to the A-Division, there they remained for a number of seasons, although they almost perennially struggled against relegation, before finally succumbing in 2011. History =2002‚Äì2007= The first recorded mention of Druk Athletic competing in any level of football in Bhutan was in 2002, when they competed in the B-Division. In the single round-robin group stage they performed disappointingly, winning only one of their games, a 6‚Äì0 victory over eventual last place finishers, RC Cables, and did not progress to the knock out stage. The following season was more successful, though sources are confusing. The team lost to RIHS in the knock-out final of the B-Division, but apparently were declared champions and were promoted to the A-Division for the first time. Insufficient details is present in the surviving records for the 2004 season to show how Druk Athletic performed, though it is known they did not compete the following year, but again, a lack of detail on that season's B-Division means it is not possible to say whether they were relegated in 2004 or simply did not compete. All that can be said is that if they did play in the 2005 B-Division, they did not finish in the top two, as the final was contested by Choden and Rookies. The next record of the club competing is in 2007. They finished in the top two of the B-Division and entered the promotion / relegation play-offs together with Wolfland from the B-Division and the bottom two teams in that year's A-Division, RIHS and Rigzung. Veterans won all three of their matches and were promoted to the A-Division for the second time in their history. =2008‚Äì2012= For their second period in the A-Division, they changed their name from Veterans to Druk Athletic. the team struggled in 2008. Although their final position is not known, they were in second last position at the halfway stage of the season with only two wins from their seven games to that point. Results are incomplete in the records for the remainder of the season, but it is recorded that they suffered heavy defeats, 11‚Äì1 against Transport United and 12‚Äì0 versus Yeedzin. Their struggles continued in 2009 when they were saved from relegation only by the withdrawal of Royal Bhutan Army halfway through the season, who at that point had already gained more than twice the number of points Druk Athletic would amass throughout the whole campaign. Their sole victory came against Rigzung, 3‚Äì1, who finished below them, and their only other point was gained in a 2‚Äì2 draw versus Transport United. In their thirteen games, they conceded 113 goals and finished the season with a ‚àí101 goal difference, ending up on the receiving end of very heavy defeats at the hands of Yeedzin, 20‚Äì0 and 16‚Äì1, Druk Star, 13‚Äì1, Choden, 11‚Äì0 and Druk Pol 10‚Äì0. The following season saw a slight improvement in their fortunes. They finished a place lower than 2009 in second last place, although this time all teams completed their twelve matches. They managed to gain two wins, 2‚Äì1 against Choden and 3‚Äì2 versus Nangpa. they also managed to perform much better defensively, still finishing with the worst goal difference in the league of ‚àí41, but only conceding 52 goals in their 12 games. Despite finishing in second last place, there appears to have been no promotion or relegation between the A and B-Divisions, and Druk Athletic competed again in the top flight of Bhutanese football in the 2011 season. No details are available in terms of results, but it is known that Druk Athletic again finished second last with Nangpa propping up the table for a second consecutive season. It appears that there was again no promotion or relegation, as Nangpa again took part in the A-Division in 2012, however Druk Athletic did not, and if they did compete in the B-Division then they could have finished no higher than fourth as three semi-finalists are known from that season's knock out stages. Their current status is unknown as there are no details indicating they took part in either the 2013 or 2014 B-Division competitions.

Van Coke has always had an affinity for music. Moving to Boston, Bellville, Western Cape in early childhood where he grew up, he participated in high school in a battle of the bands competition where he performed the vocals for the band. He was later kicked out of the band, which put him off performing vocals for a while. Van Coke's strong Christian upbringing (his father was a pastor) led him to create the Christian band AS180. Van Coke established himself in the Bellville underground music scene by forming the band \\"A Guy Called Gerald\\", which later changed its name to \\"New World Inside\\". Van Coke then co-founded the rock band Fokofpolisiekar. The band was initially started as a joke to shock the widely conservative Afrikaans community. Van Coke recalls that, \\"My mom cried for a day or two when she heard the name of the band\\". After initial performances his father asked him to change his surname from \\"Badenhorst\\" to \\"Van Coke\\", as his father, being a minister, was receiving complaints about his son's performances from the local church-going community.

Opened in 1884, it was one of the first hospitals in New Hampshire, and it served as the city's primary hospital facility until 1986, when Portsmouth Regional Hospital opened. Its 1895 campus has been repurposed to house city offices and the police station, and a senior living facility. A portion of that facility, representing its oldest buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History The Portsmouth Cottage Hospital was founded in 1884, and was an outgrowth of charitable impulses that included the operation of almshouses for the poor and needy, and the provision of care for wounded veterans of the American Civil War. The driving force in its founding was Harriet Kimball, the daughter of a local pharmacist. The hospital was originally located at 51 Court Street, in a large house now located in the Strawbery Banke museum complex. That building quickly proved inadequate as a hospital facility, and fundraising began in 1889 for construction of a proper dedicated facility. Land for the new facility was purchased on the south side of the South Mill Pond, and the core of the hospital complex, a 2-1/2 story brick building designed by Boston architect Harry Ball, was opened in 1895. The hospital was run as a secular charity, providing a significant number of patient stays at no or reduced cost. It received a small amount of funding from the city until 1903. The main building was enlarged several times before 1962, when a more modern facility was built directly adjacent. At that time, the old building was converted to house an outpatient mental health clinic as well as hospital administrative offices. The entire complex was acquired in 1983 by the for-profit Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). HCA opened the Portsmouth Regional Hospital in 1986, closing the old campus. The city purchased the campus in 1986. The 1962 building and a former nurses' housing building were adapted to house city offices and its main police station. The original 1895 building was later converted into a senior living facility.

In 1976 he was kidnapped by Dieter Zlof, a Slovene-born mechanic, and only released after a substantial ransom was paid. Career He was born in Bielefeld to Rudolf August Oetker (1916-2007) and Susanne Jantsch (1922-2012); his siblings are August Oetker the Younger, Bergit Countess Douglas, and Christian Oetker. He read agronomy and brewing at the Technical University of Munich and has held various positions at Dr. Oetker since 1981, the year his father retired as CEO. He has been married twice and has two children. Kidnapping On 14 December 1976, the 25-year-old student was kidnapped by 34-year-old Dieter Zlof, a Slovene-born mechanic who locked him into a crate and linked his feet and wrists to manacles that would give him electric shocks if he screamed or tried to break out. While Oetker was 1.94 metres (6'4\\") tall, the crate was 1.45 metres (4'9\\") long and 70 cm (28\\") wide. In the early hours of 15 December, a noise sparked off a near fatal shock that broke Oetker‚Äôs thighs and two of his ribs as he thumped against the crate. His screams prolonged the shocks by ten seconds, and the pain was such that he briefly wanted to die. He was freed for DM21 million, the highest ransom then paid in Germany. The abduction had lasted 47 hours by the time he was found in an Opel Commodore on 16 December. Zlof was arrested on 30 January 1979 on circumstantial evidence. Though he did not plead guilty, he received the maximum penalty ‚Äì fifteen years in prison ‚Äì on 9 June 1980. In May 1997, Zlof, who had buried the ransom in a forest around 30 km (20 miles) southeast of Munich, went to England to swap mouldy banknotes worth DM12.5 million for usable money. The rest had mouldered away in its cache. He was re-arrested, served out a two-year sentence, and confessed to the kidnapping in a 1997 autobiography which was written by his barrister‚Äôs wife.

It was converted to an amphibious landing control vessel during the war and reclassified a Patrol Craft - Control or PCC. It participated in six amphibious invasions as a control vessel.  Commissioning  PC-598 was commissioned in Portland, Oregon on 5 March 1943, Lieutenant Benjamin V. Harrison, Jr. commanding. With her new crew of \\"plank owners\\" she left the Commercial Iron Works pier on the Willamette River on 13 March for Astoria and then Seattle, Washington arriving on 15 March. In Seattle, she took on provisions and munitions, and the crew received additional anti-aircraft gunnery training. On 31 March the ship test fired its 3\\"/50, 40 mm and 20 mm guns off Marrowstone Point.PC-598 Operational Remarks, March 1943 The ship next relocated to San Diego arriving on 18 April.PC-598 Administrative Remarks, April 1943 PC-598 then moved on to San Francisco, arriving 5 May, loaded stores and departed for Pearl Harbor on 9 May.PC-598 Administrative Remarks, May 1943  Hawaii, Midway and Canton  The \\"subchaser\\" arrived in Pearl Harbor on 16 May 1943 and spent the next two months towing targets and picket duty on the sonar \\"ping line\\" patrolling for enemy submarines near Pearl Harbor. On 7 August the ship sailed to Palmyra Atoll and Canton Island. The equator was crossed at 167 degrees West on 13 August and the new \\"polliwogs\\" were initiated by the experienced \\"shellbacks\\" among the crew into the Ancient Order of the Deep. A PC-598 crewman's Trusty Shellback card.The crew enjoyed the beach at Canton and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 August. The following day Lieutenant Harrison was relieved of command and Lieutenant William H. Taylor assumed command of the ship.PC-598 Administrative Remarks, 26 August 1943 September, October and November 1943 were spent patrolling and escorting ships between Midway and Pearl Harbor, including the fleet oiler Neshanic and the transport William Ward Burrows. Thanksgiving 1943 was spent at Midway. Thanksgiving Day menu at Midway, 1943. Back at Pearl Harbor the ship was docked for an engine overhaul on 9 December which was completed on 21 December in preparation for heading towards harms way in the Western Pacific.  Makin, Espiritu Santo and Fiji  On 31 January 1944 the ship was underway from Pearl Harbor to Espiritu Santo, escorting the cargo ship Vega and the Liberty ship Mary Bickerdyke.PC-598 Log Book, 31 January 1944 First stop was Makin Atoll in the Gilbert Islands on 9 February. At Makin were Hydrographer, there to survey the lagoon and anchorages, and the destroyer Capps, late of Scapa Flow, Scotland and Gibraltar in the Atlantic. Departing the atoll on 13 February, the ship stopped briefly at Funafuti on 16 February, anchoring alongside the repair ship Luzon and taking fuel and water from the minesweeper, YMS-290. The ship departed Funafuti on 16 February, detouring to collect the tanker Gulfbird and escort it to Espiritu Santo, entering Selwyn Straight in the New Hebrides on 20 February.PC-598 Log Book, February 1944 That same day, unable to raise anchor, 45 fathoms of chain and the anchor were cut loose and marked with a buoy to be recovered later by the tug Rail, a Pearl Harbor survivor.PC-598 War Diary, March 1944, p. 4-5 On 27 February the ship was degaussed at Espiritu Santo to reduce the risk of detonating magnetic mines.PC-598 Log Book, February 1944 The Pacific Theater showing locations visited by PC-598 between May 1943 and August 1945 = Dull, monotonous duty in dismal surroundings = Force 7 winds and rough seas removed the upper racks Mousetrap and capstan control on 4 March. PC-598 spent 7‚Äì9 March hunting for a reported enemy submarine with the destroyer Coolbaugh, later determined to be a wild goose chase. The storm damage to the capstan was finally repaired 25 March. The same day the crew test fired their 20mm Oerlikon guns at a towed sleeve in company with SC-502 and SC-639, finding the new Mark 14 sights produced poor results compared to the previous method involving the use of tracers. During March, the sub chaser escorted an odd assortment of ships to and from collection and dispersal points near Espritu Santo, including the transports Naos and Lyra, a US Army cargo vessel F-53, the tanker Cape Hatteras, the cargo vessel Tjibesar and a Dutch merchant ship Boschfontein. On 26 March the ship headed for Suva, Fiji with two Liberty ships, Ethan A. Hitchcock and Edwin Meredith. Edwin Meredith peeled off on its own on 29 March, but Ethan A. Hitchcock continued on with the sub chaser to Suva, arriving 30 March. PC-598 then proceeded solo to Vunda Point at Viti Levu Island.PC-598 War Diary, March 1944 The PC returned from the Fiji Islands to Espritu Santo on 3 April, in company with the tanker Egg Harbor. April was spent operating in the area of Espiritu Santo, principally on escort duty in the company of other tankers including Soledad, Pequot Hill, Crater Lake, Sparrow's Point, Stanvac Capetown and Charlestown. The sole exception was time spent with the ammunition ship Mauna Loa, escorted 27‚Äì28 April. Writing with the same style that won him the 1935 Pulitzer Prize reporting on the America‚Äôs Cup yacht race for the New York Herald Tribune, Captain Taylor referred to this period in the ship's War Diary as ‚Äúdull, monotonous duty in dismal surroundings in areas remote from any likelihood of meeting enemy action.‚ÄùPC-598 War Diary, April 1944 The ship was able to briefly hone its ASW (anti-submarine warfare) skills on 7 April, practicing on a live submarine, S-31, a World War I era submarine returned to active service. The submarine also played a leading role in the 1933 MGM movie Hell Below. While at Espiritu Santo, PC-598 continued training exercises, working again with S-31 on 1 and 2 May, anti-aircraft practice with the sub chaser SC-1327 on 5 May and attack and recognition classes for the crew on 8 May. Beginning 9 May, PC-598 spent 4 days patrolling the Wawa Channel and then began a routine overhaul alongside Oceanus that lasted until 19 May, during which the pesky Mark 4 sights were removed.PC-598 War Diary, May 1944, p.1 = Cruising with the Free French Navy = On 22 May the ship left for Guadalcanal escorting a convoy under the command of Savorgnan de Brazza, a Free French ship which had sunk a Vichy sister ship of the same class in the Battle of Gabon in 1940 and rescued 76 survivors of the British ship Clan Macarthur, sunk in 1943 by a German submarine east of Madagascar. The convoy included the tanker Cape Pillar, the Liberty ship Richard Moczkowski and the U.S. Army transport William R. Gibson. The convoy arrived safely at Guadalcanal on 25 May and PC-598 returned to Espiritu Santo to collect another.PC-598 War Diary, May 1944, p.2 = Marine airmen rescued at sea = Gruman TBF Avenger Torpedo Bomber On 30 May things got a bit more exciting for the ship. While escorting Kalita from Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal, PC-598 rescued two USMC airmen from a downed Gruman TBF-1 Avenger out of Turtle Bay Field, Espiritu Santo. The plane, part of Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 232 (VMTB-232), was on a routine flight but got lost in bad weather, ran low on gasoline and its crew decided to ditch the plane near the convoy. The rescued crewmen were 1st Lieutenant A. J. Aune and Sergeant L. J. Eickhoff.PC-598 War Diary, May 1944, p.2 The convoy arrived safely on 1 June and the ship spent the next five days moored in Tulagi Harbor at Florida Island near Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. For the remainder of June 1944, PC-598 patrolled off Guadalcanal and escorted ships, including the Victory ship Canada Victory, later sunk by a kamikaze at Okinawa in April 1945,Askew, p. 242 the Liberty ship Paul Revere, the cargo vessel Arided and Norwegian freighter Narvik.PC-598 War Diary, June 1944 On 22 June Lieutenant (jg) Leo Hackney took command of the ship and Lieutenant Taylor was transferred to the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami.PC-598 War Diary, June 1944, p. 2 = Conversion to Patrol Craft - Control (PCC) = The ship returned to Espiritu Santo on 4 July, screening a convoy. For the rest of July the ship remained moored at Espiritu Santo and the crew received gunnery, recognition and firefighting training at the island‚Äôs \\"Coconut College\\". Although not officially reclassified as such until after the end of the war,Silverstone, p.186 it was here the ship was modified to accommodate its new role as a Patrol Craft - Control (PCC).PC-598 War Diary, July 1944, p.1 Thirty-five PCs were converted to Patrol Craft - Control (PCC) for use in amphibious landing operations. Extra personnel (eight radiomen, two signalmen, one quartermaster and two communications officers), accommodations and communications equipment were added, the weight compensated for by removal of other equipment. Near the end of the war, twin-mount 20 mm guns replaced the single mount 20s.Veigele, p. 66-67 In addition, the PCCs were fitted with improved SU radar. PCs proved exceptionally adept as Control Vessels, guiding waves of landing craft during numerous amphibious landings in the European and Pacific Theaters. In the Pacific, the PCCs were assigned to the Seventh Fleet and participated in all of MacArthur's island-hopping.  The Solomon Islands  On 4 August 1944 PC-598 left Espiritu Santo for Guadalcanal escorting the cargo ship Antares, arriving 6 August. The ship moored at various locations including Tulagi Harbor, Port Purvis, Gavona Inlet, McFarland Point and the Russell Islands over the next 12 days.PC-598 War Diary, August 1944, p.1 = Death of a shipmate = On 17 August the ship was anchored in Anonyma Cove at the Russell Islands when SM3c Galen R. Dielman was fatally wounded by gun fire from the beach off Pavuvu, which was being used as a staging area for the 1st Marine Division.Sledge, p. 30-33 It was later determined the sailor was killed by a bullet fired from a Marine rifle range on the island. Last rites were held in honor of Dielman aboard ship by Navy Chaplain Lieutenant Davis from the amphibious force command ship Mount McKinley. Dielman was buried ashore.PC-598 Log Book, 17 August 1944 From 18 to 25 August the ship ran between the Russell Islands and Florida Island. Between 26 and 29 August PC-598 was involved in practice landings as a control ship off Cape Esperance, Guadalcanal in preparation for the upcoming invasion of Peleliu. Among the ships involved in the exercise was SC-669, the only SC class subchaser to receive credit for sinking an enemy submarine, I-178.Cressman, p. 162 - \\"Submarine chaser SC-669 sinks Japanese submarine I-178 30 miles west of Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, 15¬∞35'S, 166¬∞17'E.\\" The end of August saw PC-598 moored at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands.PC-598 Log Book, August 1944  Invasion of Peleliu  Landing Beaches at Peleliu. On 4 September 1944, PC-598 formed up with the Tractor Group of the Western Attack Force and began anti-submarine screening on the way to the Invasion of Peleliu. The convoy arrived at Peleliu in the early morning of 15 September. The invasion plan called for the 1st Marine Division to assault the beachhead with three regiments. The 1st Marine Regiment (under the command of Colonel \\"Chesty\\" Puller) would be on the left flank, assaulting beaches White 1 and White 2. In the center would be the 5th Marine Regiment assaulting beaches Orange 1 and Orange 2. The right flank would be held by the 7th Marine Regiment assaulting Orange 3.Hough, p. 19 15 September 1944: The first wave of LVTs approach the beaches during the American assault on Peleliu. At 0630 the Beachmaster and Communications team, Marine observers and newspaper correspondents arrived aboard. Acting as a guide ship for White Beach 2, the ship advanced from the line of departure and moved toward the beach. They bombarded the shore with 46 rounds from their 3\\"/50 caliber gun, then advanced to the transfer line. The PC remained there as control ship for the LCIs and LVTs of the 1st Marine Division en route to the beachhead. At 0905 the ship assumed guide ship duties for the entire White Beach landing area and remained there overnight.PC-598 War Diary, September 1944, p. 1 = Burial at sea = The following day, 16 September, the ship was relieved of control duty. The Beachmaster and Communications team left the ship which was then assigned to the anti-submarine screen for the LST Tractor Group at Peleliu until 25 September.PC-598 War Diary, September 1944, p. 1 While on the screen on 19 September, the ship stopped to identify a floating corpse, which was determined to be that of an American Marine. A thorough search of body revealed no identification whatsoever, the body being in such a state that no fingerprints were possible. The crew weighted and sank the body with a length of anchor chain in accordance with instructions from the destroyer Hazelwood.PC-598 Log Book, 19 September 1944 Late in the day on 26 September, the LST Tractor Group formed in cruising disposition and proceeded to New Guinea. The Tractor Group arrived at Hollandia, New Guinea on 30 September and anchored in Humboldt Bay.PC-598 War Diary, September 1944, p. 2 = Aftermath = The Battle of Peleliu remains controversial due to the island's lack of strategic value and a casualty rate which exceeded all other amphibious operations during the Pacific War. The 1st Marine Division was severely mauled and remained out of action until the invasion of Okinawa. On Peleliu, the 1st Marine Division suffered over 6,500 casualties, over a third of the division. The 81st Infantry Division suffered nearly 1,400 casualties while on the island.Hough, p. 183 The Japanese defenders, consisting of an estimated 10,500 men, were annihilated,Garand and Strowbridge, p. 285 but would have lacked the means to interfere with US operations in the Pacific if the island had been by-passed, as had many other Japanese garrisons. Although deemed an essential stepping stone to the Philippines at the time, Peleliu never played a key role in subsequent US operations,Anderson, \\"Western Pacific\\", p. 28 \\"...the minor strategic value of the Palaus left troubling questions about overall American decision making in the Pacific. Intended to support subsequent operations against the Philippines, the airfields and ports of Peleliu and Angaur ultimately proved less than essential.\\" but did show Americans the pattern of future Japanese island defense and provided experience in assaulting heavily fortified positions such as they would find again at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  Hollandia, New Guinea  October 1944 was a busy month for the ship. She began the month moored in the great anchorage of Humboldt Bay, the staging base for Leyte Island in the Philippines, the next invasion. Between 1 and 10 October she replenished her fuel and water and effected repairs to the ship. She was often moored alongside sister control vessels, including PC-623, PC-1119 and PC-1129.PC-598 Log Book, 1‚Äì9 October 1944 In late October 1944, both PC-623 and PC-1119 would participate in the rescue of 1150 survivors of Task Unit 77.4.3 (\\"Taffy 3\\") from the carrier Gambier Bay and the destroyers Samuel B. Roberts and Hoel, lost during the Battle off Samar Island.Veigele, p. 210-211 PC-1129 was sunk 31 January 1945 during Operation Mike VI by a Japanese Shinyo \\"suicide boat\\" off Nasugbu, while serving as flagship for the control unit, TU 78.2.7.Cressman, P. 291 11 October found PC-598 at Pier #1 in Hollandia. Corporal Howard F. Klawitter, U.S. Army Photographer reported aboard for temporary duty assigned by the Sixth Army to accompany the ship and photograph the Leyte landings. On the same day, the wooden hulled subchaser, SC-648 was moored to starboard side. Theodore R. Treadwell, author of Splinter Fleet: The Wooden Subchasers of World War II, served aboard SC-648 for two years, including nine months as commanding officer. On 12 October PC-598 took part in training exercises as a landing control ship in preparation for the Leyte Island landings. The ship moored later that day in Hollandia Bay outboard of Murzim, a cargo ship used as an ammunition station ship. Manned by a United States Coast Guard crew, Murzim is the only US Navy ship in wartime whose crew was ordered to \\"abandon ship\\" while dockside. Alex Haley, author of Roots: The Saga of an America Family, served aboard her during the war.USS Murzim (AK-95), Wikipedia  Invasion of Leyte  Northern Attack Force Beaches at Leyte The next day, 13 October 1944, PC-598 took on fuel and lube oil and proceeded to form up with Task Force 78.1, the Palo Attack Group of the Northern Attack Force headed for the invasion of Leyte.Bates, p. 696 PC-598 took position 300 yards behind PC-623 in the control ship column. On 17 October, the ship relieved the Royal Australian Navy destroyers Arunta, responsible for sinking Japanese submarine RO-33 in August 1942, and Warrarunga as each refueled, and then returned to her position in the convoy.PC-598 War Diary', October 1944, p. 1 The Northern Attack Force, which was delivering the 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division of the 6th Army's X Corp, took a week to arrive at Leyte Gulf. PC-598 entered San Pedro Bay with the Northern Attack Force at 0740 on 20 October. By 0820 she closed with the attack transport Dupage to collect Lieut. E.E. Boelhauf, who was later also a Beach Control Officer at Okinawa,Morison, p. 144 and his communication party. She proceeded to her assigned station on Red Beach and anchored at 0902. The first wave steamed by at 0943. After the last wave passed at 1128, the Beach Control Officer and communications team left the ship.PC-598 Log Book, 20 October 1944 = MacArthur returns to the Philippines = At 1330 the landing area was secure enough for General Douglas MacArthur to stride from a landing craft through knee deep surf onto Red Beach, keeping his promise to return to the Philippines.Anderson, p. 12 By mid-afternoon, PC-598 repositioned closer to the landing area and waited for orders from Blue Ridge, the amphibious landing command ship for the Northern Attack Force. By 1815 they left their position at Red Beach under orders to report to the Commander of LCI Flotilla 7 and provide screening for the transport area.PC-598 War Diary, October 1944, p. 2 General Douglas MacArthur and staff land on Red Beach at Palo, Leyte, 20 October 1944. Two days later, on the morning of 23 October, while maneuvering to go alongside tank landing ship LST-465, the subchaser hit a reef that was \\"improperly charted and buoyed\\". The stern of the ship grounded in the gravel of the reef. By noon, with assistance from the tug Quapaw, the ship was floated off the reef.PC-598 War Diary, October 1944, p. 2 Inspection showed only slight damage to screws. The PC refueled and took on water from LST-465. By 1600 they were underway with the patrol frigate Carson City and PC-1129 to rendezvous with LST Flotilla 23 and provide an escort back to Hollandia.Bates, p. 23 = Aftermath = In all 132,000 troops were landed on Leyte. Fearing that the loss of the Philippines would result in the loss of shipping lanes to their oil supplies in South East Asia, the Japanese committed the remnants of the Imperial Japanese Navy in what would become the greatest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Between 23 and 26 October 1944, there were four separate engagements: the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Cape Enga√±o and the Battle off Samar, as well as other actions. In four days of fighting the Japanese lost 26 of their finest ships: three battleships, one large carrier, three light carriers, six heavy cruisers, four light cruisers and nine destroyers, ending Japan's dream of being a naval power.Victory at Sea - Episode 16, The Battle for Leyte Gulf  Return to Hollandia, New Guinea  = Convoy attacked by submarine = Near midnight on 24 October 1944, the convoy was in the Philippine Sea east of Mindanao. Two explosions were heard and PC-598 went to General Quarters. LST-695 had been torpedoed by the .Cressman, p. 266, ‚ÄúJapanese submarine I 56 attacks Humboldt Bay, New Guinea-bound TG 78.1 (Commander Theodore C.

Together with LST-170 they formed an independent LST Group and were escorted by PC-598 to Peleliu, arriving on 27 October, where the injured were hospitalized. Leaving with the two undamaged LSTs, PC-598 returned to Hollandia and arrived at Humboldt Bay on 30 October, mooring alongside the Destroyer Repair Base Dock. Corporal Klawitter was detached from his temporary duty aboard PC-598 on 31 October. He died later in the war from wounds sustained in combat. = Dry dock repairs and recovery = The first four days of November were spent in the floating dry dock AFD-24 for repairs to the ship, most likely the damage caused by running aground at Leyte on 23 October. With its propellers and shafts removed to allow repairs, on 5 November the ship was towed from dry dock to the Destroyer Repair Base Dock at Hollandia. There she was moored starboard side to SC-744, which would be sunk within a month by a kamikaze at Leyte Gulf.Cressman, p. 277 Eleven days later, on 16 November, the PC returned under tow by LCMs to AFD-24 for dry docking and underwater repairs which were completed around midnight. The next day, the ship left dry dock and returned under its own power to the Destroyer Repair Base dock where it remained through the end of November. Lieutenant (jg) Clarence S. Rose Jr., the ship's Executive Officer, was ordered to take command on 19 November. Lieutenant Hackney, was detached from duty as commanding officer and left the ship.PC-598 Log Book, 19 November 1944 During the first three weeks of December, the ship lay anchored in Humboldt Bay or moored along Liberty dock #1 in Hollandia. 18 December was spent at the firing range, holding anti-aircraft practice and running the degaussing range. The ship received replacement crew members and replenished supplies, water and fuel. Late on 22 December they left Hollandia to proceed to Aitape, New Guinea under orders to join the Seventh Amphibious Force, which was forming for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon in the Philippines.PC-598 Log Book, December 1944 = Exercises off Aitape = PC-598 arrived at Aitape the next day and anchored in Ataipe Road. On the day before Christmas 1944, Captain Stephen G. Barchet, former commanding officer of the submarine Argonaut, reported aboard to assume the duties of Senior Control Officer for White Beach at the Lingayen Gulf landings. Captain Barchet served as Operations Officer for the 7th Amphibious Force in the Pacific. In this assignment he coordinated planning and supervised operations of approximately 1,000 ships, consisting of cruisers, destroyers, transports and landing craft. These operations included the assault landings at Lingayen Gulf. On the day after Christmas, Lieutenant William H. Moore, USNR reported aboard for temporary additional duty with a six man communications team to participate in the landing rehearsal at Aitape, scheduled for 27 December. On board to watch the exercise was Brigadier General Alexander N. Stark, Jr., Deputy Commander of the 43rd Infantry Division which would make the White Beach landing at San Fabian in the Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945.MacArthur, et al., p. 254 - 260 = En route to Luzon = The landing exercise completed, PC-598 was underway the next day, 28 December, as part of the anti-submarine screen for the Luzon Attacking Force from Aitepe, New Guinea. While en route, on 31 December, the ship delivered mail from Blue Ridge to ships in the convoy, including tank landing ship LST-466, the attack transports Cavalier, DuPage, Fayette, and Fuller, cargo ships Auriga, Indus, and Aquarius and the destroyer Braine. On 22 May 1945, while on picket duty near Okinawa, Braine was struck by two kamikazes. Eight officers and 59 enlisted men were killed. 102 others were wounded, 50 seriously enough to be hospitalized. Braine suffered the highest casualty rate of the war for any destroyer that was not actually sunk.  Naval mine sighted and sunk  New Year's Day 1945 saw PC-598 screening for the San Fabian Attack Force. At 1756, they sighted a floating mine about 1000 yards off the port bow. The ship maneuvered to the vicinity of the mine and waited for the convoy to pass. Firing both 20 mm rounds and .30 caliber rifle bullets, the mine was sunk. It was a spherical type, judged to weigh 450 pounds and believed to be an enemy mine, as the horns were 10 to 12 inches long.PC-598 War Diary, January 1945, p.1  Last surface ship engagement of World War II  The San Fabian Attack Force continued on to the Lingayen Gulf during the first week of 1945. PC-598 screened the convoy and periodically delivered mail among the ships, including officers mail on 6 January to the attack transports Fayette, Freemont and DuPage, which was struck by a kamikaze four days later, killing 35 and wounding 103. On 7 January PC-598 refueled and took on water from the fleet oiler Pecos, a more fortunate ship. That night, at 2245, destroyers from the starboard side of the anti-submarine screen were observed firing at a surface target about 11 miles away.PC-598 Log Book, 7 January 1945 Destroyers Ausburne, Braine, Russell, and Shaw were sinking the Japanese destroyer Hinoki,Cressman, p. 287 lost with all hands while attempting to escape from Manilla Bay. This proved to be the last engagement between surface ships of World War II.Roscoe, p. 457  Invasion of Lingayen Gulf  Lingayen Gulf Invasion Beaches. = Flagship for Commander Task Unit 78.1.7 = On 9 January 1945 the San Fabian Attack Force commenced the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf at 0345. Released from anti-submarine duties at 0630, PC-598 assumed the duties of Senior Control Vessel, acting as Flagship for CTU 78.1.7 at its assigned position on the line of departure for White Beaches, 4,000 yards off shore. Naval and Army officers and their staffs came aboard to use the ship as an observation and control center. Landing operations were controlled by Captain Barchet, who had been on board the ship since New Guinea. PC-598s sister ship, PC-623, depicted acting as White Beach 2 control vessel, 9 January 1945. San Fabian Attack Force by Dwight Shepler, USNR. Luzon, January 1945. The first wave of the 43rd Infantry Division was dispatched towards the beach at 0902. By 1840 the PC was anchored 2000 yards off shore near White Beach 2. The ship's crew sighted three enemy aircraft and fired at one plane which escaped flying very high.PC-598 War Diary, January 1945, p. 1 PC-598 remained anchored near the White Beaches, occasionally maneuvering to support operations. Near midnight on 11 January the ship came under fire from beach installations with shrapnel falling nearby from shell bursts in the air. The enemy guns were silenced within minutes by counter fire from destroyers in the Gulf.PC-598 Log Book, 11 January 1945 Captain Barchet and his control communications team left the ship on 15 January, replaced by Lieutenant Commander J.B. Avery who had been assisting Barchet since 14 January. The ship continued as flagship for Commander Task Unit 78.1.7 and later 78.1.11 until 28 January. On 29 January the ship was relieved of its duties and reported alongside the landing craft repair ship Amycus for minor repairs, which were completed by the morning of 31 January. That evening PC-598 reported for duty as a screen vessel for a convoy departing from the Lingayen Gulf to Leyte.PC-598 War Diary, January 1945, p. 2 = Aftermath = Over 200,000 soldiers were landed in the Lingayen Gulf during this period. American naval forces suffered relatively heavy losses, particularly to their convoys, due to kamikaze attacks. During the first two weeks in January, a total of 24 ships were sunk and another 67 were damaged by kamikazes including the battleships , New Mexico and Colorado, the Australian heavy cruiser Australia, the light cruiser Columbia, and the destroyers Long and Hovey. Following the landings, the Lingayen Gulf became a vast supply depot to support the Battle of Luzon.Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Wikipedia  Return to the Solomons  The convoy from Lingayen Gulf arrived in San Pedro Bay, near Leyte, on 2 February 1945 where Captain Rose reported to CTF 78 on Blue Ridge. The ship took on stores, fuel and water and anchored for the night off Samar Island. The next day the convoy left at 1800 to Guadalcanal via the Admiralty Islands. On 14 February PC-598 passed the entrance nets to Seeadler Harbor at Manus in the Admiralty IslandsPC-598 Log Book, February 1945 where three months earlier the ammunition ship Mount Hood exploded, killing all aboard her, obliterating the ship and sinking or severely damaging 22 other nearby ships. The explosion of the USS Mount Hood (AE-11) in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands on 10 November 1944. Once more the ship's fuel, water and supplies were replenished. PC-598 was underway again in the company of other patrol craft on 16 February and arrived off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal on 20 February. At Guadalcanal, Communications team #55 commanded by Lieutenant (jg) P.W. Cochran reported aboard for temporary duty and the ship was ordered by CinCPac to report as a control vessel to ComPhib Group 4. On 21 February the ship visited the Florida Islands, anchored in Govana Inlet and later made its way to the Egan Bluff water hole at Port Purvis to take on water.PC-598 Log Book, February 1945 PC-598 spent the last eight days of February anchored at various locations at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands in \\"nests of ships\\" including the tank landing ships LST-220, later used as a target vessel for atomic bomb test \\"Able\\" during Operation Crossroads in the summer of 1946, LST 213, involved in the rescue of survivors after the sinking of Gambier Bay during the Battle off Samar and LST-698, the subject of the book LSTs, the Ships with the BIG MOUTH and what made these ships so essential in island actions of World War II (1944-45) written by a crew member, Homer Haswell. PC-598 spent six of these days alongside the repair ship Briareus undergoing voyage repairs and installing new control equipment.PC-598 Log Book, February 1945 = Tractor Group Baker to the Ryukyus = The first six days of March, PC-598 participated in training exercises off Cape Esperance, Guadalcanal in preparation for the landings in Okinawa. The ship then retired to Govana Inlet, Florida Islands for repairs provided by AFD-14. Late in the evening of 9 March, the ship joined Tractor Group Baker en route to the Russell Islands, arriving 11 March at Macquitti Bay. By 18 March Tractor Group Baker was once again on the move, this time to Ulithi in the Western Carolina Islands.PC-598 Log Book, February 1945 4-missile launcher anti-submarine projector Mark 20. PCs carried two 4-missile launchers on their bow On 21 March, the sub chaser passed into Ulithi Harbor via Mugai Channel and anchored in the northern anchorage. While at Ulithi, the ship replenished stores from the non-self propelled storage barge, IX-151 and took water from the new distilling ship, Abatan, which provided potable water to landing craft, patrol vessels and escort ships unable to produce their own water. Like many smaller ships, PCs could not produce their own fresh water and were reliant on larger vessels for drinking water.Veigele, p. 42 Just before noon on 25 March, Lieutenant Vrooman, Blue Beach Control Officer, came aboard for the last leg of the journey to Okinawa. The submarine chaser then joined the anti-submarine screen for Tractor Group Baker, en route from Ulithi to the Ryukyus. The Tractor Group arrived at the Ryukyus on 31 March.PC-598 Log Book, February 1945 Late that afternoon, PC-598 pulled alongside LST-834 refueled and replenished water. LST-834 is the central figure in Waddling to War by Bob Shannon. At 1728, as PC-598 began the transition from anti-submarine screening to control vessel duties, the crew dropped eight Mousetraps (ASW Mark 20 anti-submarine rockets) and their fuzes overboard.PC-598 Log Book, February 1945  Battle of Okinawa  Okinawa Invasion Beaches, 1 April 1945 1 April 1945 was both Easter Sunday and April Fool's Day, a coincidence not unremarked on by the crew of PC-598. It also marked the start of Operation Iceberg, the invasion of Okinawa. Released from screening duty at 0405, PC-598 proceeded to the line of departure at Blue Beach to serve as the Control Vessel. While approaching the line, several Japanese dive bombers, Aichi D3A \\"VALS\\", were seen attacking the ships. One VAL approaching from the beach came within range of the ship's guns and the sub chaser opened fire. Hits were observed and the plane caught fire and crashed into the sea.PC-598 War Diary, April 1945, p.1 Purple Beaches, Okinawa 4 April 1945 PC-598 anchored at its assigned station with Lt. Vrooman acting as Blue Beach Control Officer. Various Naval and Marine officers came aboard to use the ship as a control center during the landing phase of the operation. The first assault wave was dispatched at 0800.PC-598 War Diary, April 1945, p.1 The 7th Marine Regiment (1st Marine Division) was assigned to Blue Beaches 1 and 2, and landed with its 1st and 2nd Battalions abreast followed by the 3rd Battalion.Frank, et al., p.113 By early afternoon, the ship maneuvered 1000 yards closer to Blue Beach and anchored for the night. The ship continued to act as Blue Beach Control Vessel until 5 April when it was detached and reassigned as Purple Beach Control Vessel in early afternoon. = Kamikaze onslaught begins = The Japanese kamikaze onslaught against U.S. ships off Okinawa begins in earnest on 6 April. The ship, anchored and serving as Purple Beach Control Vessel, along with the rest of the fleet, is under attack from numerous airplanes. The ship‚Äôs guns fire on two VALS in range, downing one into the sea.PC-598 War Diary, April 1945, p.2 Aichi D3A \\"VALs\\" in flight Suicide attacks by planes at Okinawa sank 26 U.S. war and merchant ships and damaged 225 others.Rottman, p. 76 On 6 April alone, six ships were sunk at Okinawa including the destroyers Bush and Colhoun, the minesweeper Emmons, and the cargo ships Hobbs Victory and Logan Victory.Cressman, p. 309-310 Many more were damaged. In the midst of this inferno, PC-598 is forced to maneuver to avoid a flaming gasoline barge drifting in the direction of the ship.PC-598 Log Book, 6 April 1945 Kamikaze attacks continued throughout the remainder of the war expending 1,900 Japanese planes and pilots.Rottman, p. 76 = Control Vessel for TransRon 16 = Except for a one-day excursion on 24 April to Kerama Retto,PC-598 Log Book, 24 April 1945 a protected anchorage to the west, PC-598 remained anchored off the Hagushi landing beaches on the west coast of Okinawa through most of April, serving as Control Vessel for the unloading of Transportation Squadron 16. On 9 April, Lieutenant Commander Dawes, USNR came aboard as Control Officer at Purple Beach to supervise the unloading. Relieved of control duty on 11 April, the ship proceeded to Coronis for repairs which were completed 14 April after which the ship returned to its control duties. On 18 April Commander Quine, USN came aboard as Control Officer. During April, nightly attacks were made by enemy aircraft on the ships lying at anchor off the Hagushi landing areas. On each occasion the Control Vessel concealed itself in smoke and withheld fire.PC-598 War Diary, April 1945 = Nago Bay = The ship was relieved of its Control Vessel assignment on 30 April and ordered to Nago Wan (Nago Bay), Okinawa.PC-598 Log Book, 30 April 1945 While at Nago Wan on 2 May, Lieutenant (jg) Rose was relieved of command of the ship and replaced by Lieutenant (jg) Raymond C. Chaisson, USNR, previously the Executive Officer.PC-598 Log Book, 2 May 1945 On 5 May PC 598 was moored port side to the landing craft support ship LCS-62 in order to take on water. After the initial landing bombardment, LCS-62 had been assigned to picket ship duty on stations 25‚Äì80 miles off the main invasion beaches of Okinawa to intercept Japanese planes and to warn the main forces of the approach of enemy aircraft. Typical of many of the radar picket ships, LCS-62 survived over 150 air raids and went to general quarters over 200 times before the campaign ended. = Mail and taxi service = On 9 May the submarine chaser was ordered to Ie Shima where she took on the less glamorous role of delivering mail and passengers. Ie Shima, a small island twenty miles north of the Hagushi landing beaches, had been captured after a six-day battle on 24 April to provide additional airfields for air strikes in Okinawa and Japan. It is also the final resting place of Ernie Pyle, American journalist and war correspondent, killed there on 18 April 1945.Appleman, et al., p. 163 The sub chaser ran a daily route starting from the amphibious force command ship Panamint at Ie Shima to the dock landing ship Epping Forest at Nago Wan to the amphibious force command ship Eldorado at Bisa-Gawa, off the original Hagushi landing areas, and back to Ie Shima.PC-598 Log Book, May 1945 On 14 May while at Ie Shima, PC-598 received water from the tank landing ship LST-808. While still at Ie Shima four days later, LST-808 was struck by a Japanese aerial torpedo. Pushed onto a nearby coral reef by U.S. ships, she was attacked a second time on 20 May by a Japanese kamikaze.Cressman, p. 320-321 On 17 May PC-598 was relieved as mail ship by SC-1278 and returned to Nago Wan. While there, the ship continued to make regular trips to Hagushi to take on water and deliver mail and passengers to various ships, including the amphibious force command ship Ancon on 21 May. In need of repairs, the ship relocated to the Hagushi anchorage and moored alongside Coronis on 23 May, remaining until repairs were completed on 30 May.PC-598 Log Book, May 1945 During May air attacks remained a daily threat to the U.S. fleet at Okinawa, including four major kamikaze attacks involving 550 Japanese planes.Appleman, et al., p. 364 = Iheya and Aguni operations = Iheya-Aguni Operations Chart Iheya Shima and Aguni Shima are two small islands about 30 miles north and west, respectively, of Okinawa. Because of the heavy damage sustained by the U.S. fleet and especially the radar pickets during kamikaze raids, the decision was made to capture them for long-range radar and fighter director facilities.Frank, p. 5 On 3 June, PC-598 accompanied the amphibious landing force to Iheya Shima, providing anti-submarine screening en route to the island and during the landing. The Aguni Shima landing followed on 9 June, with PC-598 providing similar services.PC-598 Log Book, June 1945 Both landings were unopposed.Frank, p. 5 After Aguni Shima, PC-598 remained in and around Hagushi anchorage including one excursion on 16 June to pick up passengers arriving at seaplane anchorage V-4 at Kerama Retto and deliver them to Hagushi. On 23 June the PC was ordered to escort the cargo ship San Bruno to Nakagusuku Wan.PC-598 Log Book, June 1945 This large bay on the southern coast of Okinawa was referred to as Buckner Bay by American soldiers in honor of General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., commander of the 10th Army, killed on Okinawa 18 June 1945.Frank, p. 353 Buckner was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer lost to enemy fire during World War II.Sarantakes, p. 129 = Aftermath = The invasion of Okinawa was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater.Frank, et al., p. 793 About 548,000 men of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps took part, with 318 combatant and 1139 auxiliary vessels.King, p. 176 The toll on US ground troops exceeded 12,500 killed, 36,600 wounded and over 26,000 neuropsychiatric ‚Äúnon-battle‚Äù casualties. These were the highest experienced in any campaign against the Japanese. The Navy suffered over 4,900 dead and 4,800 wounded, the most in any single operation. The US also lost 36 ships and another 368 damaged, mostly by air attack. 763 carrier based aircraft were lost to all causes.Appleman, p. 473 At least 110,000 Japanese troops and native islander defenders were killed and only 7,400 taken prisoner during the battle.Appleman, p. 473-474 At least 42,000 civilians on the island also died during the battle, caught between the opposing forces.Frank, et al., p. 396 These casualty figures, as well as those from other island campaigns, were used by U.S. military planners to estimate that Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, would result in well over 1,000,000 U.S. and 5,000,000 Japanese casualties. These estimates put the decision made to use atomic weapons against the Japanese in context.Hansen, ‚Äú...because the Japanese on Okinawa... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties.\\"  Goodbye to all that  The next morning in Hagushi anchorage, PC-598 received lube oil, fuel and fresh water from the tanker Armadillo and collected guard mail from PCS-1390. By 1030 on 24 June 1945 the ship was en route from Okinawa to Pearl Harbor via Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands.PC-598 Log Book, 24 June 1945 The convoy took 11 days to travel the 2,145 nautical miles between Okinawa and Eniwetok Atoll, arriving on 5 July.PC-598 Log Book, 5 July 1945 After the war, this remote atoll was used for nuclear testing as part of the Pacific Proving Grounds. Forty-three nuclear tests were fired at Eniwetok from 1948 to 1958, including Ivy Mike, the first full scale test of a thermonuclear device.Diehl, Sarah and Moltz, James Clay. Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: A Reference Book. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 208. The convoy of LSTs left the atoll, escorted by PC-598, 3 days later on 8 July. This last leg of the trip to Pearl Harbor was another 2,000 nautical miles. The journey went smoothly until 12 July when PCS-1379 developed engine trouble and was taken under tow by PC-598 and other ships in the convoy. PC-598 arrived safely at Pearl Harbor at noon 21 July 1945.PC-598 Log Book, July 1945 It had left Pearl Harbor 537 days earlier on 31 January 1944. The war was over for PC-598 and its crew, but no one knew it at the time. The U.S. Navy and Army were preparing for the invasion of the Japanese home islands and wanted all available ships in good repair. In late July, the war weary ship was sent for a major overhaul of its engines. It unloaded its munitions, discharged its fuel at Merry Point and berthed at Baker #8 at the Navy Yard in Pearl Harbor.PC-598 Log Book, 23 July 1945 On 16 August Lieutenant (jg) Chaisson was relieved of duties as Commanding Officer, replaced by Lieutenant (jg) Edwin J. Adams, Jr. the Executive Officer.PC-598 Log Book, 16 August 1945 To the enormous relief of U.S. military personnel in the Pacific, the war ended 14 August 1945 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Appleman, et al., p. 474, \\"...there came the almost unbelievable and joyous news that the war was over. \\"Sledge, p. 312, \\"We received the news with quiet disbelief coupled with an indescribable sense of relief.\\" The engine overhaul was eventually completed and the ship returned to Astoria, Oregon just before Christmas Day, 1945. Like many of the hundreds of smaller vessels built during the war, PC-598 was quickly decommissioned. On 16 November 1946 the ship was sold to the Foss Tug and Barge Company of Tacoma, Washington.Silverstone, p. 186 = A China connection? = Between 1946 and 1949, 14 ex-PCs were reportedly transferred to the Kuomintang government of China (Nationalist forces) including ex-PCs 490, 492, 593, 595, 598, 1088, 1089, 1090, 1091, 1233, 1247, 1549, 1551, and 1557. When the Nationalist forces fled the mainland for Taiwan in January 1949, ten of the ex-PCs went with them, including ex-PCs 490, 492, 593, 598, 1089, 1233, 1247, 1549, 1551, and 1557. Four remained on the mainland and served with the navy of the People‚Äôs Republic of China (Communist China), including ex-PCs 595, 1088, 1090, and 1091. PC-598 reportedly remained on the naval register the Republic of China (Nationalist China) until 1954.Gardiner, p. 57Blackman, p. 173 (1951-52), p. 148 (1952-53), and p. 154 (1953-54) If true, PC-598 was the only ex-PC not transferred directly from the U.S. government to the Kuomintang forces. At least one source admits to some uncertainty regarding a positive identification of PC-598 among these vessels and the fate of the ship remains uncertain.Gardiner, p. 57  Awards and honors  PC-598 received four battle stars for her World War II service:Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual, p. 117 * Western Caroline Islands Operation - Capture and occupation of southern Palau Islands (Peleliu) * Leyte Operation - Leyte landings * Luzon Operation - Lingayen Gulf landingsNavy and Marine Corps Awards Manual, as amended by memo dated 19 August 1954, Enclosure 7, p. 2 * Okinawa Gunto Operation - Assault and occupation of Okinawa Depending on time of service, crew members were eligible for one or more of the following medals: * World War II Victory Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 7 stars * American Campaign Medal - WWII * Philippine Liberation Medal with 2 stars  Notes  References *PC-598 Operational Remarks, March 1943 *PC-598 Administrative Remarks, March 1943 - January 1944 *PC-598 Log Book, December 1943 - August 1945 *PC-598 War Diary, February 1944 - September 1945 * Anderson, Robert Charles, Center of Military History, Western Pacific: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, 1994, Government Printing Office pamphlet * Anderson, Robert Charles, Center of Military History, Leyte: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, 1994, Government Printing Office pamphlet * Appleman, Roy E., Burns, James M., Gugeler, Russell A., and Stevens, John, Okinawa: The Last Battle, 1947, Historical Division, War Department Special Staff * Askew, William C., History of the Naval Armed Guard Afloat, World War II, 1946, Director of Naval Operations, Washington DC * Bates, Richard W., Battle for Leyte Gulf, October 1944, Strategical and Tactical Analysis, Vol. 5, Battle of Surigao Strait, from 1042 October 23rd until 0733 October 25th., 1958, U.S. Naval War College * Blackman, Raymond (Editor), Jane's Fighting Ships, 1951-52, 1952, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York * Blackman, Raymond (Editor), Jane's Fighting Ships, 1952-53, 1953, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York * Blackman, Raymond (Editor), Jane's Fighting Ships, 1953-54, 1954, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York * Cressman, Robert, The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II, 1999, US Naval Institute Press * Chen, C.

Based on the success of the comedy, a later music video of the same was also made. The original The original version of the song appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! special show broadcast on the night of February 24‚Äì25, 2013 immediately after the 85th Academy Awards (2013). Kimmel's comedy writers wrote the original lyrics on occasion of Kimmel inviting both stars to his show, with Jamie Foxx going along with the plan to surprise Channing during the special by presenting verses on a catch phrase invented by Kimmel. Upon the latter's invitation, Foxx went on performing the verses on the piano. As an opener, Guillermo, Kimmel's side-kick served the drinks, with Channing opting to grab the whole bottle. Foxx went on to play the agreed verses, three in number with Kimmel trying his hand with another two verses. In between each verse, Channing would make funny, and at times, disparaging comments as a reaction trying to stop them from uttering profanities based on his name. Kimmel in a self-deprecating manner responded by saying \\"I guess I didn't understand what channing all over your tatum actually means\\", adding \\"It just makes no sense\\". At the end, Foxx says \\"I think we need to finish it the right way\\" upon which Channing in a self-deprecating finale and a reminder of his own past as a male stripper goes on to \\"[channing]\\" all over the piano.Excerpt from the Jimmy Kimmel special with Foxx and Kimmel performing \\"(I Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum\\" to Channing Tatum Foxx says about the skit: \\"We all pitched in [for the skit]. It's funny, that stuff. He's [Channing's] cool, too. He embraces it. A lot of times you don't see celebrities embracing silliness. It was a good time\\". Music video After the immense response to the performance, Channing, Foxx and Kimmel decided to spend the week-end at Jamie Foxx's place to work on the song and record it and prepare a music video to accompany the song. Channing said he was so thrilled to do the music video. The music video was shot by Will Burke and it was released on Jackhole Records, with official credits as \\"Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum featuring Jimmy Kimmel\\". Channing says he was so thrilled to do the video in which he repeats several times the catch phrase reminiscent of his role in Magic Mike and word play on the film's title: The video commences with various women drooling over their favorite sex symbol Channing Tatum and chanting 'Channing, Channing, Channing'. Foxx and Tatum sing their verses on a beach. Clips of Foxx and Tatum rescuing women from bizarre situations and dancing are interspersed throughout the video. Various objects explode as an allusion to male sexual climax. The song delivers a word of caution and advice: Miley Cyrus, Olivia Munn and Gabourey Sidibe agreed to appear in the official music video and pitched in with additional materials. The music video opens with Olivia Munn chanting Channing's name in her bedroom. She is soon supplanted by Precious star Gabourey Sidibe, who is also incanting the actor's name in her own bedroom. Jimmy Kimmel then goes on to rescue Miley Cyrus from under a vending machine so that she can sing her verse wearing a T-shirt saying Channing and holding a bag of candy bearing the actor's name. She also thanks Kimmel for saving her saying: \\"Thanks man, you just Channinged all over my Tatum\\". Matt Damon also made a cameo appearance \\"giving the middle finger\\" which is blurred by the FCC \\"censor\\", alluding to the Kimmel's regular \\"Unnecessary Censorship\\" feature on his regular show. The video also claims Channing Tatum \\"can do anything\\", including launching like a rocket. The music video ends with Tatum skywriting his name as Foxx exclaims: \\"Channing is the best!\\" Reaction The release of the music video on the official Jimmy Kimmel Live YouTube channel garnered big viewership exceeding 25.2 million views and prompted many tribute and lampoon videos by various fans online. Also on a follow-up show on Kimmel, Channing commented: \\"Everyone is talking about it. (On the Today Show), Hoda [Kotb] was like, 'Would you Hoda all over my Kotb?' I'm going to let y'all play with that one or I'll get in trouble\\".

He was one of the most knowledgeable Englishmen of his generation about Russian life and literature. Life Calderon was born in St John's Wood, the fifth son of the Victorian painter Philip Hermogenes Calderon, and educated at Rugby and Trinity College, Oxford, before training as a barrister. From 1895 to 1897 he worked in Russia as a teacher, journalist and scholar, then returned to England, learned several other Slavonic languages and in 1900 became an assistant librarian at the British Museum. During this time he pursued his research into Slavonic folklore, married, and published many stories, articles and translations. In 1903, Calderon left the British Museum to become a full-time writer. In 1906 he lived for two months on Tahiti. On his return, he regularly reviewed for the Times Literary Supplement. Calderon was the first person to translate into English and successfully direct a full- length play by Anton Chekhov (The Seagull, at Glasgow in 1909). He also published notable translations of Chekhov and Ilya Tolstoy, and wrote several ballet libretti for Michel Fokine. Between 1908 and 1910 Calderon worked closely with leaders of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League. His plays The Fountain, The Little Stone House and Revolt were performed all over Britain between 1909 and 1913. In 1914 he succeeded in enlisting in the British army at the age of 45, seeing action in Flanders. George Calderon was killed at Gallipoli on 4 June 1915. The book Tahiti was posthumously published in 1921, to great acclaim, and in 1925 a production in London of Calderon's translation of The Cherry Orchard established Chekhov as a new force in the English theatre.

The brand is distributed by The Kayo Corp, a partnership that was established through Stevie Williams and Troy Morgan of The Kayo Corp. History As part of the \\"Est.\\" segment on the Berrics website, Williams revealed in 2012 that the idea of DGK \\"really came out of nowhere\\", further explaining that the company was built upon the Gold skateboard wheels brand that he co-owned with his good friend Eli Soto. Williams stated in the interview that the \\"Dirty Ghetto Kids\\" name was thought of fairly immediately, elaborating that he \\"didn't really second-guess\\", as it was what he \\"really wanted to do\\". Williams also explained that he created a brand that was consciously different from the expectations that preceded the official launch, such as the rumor that Williams was going to only recruit African-American skateboarders. In September 2009, the recruitment of Williams' close friend and skateboarding partner Josh Kalis was announced. Kalis, formerly of the Alien Workshop brand, skated together with Williams during the 1990s in Philadelphia, U.S. at the LOVE Park location. Both Kalis and Williams filmed often with William Strobeck. Their skateboarding during the period was documented in numerous videos, including the ON Video series, Transworld SKATEboarding's The Reason. In December 2010, Rodrigo Teixeira announced his departure from Flip Skateboards and the official statement from the company read: \\"Everyone at Flip would like to thank Rodrigo for all the good times and wish him all the best for the future.\\" Teixeira subsequently joined the roster of DGK and explained his decision in a January 2011 interview: \\"I feel like it was time for me to make a move and do what I wanted to do. With DGK we are into the same things. We can all kick it and skate at the same spot. It‚Äôs just more who I am.\\" DGK collaborated with the Zero Skateboards company, founded and owned by professional skateboarder Jamie Thomas, in mid 2011 on the \\"Fresh 'Til Death project. The two companies completed a U.S. tour together and released products‚Äîthe Zero \\"Dirty\\" and the \\"Dirty Zero Kids\\" series of skateboard decks‚Äîfollowing the tour. The collaboration was the result of an airplane conversation between Kalis and Thomas in early 2011. Williams announced the establishment of the \\"Da Playground\\" indoor training facility in 2011‚Äîthe facility is located in Atlanta, Georgia, US and its main purpose is to provide a location for the DGK team to skate. However, footage that has been filmed inside the facility has also featured non-DGK skateboarders. Williams spoke with the Wall Street Journal in July 2012 to promote the expansion of the brand into the Macy's department store chain. In response to a question regarding the financial growth that follows the expansion, Williams explained: > My personal goal is, like, I want my son and daughter to be old enough that > their still around to where they can remember that, you know, daddy's > company DGK is, like, on the billboards, or maybe commercials on TV, and, > you know, those are the things that I like to pride myself on. Because I can > tell them, \\"Once upon a time\\" stories that were real, but can actually let > them know that you can defy adversity. The world premiere of the Parental Advisory full-length video was held at The Avalon in Hollywood, California, U.S. on December 11, 2012. Prior to the screening, the DGK team was given custom DGK pinky rings made by Ben Baller, and Juicy J and Trinidad James performed music afterwards. The retail release of the video occurred on December 14, 2012. Following the release of Parental Advisory, the majority of the DGK squad filmed a \\"United Nations\\" segment for the Berrics website, and Keelan Dadd was assigned professional status after five years with the company. Williams explained the ethos of both himself and DGK in a 2013 interview with the European skateboard publication, Kingpin‚Äîthe importance of fun, friendship, and community is highlighted: > I like reminiscing about the things that made me psyched on skating as a > kid, it helps me go out there and keep doing it. The problem with most > videos these days is that they just show how challenging skateboarding is, > rather than showing how fun it is. I don‚Äôt have time for that shit. It feels > like they are going too far, we‚Äôve got to go back in time‚Ä¶ It just doesn‚Äôt > look fun anymore. I think that‚Äôs why the DGK video was so successful. We > would go out all together, skate the same spots and you can actually see > that we are having a bunch of fun. Boo Johnson and Marquise Henry were announced as the newest professionals on the DGK team in July 2014. A video to commemorate their new status was released on July 18, 2014. It was widely regarded as one of the best videos of 2014. =\\"Free Fabes\\" campaign= On October 5, 2012, DGK launched the \\"Free Fabes\\" campaign to raise legal fees for Williams' close friend and former professional skateboarder, Fabian Alomar. A member of the now-defunct brand, Menace, Alomar was arrested and detained on a drug possession charge and faced a lengthy sentence due to California's \\"3-strike\\" legislation. Williams appeared in a video segment, alongside Alomar, to promote the campaign. An unseen video part from Alomar, filmed during the height of his career, was published on the internet as part of the campaign. Awards The DGK team was selected for the \\"Best Team\\" award at the 15th Annual Transworld SKATEboarding Awards. It's produced by Transworld SKATEboarding magazine; the award followed a sixteen-page feature in its April 2012 issue. They created a full-length video Parental Advisory, in which every team member contributed a full video part (DGK was nominated alongside the Element and Chocolate teams).

The company was founded by Tim Piersant and Joe Ledbetter. The 1816 brand was launched in April 2012, and the company simultaneously announced its intention to help change local distilling laws. The launch met with some initial criticism, primarily due to where the product was made (contract manufactured at MGP/LDI of Indiana), but Hamilton County laws prohibited the manufacture of \\"intoxicating liquors\\" at the time. Local public awareness eventually became a catalyst in galvanizing support to change Prohibition-era distilling laws. In March 2015, the company opened the first legal distillery in Chattanooga since Prohibition. The first experimental whiskey, \\"Batch 001: Tennessee High Malt\\", was released in August 2017. The company‚Äôs production facility and headquarters is located on Chattanooga‚Äôs riverfront and engages in larger scale production of select recipes created at the experimental facility. The facility began production in 2017 and has made Chattanooga Whiskey one of the largest craft whiskey producers in the state of Tennessee.  History  = 2011 = In November 2011, the launch of Chattanooga Whiskey Company was announced along with a plan to release a first whiskey by early 2012. Because it was illegal at the time to distill spirits in Chattanooga, the company revealed it would sell whiskey distilled in Lawrenceburg, Indiana and bottled in Nashville, Tennessee. Co-founders Tim Piersant and Joe Ledbetter expressed interest in the process for changing the county's distilling laws. = 2012 = In April 2012, the company announced the release of two locally-inspired whiskeys: 1816 Reserve and 1816 Cask. The 1816 in the name comes from the year a trading post was set up by the river in the area that eventually became Chattanooga. Both have the same mash bill of 75% corn, 21% rye, and 4% malted barley, but the Reserve is 90 proof compared to 113.6 proof for the Cask. On November 15, 2012, Piersant and Ledbetter presented a pro-economic case to a crowded Hamilton County commission chamber to show the benefits of local spirit production. The local community and local commissioners were largely supportive, and shortly after the courthouse session ‚Äì on November 21, 2012 ‚Äì the Hamilton County Commission voted to adopt a non-binding resolution for the Tennessee General Assembly. = 2013 = In 2013, the founders launched the \\"Vote Whiskey\\" campaign to promote the legalization of distilling in Hamilton County. In March, the company announced plans to build a distillery on Fort and 14th Streets, on the south side of Chattanooga, pending the passing of House Bill 102 to allow legal distilling in the county. The 30,000-square-foot property was the original site of the Turnbull Cone Machine Company in 1910 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The estimated cost for the project was $2 million. In May 2013, House Bill 102 ‚Äì nicknamed the \\"whiskey bill\\" and sponsored by Joe Carr, R-Lascassas and Bill Ketron, R-Murfreesboro ‚Äì was signed by Governor Bill Haslam, allowing Chattanooga Whiskey to begin the process of building the first legal distillery in Hamilton County in a century. The plan to build at the previously announced location fell through, and in October 2013, the company announced plans for a different distillery location on the corner of 4th and Broad Streets in downtown Chattanooga. The 60,000-square-foot property known as the John Ross Building was estimated to be a $6 million investment. Construction delays were announced in March 2014, and the location was abandoned in September 2014 due to structural and logistical issues. = 2014 = In April 2014, the parent company of Chattanooga Whiskey ‚Äì Tennessee Stillhouse ‚Äì launched Freedom Moonshine. This brand is no longer produced. In July, co-founder Joe Ledbetter announced he was resigning from the company, citing personal and professional reasons. In September, after deciding not to renovate the John Ross Building for the distillery, the company announced a plan to open a 100-gallon micro-distillery across from the historic Chattanooga Choo Choo. The site included research and development operations for the brand and served as a tour and tasting location for the public. In December, the company announced the hiring of Grant McCracken as its head distiller. McCracken had previously worked as Head Brewer of R&D; at Samuel Adams in Boston, Massachusetts, and he came on board in the midst of the micro-distillery build out. = 2015 = Work on the 2,500-square-foot micro-distillery began at the end of 2014 and concluded in March 2015. The grand opening for the location ‚Äì originally called Tennessee Stillhouse Micro Distillery ‚Äì took place on March 24, 2015, with the initiation of both tours and distilling operations. The distillery was named one of Southern Living's \\"50 Best Places in the South\\" in its first year. In March 2017, this location was renamed Chattanooga Whiskey Experimental Distillery. In August 2015, Tennessee Stillhouse launched Dr. Thacher's Cocktail Syrups, a joint venture between Tennessee Stillhouse and Pure Sodaworks to produce a series of non-alcoholic, pre-mixed syrups for making common whiskey cocktails. In November, the company released its first whiskey called Chattanooga Whiskey 100, a white Tennessee malted bourbon. The 100 in the name refers to the century that passed before it became legal again to distill whiskey in Chattanooga. Additionally, the whiskey is 100 proof, and only 100 cases were produced. The company had more than 50 experimental whiskeys aging by the end of 2015. = 2016 = In April 2016, Chattanooga Whiskey won a series of awards for its 1816 line of straight bourbon whiskeys. At the 2016 San Francisco World Spirit Awards, the 1816 Reserve won Double Gold for small batch bourbon, and the 1816 Cask won Gold in the same category. At the American Distilling Institute Spirit Competition, the 1816 Cask won Gold for straight bourbon. At the International Whisky Competition, the 1816 Cask won Gold for \\"Best Bourbon Whiskey\\", and the 1816 Reserve won Gold for \\"Best Small Batch Bourbon\\". In July, the company announced plans to open a larger, 46,000-square-foot production facility on the corner of Riverfront Parkway and Martin Luther King Boulevard in the historic former Newton Chevrolet car dealership. Construction activities on this property began in late July 2016 and were completed in March 2017. = 2017 = In March 2017, the new facility opened on Riverfront Parkway with 15,000 square feet of barrel storage space (enough for 4,000 53-gallon white oak barrels), 3,000 square feet of office space, and 5,000 square feet of event space for approximately 300 guests. The company held a launch party for the public at the facility in December, but there are no plans to offer tours or public access at this location at this time. Tours are conducted at the original micro-distillery location on the south side. In August 2017, the company announced the release of its first aged Chattanooga whiskey as part of the Experimental Single Batch Series. Batch 001 was a \\"Tennessee High Malt\\", and 228 cases were produced. This style has now become a focus for the brand, as many of its experimental whiskeys have used \\"high malt\\" phrasing. In October, the 1816 line was extended to include the Native Series, the result of a collaborative partnership between Chattanooga Whiskey and six local breweries ‚Äì Terminal Brewhouse, Hutton & Smith Brewing Company, Moccasin Bend Brewing Company, OddStory Brewing Company, Big River Brewing Works, and Chattanooga Brewing Company ‚Äì and one Nashville brewery, Yazoo Brewing Company. The Native Series whiskeys are finished in casks previously used to age different style beers from each brewery. The distillery plans to produce new batches of the Native Series every year. In November, the company released Batch 002 and Batch 003 in the Experimental Series. Batch 002 is a smoked high malt, while Batch 003 is a native barrel whiskey because of its aging in smoked beer barrels previously used to age the Native Series. For 2017, Chattanooga Whiskey production demand was about 10,000 cases for products that are available in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia. Actual production before opening the new riverfront location was only about 2,500 cases a year out of the microdistillery, leading the distillery to source bourbon from an Indiana distillery to meet the 10,000-case volume in the past. The new location will increase distillery production to 14 barrels per day versus one barrel per week at the micro-distillery location. = 2018 = In February 2018, the company released three additional experimental whiskeys: Batch 004, Batch 005, and Batch 006. Batch 004 is Scottish-style high malt, Batch 005 is a wheated high malt, and Batch 006 is a beer-barrel-finished wheated high malt that shared barrels with Hutton & Smith's Wee Heavy Ale. All three whiskeys were bottled at 102 proof. The next experimental release ‚Äì available on a very limited basis with only about 60 cases of each whiskey produced ‚Äì took place in May. Batch 007 is a Tennessee rye malt, and Batch 008 is a Tennessee single malt. At the 2018 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, the company won five medals for its whiskeys and two for its packaging.  Distillery locations  = Chattanooga Whiskey Experimental Distillery = Located at the original site on Market Street, this location was first named Tennessee Stillhouse after the Chattanooga Whiskey parent company of the same name. The distillery opened in March, 2015, at which point all the blending and bottling for 1816 began. This location makes approximately one barrel of whiskey per week on a 100-gallon system with one cooker, three fermenters, and a Vendome hybrid pot/column still. As the home of the Experimental Single Batch Series and the birthplace of \\"Tennessee High Malt\\", the distillery has released eight batches of experimental whiskey since August 2017, most highlighting a high malt style. = Chattanooga Whiskey Riverfront Headquarters = Located on Riverfront Parkway, this location has become the headquarters and main production facility for the company. The distillery was opened to the public in December, 2017, for an open house event, but is currently only available for private events in the adjacent event hall. The system ‚Äì made by Vendome ‚Äì consists of four 2,700-gallon fermenters, a 2,700-gallon cooker, a beer well, a 12-inch, 30-foot continuous column still, and a custom 100-gallon doubler that can produce up to 14 barrels a day when running on a 24-hour shift. The barrelhouse has space for 4,500 53-gallon barrels and houses a large 4,000-gallon, charred white oak Solera tank for finishing. The facility also has a 4,000-square-foot event hall that is available for private events.

Its goal is to create a partially proportional division of a heterogeneous resource among n people, such that each person receives a subset of the cake which that person values as at least 1/an of the total, where a\\\\geq 10 is some sufficiently large constant. It is a randomized algorithm whose running time is O(n) with probability close to 1. The protocol was developed by Jeff Edmonds and Kirk Pruhs, who later improved it in joint work with Jaisingh Solanki.  Motivation  A proportional division of a cake can be achieved using the recursive halving algorithm in time O(n log n). Several hardness results show that this run-time is optimal under a wide variety of assumptions. In particular, recursive halving is the fastest possible algorithm for achieving full proportionality when the pieces must be contiguous, and it is the fastest possible deterministic algorithm for achieving even partial proportionality and even when the pieces are allowed to be disconnected. One case which is not covered by the hardness results is the case of randomized algorithms, guaranteeing only partial proportionality and with possibly disconnected pieces. The Edmonds‚ÄìPruhs protocol aims to provide an algorithm with run-time O(n) for this case.  The protocol  The general scheme is as follows: # Each partner privately partitions the cake to an pieces of equal subjective value. These n ‚ãÖ an pieces are called candidate pieces. # Each partner picks 2d candidate pieces uniformly at random, with replacement (d is a constant to be determined later). The candidates are grouped into d pairs, which the partner reports to the algorithm. These n‚ãÖd pairs are called quarterfinal brackets. # From each quarterfinal bracket, the algorithm selects a single piece - the piece that intersects the fewer number of other candidate pieces. These n ‚ãÖ d pieces are called semifinal pieces. # For each partner, the algorithm selects a single piece; they are called final pieces. The final pieces are selected such that each point of the cake is covered by at most 2 final pieces (see below). If this succeeds, proceed to step #5. If this fails, start over at step #1. # Each part of the cake which belongs to only a single final piece, is given to the owner of that piece. Each part of the cake which belongs to two final pieces, is divided proportionally by any deterministic proportional division algorithm. The algorithm guarantees that, with high probability, each partner receives at least half of one of his candidate pieces, which implies (if the values are additive) a value of at least 1/2an. There are O(n) candidate pieces and O(n) additional divisions in step #5, each of which takes O(1) time. Hence the total run-time of the algorithm is O(n). The main challenge in this scheme is selecting the final pieces in step #4: Start by creating the implication graph: a graph whose nodes are the semifinal pieces, and there is an edge from piece I of partner i to piece J of partner j if piece I intersects the other piece of partner j (hence, if we select piece I and want to avoid intersection, we ought to select piece J too). Select an arbitrary partner i that has not received a piece yet, and select an arbitrary piece I of that partner as a final piece. Then, traverse the links in the implication graph and select as final pieces all pieces that are reachable from I. There are two good scenarios: either we allocate a single final piece to each partner and we are done, or we reach a piece with no outgoing links (which implies that it does not intersect other pieces). In the latter case we just pick another piece of one of the remaining partners and continue. The bad scenario is that our traversal leads us to two different pieces of the same partner, or equivalently to the other piece of partner i from whom we started. Such a path, leading from one piece of partner i to another piece of the same partner, is called a pair path. If the implication graph contains no pair paths, then the selection algorithm just described returns a collection of n non-overlapping final pieces and we are done. Now it remains to calculate the probability that the implication graph contains a pair path. First, consider the special case in which all partners have the same value function (and hence the same collection of candidate pieces). In this case the probability of a pair path is easy to calculate: since the probability of each edge is 1/an, and all edges are independent, the probability of a specific pair path of length k is 1/(an)k, and the probability of any pair path is at most: :\\\\sum_k \\\\frac{(2dn)!}{(2dn-k)!(an)^k} = O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a^2}\\\\right) By selecting d=1 and a sufficiently large, it is possible to make this probability as small as we want. This is true even if we omit the semi-final selection phase (#3) and just take all quarter-final pieces as semi-final. Note that this case is analogous to the balls into bins model. It proves that, if d bins are picked randomly for each ball, then it is possible to select one bin for each ball such that the bins are all distinct (the maximum load is 1). In the general cake model, where the value functions are different, the probabilities of the edges in the implication graph are dependent. but thanks to the semi-final selection phase, we can prove that the probability that the implication graph contains a pair path of length at least 3 is at most \\\\frac{32 d^5}{a^2\\\\cdot(a - 4 d^2)}. It remains to handle pair paths of length 2. Unfortunately the probability of having such pair paths in the implication graph is not negligible. However, with high probability it is possible to partition the partners to two groups, such that in each group there is no pair path of length 2. Hence, we can run the final-piece-selection algorithm twice: once for each group. Intersection can occur only between final pieces of different groups; hence the overlap in each point of the cake is at most 2. The probability that such a 2-partition is not possible is at most \\\\frac{16 d^3}{a^3}+\\\\frac{8d^2}{a^2}. By summing the above two expressions and setting d = 2, we get that the probability of failure is still O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a^2}\\\\right). Recall that a is the proportionality ratio - the more value we want to guarantee each partner, the more likely it is that the division will fail and we will have to start over at step #1. The same algorithm works also when the cuts are approximate, i.e., the partners do not know to mark pieces with exactly the same value; they might mark a piece with a value of p percent above or below the required value, where the exact error is picked at random.  A high-confidence protocol  It is possible to further reduce the probability of failure using the following scheme: * Make two independent runs of the original protocol. * In each run, remove every partner that appears in the beginning of a pair path, and allocate final pieces only to the remaining partners as in the original protocol. * If for every partner there is at least one run in which it is not removed, then we are done since every partner now holds at least one final piece. The probability of removing a specific partner in each run is O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right). The probability of removing a specific partner in both runs is O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\right). Hence the probability of failure is O\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{n^2}\\\\right)=O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right), which goes to 0 when n increases, even when the partial proportionality ratio a is kept constant.  Related problems  The cake model can be seen as a generalization of the balls into bins model. This model has found wide applications in areas such as load balancing. In these situations, a ball represents a job that can be assigned to various bins/machines. Roughly speaking, load-balancing of identical machines is to balls and bins, as load balancing on unrelated machines is to cake-cutting. Hence, it is reasonable that the cake model and the Edmonds‚ÄìPruhs protocol should have interesting applications in settings involving load balancing on unrelated machines.

Painting  The painting shows a tastefully dressed young man in a floppy hat with his hand on his hip in a characteristic Hals pose. The dress of the man fits his occupation, that of a Haarlem brewer, but unlike other Haarlem brewers that Hals portrayed, we don't find his name in the archives of the local militias. We don't know the occasion for which it was painted, but the painting is probably not a wedding pendant, because Hals was quite consistent with his pendant portraits; positioning the man on the left and the woman on the right. This allowed the light which always shines from the left in his paintings, to shine directly on the woman's face and not the man's. Possibly this portrait was made to decorate a hofje or his brewery, so that people who worked for him or visited the premises could know what the owner Claes Duyst van Voorhout looked like. For the same reason it is also possible that this painting was a pendant to the portrait of a business partner, rather than a wife. For example, the shape, size, period, and position matches that of Portrait of a Young man holding a glove: File:Frans Hals - Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove - WGA11160.jpg File:Frans Hals - Claes Duyst van Voorhout.jpg Provenance The painting is one of the best documented paintings in Hals' oeuvre, first documented by Gustav Friedrich Waagen in his description of the paintings of the Lord Egremont in 1854. After that it was included by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883, by Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909, Hofstede de Groot in 1910, by W.R. Valentiner in 1923, Trivas in 1941 and by Gerrit David Gratama in 1946. Both Seymour Slive and Claus Grimm agree it is by Hals. The MET lists various sale entries from Lord Egremont's time up to their acquisition date. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive included discussion of an old label on the back which listed the portrayed man as Claes Duyst van Voorhout, brewer in \\"De Zwaanschel\\".Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive as editor, with contributions by Pieter Biesboer, Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S.

Initially sung by Bruno Lauzi, it was subsequently re-recorded by numerous other artists. The most popular version remains the one which its author gave in 1972. The song = Meaning = The lyrics recount the nostalgic thoughts of a man who is in love with a somewhat distant woman. The song does not say who she is: she may be a former lover or wife, with whom the protagonist broke up, or maybe just a casually encountered woman he immediately fell in love with. The protagonist, in any case, can't help but think of her constantly: the first and third stanza describe the actions of his daily life, each one followed by \\"... e penso a te\\" (\\"... and I think of you\\"), a line which highlights his obsession and his inability to fully enjoy what he is doing. During the day, the protagonist is at work, then comes home, and has a date with his current girlfriend, but keeps on thinking to his real love and fails to appear funny and involved; he finally goes to bed but can't sleep for the same reason. In the second stanza, he asks himself what she might be doing in this moment and bets she is searching for him too; but he has no true hope, because \\"the city is too big for two who, like us, are looking for each other\\". The three stanzas are followed by an instrumental coda which represents the explosion of nostalgia. In Battisti's rendering, the coda has a final diminuendo in which all of the instruments dissolve into silence, leaving only the singer's voice, as to represent his loneliness in the world. Mogol, who wrote the song's lyrics, told that the protagonist ¬´still hopes in a casual encounter; the desire to see each other is such that there is the will for a miracle, for something impossible, opposed to the reality which seems impregnable. [...] It's a constant search. As if they were dogs: there's something that goes beyond reasoning, a kind of animal instinct¬ª.Giammario Fontana, Mogol. Umanamente uomo, Sperlink & Kupfer, 1999, page 67. = Composition = The lyrics of the song were written in just 19 minutes during a drive on the Milano-Como Highway in which Mogol composed the lyrics almost entirely improvising while Lucio Battisti sung the melody line. The drive took place on a full-loaded tiny car; on board there were four people including Mario Lavezzi. According to some versions, Battisti was driving, according to others he was sitting in the passenger seat and Mogol himself drove the car. When Battisti composed the song, he didn't believe it could become successful: he famously said that ¬´this one won't make it, doesn't have enough rhythm, it's weak¬ª. For this reason, he didn't record the song himself but gave it to Bruno Lauzi, and even Lauzi's rendering wasn't given much emphasis (it was released in 1970 as B-side of another song written by Battisti and Mogol, named Mary oh Mary). The single wasn't a success and sold just over 30,000 copies. The song became a hit and a classic of Italian pop music only two years later, when Battisti sung the song himself and included it in the album Umanamente uomo: il sogno. = Legacy = According to a document published on 5 August 2009, the song was censured in Argentina by the National Reorganization Process with the newsletter 24-COMFER on 25 July 1978, along with songs by other internationally famous artists such as John Lennon, Queen, Joan Baez, The Doors, Pink Floyd, Donna Summer and Eric Clapton.

It was also released as a bonus track on the Italian edition of \\"The Cappuccino Songs\\", and released as a promotional single there in 1998.

It is present in southern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan, and consists primarily of calcareous shale. It was named for the Favel River near Minitonas, Manitoba, by R.T.D. Wickenden in 1945. The Favel Formation is richly fossiliferous and had yielded remains of a wide variety of marine animals, including the marine crocodile Terminonaris.Collom, C.J. 2000.

It is also rich in organic carbon and is therefore an oil shale.Macauley, G. 1984. Cretaceous oil shale potential in Saskatchewan. In: J.A. Lorsong and M.A. Wilson, eds., Oil and Gas in Saskatchewan, proceedings of a conference held in Regina, Saskatchewan, 11-12 October 1984; p. 255-269.  Lithology and thickness  The Favel Formation is subdivided into the upper Assiniboine Member and the lower Keld Member. Both consist primarily of olive- black, chalk-speckled, calcareous and carbonaceous shale, with lesser amounts of shaly and argillaceous limestone, minor beds of calcarenite, and numerous thin beds of bentonite. The Assiniboine Member is topped by a bed of shaly argillaceous limestone called the Marco Calcarenite. The Keld is more calcareous than the Assiniboine, and is topped by a bed of shaly argillaceous limestone called the Laurier Limestone. The Favel Formation reaches a maximum thickness of 46 m (151 ft) in southern Manitoba.  Deposition and paleontology  The Favel Formation was deposited along the eastern edge of the Western Interior Seaway. The water was anoxic at depth, which was conducive to the preservation of fossils and organic matter.Schr√∂der-Adams, C.J., Cumbaa, S.L., Bloch, J., Leckie, D.A., Craig, J., Seif el-Dein, S.A., Simons, D.-J.H.A.E. and Kenig, F. 2001.

Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, vol. 170, p. 261-289. Numerous fossils have been recovered from the Favel Formation. There are remains of coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera, aggregates of which make up the formation's distinctive the \\"chalk specks\\". Invertebrates include the bivalves Inoceramus, Mytilloides, and Ostrea, and ammonites such as Collignoniceras. There are bony fishes, including articulated specimens of Xiphactinus audax, as well as Apsopelix, Pachyrhizodus, and others. Cartilagenous fishes include sharks such as Odontaspis, Squalicorax, and Ptychodus, as well as rays.Cumbaa, S.L. and Tokaryk, T.S. 1999. Recent discoveries of Cretaceous marine vertebrates on the eastern margins of the Western Interior Seaway. In: Summary of Investigations 1999, Vol. 1, Saskatchewan Geological Survey, Sask. Energy Mines, Miscellaneous Report 99-4.1, p. 57-63. The largely complete skeleton of the marine crocodyliform Terminonaris robusta (first described as Teleorhinus robustus), was recovered from the Keld Member about 1 m (3 ft) below the Laurier Limestone bed, and has been nicknamed \\"Big Bert\\".  Distribution and relationship to other units  The Favel Formation is present in the subsurface beneath the plains of southern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan, and can be seen in outcrop in river valleys along the Manitoba Escarpment and the Pasquia Hills. Its contact with the noncalcareous shales of the Ashville Formation is conformable to unconformable, depending on the location, and the formation is unconformably overlain by the noncalcareous shales of the Morden Formation. To the west it is equivalent to the Second White Speckled Shale of the Colorado Group, and the Vimy Member of the Blackstone Formation.  Economic resources  The Favel Formation is an oil shale. It is rich in kerogen, with a total organic carbon content that ranges up to 10%. Fresh samples typically have a petroliferous odor. Because they were deposited under marine conditions, the Favel shales are classified as marinites, in contrast to the lamosite oil shales of the Green River Formation, which were deposited in a lacustrine environment. The formation may also have some potential for biogenic natural gas.Macauley, G. 1984. Cretaceous oil shale potential in Saskatchewan. In: J.A. Lorsong and M.A. Wilson, eds., Oil and Gas in Saskatchewan, proceedings of a conference held in Regina, Saskatchewan, 11-12 October 1984; p. 255-269.

Located near Pla√ßa Mercadal, its main facade faces Miracle Street, where the adjoining house separates it from the Church of Sant Joseph, which was a synagogue in the past. The back of the house, a part of the old city wall, faces the Segre river. Can Tarragona shares the city wall passage with the neighboring houses.  Description  In the last fifty years the house has undergone a careful restoration and decoration with furniture and pieces acquired from antiques or purchased from churches of the region in ruins, thus preventing their disappearance. The house retains its native structure and distribution. The basement, of Jewish origin as reflected in the water pipes, contains the \\"cellar\\", with two wells or reservoirs that were probably used for conservation of oil and other products, and the stable. There is also a passage, now walled up, which communicates with the Church of Sant Joseph. In one of the rooms in the basement there is also a massive stone table in one piece. The courtyard stands out at the back of the house, bounded by the thick stone walls of the building and the wall, and through which the visitor reaches a space, known as \\"lo Portalet\\", that overlooks the river. Accessing the house through the main entrance, the visitor finds himself in a large hall with stone slabs covering the ground and monastic stalls. A first flight of stairs leads to a spacious game room. Continuing the ascent, now through a covered patio, you get to the first floor, where the main rooms of the house are. The ceilings‚Äô original paintings as well as moldings and coffered ceilings have been recovered, thanks to the intervention of master craftsmen such as the carpenter Ton Camarasa and the painter √Ängel Soldevila. Mosaics and original wooden floors of the various rooms have also been preserved. Foremost among them, the main room, with a mirror by Murano, the dining room with its fireplace of solid wood, or the library, with over a thousand volumes, many of them bound in parchment, from the Franciscan convent of Sant Dom√®nec. The bedrooms are furnished in imperial and Venetian style. On the second floor, currently divided into two large open spaces, there is a terrace overlooking the river. It is a vantage point not only of the river Segre pass through the city, but also of the Montsec mountains that can be seen in the distance. Finally, the attic, located on the third floor and known in the region as \\"lo Perche‚Äù, with original wooden beams at sight and old floor tiles, offers the possibility of recreating an isolated and cozy past. Main entrance  History  The manor house has its origins in the expulsion of the Jews from the former town of Balaguer in 1333, and its relocation on the other side, which would later become Pla√ßa Mercadal. The town market has been held there every Saturday for more than 800 years. The building has undergone several renovations and expansions to reach its current state. It is noteworthy that the Renaissance fa√ßade was built in the eighteenth century, giving the interior of the house its current structure. In 1930, the Carmelite Sisters of Charity acquired the property to use it as a girls' school and convent, which they did until the late fifties. The books of the library, most of which are church books, lives of saints and sermons, come from the Franciscan convent of Sant Dom√®nec de Balaguer. The books were saved from being burned during the Civil War because someone bricked the entrance to the library and thus avoided its devastation.

Built in 1862, it is the only major mill complex in the Berwick region of York County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The mill is located between Canal Street and the Great Works River, just south of Wells Street (Maine State Route 9) in the village center of North Berwick. The associated mill pond is located just north of Wells Street. The mill complex is a somewhat typical 19th century New England mill complex, with a large rectangular main building, with a series of attached wings. The complex exhibits an eclectic mixture of architectural detailing, including elements of Greek Revival, Italianate, and Colonial Revival styling. One of the oldest steam engines in the U.S. is connected to this smokestack. An earlier wooden mill built on the site in 1832 was destroyed by fire, and the existing brick structure built in 1862. Primarily owned by Quakers, the mill, one of the first to automate the manufacture of blankets, produced uniforms and blankets for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. At its foundation level has been preserved one of the earliest steam engines in the United States, and the only one of its kind to survive. The mill closed in 1955 and remained mostly unused for nearly 40 years, when it served as the site of the Parrish Shoe Factory in the 1995 fantasy movie Jumanji. In 2009 the structure was renovated into a senior housing site by the Caleb Group, a nonprofit housing organization of New England. It was the first property to be awarded a tax credit under the Maine State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit Act of 2008.

Argentina sends a profound, pained tribute to all of the children that have been killed in the last few weeks. We vigorously condemn Israel, defying calls from the Security Council, the Secretary General and many other voices from the international community, for having decided to escalate the crisis launching a ground offensive. This decision will only create further instability in the region, more victims and more suffering. At the same time, we condemn the continued and indiscriminate launch of rockets from Gaza to Israeli cities.\\" Soon afterwards, Argentina's representative at the U.N.

Putting an immediate end to the violence is now absolutely paramount.\\" In this context, Kurz also referred to the meaning of the holy month of Ramadan, also regarded as the month of peace by Muslims.\\"My sympathy lies with the victims of this conflict; in particular the civilians. Everything possible has to be done to prevent more civilian victims. Even though Israel has a legitimate security interest, this must be exercised with a sense of proportion and in compliance with international humanitarian law. This also means that the Israeli missile offensive must be stopped.\\" \\"Peace is possible\\", Kurz concluded. On 16 July, in another press release, Kurz said, \\"The death toll is frighteningly high and the spiral of escalation is gaining momentum all the time\\",.

We urge Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza to immediately stop attacking Israeli territory in order to allow the implementation of the cease fire. The Czech Republic recognizes that the people of Israel as well as the people of Gaza have the right to live in peace and security. However, we are extremely concerned about the disastrous impact of the current situation on civilians, who are endangered the most by the conflict. While recognizing the right of Israel to take appropriate measure to protect its population, we strongly regret the Palestinian civilian casualties, in particular children, caused by the recent crisis.\\" * ‚Äì On 10 July, Djibouti \\"condemned the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip.\\" Djibouti held Israel responsible for a \\"dangerous escalation of violence\\" and called on the international community to end Israel's \\"blind and intolerable repression.\\" * ‚Äì On 12 July, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement that condemned Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people and demanded the end of attacks against the civilian population. \\"The Government of Ecuador strongly condemns the disproportionate military operations by the Israeli army against the civilian population of the Gaza Strip, which have left more than a hundred casualties,\\" the official statement said. * ‚Äì The Foreign Ministry published a statement where it expressed its \\"deep concern\\" about the situation and called for self-restraint as well as stopping the mutual violence.

Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry made remarks following a meeting with his Jordanian counterpart where he said it was important to address the crisis in a manner that protects the Palestinians and their interests. : On 11 July, the Foreign Ministry then criticised the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operation in Gaza as \\"oppressive policies of mass punishment. Egypt rejects the irresponsible Israeli escalation in the occupied Palestinian territory, which comes in the form of excessive and unnecessary use of military force leading to the death of innocent civilians.\\" It demanded Israel adopt self-restraint and keep in mind that as an \\"occupation force\\", it had a legal and moral duty to protect civilian lives. They urged world powers to intervene and stop the crisis and that its ceasefire efforts had been met with \\"obstinacy and stubbornness\\". The same day, Egypt informed authorities in Gaza that it had closed the Rafah Border Crossing after re-opening it the previous day to receive injured Palestinians for medical treatment. This comes after Egyptian forces seized 20 Grad rockets being smuggled from Gaza to Sinai after clashing with militants in Rafah, Egypt. However, shortly after the closure, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered the Egyptian military to transport 500 tons of food and medical supplies to the Gaza Strip.

The strained Israeli-Palestinian situation is very worrying and unfortunately, in recent days the situation has not improved, but rather escalated.\\" He added that the parties needed to find a peaceful solution. \\"We call on the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority to take all necessary measures to prevent a further escalation of the tense situation.\\" * ‚Äì President Francois Hollande issued a statement that read it \\"expressed France's solidarity [with Israel] in the face of rocket fire from Gaza\\" and told Netanyahu, \\"France strongly condemns these aggressions [by Hamas].\\" Hollande also said that it was up to Israel \\"to take all measures to protect its population in the face of threats\\" but reminded the Israeli premier \\"of the need to prevent an escalation of violence.\\" On 18 July, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius stated that \\"France is extremely concerned by the Israeli decision to launch a ground offensive in Gaza.\\" On 22 July, Fabius condemned the Gaza \\"massacres,\\" stating that \\"nothing justifies continued attacks and massacres which do nothing but only claim more victims and stoke tensions, hatred.\\" * ‚Äì On 16 July, the Gambian Foreign Ministry welcomed the truce brokered by Egypt and called on the parties to fully adhere to the truce. On 29 July, President Yahya Jammeh condemned the \\"extraordinary brutality\\" being shown by the Israelis in Gaza, and pointed out that even though \\"nobody is condemning them, Allah would condemn them\\". Speaking, during the traditional meeting with Muslim elders after the Eid al Fitr prayer at State House in Banjul, the Gambian leader spoke of \\"the bad things they are doing in Palestine, in the last ten days of Ramadan\\". He also lamented the fact that \\"nobody is saying a word. The white people are engaged in hypocrisy; their media is putting out lies\\". Citing the fact that the Israelis were bombing hospitals, Jammeh further declared: \\"This is excessive brutality that we condemn in the strongest terms possible\\". He also called attention to \\"the satanic Western media\\", which had been justifying Israel's actions \\"because Hamas were firing rockets\\". * ‚Äì On 10 July, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Hamas for causing intense armed clashes and expressed concern over the plight of civilians.

The Eureka Sound Formation is Tertiary in age.  History  During the early Tertiary period, marine beds began forming in the Eureka Sound Formation within an area that was previously thought to be almost exclusively non-marine. This discovery indicates that this region of the Arctic had been mild, temperate, and ice-free during the early to middle Eocene , despite being well above the Arctic Circle. As of May 2014, this discovery had been restricted to the easternmost regions of the Canadian Arctic on Ellesmere Island. Because the Eureka Sound Formation contains the largest accumulation of Arctic Paleogene deposits, studying its marine deposits is key in gaining a better understanding of the early Tertiary history of the Arctic Ocean.  Fossils  Some fossils discovered in the Eureka Sound Formation were Paleogene land vertebrates that include fish, turtles, and several types of mammals. Other types of fossils found were reptilian species and several types of birds. Fresh water molluscs were also found.  Sediments and Geology  On Southern Ellesmere Island, the Eureka Sound Formation is up to 480 meters thick and consists of a sequence of predominantly non-marine sandstones, mudstones, coal and minor siltstones. Sandstone petrography and heavy mineral analyses indicate that the Eureka Sound sediments were derived mainly from Precambrian granulite-grade metamorphic rocks of the Canadian Shield located to the southeast of the Formation. Another finding states that significant amounts of the rocks of the Eureka Sound Formation on Western Ellesmere Island are marine in origin.

It preserves fossils dating back to the Permian period. The formation rides along the southeastern edges of the Sverdrup Basin, as well as on Melville Island and Grinnell Peninsula Discovery The Assistance Formation was discovered in 1955 by Raymond Thorsteinsson, during Operation Franklin. Although the Trold Fiord Formation and Degerbols Formation were generally recognized as part of the Assistance Formation, Thorsteinsson clarified various terminology problems and cleared any naming discontinuities. Lithology Fine grained, green/gray sandstone and mudstone compose a large part of the formation. The lower portions and beds of the stone are generally recessive, with and occur in beds up to .6 meters in length and depth. Outside of sandstone and rust-colored rocks, the loose components of the fiord usually include limestone and a plethora of perpetually-eroding organic debris. In the upper half of the formation, oxidized, calcareous ironstone buildups remain abundant. On Melville Island and Grinnell Peninsula, the depth of the fiord is usually its lowest, averaging around 60 meters. The thickest parts of the fiord occur on Ellesmere Island.

It stars Richard Lumsden, Karl Theobald, Jeremy Swift and Ned Dennehy. It was produced by Benji Howell and is noted for its \\"innovative\\" release strategy.http://www.screendaily.com/home/blogs/downhill-travels- far/5073719.article?blocktitle=COMMENT-&-BLOGS&contentID;=40298 The film premiered at Zeffirellis, Ambleside, Cumbria. A restaurant and cinema complex in the heart of the English Lake District. Plot At his kitchen table, in front of his teenage son Luke (Rupert Simonian) and his hand-held camera, Gordon (Richard Lumsden) explains the mission ‚Äì to walk Alfred Wainwright‚Äôs epic Coast-to-Coast Walk ‚Äì starting at St Bees and finishing 192 miles on at Robin Hood's Bay. As he discusses the gruelling hike he is about to attempt, his wife jests that it‚Äôs, \\"just an excuse for a massive piss up!\\" After consulting his maps, Gordon rounds up the mismatched troop. A team which consists of best friend Keith (Karl Theobald), who hopes this trail of discovery can help him alleviate his burdened mind, and old school friends Steve (Jeremy Swift), a physically under-prepared school teacher, and Julian (Ned Dennehy), the troublesome and troubled wild-card. As the journey unfolds and the alcohol flows, we discover not only why this incompatible bunch have not caught up for decades, but also about the trials and tribulations of entering the mid-life ‚Äì whether it be money problems, hidden secrets, loss of identity, addiction or just general disillusionment. Julian's rebellious side continues to mock and thwart even the best of Gordon's meticulous plans, as they battle not only their personal crises and hangovers but also the seemingly unattainable journey and the struggle to sustain their frayed friendship. When the group crosses paths with two attractive, younger female travellers, who are attempting the same walk, another challenge is set and their friendship is seemingly pushed to the point of no return. During the journey, each character indulges in a cathartic release in an attempt to unburden themselves from their own demons. We come to realise, this journey is not only important for the original instigators, Keith and Gordon, but it bears a unique significance to each of the foursome. Cast *Richard Lumsden as Gordon *Karl Theobald as Keith *Jeremy Swift as Steve *Ned Dennehy as Julian Production The project first started as a seed idea the producer, Benji Howell, had been working on, based around the idea of \\"a road movie on foot\\". \\"I really wanted to make a film that was uncompromised by industry demands such as name actors for lead roles. It therefore had to be an idea that could be shot on a very low budget and at the same time not compromised by the size of that budget\\", says Howell. During this process, Howell was also making television commercials with the director, James Rouse.https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2014/jun/26/ad-break- cannes-lions-special The pair begun talking about the idea and both decided it would be a great feature project on which they could collaborate. Howell and Rouse put together a story outline and roughly sketched character breakdowns and then began the search for a writer. They settled on Torben Betts,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre- dance/features/torben-betts-alan-ayckbourns-darker-younger- brother-9590282.html a playwright who is particularly interested in character driven pieces. Betts, a former actor, also takes on a cameo role as The Helpful Walker. Rouse and Howell both financed the development then kick started the finance of the production budget. At the same time they approached Alex Melman, a DOP whom they had worked with extensively in commercials and asked him if he would like to shoot the film. He accepted, but also offered to come on board as a financier and executive producer. It was an interesting proposition for Melman, whose debut feature was The Libertine (2004 film) starring Johnny Depp. As the film is shot from the perspective of a rarely seen ‚ÄòLuke‚Äô it offered him the chance as cameraman to play a character. The rest of the finance for the film came together very swiftly. The editor Bill Smedley and his co directors at Work Post came on board as executive producers. As did Robert Campbell, whose production company, Outsider, housed the project. Two further executive producers, Tom Shutes and Elli Gharbi, completed the finance. The shoot took place in June 2012 ‚Äì at that time the wettest June on record. At an early stage, they had decided to shoot in sequence and keep as close to the Coast-to-Coast Walk route as was possible, travelling west to east across the country, so the extreme weather conditions created havoc with the schedule. However, principal photography was completed three and a half weeks later. In September that year, they went back to re- shoot some scenes that were needed due to the amount of rain-sodden rushes that they were dealing with in the edit as well as shooting a few additional scenes. Editing and postproduction took place throughout 2013 in conjunction with Rouse and Howell continuing their work in commercials. They utilised their working relationships with postproduction company MPC and sound house Factory to finish the film.

History In the Middle Ages the estate belonged to the bishops of Ribe. In 1544, it was sold to the nobleman Gunde Lange. His son Hans Lange constructed a new main building later in the century. The main building has been extensively renovated and remodeled several times, so there are only a few remains of the original building. Architecture The main building was erected around 1580 by in Renaissance-style red bricks and consisted of four built-in wings, with a tower with spiral staircase in the south-west corner of the courtyard. The original house was a four-winged complex but only the east and north wings have survived. The east wing, which contains the gate, is decorated with a ceramic frieze and pilasters. Similar decorations have been found on the courtyard side of the north wig. This kind of terracotta decoration is common in northern Germany but unseen elsewhere in Denmark. The land was sold off in lots in 1926. A new west wing was built in 1942 and followed by construction of the south wing between 1956-1959. The west wing from 1942 and the south wing from 1958 were both designed by architect Helge Holm. The building were converted for use as a school. The building now houses Brejninggaard Efterskole.

The aim is to study the processes of galaxy formation and evolution in the universe with a comprehensive physical model. Early results are described in a number of publications following widespread press coverage. The project publicly released all data produced by the simulations in April, 2015. A followup to the project, IllustrisTNG, was presented in 2017. Illustris Simulation =Overview= The original Illustris project was carried out by Mark Vogelsberger and collaborators as the first large-scale galaxy formation application of Volker Springel's novel Arepo code. The Illustris project includes large-scale cosmological simulations of the evolution of the universe, spanning initial conditions of the Big Bang, to the present day, 13.8 billion years later. Modeling, based on the most precise data and calculations currently available, are compared to actual findings of the observable universe in order to better understand the nature of the universe, including galaxy formation, dark matter and dark energy. The simulation includes many physical processes which are thought to be critical for galaxy formation. These include the formation of stars and the subsequent \\"feedback\\" due to supernova explosions, as well as the formation of super-massive black holes, their consumption of nearby gas, and their multiple modes of energetic feedback. Images, videos, and other data visualizations for public distribution are available at official media page. =Computational aspects= The main Illustris simulation was run on the Curie supercomputer at CEA (France) and the SuperMUC supercomputer at the Leibniz Computing Center (Germany). A total of 19 million CPU hours was required, using 8,192 CPU cores. The peak memory usage was approximately 25 TB of RAM. A total of 136 snapshots were saved over the course of the simulation, totaling over 230 TB cumulative data volume. A code called \\"Arepo\\" was used to run the Illustris simulations. It was written by Volker Springel, the same author as the GADGET code. The name is derived from the Sator Square. This code solves the coupled equations of gravity and hydrodynamics using a discretization of space based on a moving Voronoi tessellation. It is optimized for running on large, distributed memory supercomputers using a MPI approach. =Public data release= In April, 2015 (eleven months after the first papers were published) the project team publicly released all data products from all simulations. All original data files can be directly downloaded through the data release webpage. This includes group catalogs of individual halos and subhalos, merger trees tracking these objects through time, full snapshot particle data at 135 distinct time points, and various supplementary data catalogs. In addition to direct data download, a web-based API allows for many common search and data extraction tasks to be completed without needing access to the full data sets. =German postage stamp= In December 2018, the Illustris simulation was recognized by Deutsche Post through a special series stamp. IllustrisTNG =Overview= The IllustrisTNG project, \\"the next generation\\" follow up to the original Illustris simulation, was first presented in July, 2017. The project was achieved by a team of scientists from Germany and the U.S. led by Prof. Volker Springel. First, a new physical model was developed, which among other features now includes Magnetohydrodynamics. Three simulations are planned, which are different volumes at different resolutions. The intermediate simulation (TNG100) is equivalent to the original Illustris simulation. Unlike Illustris, it was run on the Hazel Hen machine at the High Performance Computing Center, Stuttgart in Germany. Up to 25,000 computer cores were employed. =Public data release= In December 2018 the simulation data from IllustrisTNG was released publicly. The data service includes a JupyterLab interface.

This television film was entirely shot in Sydney, Australia. It was broadcast on ABC on April 24, 2000. Plot The film is a biography of the Three Stooges following their careers and rise to fame as shown through the eyes of their leader, Moe Howard. This movie breaks away from the traditionally humorous Three Stooges format and has more of a serious undertone throughout. The film opens in 1959 with an aging Moe Howard running errands for his former agent Harry Romm on the studio lot at Columbia Pictures. A young television executive from Boston has traveled to L.A. to convince Moe and the Stooges to come back East and perform their act live in theatres and on television, but Moe is not interested. The film then flashes back to 1925, when comedian Ted Healy hires the Howard brothers for his vaudeville act. Healy offers to add Larry Fine to the act if he drops the fiddle playing from his routine. Healy pockets most of the money, which doesn't sit well with the others. The three men decide on a trademark of each having distinct hairstyles: Moe with a bowl cut, Larry with curly frizzy hair and Curly Howard (real name Jerome, also called ‚ÄúBabe‚Äù by his brothers) with a crew cut. (Shemp Howard would part his hair right down the middle.) 20th Century Fox produces \\"Soup to Nuts\\" with Healy and the Three Stooges, along with Shemp Howard and then offers Moe a seven year contract - without Ted. Healy interferes with the deal until Harry Cohn signs The Three Stooges to Columbia in 1934. Cohn sends the act to the short films department. Moe and Larry want to do feature films, but Cohn believes that a farce comedy team should only do shorts. The group completes 190 two-reel shorts from 1934 to 1957, released until 1959. Comical sound effects are added to accent physical acts such as a slap in the face, a punch in the stomach, a pull on the nose and a hammer to the head. Curly becomes famous for his high voice and other vocal sound riffs. The movie recreates many famous iconic Stooges scenes. The biography also shows the personal dynamics of the comedy team. The wives of the players also have a role throughout the film. Moe assumes the role of leader, but to the point that Babe feels bullied. Babe says he has no problem with Moe picking on ‚ÄúCurly‚Äù for the act, but off stage they are still a family. Meanwhile, Larry frequently loses money as a result of his gambling. Ted Healy, having parted with the team earlier in a bitter way, reappears later to shake hands with the group and announce that he is going to be a father. He dies later that night after a fight in his hotel at the young age of 41. Babe is injured and humiliated in a hotel lobby when some young adult fans recognize him as Curly and deliver a real poke to his eyes and a punch to his face. In 1946, Babe has a debilitating stroke while filming a scene. He is replaced by Shemp in the two-reel shorts until their respective deaths in 1952 and 1955. Curly's vacant role is taken over by Joe Besser for 1956 and 1957. Joe DeRita joins the troupe as ‚ÄúCurly Joe‚Äù in 1958. That same year, Moe & Larry report to work on the studio lot but are denied entry after learning that Harry Cohn has died of a heart attack and the short film department has been shut down. Returning to 1959, the group discusses the proposal for the live theater show in Boston and eventually agree. To their surprise, they find new success with younger viewers through television and become one of the highest paid comedy acts in the country.

(1940) *Half-Wits Holiday (1947) *Fright Night (1947) *Pies and Guys (1958) Reception Steven Oxman of Variety wrote in a review that in the film who the Three Stooges were and why they were funny was lost in its exposition. He explained that \\"[sic] the film does cover a lot for a two-hour telepic. But it also chooses information over insight, exegesis over drama, never making a case along the way for what made the Stooges such a lasting phenomenon. The final dish in this crowded kitchen has lots of quality ingredients, but almost no flavor.\\" References External links * Category:2000 films Category:2000 television films Category:2000 comedy films Category:American biographical films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:Biographical films about actors Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by James Frawley Category:Cultural depictions of The Three Stooges Category:Interscope Communications films Category:Icon Productions films Category:Films set in Los Angeles ","title":"The Three Stooges (2000 film)"},{"id":"43316657","text":"The Sheepbed Formation is a geologic formation in Northwest Territories.

The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The National Science Board conducted a survey that found that an average of 42 percent of a federal research grant recipient's time is spent on administrative tasks. Provisions of the bill According to a description from Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), the bill \\"establishes a working group to review federal regulations affecting research universities in order to eliminate redundant and duplicative federal regulation.\\" Procedural history The Research and Development Efficiency Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 10, 2014 by Rep. Larry Bucshon (R, IN-8). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. On July 14, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion The Association of American Universities (AAU) supported the bill, arguing that the legislation \\"can lead to a long-needed reduction in the regulatory burden currently imposed on universities and their faculty members who conduct research on behalf of the federal government.\\" According to the AAU, \\"too often federal requirements\\" for accounting for federal grant money \\"are ill-conceived, ineffective, and/or duplicative.\\" This wastes the researchers' times and \\"reduces the time they can devote to discovery and innovation and increases institutional compliance costs.\\" Rep. Lamar Smith supported the bill, saying that it was \\"an important step to ensure federal research dollars are being spent on research and not on regulatory requirements.\\" Rep. Bucshon, who introduced the bill, said that his goal is \\"to alleviate some of the burden placed on our research universities so they can get back to their main goal of conducting basic science research.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Funding of science *Science policy of the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 5056 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 5056 *GovTrack.us H.R. 5056 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 5056 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 5056 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Science and technology in the United States ","title":"Research and Development Efficiency Act"},{"id":"43316763","text":"The Bug Creek Group is a geologic group in Northwest Territories.

Eichenbaum (October 16, 1947 - July 21, 2017) was an American psychologist and neuroscientist who studied the hippocampus. He was a university professor and director of the Center for Memory and Brain at Boston University, having previously worked at Wellesley College. He was the editor- in-chief of the scientific journal Hippocampus. Research on the role of hippocampus in memory function Eichenbaum has performed extensive research on the role of the hippocampus in memory function, presenting a theory of the role of the hippocampus in forming relational memories. This work was important for emphasizing the behavioral role of the hippocampus beyond forming spatial representations of the environment. Eichenbaum and his collaborators performed early studies emphasizing the non-spatial responses of hippocampal neurons, showing spiking responses selective to individual odors and reward delivery during performance of behavioral tasks. Research on context-selective neuronal responses Research by Eichenbaum also demonstrated the strong context-dependence of neuronal responses in the hippocampus. One study from his lab at Boston University presented data from rats performing a spatial alternation task with return arms. As the rat ran up the stem of the task on different trials, the spiking response of hippocampal neurons depended on the prior or future response of the rat, showing differential firing even though the location and movement direction of the rat was the same. This illustrated the strong memory dependence of hippocampal neuronal responses independent of the spatial location and movement of the rat. This experiment and other data from his laboratory show how different events in the same location could be coded as different episodes. Research on time cells Research by Eichenbaum and others has demonstrated that individual neurons in the hippocampus and other regions show spiking activity at specific time intervals during behavioral tasks. Eichenbaum described these neurons as \\"time cells\\". The loss of time cells in the hippocampus may contribute to the loss of episodic memory function described in patient HM. Time cells may contribute to the role of the hippocampus in allowing what Tulving termed mental time travel in the recall of past episodic memories. Time cells may code individual time intervals necessary to disambiguate different temporal episodes within an episodic memory.

He was the National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM), a Nigerian political party. The PDM, which initially started out as a movement formed in the wake of Nigerians' agitation for a democratic governance, was denied registration as an official political party by the Abacha regime. Upon the country's return to democracy, the movement, hence, formed a major building block of what would become Nigeria's ruling party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). After years of running the country's affairs and a seeming disconnect between what had been envisioned and what had, in fact, been achieved by the PDP, some members of the PDM decided to leave the PDP and register the movement as a party, so that it could abide by the ideals which guided its formation. The PDM was, thus, registered in 2013, with Bashir as the chairman. Mentored by the late Aminu Kano, Bashir has had a public service career spanning several decades, serving in various capacities including that of Special Adviser to both President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice-President Atiku Abubakar at varying stages of their tenures, and on several committees including the Justice Niki Tobi Committee on the 1999 Constitution, among others. He is a fellow of the Nigerian Leadership Initiative and the Aspen Institute.  Early life and family background  Bashir Yusuf Ibrahim was born on January 23, 1961, to Alhaji Yusuf Ibrahim and Hajjiya Khadija Usman. Both parents came from renowned Islamic clerical families. His maternal uncle, Sheikh Tijjani Usman, with whom Bashir was quite close as a child, was one of the best known scholars in West Africa until his death in a road accident in 1970. Initially the third of six children, Bashir became the first son of the family after he lost his elder brothers to a measles epidemic which hit the city of Kano in the early 1960s. By the time his father died in July 1982, he was one of the fourteen children his father left behind. Bashir was brought up in a typical African Muslim home in a polygamous family with his mother being the first of four wives. His father, Alhaji Yusuf Ibrahim, was an itinerant businessman who travelled through Africa, dealing in ivory and precious metals and ran a transport business in former Zaire, now Democratic Republic of the Congo. Alhaji Yusuf Ibrahim was also a polyglot, learning to speak several African languages during his many extended business trips, and one of the African foreigners and businessmen deported from the Congo in 1972 during the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko.Vance, Kinshasa to Secretary of State, Washington D.C., 6 April 1972; RG 59, Political & Defence, Box 2842, Department of State, NARAII Despite his long periods of absence, often spending several months away from their Kano home, Bashir's father, himself being the eldest male in the extended family, ensured that his children had a sheltered upbringing under the watchful eyes of several uncles. Bashir's father was a strict disciplinarian who was especially concerned about the company that his children kept, and due to his father's strict nature, Bashir had few friends growing up. Bashir looked up to Mallam Aminu Kano of NEPU and PRP fame, and due to his closeness to one of Aminu Kano's nephews who was his classmate. He visited the Aminu Kano home often, interacting with his mentor and role model and gaining insight into the politics of the day. Aminu Kano was revered for his role in challenging the structure of power in Northern Nigeria as well as traditional norms and traditions and for promoting the education of women and girls in a bid to establish a progressive society for all.M. G. Smith; Government in Kano, 1350-1950, Westview Press, 1997. p 492-493.  Education  Bashir was introduced to schooling and education at quite an early stage; in accordance with the prevalent Northern Muslim tradition, he began attending an Islamiyyah (Islamic school) at the age of 3. Three years later, at the age of six, he was enrolled in Mayanka (now Jakara) Primary School, Kano, while also attending three different Islamiyyah schools ‚Äì one in the morning before conventional school hours, the other in the evening after he returned from primary school, and yet another after night prayers. His first ever school was founded by the late Mallam Aminu Kano with whom Bashir shared immediate neighbourhood. After primary school, Bashir was admitted to School for Arabic Studies in 1973 where he obtained the Teachers Grade II Certificate in 1977 and quickly obtained a General Certificate of Education from the School of Preliminary Studies, Kano in 1978. He was an Interim Joint Matriculation Board, IJMBHistory of IJMB student at the same School of Preliminary Studies from 1979 to 1981 where he was secretary-general and president of the students' union. In 1981, he took a course in Journalism at Graduate School, USDA in Washington DC and New York Institute of Technology, after which he sat for the Interim Joint Matriculation Board Exam in 1982. His next academic endeavour was as a student at the prestigious Bayero University, Kano, graduating in 1986 with a second class upper degree in History and Political Science. In 1991, he took a course in economic reporting at the United States Information Service in Lagos. In 2004, he obtained a master's degree in International Affairs and Diplomacy from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, and is also an alumnus of Wits Business School, the Harvard Kennedy School, and the Institute of Public Private Partnerships, Washington DC.  Early influences  The city of Kano is renowned for being very politically active and cosmopolitan and its people reputed for both political and business acumen. This holds true in Bashir's case, as not only did he become involved in politics at a rather young age, but also began his foray into business and profit-making at an even younger age. As a child Bashir never lost an opportunity to make an income, buying and selling items from and to youngsters his age. The older Bashir grew, the more he learnt ‚Äì especially at the feet of his mentor, Mallam Aminu Kano, who was revered and popular for his radical disposition - that leadership was about vision, courage and sacrifice and that for society to make progress leaders must envision a better future for their people and take them there regardless of the obstacles they face. Like many young people in Kano back then, politics gradually became an integral part of the young Bashir and it was, therefore, only natural for him to gravitate towards formal political engagement and seek to become part of the process. In 1978, at the age of 17, his foray into politics officially began when he became a member of the (now defunct) Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN). His preference for UPN, the late Obafemi Awolowo‚Äôs party, was due to the founder's touted socialist ideology. He, however, left for the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in 1979 after Aminu Kano left the National Movement and joined others to found his own party. In 1979, in reaction to Aminu Kano's disqualification from the presidential race by General Obasanjo's military regime on the grounds of non payment of tax,Bienen, H. (1985). Political Conflict and Economic Change in Nigeria. Routledge. Bashir and a childhood friend, Awwalu Anwar, organised a youth protest to challenge the disqualification. The protest, however, mutated into a citywide riot which lasted for several days. Later he was to become a Students Union activist and the first Deputy Senate President of National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS. In 1986, Bashir was detained at the interrogation centre run by NSO, Nigeria's secret police, on Awolowo Road in Lagos. He was later transferred to Shagamu prison in Ogun State between August and December 1986, where he spent most of his time in a hospital bed after he fell sick due to poor conditions and ill treatment. He was detained under Decree 2 by the military dictatorship of General Ibrahim Babangida for leading a nationwide one-million-signature campaign to force the military to release his former boss, governor Abubakar Rimi of Kano State, and other political prisoners, who were jailed by military tribunals, some of whom were serving long prison terms of three hundred years and even more. Twenty-five other leaders of the signature campaign were detained along with him, including three former members of the House of Representatives and the former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido.  Family life  Bashir married his first wife in 1986, a few months before graduation, after meeting her a year earlier in the university. She succumbed to cancer after several years of treatment. His second marriage lasted four years. He has been happily married to his current wife since 1999. Bashir has seven children, with ages ranging from 26 years to 7 months old. His eldest child is an information security specialist at one of Nigeria's largest financial institutions.  Public service and professional career  Bashir first took up formal employment in 1978, when he was employed as a senior information assistant at the Kano State Ministry of Information. In 1981, he joined the Kano State Television Corporation where he trained as news producer. In 1982, he was appointed Personal Assistant to the governor at the Research Unit of Kano State Government House. He served in this position for a year and returned to school after his boss, governor Abubakar Rimi lost his reelection. After graduation from university in 1986 he spent his national service year as Teaching Assistant on Public Policy and Foreign Policy where he handled final year students at the Department of Political Science in his alma mater, Bayero University, Kano. Upon completion of the mandatory one year national youth service, Bashir took up employment at the College of Arts and Science as a lecturer in Government. He held that job from 1987 to 1990, after which he became the Features Editor and subsequently Editor of The Nation on Sunday (now rested) in 1991. In January 1992, he was appointed the Director- General of the Jigawa State Government House and served in this capacity until early 1994. As Director-General, he was the Chief of Staff to the State Governor and the administrative head of the Government House. His principled stand against corruption, sound advice and impact on government policy in the young state earned him the governor's full confidence and a few uncomplimentary nicknames. It also strained some important relationships and earned him the ire of quite a number of close friends. By the time Bashir left Jigawa State Government House, the new state had become something of a model for other states created at the same time in 1991. Although the new military administrator had asked him to stay, Bashir politely declined and returned to Abuja where he established his own practice as public policy consultant at New Paradigm Consulting. One of his earliest projects was his preparation of the concept note for the First Lady's Family Support Programme and articulation of its education component. Later, he consulted for such highly regarded private and public entities such as Afri-Projects Consortium, Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund and Bureau of Public Enterprises, Nigeria's privatization agency under the management of Mallam Nasir El-Rufai where he was commissioned to advise on organization-wide remodeling and restructuring, rescaling of human resources and a new compensation structure for the new and energetic workforce. While his consulting practice thrived, Bashir doubled as Executive Director at Blueprints Consortium, a leading media and publishing company located in Abuja between 1998 and 2001. He held this position until 2001, when he was appointed Special Assistant to then President, Olusegun Obasanjo,ThisDay (22 September 2011). \\"Layer 3 Repositions, Appoints New Directors\\" on Conflict Resolution.

He is also the chairman of the Board of Directors of Layer3 Limited, a mobile network solutions company, and has a wide range of business interests in media, ISP's, Oil and Gas, and construction, among others. In 2010, Bashir served as consultant on Maritime Security in the Gulf of Guinea for the Michael Ansari Africa Centre of the Atlantic Council. The Atlantic Council is aWashington DC-based think-tank with a strong foreign policy bias and influence with the US State Department He has served on several committees including the Justice Niki Tobi Committee on the 1999 Constitution, as secretary of the presidential committee on the rehabilitation of the National Mosque, as chairman of the committee for restructuring the Abuja Investment Company, and as a member of the Federal Government committee on job creation under chairman Aliko Dangote. Bashir has been invited to speak on democracy, political parties and elections at home and abroad, including at Nigeria‚Äôs National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, United Nations Development Program, the Africa Studies Centre, University of Oxford, United Kingdom, etc.  Political career  Bashir first joined the UPN in 1978, after which he joined the PRP with his mentor, Aminu Kano, in 1979. He remained in the PRP until 1983 then became a member of the Nigeria Peoples Party (NPP) in 1983. In 1989, he joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and went on to coordinate the Ali Sa'ad Birnin Kudu governorship campaign in 1991. His candidate won and served as governor from January 1992 until the General Sani Abacha coup of November 1993.\\"Nigeria 17th Nov 1993: General Sani Abacha Takes Over Government\\".

Both ANC and PDM were denied registration as political parties by the General Sani Abacha regime. With hopes of a democratic system of government becoming more feasible, Bashir joined others to form the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 1998. He was also a member of the Olusegun Obasanjo presidential campaign team and contested for the Kano Central senatorial seat in 2002. He, however, lost out at the party primaries, which were marred with allegations of rigging.Kazaure, Musa Umar (28 November 2002) \\"Rimi Fumes over Kano PDP Primaries\\". Daily Trust, All Africa After failing to clinch the senatorial nomination, he was called upon to step in as the National Coordinator of the Dr. Alex Ekwueme Presidential Campaign due to the sudden departure of the substantive coordinator abroad for medical treatment. When the incumbent president, Obasanjo, won the party primaries, Bashir chose to assume a neutral position since he did not support the president's candidacy. Nonetheless, he was again appointed a member of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Campaign in which he played a rather passive role. After the elections had been won, he was appointed as a Special Assistant to Vice-President Atiku Abubakar on National Assembly and, later, on Political Matters, a job he kept until 2006 when he, again, resigned. Bashir went on to become the founding secretary of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), which was formed to fight President Obasanjo's third-term agenda. The MRD later closed ranks with the Movement for the Defense of Democracy (MDD) to form the Movement for the Restoration and Defense of Democracy (MRDD). Realizing that he could not be part of government while working in the opposition, Bashir turned in his resignation and left the PDP in 2006. MRDD, however, had a few leadership challenges and could not gain traction quickly. Some members, including Bashir, decided to move on to form a proper political party, and the Action Congress (AC) was born. Bashir also emerged as the founding secretary of the AC, running the secretariat with the support of other key members such as Wale Osun and Yinka Odumakin. He served in various capacities within the Action Congress, including interim national secretary, secretary of the constitution drafting committee, secretary of the manifesto drafting committee, secretary of the national launching committee, and of the committee on distribution and zoning of national offices. He also contested for the office of the substantive National Secretary of Action Congress but, instead of opening the office to contest, some leaders of the party decided to forgo internal democracyMayah, Mark (August 2012). \\"Instilling Internal Democracy in Nigeria's Political Parties\\".

Subsequently, Bashir was appointed the Director of Administration and Logistics of the Action Congress Presidential Campaign.

This announcement divided the ranks of the Action Congress, with those who wanted the government of national unity decamping to the ruling PDP and the few who wanted to maintain a vibrant opposition remaining in the AC. Bashir held on to the AC for a while longer, but upon realizing that key figures who had chosen to remain in the party were actually working with President Yar‚Äôadua as well in order to further their personal interests, he knew that the centre could no longer hold. He returned to the PDP in 2009. Earlier on, President Yar‚Äôadua, in a bid to win those who had left the PDP back had promised to make changes and right the many wrongs plaguing the party. He, however, died before he could implement these changes and the PDP went from bad to worse under his successor, with internal party democracy completely ignored.

Bashir decided to return to Nigeria's turbulent political terrain in a bid to help reverse his country's drift to perdition and anarchy. In this regard he, along with other political associates began the move to rebuild the defunct Peoples Democratic Movement and pull it out of the ruling PDP and create a strong alternative opposition with a view to dislodging the PDP from power in 2015 or beyond.(16 October 2013) \\"Why We Pulled Out of PDP - PDM\\".

The primary objective of the council is to ensure compliance with Political Parties Code of Conduct and to work with the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria. During his tenure as Chairman, he initiated the first ever IPAC Annual Conference bringing together representatives of political parties to discuss the state of Nigeria's democracy and how it could be improved. He held this position until 2016, when he was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Constitution and Electoral Reform under the leadership of former Senate President Ken Nnamani. The Committee was tasked to make broad consultations with Nigerians and develop proposals for the reform of Nigeria's electoral system and processes. Among the Committee's proposals was the introduction of independent candidature, out-of-country voting, electronic voting and new executive bills to support the proposals. Bashir was the Chairman of the sub- committee which reviewed existing electoral laws and proposed new ones.

It is located in the southern part of the Haardt mountains at the summit of its highest peak, the Kalmit (), and is thus the highest hut in the Palatinate Forest. From its terrace there is often a stunning view of the Upper Rhine Plain as far as the foothills of the southern Odenwald and northern Black Forest. Immediately next to the hut is the observation tower on the Kalmit, which is out of bounds to the public, and houses a radio relay station, a weather station and a visibility survey station.  History  A commemorative board below the Kalmithaus refers to a refuge hut built in 1882 by the Palatinate Conservation Club. The first hut managed by the Ludwigshafen branch of the Palatinate Forest Club was inaugurated in 1908. After the Second World War the Kalmit and its refuge hut were occupied by French troops. After lengthy negotiations the hut was handed back on 11 October 1953 and opened again in 1955. Following the receipt of a large sum of money from the War Damages Office, supplemented by donations, a brand new hut was opened in 1957. On 13 November 1981 the front part of the hut was completely destroyed by a gas explosion. After it was rebuilt the present Kalmithaus was inaugurated on 12 June 1983.  Access and walking  The Kalmithaus can only be reached on the forest tracks of the Kalmit; although there is hiker's car park known as the Kalmit on the Kalmith√∂henstra√üe (ca. 645 m) only about 250 metres northwest of the summit. One route to the top runs from Alsterweiler (; in the municipality of Maikammer) through the valley between the Wetterkreuzberg (400.7 m) and Breitenberg (545.2 m). Other routes include the one from Sankt Martin () through the Altbach and Wolsel valley, from Maikammer through the Klausental and from Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe () through the Kaltenbrunnen valley.

Later life and work After the war, Conrow returned to New York City, where he lived with his wife above Carnegie Hall and operated a successful portrait studio. During the summers, he resided in Hendersonville, North Carolina. In 1940, during an art exhibition in Asheville, North Carolina, Conrow met artist Paul Whitener. Conrow had never considered himself a teacher, but when Whitener petitioned the portraitist to instruct him, Conrow accepted the promising young artist as his student. The two worked together each summer for the next fourteen years.Perryman, Thomas, and Mildred Whitener Coe. Catawba Native Paul Whitener: A Retrospective: Exhibition Catalogue. Hickory, NC: Hickory Museum of Art, 1998. Print. During this time, Whitener expressed an interest in establishing an art museum in his hometown of Hickory, North Carolina. As Vice-President of the American Artists Professional League in New York, Conrow was greatly in favor of a museum that would promote American art in the south, and proved to be instrumental in the development of the eventual Hickory Museum of Art. Over the years, he would provide the museum with his knowledge of American art, New York connections, paintings from his private collection, and a large number of his own works. His portraits are characterized by an intimacy achieved through weeks of time spent with each of his subjects. Beyond physical appearance, he strove to portray character, and becoming acquainted with the subject was consistently part of Conrow‚Äôs painting process. He is also known for his unconventional use of bold color to enhance flesh tones. He is included in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Hickory Museum of Art.

It is the first international organisation to focus exclusively on renewable energy, addressing needs in both industrialised and developing countries. It was founded in 2009 and its statute entered into force on 8 July 2010. The agency is headquartered in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi. The Director-General of IRENA is Francesco La Camera, a national of Italy. IRENA is an official United Nations observer. History The first suggestions for an international renewable agency is based on the 1980 Brandt Report activities. NGOs and industry lobbying groups like Eurosolar,EUROSOLAR-Memorandum zur Einrichtung einer Internationalen Agentur f√ºr Erneuerbare Energien (IRENA), May 2001 the World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE) and the World Wind Energy Association have promoted IRENA since several decades. In 1990, the Austrian government of Franz Vranitzky suggested a reneweables agency to the UN. One of the drivers was Hermann Scheer, a German politician and lobbyist which was acting as president of EUROSOLAR and chair of WCRE.The long Road to IRENA- A chronology, by Hermann Scheer On 15 June, at their annual event, the WWEA gave their 2010 World Wind Energy Award to the Founding member States of IRENA. They stated: \\"The creation of IRENA can be seen as the most important decision ever taken on the global level in favour of renewable energy. The founding of IRENA sent out a very strong signal to the world community that renewable energy will have to play and will play a key role in the future energy supply all over the world. With the Award, WWEA would also like to indicate that WWEA is committed to work closely with IRENA and will continue to give its full support.\\" Since 1981, several meetings took place to discuss the formation of IRENA. The Preparatory Conference for founding IREA was held on 10 and 11 April 2008 with 54 countries participating. Here, government representatives discussed the objectives, activities, finances, and organizational structure of IRENA. Participants expressed a need to begin a swift transition to a more secure, sustainable renewable energy economy with the assistance of an international body. The Founding Conference of the International Renewable Energy Agency was held in Bonn, Germany, on 26 January 2009. 75 countries signed the Agency's statute. The statute entered into force on 8 July 2010, 30 days after the 25th country deposited its instrument of ratification. The Founding Conference established the Preparatory Commission for IRENA, which consists of all signatory states. During the first session of the Preparatory Commission in Bonn on 27 January 2009, the signatory countries adopted criteria and procedures for selecting IRENA's Interim Director-General and its interim headquarters. An Administrative Committee was created to assist the commission in preparing its second session. The Administrative Committee prepared draft proposals for an interim work programme and budget as well as for interim staff regulations and interim financial rules. Nominations for the Interim Director-General and the interim headquarters were submitted by 30 April 2009. The second session of the Preparatory Commission met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on 29‚Äì30 June 2009, to elect the Interim Director General and decide the location of IRENA's interim headquarters. It was decided, that the interim headquarters will be located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The UAE thus became the first developing country to host a major international organisation. In addition, an innovation and technology center will be located in Bonn, and an office dedicated to liaising with the United Nations and other international institutions will be located in Vienna. H√©l√®ne Pelosse was elected as the Interim Director-General. The second session of the Preparatory Commission also adopted an interim work programme and budget as well as for interim staff regulations and interim financial rules. The fourth session of the Preparatory Commission on 24‚Äì25 October 2010 in Abu Dhabi appointed Kenyan representative Adnan Amin, Deputy Interim Director-General, to perform functions of Interim Director-General after resignation of H√©l√®ne Pelosse. On 4 April 2011, Adnan Amin was sworn in as the first Director-General. The agency has staged a number of events bringing together member states for interaction on ways and means of furthering renewable energy, and conducted significant research and development into viable solutions for the future. On 8 September 2014, IRENA published a notable report on its works titled REthinking energy, which encouraged \\"speedier adoption of renewable energy technologies,\\" as \\"the most feasible route to reduce carbon emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change.\\" The study set out to gauge the global power sector and establish how technological advances, economic growth and climate change are transforming it. \\"A convergence of social, economic and environmental forces are transforming the global energy system as we know it. But if we continue on the path we are currently on and fuel our growing economies with outmoded ways of thinking and acting, we will not be able avoid the most serious impacts of climate change,\\" Director-General Amin said at a function to release the report. The Ninth Meeting of International Renewable Energy Agency Council was held on 10‚Äì11 June 2015 at Abu Dhabi. Aims IRENA aims to become the main driving force in promoting a transition towards the use of renewable energy on a global scale: > Acting as the global voice for renewable energies, IRENA will provide > practical advice and support for both industrialised and developing > countries, help them improve their regulatory frameworks and build capacity. > The agency will facilitate access to all relevant information including > reliable data on the potential of renewable energy, best practices, > effective financial mechanisms and state-of-the-art technological expertise. IRENA provides advice and support to governments on renewable energy policy, capacity building, and technology transfer. IRENA will also co-ordinate with existing renewable energy organizations, such as REN21. Member states The statute to gain IRENA membership requires that a state be a member of the United Nations and to regional intergovernmental economic-integration organizations. States that gain membership to IRENA must uphold the organizations statute to the best of its abilities. As of March 2019, 160 states and the European Union are members of IRENA, and a further 23 are in the process of accession. On January 9, 2019, Canada became IRENA's 160th member.  Institutional Structure  = The Assembly = This assembly is IRENA's main institutional governing body, which includes one delegate from each member state. The assembly meets once yearly to discuss all IRENA management including things such as budget, membership applications and yearly goals. The 9th Assembly took place in January 2019 with the 10th Assembly scheduled for the 11th and 12 January in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. = The Council = The IRENA council is composed of 21 elected officials from member states, who each serve for two-year terms and must answer to the assembly. Council members rotate between states to ensure an efficient and fair representation of various member country sizes, geographic location, rates of development and particular concerns. The council deals directly with IRENA matters related to budgeting and annual reports. = The Secretariat = This is the executive branch of IRENA and consists of the Director-General and his staff. The secretariat acts as oversight to the council and assembly and offers technical support to these governing bodies. United Nations H√©l√®ne Pelosse, former Interim Director General of IRENA, met with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon during 2009 Climate week in New York City, and together with Mr Ban explored future fields of cooperation between IRENA and various UN bodies. IRENA also seeks to cooperate with the UN and associated organisations like the United Nations University, UNESCO, the World Bank, GEF, UNIDO, UNDP, UNEP, and WTO in the areas of education and training, financing, access to energy, potential studies and trade. Senior Management  = Director General = The current of Director-General of IRENA is Francesco La Camera, a national of Italy, who was appointed to the position during IRENA's Ninth Assembly and assumed office on 4 April 2019. IRENA's first Director-General was Adnan Z. Amin, a Kenyan national. He was elected to the post in April 2011 and completed a second term that ended 3 April 2019. During IRENA's Ninth Assembly, members of the Agency accorded Amin the honorary title of Director- General Emeritus. Before IRENA, Amin spent more than 25 years in the development of international environment and sustainable development policy, and worked in political, management, and inter-agency coordination areas of the United Nations. He was Head of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) Secretariat. Along with his work as Secretariat, Amin also served as the Director of the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) at their New York office and as Special Representative of the UNEP Executive Director where he played a crucial role in reviewing international governance and his organizations participation at the World Summit of Sustainable Development. During his time as Director General of IRENA, the organization was directly involved in the implementation of policies such as the Paris Agreement, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the G7 and G20. IRENA's membership also grew to include nearly all countries world-wide.

Extensive outcrops of the Cairn Formation near Canmore, Alberta are a popular field trip destination for those wishing to learn about Devonian reefs. They are also popular with rock climbers who enjoy the challenges presented by their extremely irregular surfaces.  Lithology  The Cairn Formation was originally deposited as limestones and mudstones in intertidal to subtidal reef environments, and was extensively dolomitized during later diagenesis. It now consists primarily of buff to dark grey, very fine to medium grained crystalline dolomite with good intercrystalline, biomoldic and vuggy porosity. Most of it is classified as floatstone, with stromatoporoids and other fossils supported in a dolomite matrix.Bloy, G.R., Leggett, S.R. and Hunter, I.G. 1989. The lower Fairholme reef complex (Cairn Formation), White Man Gap area, Canmore, Alberta. In: Reefs, Canada and adjacent areas. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Memoir 13, p. 399-402. The Cairn also includes minor amounts of undolomitized limestone and chert.  Paleontology  Bulbous stromatoporoids are particularly common in the Cairn Formation and were the main reef-building organism. There are also tabular stromatoporoids, Amphipora, horn corals, tabulate corals such as Thamnopora, brachiopods, crinoids, algae and foraminifera.Noble, J.P.A. 1970. Biofacies analysis, Cairn Formation of the Miette reef complex (Upper Devonian), Jasper National Park, Alberta. Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, vol. 14, no. 4, p. 493-543.

Thickness and distribution  The Cairn Formation typically ranges from to in thickness. It occurs in outcrop in the front and main ranges of the Canadian Rockies from Kakwa Lake in northeastern British Columbia to south of the Bow River in Alberta. It is also recognized in the subsurface in some areas.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997.

Relationship to other units  The Cairn Formation rests conformably on the Flume Formation, which is considered to be the lower member of the Cairn Formation in some areas, and it is overlain by the Peechee Member of the Southesk Formation. At reef margins the Cairn may interfinger with the Perdrix Formation which was deposited in deeper water, off-reef environments. The Cairn Formation is equivalent to, but not contiguous with, the lower Leduc Formation which lies farther to the east in central Alberta. It is also equivalent to the Cooking Lake Formation in central Alberta, and to the lower Duperow Formation and possibly the upper Souris River Formation in the Williston Basin.

Properties Vantablack grown on metal foil Vantablack is composed of a forest of vertical tubes \\"grown\\" on a substrate using a modified chemical vapor deposition process. When light strikes Vantablack, instead of bouncing off, it becomes trapped and is continually deflected amongst the tubes, eventually becoming absorbed and dissipating into heat. Vantablack was an improvement over similar substances developed at the time. Vantablack absorbs up to 99.965% of visible light and can be created at . NASA had previously developed a similar substance that was grown at , so it required materials to be more heat resistant than Vantablack. The outgassing and particle fallout levels of Vantablack are low, the high levels of which in similar substances in the past had limited their commercial utility. Vantablack also has greater resistance to mechanical vibration, and has greater thermal stability. Development Early development was carried out at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK; the term \\"Vanta\\" was coined some time later. Vertically aligned nanotube arrays are sold by several firms, including NanoLab, Santa Barbara Infrared and others. The Vantablack name is trademarked by Surrey NanoSystems Limited,Surrey NanoSystems: Home and has been referenced in three patents registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\\"Results of Search in US Patent Collection db for: Vantablack: 3 patents.\\". United States Patent and Trademark Office. Retrieved February 2, 2017. Applications Being one of the darkest materials (though, there are darker materials: for example, in 2019, MIT has developed a material which reflects a tenth of the amount of light that Vantablack reflects ), this substance has many potential applications, including preventing stray light from entering telescopes, and improving the performance of infrared cameras both on Earth and in space. Vantablack may also increase the absorption of heat in materials used in concentrated solar power technology, as well as military applications such as thermal camouflage. Its emissivity and scalability support a wide range of applications. In addition to directly growing aligned carbon nanotubes, Vantablack is made into two sprayable paints with randomly-oriented nanotubes, Vantablack S-VIS and Vantablack S-IR with better infrared absorption than the former. These paints require a special license, a temperature of 100‚Äì280 ¬∞C, and vacuum post-processing. Surrey NanoSystems also markets a line of non-nanotube sprayable paints known as Vantablack VBx that are even easier to apply. = Artistic and decorative use = BMW X6 Vantablack at Frankfurt Motor Show 2019 Vantablack S-VIS, a sprayable paint that uses randomly-aligned carbon nanotubes and only has high absorption in the visible light band, has been exclusively licensed to Anish Kapoor's studio for artistic use. Nanolab, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based carbon nanotube manufacturer, partnered with Boston artist Jason Chase to release a nanotube-based black paint called Singularity Black. During the first showing of the colour, Chase, alluding to Vantablack, stated that \\"its possibilities have been stunted by not being available to experiment with,\\" and Singularity Black's release was important to create access. The manufacturer claims that Vantablack is subject to export controls by the UK, and due to its physical requirements and thermal characteristics, the original Vantablack is not practical for use in many types of art. Vantablack VBx2, a variant of the non-nanotube Vantablack VBx that is optimized for large area spraying, was used in a \\"Vantablack pavilion\\" at the 2018 Winter Olympics. BMW unveiled an X6 concept with Vantablack paint at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2019; however, the company does not plan on producing the color on production models of the X6.

Its deposition spanned the time interval from latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to early Palaeocene, and it includes sediments that were deposited before, during, and after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event. It includes the economically important coal deposits of the Coalspur Coal Zone, as well as nonmarine plant and animal fossils. Lithology The sediments of the Coalspur Formation were eroded from the Canadian Cordillera, and were transported eastward by river systems and deposited in fluvial channel and floodplain environments. The formation consists primarily of sandstones and siltstones, interbedded with mudstones and minor amounts of bentonite. Thick coal seams are present locally in the upper portion of the formation, especially in the Alberta Coal Branch area southeast of Hinton, Alberta. Near the Athabasca River the base consists primarily of conglomerate and is known as the Entrance Conglomerate. Stratigraphy and age The Coalspur Formation is part of the Saunders group. The K-Pg boundary has been identified within the formation at the base of the lowermost coal seam (the Mynheer seam), based on changes in the fossil pollen assemblage and the presence of an iridium anomaly.Jerzykiewicz, T. and Sweet, A.R. 1986. The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, central Alberta foothills. In: Stratigraphy. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, vol. 23, p. 1356-1374. The boundary subdivides the Coalspur Formation into an upper member called the Coalspur coal zone which is of early Paleocene age, and an unnamed lower member of latest Cretaceous age.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada including eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD-ROM. . Thickness and distribution The Coalspur Formation is present in the Alberta foothills from south of the Wapiti River to the North Saskatchewan River. The formation is estimated to reach thicknesses of up to about , and the Coalspur coal zone is about to thick. Relationship to other units The Coalspur Formation rests abruptly on the Brazeau Formation and is overlain abruptly by the Paskapoo Formation. It is equivalent to the Scollard Formation of the west-central Alberta plains, the Willow Creek Formation in the southwestern plains, and part or all of the Ravenscrag Formation in Saskatchewan. The base of the Coalspur coal zone is equivalent to the base of the Ardley coal zone, which is also floored on the K-Pg boundary bed.Langenberg, C.W., Berhane, H., Sweet, A.R., Marchioni, D. and Heamann, L.M. 2007.

It features unique design of 132 coaxial injection elements causing swirl mixing of the MMH propellants with Nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. The pressure-fed engine allows for multiple re- ignitions.  Operations  Fuel and oxidizer are stored in two aluminium alloy tanks, fuel tank is spherical while oxidizer tank is enlarged due to different volumes required from engine operations. Before engine is started it is purged with helium and fuel is pressurized. Then oxidizer valve is opened in a center of injector followed by fuel injectors arranged on a chamber wall. Hypergolic propellants spontaneously ignite on contact expanding to supersonic velocities and escaping through cooled nozzle extension.  History  Aestus was developed by the Ottobrunn Space Propulsion Centre between 1988 and 1995 with first flight as an upper stage of Ariane 5 G flight 502 and performed as designed. The first improvements were developed between 1999 and 2002 improving the frame performance and adjusting propellant mixture ratio from 2.05 to 1.90 with a first flight on an Ariane 5 flight 518 on 26 February 2004. Ignition qualification programme preparing engine for handling new Automated Transfer Vehicle that requires 3 ignitions per flight was completed in 2007 and flew with Jules Verne ATV on Ariane 5 flight 528.  Aestus II / RS-72  Aestus II (also known as RS-72) was a turbopump-fed version of the pressure-fed Aestus developed in a collaboration between the Ottobrunn Space Propulsion Centre and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (Boeing Rocketdyne at the time). It was designed for improved performance, thrust and reliability over its predecessor. Aestus II development was supported by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne which provided turbopump for the engine. The first prototype variant, called RS-72 Pathfinder, successfully completed 14 tests at the White Sands Test Facility, reaching a 60 second burn time at 100% power in May 2000.

(2005). \\"Importance of discovery of the first cave beetle Leptodirus hochenwartii Schmidt, 1832.\\" . Endins 28 (2005). Biospeleology was formalized as a science in 1907 by Emil Racovi≈£ƒÉ with his seminal work Essai sur les probl√®mes biosp√©ologiques (\\"Essay on biospeleological problems\\"). = Subdivisions = Organisms Categories Cave organisms fall into three basic classes: =Troglobite= Troglobites are obligatory cavernicoles, specialized for cave life. Some can leave caves for short periods, and may complete parts of their life cycles above ground, but cannot live their entire lives outside of a cave environment. Examples include chemotrophic bacteria, some species of flatworms, springtails, and cavefish. =Troglophile= Troglophiles can live part or all of their lives in caves, but can also complete a life cycle in appropriate environments on the surface. Examples include cave crickets, bats, millipedes, pseudoscorpions and spiders. =Trogloxene= Trogloxenes frequent caves, and may require caves for a portion of its life cycle, but must return to the surface (or a parahypogean zone) for at least some portion of its life. Oilbirds and most Daddy longlegs are trogloxenes. Environmental Categories Cave environments fall into three general categories: =Endogean= Endogean environments are the parts of caves that are in communication with surface soils through cracks and rock seams, groundwater seepage, and root protrusion. =Parahypogean= Parahypogean environments are the threshold regions near cave mouths that extend to the last penetration of sunlight. =Hypogean= Hypogean or \\"true\\" cave environments. These can be in regular contact with the surface via wind and underground rivers, or the migration of animals, or can be almost entirely isolated. Deep hypogean environments can host autonomous ecologies whose primary source of energy is not sunlight, but chemical energy liberated from limestone and other minerals by chemoautotrophic bacteria.

The 17th Guards continued a record of distinguished service through the rest of the Great Patriotic War. It became the 123rd Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1957 and converted into the 129th Guards Machine-Gun Artillery Division in 1989. In 2001, it was converted to the 17th Guards Motor Rifle Division and became the 70th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in 2009. The brigade is currently based in Ussuriysk.  Formation  The 17th Guards was one of four Guards rifle divisions created in Kalinin Front on the same date (along with 20th, 21st and 22nd Guards) in recognition of their role in driving in the left flank of Army Group Center during the winter of 1941‚Äì42. When formed, its order of battle was as follows: * 45th Guards Rifle Regiment from 365th Rifle Regiment * 48th Guards Rifle Regiment from 421st Rifle Regiment * 52nd Guards Rifle Regiment from 634th Rifle Regiment * 26th Guards Artillery Regiment from 349th Artillery Regiment * 22nd Guards Antitank Battalion from 230th Antitank Battalion * 16th Guards Sapper Battalion from 224th Sapper Battalion.Charles C.

Note that Sharp gives \\"249th\\" as the number of the artillery regiment from the 119th Rifle Div., but is given as \\"349th\\" in his other works. The division was part of 22nd Army when it was formed, and remained in Kalinin Front, in either that army or the 41st Army for the next year. In early 1943 it was transferred to 5th Guards Rifle Corps in 39th Army, and remained under those commands for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Guards, p 49 In late 1943 the division, along with the rest of 39th Army, was transferred to Western Front, and took part in the campaign to liberate Smolensk.

In Russian. Retrieved March 5, 2019. During Operation Bagration the 17th Guards, now under 3rd Belorussian Front, advanced into the southern Baltic States. At the time of the German surrender the division was in East Prussia, near K√∂nigsberg. In the following months the entire 39th Army was shipped east across Siberia, and in August 1945, participated in the invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria as part of Transbaikal Front. By this time its towed anti-tank battalion had been replaced with a battalion of SU-76 self-propelled guns, but the divisional artillery had not been augmented as per the December 1944, Guards Rifle Division table of organization. During this campaign the division received a second honorific, Khinganskaya, for its efforts in driving through the Khingan Range.

Postwar  Postwar, the division moved to Barabash, Primorsky Krai with the 39th Army from Port Arthur. The 39th Army disbanded in 1956 and the division became part of the 5th Army.

The company was founded on 1 April 1906. A major force in the European film industry before the First World War, the company took part in the Paris Film Congress in 1909, a failed attempt to create a cartel similar to the MPPC in the United States. In 1926 the company was taken over by Stefano Pittaluga who oversaw production until his death in 1932. Emilio Cecchi served as head of production for a year following Pittaluga's death. In 1930, at the time of the rebirth of Italian cinema, the old label had produced The Song of Love, the first sound film in Italy. The new Cines Studios were constructed in Rome and functioned as the country's most important film studios until they were destroyed in a fire in 1935. Under the leadership of Carlo Roncoroni it was involved in the state- backed project to build Cinecitta which opened in 1937. Following Roncoroni's death, the company was nationalised under the ENIC umbrella. It was relaunched in 1941 as part as the Fascist government's scheme to boost film production. It survived the fall of Mussolini and continued into the postwar era. In 1956 he received the Nastro d'Argento for Best Producer. However, in 1958, the Cines ceased operations and was liquidated by the Finance Ministry. In 2006, on the occasion of the centenary of the very first foundation, through the work of the editorial group Persians Publisher - New Media Entertainment has been given life to a new Cines, with an essentially private, who recovered the brand and the artistic legacy of the previous management.

A prominent figure in the Los Angeles art scene prior to World War II, his career was interrupted by the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans. Although he continued painting for decades after the war, Date's work remained largely ignored until he was rediscovered by a younger generation of artists and curators in the 1990s. Early life Date was born in Osaka, Japan, and his father left for California in search of work shortly thereafter. Date's mother and brothers later joined his father to help in the hardware store he had established in Fresno, and in 1923, a sixteen-year-old Date immigrated to California as well. After his father was forced to file for bankruptcy and close the hardware store in 1925,Patrick, Alisha. \\"Hideo Date (1907-2005) .\\" Retrieved 25 August 2014. the family moved to Los Angeles, where Date graduated from Polytechnic High School. In 1928, he enrolled at the Otis Art Institute, but he left the next year over an argument with the Institute's director, who had urged him to stop painting \\"in an Oriental manner.\\"Cheng, Scarlet. \\"A Painter Ready to Claim His Place\\" (28 October 2001) Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 25 August 2014. (His parting words: \\"If you don't like my painting, you can go to hell.\\")Higa, Karin. In Living Color: The Art of Hideo Date (Berkeley, California: Heyday Books, 2001). Date studied traditional Japanese painting at the Kawabata Gakko in Tokyo for two years, returning to Los Angeles in 1930. Over the next several years Date became active in the local arts community and began exhibiting his work, helping his two brothers at their flower shop during the day and attending art classes at night. He was a member of the Independents, a group of Los Angeles area artists who rejected the tenets of modernism, and worked closely with Synchromism co-founder Stanton Macdonald- Wright and others in the avant-garde movement. Date showed paintings in exhibitions of the Japanese Artists of Los Angeles, Young Painters at the College Art Association, Foundation of Western Art, the Los Angeles Oriental Artists Group, and the Los Angeles Art Association. He received a commission to paint a mural in Pickfair, the mansion home of Mary Pickford, and later Macdonald-Wright, then heading the Southern California Works Progress Administration's Federal Arts Project, arranged for Date to paint another at a school in the Japanese American community of Terminal Island. Date was at work on the second mural at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor and Executive Order 9066; it remained unfinished when he was sent to camp in 1942 and has since disappeared. World War II and later career During World War II, he was \\"evacuated\\" from the West Coast with other Japanese Americans, first to the Santa Anita Assembly Center in California and then to the Heart Mountain concentration camp in Wyoming. While at Heart Mountain, Date and fellow inmate Benji Okubo formed the Art Students League school and taught art classes in camp. At its peak the school had 250 students and teachers, who showcased their work in several exhibitions and created a mural at the camp. Date himself continued drawing and painting in camp, although he almost exclusively created pictures of cats. Date was released from Heart Mountain in 1945, to work on a mural in Buffalo, New York. He returned to Los Angeles briefly in 1947, to retrieve his pre-war artwork and hold a show at the Art Center School, but otherwise remained based in New York for the rest of his life. He married Yuriko Tamaki, and in 1955, after the Walter-McCarran Act struck down race-based restrictions on naturalization, he became a U.S. citizen. Although Date continued working, his career never fully recovered from the interruption caused by his wartime confinement. He participated in a few exhibitions in the 1950s, but did not show any work again until 1977. In the late 1990s, Date donated almost 200 works to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. Two other area museums showcased his work in 2000, and in 2001 the JANM retrospective, \\"In Living Color: The Art of Hideo Date,\\" opened to the public. The JANM exhibit's curator, Karin Higa, published an accompanying book on Date and his work under the same title. Date died at his home in Queens one day after his ninety-eighth birthday, in 2005.

History Rugumayo was born in Kyenjojo District, then known as Mwenge County, on 18 December 1934. Education He attended Mukole Primary School in Kyenjojo District from P1 to P4. He then attended Galihuma Primary School from P5 to P6. For S1 to S3, he attended Kabarole Junior Secondary School, and for S4 to S6, he attended Nyakasura School, in Fort Portal. He was admitted to Makerere University in the mid 1950s, but he quit when the university did not offer him the course he wanted; he was offered Agriculture, but he wanted Medicine. He was offered a scholarship to go and study in the United States of America, but was denied a passport by the British Colonial Administration. Instead, in 1958, they gave him a scholarship to study in the United Kingdom. He studied for the Diploma in Education at Chester College, then a constituent college of the University of Liverpool. He then studied at the University of London, where he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Botany and Ecology. Political career When Rugumayo returned to Uganda in 1966, he taught briefly at Kyambogo before joining Makerere University, as the warden of Mitchell Hall, one of the halls of residence. In 1971, Idi Amin successfully led a coup d'√©tat against the Obote I administration. Rugumayo was appointed Minister of Education, through connections with his friend Wanume Kibedi, a lawyer, with whom they had studied in London and who was an in-law to Idi Amin. Kibedi was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. In February 1973, one year and eight months on the job, Rugumayo resigned from Amin's cabinet; the first member of the cabinet to resign. He went into exile in Nairobi, Kenya, staying there until 1979, when Amin's regime was toppled. After the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) and the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) captured power in Kampala, with the assistance of the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF), Rugumayo was appointed chairman of the National Consultative Council (NCC), the parliament of the time. Rugumayo was instrumental in removing Yusuf Lule from power, when Lule disagreed with the NCC on procedural protocol when making cabinet appointments. Lule was replaced by Godfrey Binaisa. In May 1980, while Rugumayo was in Arusha, Tanzania, the Binaisa administration was also deposed in another coup d'√©tat. This time Rugumayo stayed in exile until 1992. That year, he returned to Uganda and joined the National Resistance Movement administration of Yoweri Museveni.

Life He was born in Sint- Jans-Molenbeek. At the age of eleven, he contracted meningitis, which left him deaf and nearly mute (although some sources say he was born deaf). This concentrated his attention on his sense of sight, and led to his decision to become a painter. He enrolled at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in 1887,Article in the Encylclop√©die Larousse where he studied with Jean-Fran√ßois Portaels and was a great admirer of the paintings of F√©licien Rops. The writings of Charles Baudelaire were also an influence, so Laermans joined the Decadent movement in 1890 and created illustrations for Baudelaire's book Les Fleurs du mal. By 1893, his work resembled that of Bruegel rather than the decadents, and he had settled on his signature theme, portrayals of downtrodden laborers and poor peasants which some critics saw as \\"disturbing caricatures\\". In 1894, he began to exhibit at the Salons of La Libre Esth√©tique. Two years later, he illustrated La Nouvelle Carthage, a novel by Georges Eekhoud, and was inspired by the book to create a triptych of paintings, \\"Landverhuisers\\" (Emigrants), that he considered his masterpiece. In 1922, he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium. Two years later, his eyesight began to fail as well and he stopped painting, declaring \\"I am no longer Laermans\\". In 1927, the year his mother died, King Albert made him a baron. He became totally blind, faded into reclusive obscurity and died thirteen years later, in Brussels and was buried in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. In Wemmel, there is a wall called the \\"Laermansmuur\\". Once, as a student, when he was home on vacation, Laersman saved a drowning man there and the wall was later named after him. It is a low, whitewashed wall of a style that appears in many of his paintings.  Honours  * 1919 : Commander of the Order of the Crown. Royal Decree of H.M.

Weinstra√üe, Maikammer, Edenkoben, Landau i. d. Pfalz. Eigenverlag des Landesvermessungsamtes, Koblenz, 1984 of the Kalmit (672.6 m) the highest mountain in the Haardt in the eastern Palatinate Forest of Germany. There is a blockfield, the H√ºttenberg Felsenmeer, along the crest.  Geography  = Location = The H√ºttenberg lies in the Palatinate Forest-North Vosges Biosphere Reserve and the Palatinate Forest Nature Park. Like the Breitenberg (545.2 m), the Taubenkopf (603.8 m), the Kanzel (531.7 m) and the Wetterkreuzberg (400.7 m), it is one of the subpeaks of the Kalmit (672.6 m), the Palatinate Forest's highest summit. It is covered by woodland and is about 950 metres as the crow flies southwest of the main summit, with which it is linked via a gently sloping saddle, and west-northwest of the top of the Breitenberg. Its northern part, including the summit, is in the parish of Maikammer, the southern part belongs to Sankt Martin.  H√ºttenberg Felsenmeer  H√ºttenberg Felsenmeer The H√ºttenberg Felsenmeer is a blockfield on the H√ºttenberg ridge and a feature of the geology of the Palatinate Forest. The sandstone blockfield is made up of boulders of the Middle Bunter, particularly the Karlstal Rock Zone, which were formed during the Triassic period. These range from boulders strewn over the surface of the mountainside to rock formations up to 10 metres high. The boulders were formed during the various ice ages, frost weathering of the hitherto solid layers of rock splitting it into a sea of boulders. These rocks are not only found on the summit ridge, which runs roughly from north to south and is around 700 metres long, but also on the mountainsides because, during the short periods of thawing in the summer months, the piles of rubble, soaked in meltwaters, are set in motion and slide downhill. The Felsenmeer is a popular bouldering area.  Transport and walking  The H√ºttenberg Hut The Landesstra√üe 514 (Totenkopfstra√üe), runs along the southern and western sides of the H√ºttenberg from Sankt Martin via the H√ºttenhohl (479 m) and over the Totenkopf saddle (513.7 m) to Breitenstein. The L 515 (Kalmith√∂henstra√üe) branches off northwest from this road below the summit of the H√ºttenberg near the H√ºttenhohl at 476.9 m heading over the Kalmit heights to Maikammer. The shortest route to the H√ºttenberg is from the car park near the Kalmit which is about a 15-minute walk. Other routes are from the Sankt Martin valley from the ramblers' car park by the managed refuge hut, Haus an den Fichten, through the Wolseltal valley or from the car park at the H√ºttenhohl. Two trails run over the summit ridge ‚Äì on directly over and through the H√ºttenberg Felsenmeer; the other running alongside the blockfield to the east and just below it. The start and end point is the saddle with the Kalmit and the refuge hut at the southern end of the ridge called the H√ºttenberg Hut (H√ºttenbergh√ºtte, 591.2 m), from where there is a view of the Sankt Martin valley. The Palatine Wine Route, opened in autumn 2010 and certified as a Pr√§dikatsweg in 2011 by the German Alpine and Rambling Club Association, also crosses the felsenmeer as part of the 4th stage and finally reaches the long descent to the wine-growing village of Sankt Martin.Pf√§lzer Weinsteig, at wanderkompass.de, retrieved 25 January 2014Pf√§lzer Weinsteig (Gesamtroute), at outdooractive.com, retrieved 25 January 2014  References   External links  * Category:Mountains under 1000 metres Category:Mountains and hills of the Palatinate Forest ","title":"H√ºttenberg (Haardt)"},{"id":"43317763","title":"Alisha Farrer"},{"id":"43317791","text":"Kobina Tahir Hammond (born June 16, 1960) is a lawyer and Ghanaian politician of the Republic of Ghana.

National assessment is conducted across the country in five subjects each for Grade - 4 & 8 on sample basis after every four years. This report is meant to reflect the health of the education system for better understanding of the stakeholders. The report also aims at pointing out the pluses and minuses of the education system and the facts about students‚Äô learning achievements along with recommendations on the findings for effective implementation. This practice is not peculiar to Pakistan, as the last decade has seen many ups and downs affecting national assessment at various subjects and grade ‚Äì levels. Briefly, initiative taken in primary and elementary education through the assessment system, named as National Education Assessment System (NEAS) in Pakistan is given for the audience in this report. NEAS has been institutionalized in Pakistan at national level with the cooperation of provincial and area Assessment Centers. Initially NEAS and its sister provincial and area education assessment organizations were established as five years development project with the financial assistance of the World Bank and Department for International Development (DfID) in year 2003. Realizing its significance in the education system, NEAS was made a regular feature of the education system before the closure of its project life. So far, NEAS has published four national level assessment reports on two grades each with four subjects. National Achievement Test (NAT) ‚Äì 2014 is a step ahead of previous studies as the subject of English is introduced for the first time and performance of the students is being analyzed on the proficiency benchmark. Recent Report NEAS conducted National Achievement Test in 2014 and the findings of the study were disseminated in a conference on September 3, 2015. These findings provide some food for thought for those who wish to make positive changes in Pakistani educational system. NAT-2014 Report is a milestone in the history of NEAS, since this study was conducted by NEAS with the help of provincial PEACe's and Area Centres under guidance from Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training Pakistan.

The play was produced by Hillard Elkins, directed by Edwin Sherin, and starred George S. Irving, Gene Rupert, Humbert Allen Estredo, Stephen D. Newman, Philip Sterling and Robert King. As yet \\"undiscovered\\" in the ensemble were future stars Maureen Anderman and Susan Sarandon. The play is a wry examination of the career and Presidency (up to that pre-Watergate point) of Richard M. Nixon (Irving). As it starts, two pundits, a William F. Buckley- like Pro (Rupert) and a Gore Vidal-like Con (Estredo) are debating the worthiness of Nixon. Unable to settle their differences objectively, they magically convene a tribunal of deceased, past Presidents ‚Äî Eisenhower (Sterling), Kennedy (King) and Washington (Newman) ‚Äî to review the Nixon career and pass judgment. The rules are strict: anything we observe in the central playing area, which is dedicated to historical recreation, is taken from actual public record; every word spoken by anyone is what that person actually said. This applies especially to Nixon, whose words, we are assured, remain in their original context. Only Pro, Con and the Tribunal speak freely in the immediate present. And of course, they have much to say. Previews began on April 18, and the play ran from April 30 to May 13, for a total of 14 previews and 16 regular performances.Playbill Vault entry The published version of the play, prepared prior to rehearsals, features only the tribunal of presidents, but not the characters of Pro and Con, who were added later.

Background and recording Super Critical was recorded in Ibiza and co-produced by former Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor. The duo rented a rural estate in the village of Santa Gertrudis, where they started writing and recording, before moving to Sonic Vista Studios with Taylor. The album was mixed at Avatar Studios in New York City. The album was influenced by Madonna, The Beatles, Diana Ross, Prince, Fleetwood Mac, Talking Heads, Nile Rodgers and Blondie. Critical reception Super Critical received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on five reviews, which indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Tim McNamara of The Australian called album \\"assured, confident and cohesive\\" and praised it as a \\"fantastic, upbeat and dance-inducing fare, signalling the resurgence of an act that has bet everything on doing their third album their way, and are set to reap the rewards.\\" Fred Thomas of AllMusic wrote, \\"Though not quite as boisterous and immediate as their debut and nowhere as stylistically restless as Sounds from Nowheresville, the songs here slowly sink in and last a lot longer than anything else the band has done prior\\", yet concluded that \\"the maturation on Super Critical takes them out of the 'overbearing pop flash in the pan' category and suggests they may have even more interesting statements ahead of them.\\" Ed Potton of The Times found Super Critical to be \\"breezier and more coherent [than Sounds from Nowheresville], sticking mainly to the kind of insouciant disco-funk-pop that [The Ting Tings] do so well.\\" Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu viewed the album as \\"a short and rather sweet effort that might not launch them to the top of the charts once again, but at least confirms us they're not yet ready to fade into obscurity\\", while commending The Ting Tings for \\"creating a consistent record that not only manages to mend the damage done by its faulty predecessor, but also create a coherent, fun atmosphere.\\" Virgin Media's Matthew Horton felt that \\"what Super Critical misses is one really great tune. The closest it comes is 'Green Poison's soulful grind, strangely reminiscent of Stock Aitken & Waterman's 'Roadblock', yet no cigar. Otherwise this is just frothy fun, which is fine‚Äîbut only fine.\\" Stephen Dalton of Uncut wrote, \\"With echoes of prime-time Chic, Prince and Madonna, the intent is admirable even if too many of the songs feel flimsy and pedestrian\\", but described the songs \\"Communication\\" and \\"Failure\\" as \\"unabashedly gorgeous blasts of sugardipped synth-funk hedonism.\\" Despite stating that the album \\"actually isn't all that bad, and certainly marks an improvement on its disastrous predecessor, Songs from Nowheresville\\", the Shields Gazette commented that \\"there's here nothing which leaves any lasting impression.\\" Dorian Lynskey of Q magazine noted that Super Critical \\"sounds less petulant but no more likely to return [the duo] to the Top 10\\", adding that it \\"would be a solid album for someone like Annie, For The Ting Tings, though, it suggests there's no way back from Nowheresville.\\" The Observers Killian Fox opined that the duo \\"can still write a catchy tune [...] but these songs are all surface, with only the odd hook to snag us.\\" Guy Oddy of The Arts Desk panned the album, dubbing it a \\"disappointment\\" and expressing that \\"it's not wholly clear whether the Ting Tings have become cultural commentators, like Negativland without samplers, and Super Critical is a prank about the vacuousness of so much chart pop, or whether they've committed commercial suicide.\\" Track listing Charts {| class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" |- !scope=\\"col\\"|Chart (2014) !scope=\\"col\\"|Peak position |- !scope=\\"row\\"|Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) |172 |- !scope=\\"row\\"|Japanese Albums Chart |100 |- !scope=\\"row\\"|UK Albums Chart |111 |- !scope=\\"row\\"|UK Indie Albums Chart |21 |} Release history {| class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" |- !scope=\\"col\\"| Region !scope=\\"col\\"| Date !scope=\\"col\\"| Format(s) !scope=\\"col\\"| Label !scope=\\"col\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| Australia |rowspan=\\"3\\"| 24 October 2014 |rowspan=\\"3\\"| | Liberator |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| Germany | |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| Ireland |rowspan=\\"3\\"| Finca |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| France |rowspan=\\"3\\"| 27 October 2014 | Digital download |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| United Kingdom | |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| United States | Digital download | |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| Japan | 29 October 2014 | | Sony |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| France | 3 November 2014 | CD | Finca |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| Germany | 21 November 2014 |rowspan=\\"3\\"| LP | |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| France |rowspan=\\"2\\"| 24 November 2014 |rowspan=\\"2\\"| Finca |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| United Kingdom |align=\\"center\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| United States | 13 January 2015 | CD | |align=\\"center\\"| |} References Category:2014 albums Category:The Ting Tings albums ","title":"Super Critical"},{"id":"43317866","text":"When the Evening Bells Ring () is a 1951 West German drama film directed by Alfred Braun and starring Willy Birgel, Maria Holst and Paul H√∂rbiger.Hake p. 226 It is unrelated to the 1930 silent film of the same title.

There is dispute over whether the peak was named for Charles A Vogelsang, an executive officer of California's State Fish and Game Commission from 1896‚Äì1901, or his brother Alexander Theodore Vogelsang, who served as president of the California State Board of Fish and Game from 1901-1910.

It was designed by architects Michael Goodwin and Kemper Goodwin, and built during 1969-1971.  Design & Construction  The first design Michael Goodwin proposed was a large concrete building, similar to Boston City Hall. The city council rejected his design. The next was a structure that terraced down the slope of Tempe Bute. The council also rejected this undersign. Goodwin came up with the idea of an inverted pyramid while in the shower. He saw how light shine across the shower door at 45-degree angles. In 1966 the Goodwin firm drew up the plans for the new municipal building. The building's inverted pyramidal shape helps in keeping the building cool in summer and warm in winter. The ground floor comprises only of reception space, while the second floor is and the third floor . The council chambers are in a semi-buried basement level. The building is flanked by free-standing fire stair towers. Ground was broken in 1969. The contractor selected was M. M. Sundt Construction Company of Phoenix. The building was completed in 1971 and inaugurated on October 2nd of that year.  Renovations  In July 2019 the first phase of a decade long renovation began. The first phase includes renovation of the plaza level council chambers which haven't been updated since the late 1980s. The council chamber renovation is expected to be completed in early 2020.
