(Zoom) is an American communications technology company headquartered in San Jose, California. It provides videotelephony and online chat services through a cloud-based peer-to-peer software platform and is used for teleconferencing, telecommuting, distance education, and social relations. Zoom's business strategy focuses on providing an easier to use product than competitors, as well as cost savings, which include minimizing computational costs at the infrastructure level and having a high degree of employee efficiency. Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive, founded Zoom in 2011, and launched its software in 2013. Zoom's aggressive revenue growth, and perceived ease-of-use and reliability of its software, resulted in a $1 billion valuation in 2017, making it a \\"unicorn\\" company. The company first became profitable in 2019, and completed an initial public offering that year. The company joined the NASDAQ-100 stock index on April 30, 2020. Beginning in early 2020, Zoom's software usage saw a significant global increase following the introduction of quarantine measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its software products have faced public and media scrutiny related to security and privacy issues. A portion of Zoom's workforce is based in China, which has given rise to surveillance and censorship concerns. History Zoom headquarters in San Jose, California =Early years= Zoom was founded by Eric Yuan, a former corporate vice president for Cisco Webex. He left Cisco in April 2011 with 40 engineers to start a new company, originally named Saasbee, Inc. The company had trouble finding investors because many people thought the videotelephony market was already saturated. In June 2011, the company raised $3 million of seed money from WebEx founder Subrah Iyar, former Cisco SVP and General Counsel Dan Scheinman, and venture capitalists Matt Ocko, TSVC, and Bill Tai. In May 2012, the company changed its name to Zoom, influenced by Thacher Hurd's children's book Zoom City. In September 2012, Zoom launched a beta version that could host conferences with up to 15 video participants. In November 2012, the company signed Stanford University as its first customer. The service was launched in January 2013 after the company raised a $6 million Series A round from Qualcomm Ventures, Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang, WebEx founder Subrah Iyar, and former Cisco SVP and General Counsel Dan Scheinman. Zoom launched version 1.0 of the program allowing the maximum number of participants per conference to be 25. By the end of its first month, Zoom had 400,000 users and by May 2013 it had 1 million users. =Growth= In July 2013, Zoom established partnerships with B2B collaboration software providers, such as Redbooth (then Teambox), and also created a program named Works with Zoom, which established partnerships with Logitech, Vaddio, and InFocus. In September 2013, the company raised $6.5 million in a Series B round from Horizon Ventures, and existing investors. At that time, it had 3 million users. By June 2014, Zoom had 10 million users. In April 2020, the app's CEO, Eric Yuan, announced Zoom's daily users have ballooned to more than 200 million. On February 4, 2015, the company received US$30 million in Series C funding from investors including Emergence Capital, Horizons Ventures (Li Ka-shing), Qualcomm Ventures, Jerry Yang, and Patrick Soon-Shiong. At that time, Zoom had 40 million users, with 65,000 organizations subscribed and a total of 1 billion meeting minutes since it was established. Over the course of 2015 and 2016, the company integrated its software with Slack, Salesforce, and Skype for Business. With version 2.5 in October 2015, Zoom increased the maximum number of participants allowed per conference to 50 and later to 1,000 for business customers. In November 2015, former president of RingCentral David Berman was named president of the company, and Peter Gassner, the founder and CEO of Veeva Systems, joined Zoom's board of directors. In January 2017, the company raised US$100 million in Series D funding from Sequoia Capital at a US$1 billion valuation, making it a so-called unicorn. In April 2017, Zoom launched a scalable telehealth product allowing doctors to host remote consultations with patients. In May, Zoom announced integration with Polycom's conferencing systems, enabling features such as multiple screen and device meetings, HD and wireless screen sharing, and calendar integration with Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and iCal. From September 25-27, 2017, Zoom hosted Zoomtopia 2017, its first annual user conference. At this conference, Zoom announced a partnership with Meta to integrate Zoom with augmented reality, integration with Slack and Workplace by Facebook, and first steps towards an artificial intelligence speech recognition program. =IPO and onward= On April 18, 2019, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. After pricing at US$36 per share, the share price increased over 72% on the first day of trading. The company was valued at US$16 billion by the end of its first day of trading. Prior to the IPO, Dropbox invested $5 million in Zoom. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Zoom saw a major increase in usage for remote work, distance education, and online social relations. Thousands of educational institutions switched to online classes using Zoom. The company offered its services for free to K‚Äì12 schools in many countries. By February 2020, Zoom had gained 2.22 million users in 2020 ‚Äî more users than it amassed in the entirety of 2019. On one day in March 2020, the Zoom app was downloaded 2.13 million times. Daily average users rose from about 10 million in December 2019 to more than 300 million daily meeting participants in April 2020. This led to an increase in the company's stock price in early 2020, despite a general stock market downturn. Zoom stock went from less than $70 per share in January 2020 to $150 per share by the end of March. By June 2020, the company was valued at over $67 billion. On May 7, 2020, Zoom announced that it had acquired Keybase, a company specializing in end-to-end encryption. In June 2020, the company hired its first chief diversity officer, Damien Hooper- Campbell. In July 2020, Zoom announced its first hardware as a service products, bundling its videoconferencing software with third-party hardware by DTEN, Neat, Poly, and Yealink, and running on the ServiceNow platform. It will begin with Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone offerings, with those services available to US customers, who can acquire hardware from Zoom for a fixed monthly cost. On July 15, 2020, the company announced Zoom for Home, a line of products for home use, designed for those working from home. The first product, with software by Zoom and hardware by DTEN, is called Zoom for Home - DTEN ME. It consists of a 27-inch screen with three wide-angle cameras and eight microphones, with Zoom software preloaded on the device. It is expected to be available in August 2020. By September 2020, Zoom's stock price had increased 569% over the course of the year, lifting its market cap to $129 billion. Criticism Zoom has been criticized for \\"security lapses and poor design choices\\" that have resulted in heightened scrutiny of its software. The company has also been criticized for its privacy and corporate data sharing policies. Security researchers and reporters have criticized the company for its lack of transparency and poor encryption practices. Zoom initially claimed to use \\"end-to-end encryption\\" in its marketing materials, but later clarified it meant \\"from Zoom end point to Zoom end point\\" (meaning effectively between Zoom servers and Zoom clients), which The Intercept described as misleading and \\"dishonest\\". In March 2020, New York State Attorney General Letitia James launched an inquiry into Zoom's privacy and security practices; the inquiry was closed on May 7, 2020, with Zoom not admitting wrongdoing, but agreeing to take added security measures. Also in May 2020, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was looking into Zoom's privacy practices. On April 1, 2020, Zoom announced a 90-day freeze on releasing new features, to focus on fixing privacy and security issues on Zoom. On July 1, 2020, Yuan wrote a blog post detailing efforts taken by the company to address security and privacy concerns, stating that they released 100 new safety features over the 90-day period. Those efforts include end-to-end encryption for all users, turning on meeting passwords by default, giving users the ability to choose which data centers calls are routed from, consulting with security experts, forming a CISO council, an improved bug bounty program, and working with third parties to help test security. Yuan also stated that Zoom would be releasing a transparency report later in 2020. In April 2020, Citizen Lab warned that having much of Zoom's research and development in China could \\"open up Zoom to pressure from Chinese authorities.\\" In June 2020, Zoom was criticized for closing multiple accounts of U.S. and Hong-Kong based groups, including that of Zhou Fengsuo and two other human rights activists, who were commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The accounts were later re-opened, with the company stating that in the future it \\"will have a new process for handling similar situations.\\" Zoom responded that it has to \\"comply with local laws,\\" even \\"the laws of governments opposed to free speech.\\" Zoom subsequently admitted to shutting down activist accounts at the request of the Chinese government. In response, a bi-partisan group of U.S. senators requested clarification of the incident from the company. Partially in response to criticisms of its blocking of the activists accounts as well as expressions of concern by the United States Justice Department, Zoom moved to cease direct sale of its product in mainland China in late August of 2020. In September 2020, Zoom, following lobbying by the Jewish coalition group \\"End Jewish Hatred\\", prevented San Francisco State University from using its video conferencing software to host former Palestinian militant and hijacker Leila Khaled, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). In justifying its decision, Zoom cited the PFLP's designation as a terrorist organization by the United States Government and its efforts comply with U.S. export control, sanctions, and anti-terrorism laws. Facebook and YouTube also joined Zoom in denying their platforms to the conference organizers. Professor Rabab Ibrahim Abdulhadi, one of the conference organizers, criticized Zoom for allegedly censoring Palestinian voices.  Workforce  In January 2020, Zoom had over 2,500 employees, with 1,396 in the United States and 1,136 in international locations. It is reported that 700 employees within a subsidiary work in China and develop Zoom software. In May 2020, Zoom announced plans to open new research and development centers in Pittsburgh and Phoenix, with plans to hire up to 500 engineers between the two cities over the next few years. In July 2020, Zoom announced the opening of a new technology center in Bangalore, India, to host engineering, IT, and business operations roles. In August 2020, Zoom opened a new data center in Singapore. The company ranked second place in Glassdoor's 2019 \\"Best Places to Work\\" survey. Part of Zoom's product development team is based in China, where an average entry-level tech salary is one-third of American salaries, which is a key driver of its profitability. Zoom's R&D; costs are 10 percent of its total revenue and less than half of the median percentage among its peers.

Musically, \\"If It Wasn't True\\" is an R&B;, pop, and dance song. Shamir has called the track \\"a breakup song, but not a typical one,\\" and Vogue magazine in 2014 dubbed it \\"Your New Favorite Breakup Song.\\" Composition and style Shamir has described \\"If It Wasn't True\\" as a \\"typical breakup song\\". The song was the first released by Shamir and introduced his countertenor voice to the music world. Shamir has said that he doesn't mind having his voice described as androgynous, but notes that \\"countertenor\\" is the correct term: \\"It's not feminine, it's not masculine. It's a happy medium ... I feel like if the world was more like that, our problems would be gone.\\" Jazz Monroe of Dazed magazine described \\"If It Wasn't True\\" as \\"semidissonant pulses tickled by antsy snares and hi-hats ‚Äì as Shamir's sinuous vocal vogues down memory lane.\\" Lizzie Plaugic of CMJ called Shamir's music \\"amazingly unclassifiable,\\" like a \\"souped-up Vegas Strip disco with a self-conscious pop bent,\\" and wrote that Shamir's voice \\"limbers and stretches like a wad of pink Silly Putty dipped in glitter.\\" Release \\"If It Wasn't True\\" was first released in early 2014 as part of a cassette compilation called \\"Common Interests Were Not Enough To Keep Us Together\\" from Godmode Music. The song proved to be a \\"highlight of the compilation,\\" and the track was released digitally in late February 2014. An official music video was released in March 2014, and in June 2014, Shamir's debut extended play (EP) Northtown was released with \\"If It Wasn't True\\" as the opening track. Music video The official music video for \\"If It Wasn't True\\" features distorted images of Shamir's hometown, Las Vegas, Nevada, interspersed with video footage of Shamir in a bathtub, playing with bubbles, and dancing and hanging with friends. The video was shot by Shamir with editor Anthony Sylvester adding fisheye and chop-up effects and \\"all sorts of weird filters.\\" Jazz Monroe of Dazed magazine wrote of the video: \\"It's a freeform assortment of twerking headstands, foam-beard fun and Las Vegas neon, all intercut with fabulous house party hijinks that echo '80s Manhattan loft culture.\\" Shamir's Twitter handle described himself as a \\"musician, comedian, singer, rapper, twerker, chef, writer, filmmaker, tumblr, skinny fat ass.\\" Critical reception In a review for Pitchfork, Mike Powell rated \\"If It Wasn't True\\" as a \\"Best New Track\\" and wrote: \\"Rarely do debuts sound so certain.\\" Powell described Shamir's voice on the track as \\"thin, pretty and androgynous, like \\"an alien presence in a track that at every step is earthy and rock-solid.\\" He also referred to the song as \\"[s]exy, dissonant, confident but a little amateurish\\" following a tradition of \\"high-rent body music made by people who probably take the bus to work.\\" In Vogue magazine, Thomas Gebremedhin reviewed the song, noting that \\"Bailey's delicate vocals glide effortlessly over the funky production that recalls '80s classics from Janet Jackson and Prince.\\" Tom Breihan of Stereogum called it \\"a truly great song\\" and a \\"disco-house anthem\\" sung with \\"rare levels of badass self-assurance.\\" \\"Recommended Listen\\" called Northtown \\"a watershed moment for both the artist and the label\\" and described \\"If It Wasn't True\\" as \\"one of the year's best dance singles.\\" In July 2014, Flavorwire named \\"If It Wasn't True\\" one of its \\"25 Best Songs of 2014 So Far\\".

Nelson wrote the song at the age of twelve. While working for KBOP in Pleasanton, Texas, in 1955, the song was one of the first two ever recorded by Nelson. After two of his demos with the song were rejected, Nelson cut the song during his first session as a recording artist for D Records in Fort Worth, Texas. The song was released as the B-side to \\"Man With the Blues\\". It was later covered by Billy Walker the same year.  Background  The \\"Storm Has Just Begun\\" was written by Nelson in his hometown of Abbott, Texas when he was twelve years old and played for the local polka band. In 1955, Nelson moved to Pleasanton, Texas, where he auditioned for a disc jockey job in KBOP. With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings. He recorded \\"The Storm Has Just Begun\\" along with \\"When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song\\". He recorded the tracks on a used reel-to-reel tape, over a farm market report that could be heard under the song. He sent the demos to Charlie Fitch, head of the local label SARG Records. Fitch rejected Nelson's recordings.Encouraged by his mother, Nelson then sent a demo containing the song to Grandpappy Smith, owner of the Melody Ranch dance hall in Eugene, Oregon. Smith, who also owned recording labels, booked Nelson to play in his hall in May 1955. After the date, Nelson did not receive a recording contract nor he was booked again on the venue. Recordings Years after, in 1958, Nelson recorded the song during his first session with D Records for a single release. Recorded at Manco Studio in Fort Worth, Texas the song backed the A-side \\"Man With the Blues\\". The single was credited to \\"Willie Nelson and the Reil Sisters\\". The single was released in 1959 Billy Walker cut the song as \\"The Storm Within My Heart\\", the flip side of his 1959 single \\"A Woman Like You\\". Billboard described the track on its July 1959 review as a \\"traditional approach on a weeper ballad [...] (an) attractive side\\". The song was recorded by Nelson again in 1976, included in his album The Longhorn Jamboree Presents: Willie Nelson & His Friends.

The elder Harrison was from 1805 head gardener at Wortley Hall, the seat of James Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, and then, from 1818, of James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe. Joseph took over the position in 1828 when his father moved to the estate of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, at Petworth House. Harrison married Ann Louise Weightman on 21 August 1818 at St. Peter's Church in Tankersley. In 1830, with Richard Gill Curtis, he filed a patent relating to the glazing of greenhouses.

In 1910, he attempted to blackmail The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).  Colorado  Florence was born in ≈Ωidikai, Lithuania / 56¬∞19' N 22¬∞01' E 171 mi NW of Vilnius,family genealogy to Jewish parents Hirsch and Anna Florens (Florence). One of six children, he and his brother were the first to leave for America, arriving sometime between 1884 and 1886. As an immigrant lacking knowledge of the English language and no family on the continent beyond his brother, he started his journey west. Around 1890 Florence arrived in Cripple Creek, CO to find his riches in the gold fields during the gold rush. Starting off in furniture repair to make some cash, he bought or became a partner in at least 6 gold mines including the King Solomon Mine. While in Cripple Creek he fell in love with Anna Freibourg, trading two gold mines he owned to her father for her hand. They married December 30, 1894 when she was just 2 months over 13. Poorly treated by her father for not going to her new husband, she sought protection from the police. With their help she ended up in a Humane Society home in Denver where she was put under the care of Matron Lavelle and filed for divorce. The court complaint set out that Anne will not be 14 until September 21 also that Florence and Anna‚Äôs father compelled her to marry even though he was almost a complete stranger to her. She asked the court to decree an absolute divorce, $1000.00 in Alimony and $500.00 for attorney fees. Although her father had pushed the marriage her mother had agreed that it was in the best interest of the girl when interviewed by police.  Wyoming  Farmington, Utah Around 1900 Florence moved to Cheyenne and became a bartender. There he met the actress Cecilia (Celia) Evans and they exchanged vows sometime in 1900. Cecilia had one daughter, Ruth, by a previous marriage. His activities are unknown from his marriage until the family moved to Utah.  Utah  Florence led a colorful life in Utah. He got involved in a range of economic opportunities including movies, restaurants, bootlegging, and farming. He was also active in the Jewish community and with the Knights of Pythias. Once in Utah, Florence began to diversify his business dealings. Apparently starting with the Lyric Bar, he worked his way up to ownership of almost all of Salt Lake City's motion picture houses and the Florence Film exchange by late 1910. It was during this time that he met Cecil B. DeMille and Thomas Edison. = Motion picture business = In Florence's quest to control all over the motion picture business in the Salt Lake area he became acquainted with Thomas Edison so all the films from Edison would go to his distribution company, The Florence Film Exchange, and not any possible competitors. Now even if he did not own the theatre he would make money off of them. Because of his prominence in the moving picture business DeMille approached him to provide capital for the studio he wanted to open up. Florence having just recently met him declined and DeMille moved on to Hollywood. On July 16, 1907 one of his theaters, The Theatorium, had a fire in the projection room (while ironically showing a film about the New York City Fire Department battling a burning building). The damage to the building was pegged at $50 and the loss of the film at $500. In 1908 his brother Aaron came to Salt Lake to join him in the movie business and make his permanent residence. It is not known how long he remained but he had returned to Canada after only a short time. On Sunday Dec 13, 1908. The Salt Lake Herald reported that Florence was to commence remodeling of the Mayer building into an electric theatre. He was also building the new Luna Theatre and upon completion would shut the Elite Theatre for upgrades. The articles goes on to report that Florence prevailed on his cousin Abraham L. Florence, a prominent business man in Ottawa, Ontario, to invest. Also, his brother Aaron had arrived the week before from Canada with interest in the two new theaters. The Shubert and Daniels put on performance by Max Florence‚Äôs Musical Co. In 1912 the Florence Film Exchange consolidated with the Progressive Film Exchange of Oregon which was headed by William Wadsworth Hodkinson former president of Paramount Pictures. A list of theaters that he owned include: The Luna, The Elite, The Theatorium, The Isis, The Shubert, The Daniels, The Lyceum, The Bungalow and more. In total he owned 54 theaters between Salt Lake City, Provo, and Ogden. = Blackmailing of the LDS Church = In 1910, Florence instigated the moment of his greatest notoriety: the blackmailing of the LDS Church and church president, Joseph F. Smith. It all began with an idea and the chance meeting of Gisbert Bossard, a disenfranchised Mormon convert and the financial distress that began to dog Florence. Florence persuaded Bossard to enter the church's Salt Lake Temple and clandestinely take a series of photographs. On September 16, 1911, the Salt Lake Tribune published a story relating that Florence had attempted to sell photographs of the interior of the temple. On September 19, 1911, the Duluth Herald related the same story and the details that Florence was an inn keeper and restaurant proprietor. What made the event so notorious is the fact that no one outside of church members are permitted to enter its temples. According to the church, Florence demanded that Smith pay him $100,000 to not release the photographs. In response, Florence said that he named no sum and he would rather burn the photographs then accept the paltry sum of $100,000. In response, Smith said, \\"I will not deal with a thief or a trafficker in stolen goods.\\" Florence was asked by a New York Times reporter if the pictures showed any marriage records that would confirm the solemnization of polygamous marriages by the LDS Church, but he stated that all such records had been locked in vaults or held off site. For a while, Florence would not divulge how he obtained the photographs but said, \\"I felt frisky today and I had a mind to write to that Mormon prophet that if he made me any madder I‚Äôd come back there and steal the angel Mormon off the main steeple. That‚Äôs how easy the Temple is for me.\\" Florence continued in his efforts to sell the photographs for a few weeks, including making them into a lecture, but eventually gave up and returned to Salt Lake City. = Legal troubles = Florence was arrested in January and February 1907 for serving alcohol on Sunday in violation of Utah‚Äôs Sunday blue laws. He was convicted on Feb 17, 1907, a stay of 5 days was granted for appeal. On the right side of the law in 1908 Florence chased a ‚Äúdip‚Äù for trying to steal his diamond stud. Florence chased him until the would-be thief James A. Getz was caught by one Patrolman Lyon, arrested and found to be a wanted man in multiple states according to the Salt Lake Tribune. July 1912 brought a lawsuit from Ruth Parry over a debt of $500. The case was filed against Florence and A. McCheney, his bankruptcy trustee. In 1913 Florence was in court on charges of false imprisonment. It was alleged that he and three associates; G.E. Peterson, Ike Thompson, and Dick Gunther falsely imprisoned a man named Joseph Davis. Florence was in the county attorney‚Äôs office filing a complaint about Davis robbing the Isis Theater. As Florence's associates were testifying in court for the false imprisonment Mr. Morgan, the county attorney, decided to file the false imprisonment charges against them while Florence was in his office. Come 1918 Florence was under investigation by the Bureau of Investigation for violations of the Reed Amendment. According to BOI files Florence was trying to reroute a liquor shipment from Kentucky to California, to Utah. Florence was also found to have stolen 175 cases of whiskey valued at $15,000 from the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. Florence received 3 months in prison but could have gotten less except the defense said he had a friend who would pay the fine instead of prison. This annoyed the judge who sentenced him to three months instead of one. In 1919 a shipment of liquor was being transported by Florence, the shipment was being sent from California to Salt Lake in violation of the Reed Amendment. Bureau of Investigation files reveal that Florence had 8 large trunks filled with liquor. A number of people had been interviewed with no knowledge of the contents of the trunk. Outcome of this case is currently unknown. Although it is apparently unrelated to the 1918 investigation and subsequent imprisonment at Leavenworth. In May 1919 in connection with the aforementioned investigation Florence was in U.S. District Court before Judge Tillman Davis Johnson. Florence and his associate Ray Grant Middaugh, a switchman, were sentenced to three years in United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth. They received 2 years for conspiracy and 1 year for receiving stolen goods. In addition to the conspiracy to rob an interstate shipment BOI files show an allegation of attempted bribery of US District Attorney William F. Ray. Florence was released with a $5000 bond pending outcome of his appeal. Florence would not end up at Leavenworth until December 13, 1920 after the exhaustion of his appeals. Florence began his sentence on December 16, 1920 to not exceed December 15, 1923. On April 21, 1921 he became a trustee and became eligible for parole on December 15, 1921. Florence was released on parole on March 21, 1922. While in prison he wrote his wife many letters and U.S. Representative Elmer O. Leatherwood. Florence wrote Leatherwood on a number of occasion requesting that he go to President Harding for a pardon or commutation of his sentence.United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth; Prisoner File: Max Florence Inmate #15718 = Prohibition and beyond = With Prohibition starting after the passage of the 18th Amendment Florence began to look at bootlegging. He began to manufacture his own liquor at his home in Farmington, UT and was known for making the highest quality booze in the state. Florence moved to Farmington, UT in 1920 to a large house surrounded by a cherry farm. His nephew Harry Florence joined him around 1924 to assist in the bootlegging and make some easy money. In June 1926 Florence's cherry farm in Farmington was raided by a prohibition officer over a complaint filed by the Mayor of Farmington, Gardiner. Florence's wife was also charged over the alleged quantity of liquor found at the home. Again in July 1928 Florence was arrested for possession of alcohol and in November he was found guilty of being a persistent violator. In September 1930 Florence was again raided by prohibition officers and had 3-¬Ω gallons of wine and 13-¬Ω pints of whiskey confiscated. It is unknown if charges had been pressed. In March 1932 the Utah Supreme Court ordered a new trial over a July 1928 possession of alcohol charge. The case had been initiated by the Salt Lake City court for a crime occurring in Davis County. Florence raised two children, his wife's daughter Ruth and her son Bernard. He died from general carcinomatosis (carcinosis), having suffered for 6 months. The contributory illness being advanced chronic myocarditis which he suffered for 4 years. He died on November 26, 1932 at 6am.

Biography Otto Dov Kulka was born as Otto Deutelbaum in 1933, in Nov√Ω Hrozenkov, Czechoslovakia, to Erich Sch√∂n and Elly Deutelbaumov√° (n√©e Kulkov√°). Elly was at the time married to Rudolf Deutelbaum, Erich's uncle, who had taken Erich as his trainee. In 1938, Rudolf and Elly divorced, and Erich sued to be recognized as Otto's legitimate father. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, in 1939, Erich Sch√∂n was arrested by the Gestapo and in 1942 transported from a concentration camp in Germany to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Rudolf Deutelbaum, along with his second wife Ilona and daughter Eva Deutelbaumov√° (Otto's half-sister), were deported in September 1942 to Theresienstadt Ghetto. In October 1942 they were deported to Treblinka extermination camp where they were murdered. Otto Kulka and his mother were deported in September 1942 to the Theresienstadt Ghetto, and from there, in September 1943, to the Theresienstadt family camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. His mother died in the Stutthof concentration camp in January 1945. After the war, he and his father returned to Czechoslovakia. To commemorate Erich's wife and Otto's mother they changed their family name to Kulka on the 23rd of April, 1946.Rodn√Ω list. V√Ωpis z matriky narozen√Ωch.

Since 1958 he has lived in Jerusalem. He is married to Chaia Kulka and is the father of a daughter, Eliora Kulka-Soroka. Kulka began his academic studies in 1958, at the Hebrew University, and in 1966 joined the faculty of its Department of the History of the Jewish People. He retired as professor emeritus in 1999 and since then has kept up his research activity and continued to publish scholarly and other works. The aesthetician Tom√°≈° Kulka is his brother. Academic activity Kulka studied philosophy and history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at Goethe University Frankfurt. The subject of his doctoral thesis (1975) was \\"The 'Jewish Question' in the Third Reich. Its Significance in National Socialist Ideology and Politics and its Role in Determining the Status and Activities of the Jews\\". In 1985, he was appointed an associate professor, and in 1991 a full professor in the Hebrew University's Department of the History of the Jewish People. In 1984-1985 he was a Visiting Professor at Harvard University. Since 1988 he has held the Sol Rosenbloom Chair in Jewish History. He retired from teaching in 1999 after being diagnosed with cancer. He conducts his current research within the framework of the Hebrew University's Institute of Jewish Studies; his research projects on German Jewry under the Nazi regime are supported by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the German- Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (GIF). Kulka was for many years a member of the board of directors of Yad Vashem and continues to sit on the board of the Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of German and Central European Jewry. He is a member of the editorial board of the bilingual (Hebrew and English) journal \\"Yad Vashem Studies.\\" Prizes For his book Deutsches Judentum unter dem Nationalsozialismus (German Jewry under the National-Socialist Regime 1997): * Buchman Memorial Prize, Yad Vashem, 1998.for editing the book Deutsches Judentum unter dem Nationalsozialismus: Band 1: Dokumente zur Geschichte der Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden 1933-1939 (Mohr Siebeck 1998, ) * Wiznitzer Prize for best book published in Jewish studies, 1998, awarded by the Hebrew University's Institute of Jewish Studies.

Research Studies =Modern Antisemitism= From the outset of his academic activity, Kulka developed a conceptual and methodological approach to the study of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust which departed from the prevailing one-dimensional focus on the persecution and annihilation of the Jews.Otto Dov Kulka, \\"Major Trends and Tendencies in German Historiography on National Socialism and the 'Jewish Question'\\", in: Israel Gutman (ed.), The Historiography of the Holocaust Period, Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1988, pp. 1-51, 99-104. He maintained that the study of the history of the Jews under Nazism should follow the same scholarly principles that are applied to every historical period. Within this framework, he discerned three major topics of research: (1) Nazi ideology and policy on the Jews; (2) the attitude of the German population toward the regime's policy on the Jews and toward the Jews themselves; and (3) the Jewish society and its leadership. This comprehensive picture was then examined in the light of historical continuity and change. Only from this perspective, Kulka argued, could the question of the Nazi period's singularity and the \\"Final Solution\\" be properly addressed. In line with this conception, Kulka made an effort to avoid using the terms \\"Shoah\\" or \\"Holocaust\\", neither of which, in his opinion, accurately encapsulates this period within the continuity of Jewish history and does not convey its singularity. Instead, he refers to \\"the history of the Jews under the National-Socialist regime,\\" and, more frequently, to the \\"Final Solution.\\" The first phrase derives from his methodological approach, holding that this period should be studied like any other and in the context of its historical continuity, in the three dimensions mentioned above. As for the term \\"Final Solution,\\" Kulka considers it the most precise and most telling articulation of the teleological meaning of Nazi ideology and of the purpose underlying the realization of its goal: the termination of the historical existence of the Jewish people and the extermination of each individual Jew, as well as the eradication of the \\"Jewish spirit\\" (\\"j√ºdischer Geist\\") manifested in the European cultural heritage. It is here, that Kulka identifies the singularity of this period in Jewish and human history. As a scholar, Kulka has strictly separated the study of the historical past from his personal biography during the Second World War. As he noted in 2010, after completing the last of his major research projects to date,The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports, on Popular Opinion in Germany 1933-1945 (Yale Univ. Press, New Haven and London, 2010, 1064 p. ) he regarded his biographical past irrelevant to historical research, and intertwining the two spheres as illegitimate.In Kulka's interview in Sunday Times, 2.2.2013. It was only in 2012, that he decided to publish a book bearing a different character. In this work, Kulka explores his memory images from the years he spent in the ghetto of Theresienstadt and in Auschwitz Birkenau, and reflects on them as a historian and thinker. First published in English in 2013 as Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death, Reflections on Memory and Imagination,Allen Lane, Penguin Books, London 2013. the book has been widely translated. =The Jews in Nazi ideology and policy= In his research on modern antisemitism, Kulka drew, among other sources, on studies by his university teachers, the historians Jacob Talmon and Shmuel Ettinger, applying their insights to his empirical findings about National-Socialist ideology and policy. To gain a broader perspective, he examined the centrality of the ambivalent Jewish component in the major trends of Western culture in the modern age, as well as the radicalization of the elements of antagonism toward Judaism and the Jews within them. He explores these developments against the background of the secularization process of central ideological movements since the seventeenth century, the most radical of which in the twentieth century was Nazism. In 1989, Kulka articulated his approach succinctly: > Many scholarly works written on National Socialism over the past three > decades have reached the conclusion that antisemitism played a vital role in > the ideology and policy of the Third Reich. Of all the ideological and > political ingredients that went into the making of Hitler's outlook, > antisemitism, in its broadest sense, appears to be not only the one > consistent and immutable element, it also bridges such seemingly > contradictory leanings as anti-Marxism and anti-capitalism, the struggle > against democracy and modernism, and a basic anti-Christian disposition. > [...] Yet Hitler consistently portrays this ideological war in the > international arena as an extension of the struggle that the National > Socialist movement had waged, from its inception, against its ideological > and political enemies within Germany itself: Jewish Marxism, Jewish > parliamentary democracy, Jewish capitalism, and even the \\"Political > Churches\\" and the Jewish foundations of Christianity. In the movement's > racial-determinist conception, the Jews stand in an obviously dominant > relationship to all these forces and factors as the biological source of > doctrines and ideologies whose most radical expression is Bolshevism but > whose origin was Judaism's introduction of Christianity into the Western > world. National Socialist antisemitism traced the sense of crisis that > dogged the modern world to its domination by 'Jewish-Christian-Bolshevik' > principles that were based on a universalist 'destructive' belief in the > unity of the world and the equality of men in all spheres of life. These > principles were antithetical to the Nazi Social-Darwinist version of the > 'natural order', i.e., the inherent inequality of the races and the eternal > struggle between them for their very survival. Hence only the restoration of > this order ‚Äì which was conditional upon the absolute annihilation, physical > and spiritual, of Judaism ‚Äì could ensure the future health, indeed the very > existence of the human race.Critique of Judaism in European Thought: On the > Historical Meaning of Modern Antisemitism, in: The Jerusalem Quarterly, 52 > (1989), pp. 127-129. In an interview for the Hebrew-language newspaper Haaretz in 2013 he said, > My conclusion in regard to Nazi antisemitism is that it would have been > impossible without the history of traditional Jew-hatred, but that the Final > Solution would have been unfeasible in a traditional Christian society. This > is because the existence of Judaism was a necessity in Christianity's > perception of redemption: the idea that the Jews will recover from their > blindness in the last days and see the light. However, only secularization > and secular political messianism made possible the totalistic 'redemptive > anti-Semitism' which was inherent in Nazi ideology and its attempt to change > the course of human history.Haaretz, April 7, 2013. Indeed, in his very first scholarly paper, \\"Richard Wagner and the Origins of Modern Antisemitism\\" (1961), Kulka identified and analyzed the phenomenon of \\"redemptive antisemitism.\\" This was an ideology of political messianism, which in its various metamorphoses led ultimately to National-Socialist antisemitism and the \\"Final Solution.\\"Richard Wagner und die Anf√§nge des modernen Antisemitismus, in: Bulletin des Leo Baeck Instituts, 16 (1961), pp. 281-300. The term \\"redemptive antisemitism\\" has become, particularly since the 1990s, a reference point in research about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.Saul Friedl√§nder, Nazi Germany and the Jews, The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939, Harper Collins Publishers, New York 1997; The Years of Extermination. Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945, Harper Collins Publishers, New York 2007. =Attitude of the population in Nazi Germany toward the Jews and toward the regime's anti-Jewish policy= Kulka published a monumental documentary study on this subject, which originally appeared in German, the language of the sources, in 2004,Otto Dov Kulka und Eberhard J√§ckel, Die Juden in den geheimen NS-Stimmungsberichten 1939-1945, Droste Verlag, D√ºsseldorf 2004 (896 p. and CD-Rom with 3744 annotated documents).

From the reviews: ; Alan Steinweis, Yad Vashem Studies, 40 (2012), pp. 173-182; David Cesarani, The Jewish Chronicle, August 1, 2011 . Decades earlier, in the mid-1960s, Kulka was one of the pioneers of scholarly research into this subject, later collaborating with his German colleague Eberhard J√§ckel and the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw. Kulka had laid the methodological and theoretical foundations for these studies already in his seminal article of 1975, 'Public Opinion, in National-Socialist Germany and the 'Jewish Question.\\"In: Zion, 40 (1975), 186-290 [Hebr. with an extensive English summary and documentation in German]. He showed that beneath the monolithic totalitarian encasement a certain diversity of social structures and political opinions remained from the pre-Nazi period. This was also reflected in the population's consent to the regime's policy toward the Jews, in various forms of criticism of that policy, and on the other hand, in anti- Jewish violence and \\"pressure from below\\" to accelerate and radicalize the policy of the \\"solution of the Jewish question in Germany.\\"On the \\"pressure from below\\" that preceded the promulgation of the Nuremberg laws see his article \\"Die N√ºrnberger Rassengesetze und die deutsche Bev√∂lkerung im Lichte geheimer NS-Lage- und Stimmungsberichte\\", in Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, 32 (1984), pp. 582-624. On the wave of violent anti-Jewish excesses \\"from below\\" that preceded by several weeks the so called Kristallnacht pogroms and was accompanied by destruction and burning of synagogues and expulsion of the Jews from various places in Germany, see Kulka & J√§ckel, The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports, on Popular Opinion in Germany 1933-1945, p. XXVI and doc. 353, p. 334. However, the dominant trend, as emerged clearly, was the constantly expanding and ever more extreme \\"removal\\" of the Jews from all spheres of life of the \\"German people's community\\" (Volksgemeinschaft) and finally from all of Germany.See also Michael Wildt, Volksgemeinschaft als Selbsterm√§chtigung. Gewalt gegen Juden in der deutschen Provinz 1919 bis 1939, Hamburger Edition, Hamburg 2007, and Ian Kershaw, \\"'Volksgemeinschaft'. Potential and Limitations of the Concept.\\" In: Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, 1 (2011), pp. 1-17. Drawing on these sources, Kulka devoted a special study to the complex problem of the attitude taken by the churches and the religious population in Germany toward the Jews, including those who converted to Protestantism and Catholicism.\\"The Churches in the Third Reich and the 'Jewish Question' in the Light of Secret Nazi Reports on German 'Public Opinion',\\" in: Biblioth√®que de la Revue d'Histoire Eccl√©siastique, Miscellanea historiae eccl√©siasticae IX, Bruxelles 1984, pp. 490-505. In another study based on the above-mentioned highly reliable source material Kulka devoted a special article to the examination of another aspect - the popular opinion in Nazi Germany and the government's attitude toward the Jews. In this study he revealed the influence of the popular opinion as \\"a factor in the policy of the 'solution of the Jewish question'.\\"\\"Popular Opinion in Nazi Germany as a Factor in the Policy of the 'Solution of the Jewish Question'\\", in: Paul Corner (ed.) Popular Opinion in Totalitarian Regimes: Fascism, Nazism, Communism, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2009, pp. 81-106. Kulka also considered it important to probe the abundant detailed information contained in these reports about the life of the Jews and their organized activity as they coped with both the regime's policy and the attitude of the German population toward them. He viewed the picture that emerged of the diverse, systematic, and continuous information that was presented to the various levels of the regime as a significant supplementary to what could be gleaned from the contemporary Jewish sources. Both types of sources show a thrust toward continuity ‚Äì though organized Jewish activity is seen to undergo transformations. It became more intense as a dialectical response to the growing and consistently more acute efforts to remove the Jews from the various spheres of life of the German state and society.Otto Dov Kulka, \\"Jewish Society in Germany as Reflected in Secret Nazi Reports on 'Public Opinion' 1933-1945\\", in: Moshe Zimmerman (ed.), Germans and Jews under the Nazi Regime, Essays by Three Generations of Historians, The Hebrew University Magnes Press, Jerusalem 2006, p. 261-279. See also subchapter here \\"The Jewish Society and its Leadership in Nazi Germany.\\" The most critical question of the research concerned the German population and the \\"Final Solution.\\" Prior to the publication of Kulka and J√§ckel's documentation project, scholars ‚Äì among them Kulka himself, Marlis Steinert, and Ian Kershaw ‚Äì interpreted the reports' apparent silence regarding the Jews during the war years as reflecting the German population's indifference to the Jews' fate.See above endnote 11, Kulka's article in Zion 1975; Marlis Steinert, Hitler's War and the Germans: Public Mood and Attitude during the Second World War, Athens, Ohio UP 1977; Ian Kershaw, Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich: Bavaria 1933 - 1945, Oxford, Clarendon Press 1983. According to Steinert and Kershaw, the German population took little interest in the Jews and their fate \\"because they had other things on their mind during the period of the war.\\" At that time, Kulka viewed this apparent indifference, in the light of the reports about mass murder of Jews being perpetrated in \\"the east,\\" as \\"abyssal indifference.\\" Kulka and J√§ckel published nearly 4,000 reports on German public opinion and the Jews, close to 1000 of them from the war years. According to Kulka, in their light the assumption about the silence of the sources no longer meets the criterion of empirical research. The documentation also supported Kulka's earlier findings, described in his article of 1975, concerning the widespread reports that circulated among the German population about the mass annihilation of the deported Jews. In the newly found documentation from early 1942, the general consensus reported from most areas of the Third Reich was that the population wished to see all the Jews deported from Germany (in the German original: \\"Am meisten w√ºrde jedoch eine baldige Abschiebung aller Juden aus Deutschland begr√º√üt werden\\"). This attitude persisted despite the population's knowledge about the fate of the deported Jews, as evident from many accurate reports. Here, then, the term \\"abyssal indifference\\" takes on concrete meaning. As Kulka and J√§ckel note at the closing of the Introduction to the English edition of their book: \\"The conclusion that can be derived from the reports on popular opinion, and from the subsequent published studies based on our edition, is a harsh one indeed.\\"The Jews in the Secret Nazi Reports, p. LXIV and doc. 618; see also the extensive review by Bernward D√∂rner on: \\"Kulka, Otto D.; J√§ckel, Eberhard (Hrsg.): Die Juden in den geheimen NS-Stimmungsberichten 1933-1945 . =The Jewish society and its leadership in Nazi Germany= This is a subject to which Kulka devoted a series of research articles as well as a book, German Jewry Under the National-Socialist Regime.See Otto Dov Kulka (ed.): Deutsches Judentum unter dem Nationalsozialismus, Bd. 1: Dokumente zur Geschichte der Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden 1933-1939, Mohr Siebeck, T√ºbingen 1997; The Reichsvereinigung and the Fate of the Jews.

His research was based on his project to reconstruct the lost archives of the central Jewish organization in the years 1932‚Äì1939, the National Representation of the Jews of Germany (Reichsvertretung der deutschen Juden), and his archival discovery of its successor organization in the years 1939‚Äì1945, the \\"Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland.\\"Otto Dov Kulka and Esriel Hildesheimer, \\"The Central Organisation of German Jews in the Third Reich and its archives (On the Completion of the Reconstruction Project)\\", in: LBIY, 34 (1989), pp. 187-203. Revising the prevailing historiography, Kulka showed that the National Representation of the Jews of Germany was not established in 1933, after the Nazis' rise to power, but that its foundations were laid a year earlier, in 1932. In the light of the rapidly deteriorating political situation, the Jewish leadership in the various district states (L√§nder) realized that it was essential to create a united central organization to represent German Jewry vis-√†-vis the regime. Similarly, Kulka showed that the successor to the National Representation, namely the National Association of Jews in Germany, was not established in 1939 after the Kristallnacht pogrom, solely at the order of the Nazi regime. In fact, it emerged under this name, and within a new central framework as the national organization of all the Jews in Germany, in the course of a lengthy internal process in 1938. Kulka's comprehensive article, \\"Germany,\\" in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, offers an overview of the developments among German Jewry in this period within their historical context, integrating the three areas of his research on this subject.Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, vol. 2, pp. 557-575. Summing up his analysis of the status and activities of the Jewish society under the Nazi regime, he wrote: > Among the Jews, the reaction to what was happening was different on the > individual and the organizational level. Although the Jews' social and > political status had suffered a tremendous blow, their existing > organizational network was scarcely touched ‚Äì indeed, new organizations came > into being. In this respect the situation of Jews was in stark contrast to > the prevailing trend of totalitarian Gleichschaltung, the purpose of which > was to destroy the existing social and political fabric of German society > and construct a homogeneous society (Volksgemeinschaft) in its place. It was > the exclusionary racist principle on which the policy towards the Jews was > based ‚Äì their separation and isolation from the general society ‚Äì that made > possible the continuing existence of the Jew's own institutions. Moreover, > \\"alien\\" and \\"decadent\\" ideas and principles such as political pluralism and > democracy, which were now beyond the pale among the general population, were > still the rule in Jewish public life. This was, however, the freedom of the > outcasts, of a community that now seemed doomed to disappearance. According to Kulka, German Jewry faced three alternatives upon the establishment of the Nazi regime and the promulgation of the first anti-Jewish decrees in 1933. > The first alternative was the disintegration and atomization of Jewish > society and the paralysis of all its institutions and organizations under > the impact of the anti-Jewish waves of terror and legislation. In the lives > of individuals, this was manifested in a hasty mass flight from Germany, the > desperate return of some, and in extreme cases, through suicide. The second > alternative, advocated by a small minority of so-called Nationaldeutsche > Juden, was diametrically opposed to the first. It was the temptation to draw > the ostensibly inevitable conclusions from the crisis and failure of the > democratic system of Weimar, and by the same token from the failure of the > internal democratic principles of the Jewish society, and introduce in their > place ‚Äì for all of German Jewry ‚Äì a regime of authoritarian leadership based > on the F√ºhrerprinzip. However, most Jewish organizations opted for a third > alternative: the continued existence of the democratic-pluralistic > institutions of the Jewish society from the post-Emancipation period and the > establishment of a new all-inclusive central organization based on the > principle of the voluntary affiliation of each body and free activity within > the organization.On Germans and Jews, as in note 19, pp. 269-270. See also > the Introduction to \\"Deutsches Judentum\\", Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, > vol. 2, pp. 557-575. Kulka sums up his approach to the study of this period in the history of German Jewry as follows: > In my attempt to present the basic tendencies in the development of Jewish > life from 1933 on, there are two different dimensions of time: the > historical dimension of time and the time dimension of the Third Reich ‚Äì > defined teleologically, the period of the Final Solution. The first > dimension explores this time against the background of continuity: what > existed before 1933 and continued even if under an altered guise after that > watershed. The second dimension relates to what was significantly new and > novel, introduced and developed under the new regime. Both dimensions must > be examined side by side. Of course, the first was predominant until > 1938/1939, the second from then on to 1943 or even 1945.On Germans and Jews, > p. 271. =Studies on Historiography= A key element of Kulka's research on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust period is devoted to its historiography. The subject is addressed in several of his seminal articles. His article on the German historiography of National-Socialism and the \\"Jewish Question\\" from 1924 to 1984 was the first and most systematic on this complex topicDie deutsche Geschichtsschreibung √ºber Nationalsozialismus und die 'Endl√∂sung'\\", in: Historische Zeitschrift, 240 (1985), pp. 599-639; (extended English version: \\"Major Trends and Tendencies in German Historiography on National Socialism and the 'Jewish Question',\\" in: Israel Gutman,Gideon Greif (ed.), The Historiography of the Holocaust Period, Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1988, pp. 1-51, 99-104, as well as their extension to the Historikerstreit dispute: \\"Singularity and its Relativization. Changing Views in German Historiography on National Socialism and the 'Final Solution',\\"; in: Yad Vashem Studies XIX (1988), pp. 151-186; as well as the publication of Kulka's exchange of letters with Ernst Nolte: \\"Der Umgang des Historikers Ernst Nolte mit Briefen aus Israel.

Nov. 1987. until the publication of Nicolas Berg's comprehensive book on the subject in 2003.Nicolas Berg, Der Holocaust und die westdeutschen Historiker, Erforschung und Erinnerung, Wallstein Verl., G√∂ttingen 2003. Another study discusses the basic tendencies in Zionist historiography of the Jews under the Nazi regime.Otto Dov Kulka, \\"Tendencies in Zionist Historiography on the Jews under the Nazi Regime\\", in: ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£ ◊ì◊¢◊™, ◊û◊ó◊ß◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊î◊ô◊°◊ò◊ï◊®◊ô◊î ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊™ ◊û◊ï◊ì◊®◊†◊ô◊™ ◊û◊ï◊í◊©◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊§◊®◊ï◊§' ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£ ◊©◊ú◊û◊ï◊ü ◊ú◊ó◊í ◊ô◊ï◊ë◊ú◊ï, ◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊î◊°◊§◊®◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊ê◊ï◊†◊ô◊ë◊®◊°◊ô◊ò◊™ ◊ë◊ü-◊í◊ï◊®◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊†◊í◊ë, ◊™◊©\\"◊¢, ◊¢◊û' 25*-36* His basic scholarly reviews on the historiography of the Holocaust period include extensive discussions devoted to two monumental two-volume works: Saul Friedl√§nder's Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution, 1933-1939; and The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945;In: Zion, 66 (2001), pp. 109-123 [Hebr.]. and Ian Kershaw's biography of Hitler: Hitler 1889-1936.

These include: a joint project of the Hebrew University and the University of Vienna about Austria's Jewish citizens who found refuge from Nazi persecution in Mandate Palestine, and their life in Israel;Erika Weinzierl and Otto Dov Kulka, Vertreibung und Neubeginn. Israelische B√ºrger √∂sterreichischer Herkunft, Wien 1992. an article on Czech Jewry from the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic, in 1918, until after the Munich Conference and the end of the Second Republic, in March 1939;The Munich Conference and the \\"Jewish Question\\" in Czechoslovakia in 1938, in: Yalkut Moreshet, 2(1964), pp. 51-78 [Hebr.]. and a comparative study on the history of the Jews in Germany and Czechoslovakia between the two world wars and in the Holocaust period.\\"History and Historical Consciousness. Similarities and Dissimilarities in the History of the Jews in Germany and the Czech Lands 1918-1945,\\" in: Bohemia, 46/1 (2005), pp. 68-86. In all his studies of the Nazi period, Kulka refrained from dealing with the final stage of the physical annihilation of the Jews in the death camps and with the mass executions in the German-occupied areas of Eastern Europe. His only departure from this practice was an article based on his discovery of unknown documents on the \\"family camp\\" of Jews from the Theresienstadt Ghetto in Auschwitz- Birkenau and its place in the Nazis' policy of camouflage and deception about the deportation of the Jews to the \\"east\\" for extermination. The article was published in 1984 in Hebrew as \\"Ghetto in an Annihilation Camp. The 'Family Camp' of the Theresienstadt Jews in Auschwitz, 1943-1944,\\"◊ë◊™◊ï◊ö: ◊û◊ó◊†◊ï◊™ ◊î◊®◊ô◊õ◊ï◊ñ ◊î◊†◊ê◊¶◊ô◊ô◊ù. ◊û◊ë◊†◊î ◊ï◊û◊í◊û◊ï◊™, ◊ì◊û◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ê◊°◊ô◊®, ◊î◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊û◊ó◊†◊ï◊™, ◊ô◊ì ◊ï◊©◊ù, ◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊™◊©◊û\\"◊ì, ◊¢◊û' 249 ‚Äì 260, 271 - 280. and simultaneously in an English-language version with a significant difference in the title: \\"Ghetto in an Annihilation Camp. Jewish Social History in the Holocaust Period and its Ultimate Limits.\\"Israel Gutman and Avital Saf (eds.), The Nazi Concentration Camps. Structure and Aims. The Image of the Prisoner. The Jews in the Camps, Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1980, pp. 315-331, 352-356. It deals, inter alia, with the continuity of the patterns of life and the basic values of the Jewish society even in the very heart of the Auschwitz annihilation camp and in the face of a clear awareness of the certainty of death. The purpose of this special camp's existence and the reason for its liquidation ‚Äì part of the policy of Adolf Eichmann's Jewish section in the Reich Security Main Office ‚Äì did not become clear until long after the war. The riddle was solved when Kulka discovered a secret exchange of correspondence between Eichmann and his staff and the German Red Cross in Berlin, and between the latter and the headquarters of the International Red Cross in Geneva. This almost unknown episode was thus accorded its rightful place in Holocaust historiography. The article was reprinted as an appendix to shed light on the historical background of Kulka's \\"extra-scientific\\" book, Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death. =Other Studies= In 1982, Kulka initiated a large-scale international conference within the framework of his activity in the Historical Society of Israel and his research on the relations between Judaism and Christianity in the modern era. Its theme was \\"Judaism and Christianity under the impact of National-Socialism from 1919 to 1945, in Germany and in all the European countries occupied by the Third Reich, its allies and vassal states.\\" The volume of the conference's proceedings, edited by Kulka and published in 1987 by the Historical Society of Israel,Judaism and Christianity under the Impact of National Socialism 1919-1945, The Historical Society of Israel, Jerusalem 1987; Review: Ian Kershaw, \\"The Churches and the Nazi Persecution of the Jews\\", in: Yad Vashem Studies, Volume XIX (1988), pp. 427-437. has become a reference point for research and discussion about this highly charged, complex issue. Among Kulka's studies of other historical periods, a special place is occupied by his seminal Hebrew-language study on sixteenth century Jewish Prague in its Central European setting. Titled \\"The Historical Background of the National and Educational Teachings of MaHaRaL from Prague\\", it appeared in the jubilee volume of the periodical Zion.Zion, 1985, pp. 320-277. The subtitle in the English-language abstract encapsulates the article's thrust: \\"A Suggested New Approach to the Study of MaHaRaL.\\"In the English abstract, Zion, 1985, pp. XVII-XIX. Kulka's point of departure is Maharal's quasi-modern ideas, which had proved puzzling to many scholars. He too addresses the singularity of these ideas, reflected in the following quotation from Maharal's Netzach Yisrael concerning the substance of nations, their religious faith, and their place in creation: \\"It is unworthy for a nation to be subjugated and yoked to another [nation], for the Holy One, blessed be He, created each and every nation unto itself. [...] For man chooses divinity which he will resemble in part. [...] Every nation chooses its divinity according to its own thoughts...\\"Netzach Israel, Tel Aviv 1955, Kap. 1, p. 4. As for the Jewish people, its exile from its land and its redemption according to the same order of creation, Kulka continues to quote from Maharal with his unique style: > There is no doubt that the exile is a change and a departure from the order > in which the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered each nation in its proper > place and ordered Israel in their proper place, which is the Land of Israel. > Exile from the place is a change and a complete departure, and all things, > when they depart from their natural place [...] are unsustainable in the > place that is not natural to them, until they return to their natural place. > For if they were to remain in the place that is unnatural to them, what was > unnatural to them would become natural, and this is something that is not > possible, for the unnatural to become natural. In his study, Kulka shed new light on the historical research into Maharal's ideas on nationhood and education, against a diverse background of sources and in the light of the contemporary political, social, and religious situation in Central Europe. According to Kulka it is inadequate to analyze Maharal's views only in the light of the writings of his Jewish contemporaries and predecessors. Insight about the distinctiveness of Maharal's ideas concerning nationhood and education, and the connection between them, could be gained by observing the historical setting in which he was active and examining possible influences to which he was susceptible in those specific circumstances. In his study of Maharal's national theory, Kulka thus probes the different channels through which Maharal was exposed to the distinctive fusion of religion and nationalism of post-Hussitic Bohemia in the Reformation era, not omitting national conflicts and the relations between the nations. Through the prism of this historical context, Kulka is able to address convincingly the singularity and originality of Maharal's creative Jewish thought and its relevance for his time. Kulka applies a similar methodological approach in his inquiry into Maharal's innovative educational theory. One striking result of his research is the solution to the deeply puzzling similarities between Maharal's educational doctrine and that of the \\"teacher of nations\\", Jan Amos Comenius, as set forth by Aharon Kleinberger.Aharon Kleinberger, The Educational Ideas of the Maharal of Prague, Jerusalem 1962 [Hebr. with an English abstract]. According to Kleinberger, the fact that Comenius was just 17 when the Maharal died excludes the possibility that he influenced Maharal; and, ipso facto, the reverse influence is equally untenable. However, Kulka proves that Comenius, the last bishop of the humanistic Christian denomination of the Bohemian Brethren (in Latin: Unitas Fratrum), was the successor and codifier of the educational theories and methods of his teachers in this sect, who were Maharal's contemporaries and interlocutors. This study concentrates initially on the twenty years of Maharal's tenure as \\"head of the [Jewish] communities of the State of Moravia,\\" (◊ê◊ë ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ì◊ô◊ü ◊ï◊®◊ê◊© ◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊™ ◊û◊¢◊î◊®◊ô◊ü) in close proximity to the educational center of the Bohemian Brethren. This center, with its superb Hebraists, translated and published the magnificent Czech-language edition of the Bible ‚Äì Bible kralick√°. Some of Maharal's discussions and disputes with \\"Christian sages,\\" which appear in his writings, took place in this milieu. Moreover, Kulka's approach, which sets Maharal within the relevant historical context, is not inconsistent with an appreciation of his creative originality. Although anchored in the reality of their time, Maharal's ideas draw on far deeper sources and bear implications that far transcend this period. These issues, including Kulka's study, were discussed extensively in an international conference about Maharal, held in Jerusalem in 2009 to mark the four hundredth anniversary of his death. The conference's sponsors ‚Äì the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities and the Historical Society of Israel ‚Äì are to publish the proceedings. =Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death= Kulka's book, Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death. Reflections on Memory and Imagination, was published almost simultaneously in various European languages and worldwide during 2013‚Äì14. It is fundamentally different from his scholarly works, as he attests in the introduction: > I assume that readers of my historical publications will have identified me > unequivocally with an attitude of strict and impersonally remote research, > always conducted within well-defined historical categories, as a kind of > self-contained method unto itself. But few are aware of the existence within > me of a dimension of silence, of a choice I made to sever the biographical > from the historical past. [...] The hidden meaning of the metaphoric > language of the central, recurrent motifs in the book, such as 'immutable > law of the death', the 'Great Death', the 'Metropolis of Death', reaches > beyond the experience of the world of Auschwitz. They are metaphors for what > at the time seemed to expand into a world order that would change the course > of human history and remained so in my reflective memory. I am also aware > that these texts, though anchored in concrete historical events, transcend > the sphere of history. The book was extensively discussed in the press and the electronic media in Israel and throughout the world, particularly in England, France, and Germany.Die Zeit, 14.03.13; Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 26.03.13. Most reviewers commented on its different style of language and observation amid the rich literature of the Holocaust period, and remarked on its special place alongside the autobiographical works of Saul Friedl√§nder, Primo Levi, and Imre Kert√©sz. Writing in the British Guardian newspaper, Thomas W. Laqueur noted, \\"Primo Levi's testimony, it is often said, is that of a chemist: clear, cool, precise, distant. So with Kulka's work: this is the product of a master historian ‚Äì ironic, probing, present in the past, able to connect the particular with the cosmic.\\"Thomas W. Laqueur \\"Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death by Otto Dov Kulka ‚Äì review\\", The Guardian, 25 January 2013 And, in Le Monde, Nicolas Weill wrote, \\"A book that defies categorization in any conventional genre. [...] The lucidity and temperance that accompany this stunning return to the past arouse amazement and astonishment.\\"Le Monde, 25 January 2013 The book received two prestigious literary awards in Germany and Britain: The Geschwister-Scholl Prize and the Jewish Quarterly Literary Wingate Prize. Czech historian Anna H√°jkov√° of University of Warwick criticized Kulka's book Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death: Reflections on Memory and Imagination for omitting his father and sister who died in Treblinka death camp. This, in spite of the following clear declaration of the author: \\"These recordings were neither historical testimony nor autobiographical memoir, but the reflections [...] of memory and imagination that have remained from the world of the wondering child of ten to eleven that I had once been\\". In 2018 the German filmmaker Stefan Auch released the film \\"Die vorletzte Freiheit. Landschaften des Otto Dov Kulka\\" (The Freedom Last But One ‚Äì Landscapes of Otto Dov Kulka), loosely based on the book, which premiered at the Jewish Film Festival in Jerusalem. In the film \\"we delve deep into the world of Otto Dov Kulka, following his thoughts about the inexplicability of history\\".

Lafferty was a 1984 murder case in the state of Utah. It gained substantial publicity due to the accused persons' statement that the murders were the result of a divine revelation. History Ron Lafferty and his younger brother Dan were charged for the throat-slashing homicides of their sister-in-law Brenda Lafferty and her 18-month-old daughter, Erica, that occurred on July 24, 1984. Ron, a self-proclaimed prophet, claimed to have received a revelation from God in which he was instructed to \\"remove\\" several people including the two victims. Attorneys Michael Esplin and Gary Weight were appointed to serve as \\"standby\\" counsel for the brothers when they were charged with homicide in August 1984. They represented the brothers during their competency hearings. At the conclusion of the competency evaluations, and while incarcerated in the Utah County jail, Ron Lafferty attempted suicide in December 1984. This resulted in severe injury and mental damages. Following the suicide attempt, Ron was held at the Utah State Hospital for several months. Dan's case Dan Lafferty represented himself during his trial, although he had access to the standby counsel. The jury trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to 5 years to life. Esplin and Weight appealed the case to the Utah Supreme Court, which upheld his conviction. Ron's case Ron Lafferty was found competent to stand trial by doctors at the Utah State Hospital. Ron was tried in 1985, convicted and sentenced to death. The penalty was upheld after an appeal to the Utah Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court rejected a further appeal. The U.S. District Court for Utah upheld the conviction, however the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's verdict and reversed the conviction, finding that the state and the lower court judge had committed error in finding Ron competent to stand trial. The state of Utah filed an appeal with the United States Supreme Court which was turned down. Ron was remanded to the Fourth District Court for Utah so he could undergo competency proceedings, was found incompetent to stand trial and sent to the Utah State Hospital for treatment. Three years later, a court found that Ron's competency was \\"restored\\" and in 1996 he was retried for the crimes. After a 3-week trial, Ron was found guilty of a capital offense. Further appeals to the Supreme Court of Utah and the U.S. Supreme Court were denied. On August 12, 2019 the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to hear Ron‚Äôs case by a unanimous decision. Judge Mary Beck Briscoe wrote: > \\"Lafferty has failed to make this showing with respect to any of the four > claims on which he seeks a COA [certificate of appealability],\\" The courts decision gave Ron few options left to appeal his execution. Ron elected to be executed by firing squad. Jon Krakauer's book, Under the Banner of Heaven, is primarily based upon interviews with Dan Lafferty.

Content Patrick Cockburn's son Henry was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 20 whilst studying art at Brighton University. His first psychotic breakdown had occurred in 2002, after he nearly drowned whilst trying to swim the estuary at Newhaven. He was sectioned at the beginning of 2003 and then spent the majority of the next seven years held in mental hospitals (during that period he escaped from his custody on approximately thirty different occasions). Since that period he has now left mental hospitals and at the time that the book was written was moving into more independent living quarters in Herne Bay. Cockburn explores the subjective experience of being diagnosed with schizophrenia and the effect that it has on family and friends. He also examines the wider questions that are raised by a case such as Henry's, with a discussion of the vexed issues that accompany particular mental health diagnoses and classifications, the state of the contemporary law in relation to such cases and the history of disorders themselves and the treatments that are applied to them. Patrick Cockburn's wife Jan's diary extracts from the period are also included in the book. Henry's perspective is also discussed; he is able to remember the real life situations he was in as well as the hallucinatory visions that accompanied them, and sees the whole experience of schizophrenia as being a matter of 'awakening' as much as an illness or disorder, and has been resistant to the use of anti-psychotic medication because he did not want to take drugs that affected his consciousness (though it is also pointed out that he had used cannabis from a young age, raising wider questions about the link between use of the drug and the disorder). One wider social concern that emerges from the analysis in the book is that we have not yet collectively created the kind of community-based mechanisms and environments for mental health recovery and renaissance that might be paralleled with the original development of the mental hospitals in the nineteenth century. Henry's case is broadly positive given the signs of rehabilitation, though there are many questions over the long-term situation in a case such as his which are raised by the book as a whole.

Williams traveled briefly in England and France, supporting himself by teaching in private schools, before settling in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Later life and work In 1901, Williams had his first exhibition at the National Academy and won a bronze medal at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. His work was composed almost entirely of landscape paintings and of outdoor scenes peopled with idealized, elegantly-clad women. In 1910, he took a trip with painters Thomas Moran, Elliott Daingerfield, Douglas Parshall and Edward Henry Potthast to the Grand Canyon and other western sites. The result was an expansion of Williams' subject matter and a series of Californian landscapes. Williams carried out field studies of the landscapes that were the subjects of his work, but painted in his studio. He believed in the separation between art and its subject, and that an artist‚Äôs idealistic vision could serve and augment his subject matter. William‚Äôs work is included in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Hickory Museum of Art, and the Milwaukee Art Museum.

It is one of the stories featuring the reclusive scientist Wendell Urth. It first appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in October 1966, and was reprinted in the anthologies Asimov's Mysteries (1968) and The Best Mysteries of Isaac Asimov (1986). Plot summary In this short story, somewhere on the Moon is hidden an extraterrestrial artifact. Two explorers, Jennings and Strauss, discovered it, but Jennings is dead and Strauss is insane. The artifact seems to be able to amplify and transmit thoughts, even to the extent of allowing one person to damage the mind of another. The only clues are a piece of paper with cryptic symbols, numbers, and letters written on it, and the babblings of the remaining member of the expedition, Strauss. Strauss is a member of the Ultras, a society dedicated to eliminating \\"non-essential\\" people, reducing the human population to a few million who think like themselves. It is feared that the device could enable the Ultras to carry out their plan. The original paper has already disappeared, presumably stolen by an Ultra, and the investigators have only a copy to work with. The clues on the piece of paper seem to point to different locations on the Moon, but one stands out: a vertical arrow pointing upwards to the astrological symbol for Earth. One of the investigators realizes that the message means \\"go to Earth\\", or more exactly, \\"go to Urth\\". Jennings was a former student of the extraterrologist Wendell Urth. He died of a stab wound from Strauss, but not before rendering Strauss insane using the power of the artifact, and then going to some unknown place to hide it. The mysterious paper was found inside a spacesuit gauntlet. When the investigators contact Wendell Urth, he recalls Jennings was a man who liked bad puns. Urth professes to enjoy a good pun, but found Jennings' efforts irritating. Reading the paper clue and listening to the audio log, he concludes that the symbols are mostly red herrings. They are too ambiguous and contradictory to be useful. Instead he tells the investigators the story of the astronomer Christof Klau, a German Jesuit mathematician and astronomer who modified the proposal of the modern Gregorian calendar. His audience is puzzled until he tells them that in the recordings of Strauss's ravings there are frequent mentions of the artifact as \\"the key\\" to the future of the world. He tells them that, with his brain activity heightened by the artifact, Jennings achieved his greatest pun by linking the words \\"clue\\" and \\"key\\". \\"Clue\\" sounds similar to \\"Klau\\"; the Latinized form of Klau was Clavius, which is similar to the Latin word \\"clavis\\", which means \\"key\\"; so the \\"clue\\" and the \\"key\\" to the mystery were the same thing, linked by the bilingual pun. Urth directs the investigators to look in the lunar crater Clavius, at the point where Earth would be directly overhead (indicated by the arrow pointing to Earth). He also tells them that their fears about the Ultras using the device are groundless. Strauss was unable to use the artifact himself. Urth also knew Strauss as a student, and was aware of his cold, calculating nature. He believes that the one human characteristic that the artifact operates on is empathy, a quality the Ultras do not possess.

On its northern slopes is the village of Hering, which grew out of the lower ward or castellan's settlement. The history of castle and village is therefore closely interwoven.  History  The region around the Otzberg probably belonged to the territory that King Pippin gifted in 766 A.D. to Fulda Abbey, together with Gro√ü-Umstadt. Otzberg Castle was probably built in the late 12th/early 13th century. At this time, Abbot Marquard I of Fulda secured the abbey estates and built castles that were visible from a long way as a sign of his influence. : ...Here is a site for a castle‚Ä¶Die Gesta Marcuardi, in: Traditiones et Antiquitates Fuldenses, Fulda, 1844 He transferred the castle to Conrad of Hohenstaufen, brother of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, as vogt. Conrad was Count Palatine of the Rhine. The castrum Othesberg was first mentioned in the records in 1231. In this document the Archbishop of Mainz, Siegfried III, also the overseer of Fulda Abbey, guaranteed to Count Palatine Otto II the arrangement agreed in the previous year, the details of which are unknown. In 1244 the castellanos de odesbrech are mentioned for the first time: the castellans or Burgmannen of Otzberg Castle. The fortifications must have been sufficiently developed that five castellans and their servants were able to occupy it. The castellans built houses in the village of Hering, so- called \\"castellan's houses\\" or Burgmannenh√§user. Of these only parts of the house owned by Gans of Otzberg have survived. In the early 14th century, the resources of Fulda Abbey ran out so, in 1332, Prince-Abbot Henry VI of Hohenberg enfeoffed Otzberg Castle and the Fulda part of Umstadt for 4,600 pounds of Heller to Werner of Anevelt and Engelhard of Franckenstein, who carried out building work at Otzberg to the tune of 200 pounds. In 1374 Fulda redeemed the estate again, but enfeoffed in the same year Otsperg die burg (\\"Otzberg the castle\\"), Heringes die stat darundir (\\"Hering the town below it\\") and half of Umstadt for 23,875 guilders to Ulrich of Hanau, who also carried out work on the castle, for 400 guilders. In 1390 the abbey sold Otzberg and Hering and the half of Umstadt with the Hanau fief, which had meanwhile increased in value to 33,000 guilders, to Count Palatine Rupert II. In 1504 the Bavarian Feud partly involved Otzberg. In the dispute over the Landshut succession, Emperor Maximilian imposed the imperial ban on Count Palatine Philip for a breach of the Landfrieden. Landgrave William II of Hesse seized Otzberg by force. After the Reichstag of Constance in 1507, Electoral Palatinate received the Amt of Otzberg back again and did not enfeoff it again. But weapon technology had changed so that the castle could no longer simply be held by castellans. In 1511, a Zwinger was built, the inner wall was strengthened and a new gatehouse built. In the mid-16th century a stone town wall was built around the lower ward (the village of Hering). In 1621, during the Thirty Years' War, a Bavarian corps of 2,000 men and imperial and Spanish troops camped in the area of Otzberg-Umstadt and besieged Otzberg Castle. A year later, in 1622, the garrison surrendered the castle. The castle and amt of Otzberg as well as half of Umstadt went back to Hesse in 1623 as compensation for war damage suffered. In 1647 the French took the castle. They based themselves at the castle and helped themselves to the food and provisions. As a result of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 Otzberg was returned to the Palatinate. Although the whole of the Palatinate was in French hands during the Napoleonic Wars, the two √Ñmter of Otzberg and Umstadt remained Electoral Palatine. At that time the Palatine Archives were stored at Otzberg Castle, in which one can read the property claims for a new era. WIth the stabilisation of the political situation, Otzberg Castle lost its military importance for the Palatinate. From 1711 active service soldiers were gradually replaced by disabled veterans, sot that from 1720 the castle became purely an invalids garrison, which guarded the prisoners incarcerated there. According to legend, whoever bites through this ring owns the castle The inner courtyard in 1900 In 1802 the Electoral Palatine Oberamt of Otzberg went to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, which used it from 1803 as a state prison. In 1818 Otzberg Castle was abandoned as a military location. On 25 July 1826 the Finance Ministry in Darmstadt issued a decree that the tower of the castle, the commandant's house with its small stables, the doctor's house, the stable near the Marketenderei, the well house and the new barracks (Bandhaus) should be preserved. All other buildings should be sold for demolition. In 1921 the Bandhaus was converted into a youth hostel. In the 1950s a forestry office and a restaurant were housed in the commandant's house. This arrangement continued until the mid-60s when the place was rented to various tenants to run the restaurant. In 1985, a museum the Collection of Folk Art in Hesse (Sammlung zur Volkskunde in Hessen) moved into the Bandhaus. In 1996 the Korporalshaus was rebuilt. It has since been used as a museum building and location for the Standesamt of the municipality of Otzberg.  Military  The occupants from the outset were soldiers; in the 14th century, six men lived there; around 1471 there were 14 people. Specialised paid soldiers first appeared in the 16th century when the place was converted into a defensible fortification.  Description  Plan of Otzberg Castle The appearance of the fortress is dominated by its double concentric walls built in the 16th century and oval in shape, and the bergfried which is of Romanesque origin. Its character is still that of a fortress from the time after the introduction of artillery, typical castle features, like towers are entirely missing. = Bergfried = The bergfried, also known locally as the Wei√üe R√ºbe (\\"White Beet\\", also the name for the wild turnip), is the oldest building in the castle. On clear days the visitor can see the whole of the county of Darmstadt-Dieburg and as far as the city of Frankfurt am Main and the Taunus hills from the top of the 17-metre-high keep. = Well = The castle well dates to about 1320 and is one of the deepest wells in Hesse. After recent excavations the depth of the well has now been estimated as about 50 metres. Next to it is a 1788 treadwheel that made it considerably easier to raise water. = Commandant's house = The commandant's house (Kommandantenhaus), in which the castle pub is housed today, was built in 1574 together with several other new buildings. = Palas = The palas houses the Otzberg Museum ‚Äì Documenting the history of Veste Otzberg. = Barracks/cabinet room = The old cabinet room was later used as a barrack. Due to the Hessian demolition decree (hessischen Abrissverf√ºgung) of 1806 it was one of the few buildings that was destroyed at Otzberg Castle. Today, only the wall foundations remain. = Corporal's house = The \\"corporal's house\\" (Korporalshaus), rebuilt in 1996 is used as a registry by the municipality of Otzberg.

If there are too many mouths to feed, fewer young will survive, reducing the parents' reproductive fitness. Lack's principle, proposed by the British ornithologist David Lack in 1954, states that \\"the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food\\". As a biological rule, the principle can be formalised and generalised to apply to reproducing organisms in general, including animals and plants. Work based on Lack's principle by George C. Williams and others has led to an improved mathematical understanding of population biology. Principle Lack's principle implies that birds that happen to lay more eggs than the optimum will most likely have fewer fledglings (young that successfully fly from the nest) because the parent birds will be unable to collect enough food for them all. Evolutionary biologist George C. Williams notes that the argument applies also to organisms other than birds, both animals and plants, giving the example of the production of ovules by seed plants as an equivalent case. Williams formalised the argument to create a mathematical theory of evolutionary decision-making, based on the framework outlined in 1930 by R. A. Fisher, namely that the effort spent on reproduction must be worth the cost, compared to the long-term reproductive fitness of the individual. Williams noted that this would contribute to the discussion on whether (as Lack argued) an organism's reproductive processes are tuned to serve its own reproductive interest (natural selection), or as V.C. Wynne-Edwards proposed, to increase the chances of survival of the species to which the individual belonged (group selection). The zoologist J.L. Cloudsley-Thompson argued that a large bird would be able to produce more young than a small bird. Williams replied that this would be a bad reproductive strategy, as large birds have lower mortality and therefore a higher residual reproductive value over their whole lives (so taking a large short-term risk is unjustified). Williams' reply \\"is one of the most cited papers in life history evolution because it ... made it conceptually possible to find the optimal life history strategies in age- structured populations\\".

Van der Kulk has also competed in two IPC Swimming World Championships winning four gold medals. Career history Van der Kulk was born on the 9 September 1993 in Huizen, Netherlands. She started swimming at the age of 12, and began competitive swimming while still in high school. Classified as an S14 swimmer, for athletes with an intellectual impairment, she was part of the Netherlands team chosen to compete on home soil at Eindhoven for the 2010 IPC Swimming World Championships. Entered in her favoured 100m backstroke and 200m freestyle, she took both events making her a double gold medal world champion at the age of 16. 150px Two years later van der Kulk was back representing the Netherlands, this time in London for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. In her first event, the 100m backstroke, she posted a time of 1:09.98, coming in second to Britain's Chloe Davies, but her time was good enough for her to qualify for the final. In the final later that evening she swam an improved time of 1:09.50 just 4 hundredths of a second behind second placed Taylor Corry, to give van der Kulk the bronze, her first Paralympic medal. Two days later in the 200m freestyle she won her heat with a time of 2:14.43. In the final van der Kulk swam slightly slower with a time of 2:14.80, but it was enough to push Australia's Kayla Clarke into fourth place to give van der Kulk her second Paralympic bronze. Her final event was the 100m breaststroke. By winning the first heat in the inaugural SB14 100m backstroke, van der Kulk, by default, set a new Paralympic record. This record was short-lived being taken from her moments later in the second heat by teammate Magda Toeters. In the final, van der Kulk came sixth.

The company operates mail-order, online, and retail stores in the United States. History In 1983, Swedish-born Gun Denhart founded the company in Portland, Oregon, in the garage of her home. The company began as an exclusively mail-order catalog retailer; Hanna Andersson mailed out its first catalog in 1984. Co-founder Tom Denhart would remain the company's creative director until 1995. The first brick-and-mortar store opened in 1990, and to-date there are currently over 60 retail locations operating in 24 states throughout the United States. In 1995, the Denharts hired Phil Iosca as CEO/President. He refocused the company on young children's apparel. Then, in 2001, the Denharts sold the company for $175 million. Following the initial sale, Hanna Andersson was sold to a succession of private equity firms and purchased by Sun Capital Partners. Gun Denhart remained on the Board of Directors until 2007. When Iosca retired in 2010, then-COO Adam Stone was named the new CEO of the company. In August 2016, Hanna Andersson was sold to L Catterton for an undisclosed amount. The company's executive team was kept intact. Philanthropy and company policies The company has received notable attention over the years due to Denhart's advocacy of progressive workplace policies. Denhart's initiatives included family-friendly employment policies in support of work-family balance and the charitable donation of 5% of the company's pre-tax profits to groups working for children's welfare. These efforts, along with Denhart's other work, led the Oregon Commission of Women to name her the \\"Woman of Achievement\\" for 2013. The company's \\"HannaHelps\\" program also garnered attention for awarding yearly grants to schools and non- profit groups serving children throughout the United States. Products Hanna Andersson manufactures clothing for babies, toddlers, kids, and women. Over 60% of the company's products are OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certified and many items are made with organic cotton. In 2014, the company expanded its offerings to include home d√©cor and bedding. Most recently, the company expanded its women's collection to include maternity apparel.

In Volendam he was a regular guest at the Hotel Spaander, a favorite spot for many painters, including Renoir.

It enjoyed very positive reviews. Synopsis =Characters= The novel is implicitly set around the time of the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis. It has four main characters, whose back-stories and psychological peculiarities the novel gradually develops through narratorial exposition and the characters' own flashbacks and conversations: * Hrafn, born into an elite Icelandic family, who after a troubled youth has become a leading entrepreneur in Iceland's financial boom. * Vigd√≠s, Hrafn's girlfriend, who, notwithstanding the death of her mother in a car accident and a distant father, has done well in her education and become a psychiatrist. * Egill, a childhood friend of Hrafn's who despite heavy drinking and womanising has by dint of hard work become a lawyer and also a leading player in Iceland's financial boom. * Anna, Egill's girlfriend, noted in the novel for her sexual drive, who is a successful journalist and writer. She brings with her her dog Tryggur. =Plot= The four go on holiday in the Icelandic highlands, driving in a jeep to the south of Askja. Losing the road in foggy darkness, Hrafn accidentally drives the jeep into the wall of a house mysteriously located in the highland desert, making the jeep unusable and forcing the characters to demand the reluctant hospitality of the house's two inhabitants: an old woman, √Åsa; and an old man who in the characters' estimation is at an advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease. The novel is quick to imply that there is something strange and dangerous about the situation. With no mobile phone signal and unsure of their location, the characters seek to find a way to reach civilization and get help, and the plot of the novel largely comprises the failure of these efforts. On the first day they try to drive to a village in an old jeep which √Åsa lends them, but it crashes in a pothole (which Hrafn thinks may be newly dug) and they walk home. Tryggur goes missing overnight. On the second day Hrafn, Vigd√≠s, and Egill try walking north to get a phone signal; Anna stays behind with an injured ankle. The walkers soon find a dam in a glacial river and an abandoned settlement, and explore the village, finding disturbing, man-made piles of animal bones, one surmounted with a photograph of Vigd√≠s sleeping, taken with her own polaroid camera. Hrafn attacks Egill due to factors including old enmities and Egill's apparent lust for Vigd√≠s, and the three become separated, returning home separately through a sandstorm. Meanwhile, Anna explores the house, discovering the old man's office and that he is one Kjartan A√∞alsteinsson, a doctor and one-time member of the Icelandic business elite, associated with Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson and Margr√©t √û√≥ra Hallgr√≠msson. From the office she finds a hidden room containing a bed, a pistol, and a switch labeled 'see me' which, when pressed, gives her a serious electric shock. Piecing clues together, Anna concludes that Kjartan had a child by his own sister, and the family moved to the highlands to escape public shame. It is also implied that he was 'a once-famous scientist who has undertaken dangerous experiments on human subjects'.: \\"eitt sinn veri√∞ fr√¶gur v√≠sindama√∞ur sem hafi stunda√∞ varhugaver√∞ar tilraunir √° m√∂nnum\\" On the third day, Egill and Anna set off at daybreak without telling Hrafn and Vigd√≠s, as Egill wishes to escape from Hrafn. Before going far, they find Tryggur's collar with an arrow made with stones pointing down the gully through which the glacial river runs. Following this sign, Egill enters a tunnel in the gully's side, sees a mutilated Tryggur, and nothing more is seen of either in the novel. It later emerges than Anna follows Egill into the tunnel. Setting off later, Hrafn and Vigd√≠s find Anna and Egill's bags; Hrafn sees that their tracks enter the tunnel but do not emerge, but does not tell Vigd√≠s, and the two return to the house through another sandstorm. That night, the electricity cuts out and various other unnerving developments occur, leading up to a knock on the door. Despite √Åsa's demands, Hrafn and Vigd√≠s open it to find Anna wrapped in fishing line stolen from their car and mutilated, primarily by the removal of her fingers and tongue, blinded and deafened. She bears a message which appears to be an attempt by Egill to ask for help. Early on the fourth day, Hrafn and Vigd√≠s set off to look for Egill. The narrative perspective shifts to Hrafn and as he becomes increasingly confused or indeed deranged, it becomes increasingly unclear to the reader how reliable the account is. It is implied that Hrafn either is or starts to believe himself responsible for at least some of the violence that has taken place. Hrafn and Vigd√≠s become separated during an increasingly confused sequence, and Hrafn returns to the house and for the first time tries to explore the basement; the sequence ends with what appears to Hrafn's mental return to a childhood trauma. The novel closes with a confused account of Vigd√≠s being discovered wandering naked in the highlands, the police investigating events at the 'house', and Vigd√≠s's hospitalisation. Yet it also appears at this stage that the house was in fact a large rock; 'thereupon the reader has to wonder whether everything that goes on in between [the car-crash and the ending] was only hallucinations, triggered by the consumption of alcohol and drugs, but above all by the powerful impulse to self-destruction which the four young people experience'.: \\"√æ√° hl√Ωtur lesandi a√∞ velta fyrir s√©r hvort allt √æa√∞ sem √° milli fer hafi a√∞eins veri√∞ ofskynjanir, kalla√∞ar fram af neyslu √°fengis og eiturlyfja, en √æ√≥ umfram allt hinni r√≠ku sj√°lfsey√∞ingarhv√∂t sem ungmennin fj√∂gur b√∫a yfir\\" Form and themes The novel is written in the third person. It contains a map of the region where the novel is set (p. 6) and a reproduction of Seb Patane's 'Four Generations' (p. 182). It is divided into four sections: 'Ey√∞im√∂rkin' ('the desert', 12 chapters), '√ûa√∞ hefur enga s√°l' ('it has no soul', 12 chapters), 'H√∫si√∞' ('the house', 11 chapters), and 'N√°tt√∫ra' ('nature', 1 chapter). The narratorial perspective shifts from one character to another, explicitly labelling from whose perspective each sequence of chapters is presented. The novel has been understood as a self-conscious Icelandicisation of the American genre of the horror story, showing the influence of, amongst others, H. P. Lovecraft, and making subtle use of traditional Icelandic folklore. Thus, for example, Vigd√≠s fulfils the trope of the final girl, while the fact that the house is in fact a rock recalls the homes of trolls and elves in Icelandic folklore, as does the name of √Åsa herself. The novel prominently addresses the power of the natural world in Iceland, and the lack of understanding and respect of the characters for it; Icelandic culture at the height of the early twenty-first century boom; and characters' psychology.

Biography  Mario Mendoza Zambrano was born in 1964 in Bogot√°, Colombia. He studied at Colegio Refous and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√°, where he earned an MA in Latin American Literature. Later, he was Professor of Literature at the same university where he studied. He went to Toledo to attend courses of Spanish American literature, and also went to Israel where he lived in Hof Ashkelon. It was after this trip, upon returning home, that his work began to be published in Colombian magazines and newspapers. During fall of 1997, he worked at James Madison University in Virginia, US.Biograf√≠a de Mario Mendoza After graduation in 1980, Mendoza commenced his literary career by combining writing with teaching and collaborating with various cultural print media, such as Journal Bac√°nika and El Tiempo Newspaper. He has taught literature for over ten years. Thanks to his novel Satan√°s, Mendoza won the Seix Barral Premio Biblioteca Breve in 2002. He is one of the most renowned Latin American writers today.  About his work  Through the images described in several of his texts, Mendoza recreates Bogot√°, a city that hardly anyone has dared to sketch. This is firstly introduced in La Ciudad de los Umbrales, published in 1992. In this novel he starts to show the image of Bogot√° as the \\"transvestite city\\". A concept he only thoroughly explained later on, at a discussion held at the Luis Angel Arango Library in May 2004. Now, the city that reveals Mario Mendoza in the triptych [Scorpio City (1998), El Relato de un Asesino (2001) and Satan√°s (2002)] is a dark muse whose beauty is dark because it condenses the infernal and the sacred, the criminal and the virtuous, the disgusting and the desirable, the painful and the pleasant. A late-century metropolis, which has the strange case of Harry Jekyll and Edward Hyde, as she has multiplicity of overlapping facets in constant tension; she is a seductive monster whose essence is not possible to determine. Whether she came \\"deep down from heaven or emerged from the abyss.\\" \\"Through agile and concise prose, Mendoza achieves a milestone in his own narrative universe; a universe in which it is possible to find beauty in the ugly and disgusting, without trying to cover it up with facile catharsis. Since writing proposes a hyper visceral aesthetic, which fears do not travel intricate regions of the human psyche, or skirting the limits of madness.\\"Abello Onofre Carolina. A Gothic Revival in Bogota's sensitivity of the twentieth century: a tour of three imaginary horror novels of Mario Mendoza Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot√°: 2006 Pages:. 80, 81. Mendoza lives taking the pulse of the city,. He has been a literary spokesman for the city of Bogot√° for over 20 years. In his novels, it can can be traced neighborhoods, bridges, schools, streets, universities, parks and the changes that the Colombian Capital has been experiencing during these decades.Mario Mendoza was in the Calarc√° institute. Retrieved November 24, 2011 Thus, this Bogota author noted for his interest in creating resistance, not with a guild of fans of his literary work but apparently by forming activist fighters like him, through their writings. Thus, literature, as resistance to the injustices of the system, accounts for that social reality and openly expose them to society. Eventually the work of Mendoza is on track to be recognized as a valuable work related to the Colombian urban literature, especially in regard to the representation of the city of Bogot√° in Colombian writings.Alvaro A.

Taxonomists have difficulty placing this moth within an existing superfamily. The species is currently regarded as endemic to New Zealand. Only ten specimens have ever been found and none since 1959; it is classified as \\"Data Deficient\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy and etymology  Illustrated by George Vernon Hudson in his 1928 Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand Titanomis is considered an enigmatic unplaced genus and may require its own family. The genus and species were first described by Edward Meyrick in 1888 using a specimen collected by George Hudson. The location of collection of that specimen was unclear as a result an error made by Meyrick. Hudson, in his 1928 book The Moths and Butterflies of New Zealand, discussed and illustrated this species. There he recorded the holotype being caught in 1882 in Nelson. However the label written by Meyrick stated that the holotype was collected by Hudson on 10 May 1885 in Wellington. John S. Dugdale, in his Annotated Catalogue of New Zealand Lepidoptera, accepted that the type locality of the species was Nelson. The error arose as Meyrick confused the details of the capture of the holotype with the details of its shipment to the United Kingdom. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. The genus name is derived from Titan, meaning giant, and anomis, meaning anomalous. It refers to the size and unusual morphology of the group in which the species was originally placed. The epithet is derived from sisyrota, meaning wearing a shaggy garment, and refers to the hairs on the inner margin of the hindwings.  Description  Meyrick described the species as follows: The appearance of this moth may give clues as to its preferred habitat. It has been hypothesised that the whitish border of the wings assists the camouflage of the moth against mottled bark, indicating a possible preference for forest habitat.  Distribution  Waipapa Dam The species is currently accepted as endemic to New Zealand. However this is an extremely rare species with only 10 reliable records. Based on this irregular pattern of occurrences it has been hypothesised that the species may be a sporadic immigrant. It has been found in the Waikato, Taupo, Wellington, Nelson, Marlborough, Westland and Southland areas. The earliest capture recorded was at Greymouth in December 1874, and other specimens were taken in Nelson at around the same time. Other than the type specimen mentioned above, specimens were also collected in Blenheim in 1883, in Otaki in 1886, again in Nelson in 1898, in Haldane in Southland in 1900, and in Rangataua in 1921. The last collection of this species took place at Waipapa Dam in 1959. Biology and behaviour Very little is known of the biology of this species. The adults are on the wing from December until March. They are attracted to light with at least two specimens collected in living rooms and another at the flood lights of Waipapa Dam. It has been hypothesised, based on the living room collections, that the adult moth may be more attracted to weaker or less ultraviolet light sources.  Host species and habitat  The host niche is unknown however based on the morphology of the species it has been hypothesised that the host may be woody branches or stems of living plants, rotten wood, or even a bracket fungus, as females likely insert their eggs into the larval host. Beech forest habitat had been located near where many of the specimens have been taken. It has also been hypothesised that larvae of the moth may be associated with rotten podocarp wood as all the collection localities are close to valley floor kahikatea and matai forest. The 1959 collection of this species also occurred near a kanuka forest. It has been hypothesised that this species may be associated with wetland habit. The basis for this theory is that the females of this species come to light more frequently than the males and are therefore more likely to feed on scattered food sources. Species that have this attribute include those that prefer wetland habitat.  Conservation status  This species has been classified as having the \\"Data Deficient\\" conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Unfortunately there has been no record of capture of this species for over 50 years and as such the species is regarded by some as possibly extinct. However other experts regard extinction as not yet proven given the few New Zealand lepidopterists collecting specimens and searching for this species.

Production Filmmaker Darren Wilson, director of Father of Lights, Finger of God and Furious Love set out to make a movie that was completely inspired by the Holy Spirit. With no set plan, Wilson relied completely on spiritual guidance to lead him wherever the adventure is. He and his team journeyed around the world in search of nature and evidence of the Holy Spirit and to explore the role of the Holy Spirit in art, ministry and Christian life. The filmmakers had sought $200 thousand in financing through Kickstarter and exceeding their goal. The funding campaign began on April 18 2014 and within 24 hours had raised $77 thousand. Within 48 hours they had reached $100 thousand, and in five days time, had exceeded $125 thousand. By June 1 2014 the project had received $357 thousand. The film did not rely on a shooting script. Director Wilson \\"was interested in letting the film build organically instead of having a rigidly pre-determined structure or set interviews.\\" Production ended up with footage enough for two films. Based upon having so much footage, a sequel, Holy Ghost Reborn, was released in late 2015. Synopsis The film consists of interviews with religious figures as well as musicians, all speaking about the ways their faith informs their work or the miracles they have witnessed. Cast Film interviewees include Meredith Andrews, Heidi Baker, Reginald 'Fieldy' Arvizu, DeVon Franklin, Jake Hamilton, Bill Johnson, Brian Johnson, R.T. Kendall, Lenny Kravitz, Banning Liebscher, Jeremy Riddle, Michael W. Smith, Phil Vischer, Kim Walker-Smith, Brian 'Head' Welch, Gary Wilson, and William P. Young, among others. Release Wanderlust Productions is partnering with Tugg, a site the allows users to request that a film be brought to their local theaters. Once the theater approves the request, users can sell tickets on a personalized \\"event page.\\" Wanderlust CEO Braden Heckman is offering the film free for theatrical viewing due to it being fully funded through Kickstarter, and is expecting that DVD sales will bring future profits. The film raising nearly $360 thousand in 45 days represents the most money raised by a faith-based film in the history of the Kickstarter platform. The film was shown at the Soul Survivor Summer Festival in the summer of 2014. Darren Wilson introduced it personally before the showing. The film was released September 6, 2014.

The program provides a useful role in society for feral cats, who would otherwise be euthanized in shelters. It is humane for both cats and rats, who through traditional extermination methods, die painful deaths through poisoning and glue traps. Instead, the rats are simply repelled by the cats' odor, and leave the site. The program was first implemented in 1999, at the Flower Mart in downtown Los Angeles. The area was plagued by rats, and the extermination methods (spraying poison) was not only making the humans sick, it did not solve the rat problem.\\"Rodenticides: Topic Fact Sheet\\" \\"National Pesticide Information Center\\" Melya Kaplan, Executive Director of Voice For The Animals Foundation, brought in sterilized feral cats, and the rat situation was brought under control.Pool, Bob. \\"Rat Patrol: Feral Cats Nip a Problem in the Flower District.\\" Los Angeles Times 28 Aug 2002.

The process begins with taking healthy feral cats from shelters and getting them neutered, microchipped, and vaccinated.

Noire on 17 May 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 8 November 2011 for Microsoft Windows; a re-release for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was released on 14 November 2017. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between the core team and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. L.A. Noire was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints from staff members. L.A. Noire was formally announced in 2005; it was heavily promoted through video trailers and press demonstrations. The game was the first to use the newly developed MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as the player is required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game. L.A. Noires open world is a recreation of 1947 Los Angeles. The development team conducted field research in Los Angeles throughout the game's development, and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information. Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed by a group of musicians and inspired by 1940s films.  Production  = Overview = alt=A close-up image of bald man, who looking up behind the camera while talking at a conference. Preliminary work on L.A. Noire began after the founding of developer Team Bondi in 2003. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, work was shared between the core team and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games. Unlike other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor's facial expressions. BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A. Noire one of the most expensive video games ever made. L.A. Noire was developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later ported to Microsoft Windows. Windows copies of the game are distributed on two DVD discs, while Xbox 360 copies are distributed on three; the PlayStation 3 version fits onto one Blu-ray Disc. A total of 16 cases‚Äîthe game's form of missions that advance the game's narrative‚Äîwere removed from the final version of the game as they would not have fit on one Blu-ray Disc; while five of these cases were later released as downloadable content, eleven cases from the departments Bunko and Burglary were completely removed. = Technical development = While most games published by Rockstar since Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis (2006) use the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of motion capture and animation software. The game also utilises Havok for the animation and physics. alt=The left side of the image shows an actor in orange clothing sitting with his arms crossed. The right side of the image shows the equivalent of actor's face as in-game animation. L.A. Noire is notable for being the first game to use the newly developed technology MotionScan, developed by Australian company Depth Analysis. MotionScan is a motion capture technology that records the face of an actor at over 1000 frames per second. This technology is crucial to the game's interrogation mechanic, which requires players to use suspects' facial reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a moving human face. Despite using 32 cameras, not all are required; Oliver Bao, head of Depth Analysis R&D;, said that the extra samples allow the team to \\"reconstruct a better 3D surface in general\\" and to \\"remove reconstruction noise a little more easily\\". Although the use of MotionScan was critically acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces, it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements. Many players considered that characters are \\"dead from the neck down\\". Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players' expectations of realism; \\"people expect to see clothes moving and the rest of the body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games,\\" he said. \\"We would have loved to have spent more time on fine-tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved,\\" said Bao. = Research and open world design = For L.A. Noire, the development team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. In a career spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, as well as the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919. alt=The left side of the image shows a hallway, of white, green and brown colouring. The right side of the image shows the equivalent of this using the in-game engine, with two characters standing at a door in the hallway. Los Angeles was extensively researched for the game. The team spent the first year of development researching Los Angeles by using newspapers and magazines, organising field research field trips, and capturing photographs. A total of 180,000 photographs were available as resources throughout development, and over 1,000 newspapers were used for research. Both the interior and exterior of multiple sets were the result of researched reference material. For example, the Barclay Hotel in Los Angeles was used as a reference point when modelling an apartment building in the game. However, some sets were originally designed, in order to meet the gameplay or the narrative script. = Character development = L.A. Noire has over twenty hours of voice work. To cast the characters, the team held secretive auditions. In the game, Aaron Staton portrayed Cole Phelps, Gil McKinney portrayed Jack Kelso, Rodney Scott portrayed Ralph Dunn, Sean McGowan portrayed Stefan Bekowsky, Michael McGrady portrayed Rusty Galloway, Adam Harrington portrayed Roy Earle, and Keith Szarabajka portrayed Herschel Biggs. Singer and model Erika Heynatz and actor Andrew Connolly also appear as Elsa Lichtmann and Captain James Donnelly, respectively. Many of Staton's Mad Men co-stars are also featured in the game, including Vincent Kartheiser, Rich Sommer, Michael Gladis, Patrick Fischler and Morgan Rusler. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. During their performances, the actors attempted to appear as realistic as possible. Director Michael Uppendahl said, \\"I try to monitor the performances to make sure we‚Äôre getting the human element that‚Äôs going to make it compelling and interesting.\\" Initially, McNamara was not keen about the casting of Staton, but Rockstar Vice President for Creativity Dan Houser convinced him into agreeing. \\"[Cole Phelps] is conflicted and has quite a bit of depth and [Staton] is great at conveying those things,\\" said McNamara. When discussing the player character change near the end of the story, from Phelps to Kelso, McNamara explained that the narrative \\"got to the point where [Phelps] couldn't really do much more, and you have to go outside the realm of being a cop to bend the rules\\". He stated that, when players performed poorly, the game was set to allow them to become a \\"rogue cop\\", in which they must defend themselves against other police officers; this feature was removed from the game during development as the team felt that it was \\"massively out of character\\". Prior to performing, Staton received a 12-page document that outlined the story, and the history of Phelps. He has said that he received the document as there wasn't enough time to read the 2,200-page script before filming began. Staton cumulatively worked on L.A. Noire for about eighteen months. He said, \\"consecutively I think I worked six months, and then for the next year here and there picking things up, adding, changing and tweaking things\\". When discussing his character, McGowan felt that Bekowsky was initially jealous of Phelps, but eventually warmed up to him. \\"Like a good older brother he'll always have his back but will never take shit from him,\\" he said. McGrady, who portrayed Rusty Galloway, said his own introverted personality helped him connect to the character. \\"I am a classic introvert but I can hold court when I need to. I think Rusty is that way too,\\" McGrady said. Harrington described Roy as \\"jaded, tough, mean, cruel, brutally honest and ... very funny\\". He took credit for all of Roy's facial expressions, but said that all of the dialogue was scripted, as opposed to ad-lib. Many characters in the game are influenced by real people and events; for example, Captain Donnelly is loosely based on both McNamara's father, and LAPD Captain Jack Donahue. Additionally, many cases that Phelps solves are based on real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case. = Music production = L.A. Noire features an original score. The game's score accompanies the gameplay, alerting players at specific times. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire also contains licensed music tracks provided by an in-game radio. Over thirty songs, from artists such as Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, feature in the game. To work on the score, the team engaged Andrew Hale and Simon Hale, as well as Woody Jackson, who had previously collaborated with the team on Red Dead Redemption (2010). Recorded at Abbey Road Studios, the score was inspired by orchestral scores from 1940s films. In addition to the original score and licensed tracks, the game also features original vocal recordings in order to create an authentic sound to suit the musical identity of the period. When The Real Tuesday Weld were commissioned to compose the original compositions, they sought vocals that could \\"evoke the period\\", ultimately falling upon Claudia Br√ºcken. Three vocal tracks were produced: \\"(I Always Kill) The Things I Love\\", \\"Guilty\\", and \\"Torched Song\\". Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich stated that Rockstar's focus on authenticity and realism inspired the composers to reflect the focus in the music. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was a flexible process \\"about setting a mood\\", as opposed to a \\"mechanical\\" process in which the music was specifically composed to fit with the time frames of the game; the composers decided to focus on the latter after the music was produced. They also attempted to compose something that felt accessible to players, avoiding exclusively focusing on swing or jazz. Andrew Hale felt that the orchestral score assisted in this.  Business  = Announcement and delays = In October 2003, Team Soho's director of The Getaway Brendan McNamara left the London company to form his own studio in his native Australia. The six-person studio, Team Bondi, immediately announced their first project, for \\"a next- generation Sony platform\\". In 2004, McNamara said that the project was wholly funded by Sony Computer Entertainment Australia. The game's title and platform was revealed in 2005: L.A. Noire was to be released exclusively to the PlayStation 3. Team Bondi described the game as a \\"detective thriller\\". In September 2006, it was announced that Rockstar Games would be handling the publishing of the game; Rockstar only referred to it as a \\"next-generation crime thriller\\", with no platforms specified. In June 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive re-confirmed the release of the PlayStation 3 version by listing the game amongst its \\"announced to date\\" titles for \\"fiscal 2008\\". A spokesperson for Take-Two later implied that the game was likely to also be released on the Xbox 360. In September 2007, Take-Two announced that the game had been delayed until their 2009 fiscal year. The March 2010 issue of Game Informer confirmed that the game would be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2010; L.A. Noire missed this release date, when Take-Two delayed the game until the first half of 2011, confident that the delay would help the game's success. This was later narrowed down to March 2011, before a final delay until 17 May 2011. = Promotion = The game was extensively marketed through video trailers and press demonstrations. For its February 2010 issue, Game Informer magazine ran a cover story on L.A. Noire. On 12 November 2010, the debut trailer was released. It depicted several scenes from the game, partly narrated by one of the characters, Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka). On 16 December 2010, the first behind-the-scenes development video for the game was released, titled \\"The Technology Behind Performance\\". It showcased the MotionScan technology used in the game, featuring interviews with the cast and development team. The second trailer was released on 24 January 2011, particularly focusing on the game's Homicide cases. A trailer released on 9 February 2011, titled \\"Orientation\\", featured the first gameplay footage of L.A. Noire. It demonstrated the game's interrogation and investigation mechanics, and exhibited the game's combat element. The game's cover art was unveiled on 23 February 2011, followed by the announcement of the game's exclusive pre-order content. Trailers for the game's exclusive pre-order cases were released on 3 March and 31 March. The game's investigation and interrogation aspects were further showcased in a gameplay trailer released on 9 March 2011, titled \\"Investigation and Interrogation\\". The game was exhibited at PAX in March 2011. An exclusive theatre presentation was displayed at the L.A. Noire booth. The third trailer was released on 8 April 2011, particularly focusing on the game's depiction of the police department's corruption in the Administrative Vice department. The final pre-launch trailer was released on 11 May 2011. Viral marketing strategies were used to market the game. The official L.A. Noire website was redesigned on 27 January 2011 to show a preview of characters and cases in the game. On 25 April 2011, L.A. Noire was honoured as an official selection at the Tribeca Film Festival, becoming the first video game to do so. Rockstar also ran a competition to win a trip to Los Angeles to attend the Festival of Film Noir Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, and play the game a month before its official release. L.A. Noire was the focus of an April 2011 episode of GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley, which featured interviews with the development team and previews of the MotionScan technology. To encourage pre- order sales of the game, Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to provide pre-order bonuses. These included the extra cases \\"A Slip of the Tongue\\" and \\"The Naked City\\", the side quest \\"The Badge Pursuit Challenge\\", and the bonus detective suits \\"The Broderick\\" and \\"The Sharpshooter\\". Rockstar Games and L.A. Noire shirts were also offered as pre-order bonuses. In addition to the pre-order bonuses, the extra case \\"The Consul's Car\\" was included in all North American copies of the PlayStation 3 version; it later became available for purchase from the PlayStation Store, and as part of The Complete Edition. On 6 June 2011, Rockstar teamed up with Mulholland Books to publish L.A. Noire: The Collected Stories, a collection of short stories from noted crime authors, all based on the L.A. Noire universe. = Staff complaints = Shortly after the launch of the game, a group of former Team Bondi employees launched a website called lanoirecredits.com, containing over 100 names which had been excluded or incorrectly listed in the official game credits. This was later followed by a series of claims and counter-claims about working hours and company managerial style during the game's development. Anonymous members of the development team publicly discussed the managerial style of the studio, the studio's staff turnover rates and the working hours and conditions associated with L.A. Noire. alt=The top image displays the original logo: \\"L.A. Noire\\", written in shiny, cursive, silver- and-black font. The bottom displays the final logo: \\"ROCKSTAR GAMES PRESENTS\\" above \\"L.A. Noire\\", which is written in a much thicker, yellow-and-black font. In July 2011, a series of confidential emails were leaked along with further comments from staff members. They claimed the emails highlight the contentious relationship between Team Bondi and Rockstar, and indicate that the two companies are unlikely to work together again. An anonymous source from the development team claimed that \\"it has been quite clear that [Rockstar] will not publish Team Bondi's next game\\", and that \\"the relationship with Rockstar has been badly damaged\\". The source claimed: > Part of the conflict between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's > frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's > management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. > It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making > Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team > Bondi management, the more they came to understand that this was a terrible > idea. Team Bondi was placed into administration in August 2011, and was wound up in October 2011. The company's assets were all bought by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, including McNamara's next game, titled Whore of the Orient. Rockstar retained the L.A. Noire intellectual property. Some Team Bondi former employees went on to work for different Rockstar studios, while some went to Kennedy Miller Mitchell. Despite the allegedly difficult relationship during development, McNamara maintains an optimistic attitude towards Rockstar. \\"I've no hard feelings about Rockstar and hopefully it doesn't have any hard feelings about us,\\" he said.

Life and career  Born in Biella, Colli graduated from liceo classico, then he started acting in some amateur dramatics and starred in two lost Super 8 films. After one year of university he decided to abandon his studies to enroll the Fersen drama school in Rome. A real life friend of Vittorio Gassman, Colli often acted alongside him, especially on stage, and he made his film debut playing a small role in the Gassman's film The Devil in Love. He then appeared in a large number of movies and TV-series, even if usually in character roles. He was a character actor who acted actively especially during the seventies. Equipped with a particularly disturbing face, Ernesto Colli always recited customized roles for him, from the crazy to the delinquent and from the possessed to the weird man; probably the films where he had a most significant part was The Pleasure Shop on 7th Avenue and in Deadly Inheritance . The last role he played was that of a porter of a stable in Rome, in the movie Pierino La Peste Alla Riscossa!, shot a few months before his death and in which he already appeared with the face and the physique excavated by disease.

They were the champions of the state championship in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014.  History  =Foundation = = No pads = *Campeonato Ga√∫cho 2008 *Campeonato Ga√∫cho 2010 The second edition of the state championship began with a convincing victory against the team of Esteio Buriers on 14 March, followed by a 26-20 win against the other team from Porto Alegre, ensuring the title of \\"Capital Division\\" the championship, still counting with a thrilling victory against the Santa Maria Soldiers with the winning touchdown being converted by Vinicius Bergmann with 2 seconds to the end of the match, which ended at 19-16. In the next stage, the semifinals, the opponent would again Esteio Buriers, which included strengthening Keke Gant, athlete of the American NCAA. A difficult match was won by 20-19, and guaranteed ticket to the final, which would be played at the home team's best campaign, Santa Cruz do Sul Chacais, reissuing the 2008 final. On 19 September, the Est√°dio dos Pl√°tanos, the day after the match against Timbo Rhinos by LBFA, the athletes of Pumpkins, even with the pains of the previous day war, held the fort attack his greatest rival, with a touchdown and Vinicius Bergmann, the 2nd quarter has secured the state championship and happy back home. =\\"Full Pads\\"= As part of the project team and the growth of the sport in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in 2010 the team made the effort to buy his first equipment, aiming at the participation of LBFA 2010, the first edition of the National Football League. Despite the difficulties and lack of support, the athletes of the team were able to purchase enough helmets and shoulder pads so they could on August 28 debut not only in the league but also host the first match of the Sport as it should be practiced. The adversary was at the time Barig√ºi Crocodiles, which would be in December, champion of \\"Southern Conference\\" of LBFA and vice Brazilian champion. Despite the 26-07 defeat by the team made history when, in the 2nd quarter of the starting Running Back Jamal, shirt 23, breached the lines of defense of Paran√° team and scored the first touchdown in the history of American Football gaucho. Although the team's participation in the tournament has not done justice to the story of successes and victories of Pumpkins, this paved way for the growth of the sport, prompting other teams to equip. In 2011, the most classic of sports in the Rio Grande was repeated for the first time by a national competition and equipped as the Santa Cruz do Sul Chacais also joined LBFA for the season, the Pumpkins contest for second time . Competi√ß√µes Until the 2010 season, the team played in the Campeonato Ga√∫cho de Futebol Americano, in the form \\"nopads\\", however, with the migration to the modality that uses the equipment, the Pumpkins left the competition that followed the old way.

December 17, 2011) was a 13-year-old girl from Salisbury, North Carolina, who disappeared mysteriously in 2011. On July 30, 2013, Erica's brother Jamie reported to police she was missing and that he had not seen her since November 2011, stating their parents \\"killed Erica and buried her in our back yard\\", but later retracted this. Erica had been adopted at birth and raised by Sandy and Casey Parsons, relatives of her biological mother. When questioned by police, the Parsonses claimed that Erica went to live with her biological paternal grandmother. Further investigation revealed Erica had not been seen alive since her disappearance in 2011, and police could not find evidence to support the existence of the grandmother, who relatives claimed was already deceased. In 2014, Casey and Sandy Parsons were convicted of fraudulently accepting federal benefits for Erica when she was not living with them. In September 2016, Sandy Parsons led authorities to Erica's remains in Chesterfield County, South Carolina. Coroners were unable to determine the exact cause of death, but ruled the manner of death \\"homicidal violence of undetermined means\\". On February 19, 2018, a grand jury indicted Sandy and Casey Parsons in the case. Casey Parsons pleaded guilty to first degree murder on August 2, 2019 in Rowan County Superior Court. She was sentenced to life without parole. Sandy Parsons also pleaded guilty, on December 17, 2019, to \\"second-degree murder, child abuse, concealment of death and obstruction\\" and was sentenced to at least 33 years. Background Erica Lynn Parsons was born on February 24, 1998 to Carolyn Parsons. Carolyn separated from her husband, Steve, who was not the biological father, before Erica was born. Carolyn, who had three other children, felt she couldn't afford to care for Erica and sought alternative placement for her, stating she didn't want the child to grow up in foster care or homeless shelters as she had. Erica was taken in by Sandy and Casey Parsons, the brother and sister-in-law, respectively, of Carolyn Parsons' husband. The adoption was finalized in 2000. Carolyn Parsons had occasional visits with Erica and last saw her in January 2011. Erica's biological father, Billy Dean Goodman, died of natural causes in 2016. Erica had a slight hearing impairment. She was homeschooled most of her school years. Investigation On July 30, 2013, Erica's then 19-year-old brother, Jamie Parsons, had a fight with his parents, whereupon he reported Erica missing. He said he had not seen his adoptive sister in almost two years. He told police that Erica had been abused, and that he believed his parents had killed Erica, burying her in their backyard. He later retracted those statements, although he later testified at his parents' trial that there had been ongoing abuse. Jamie testified that the last time he saw Erica was November 19, 2011. She was standing in a corner, which was a common punishment Erica endured. \\"She didn't look too good ‚Äì she looked like a zombie\\", he said. \\"She said she did not feel good. She said she could not breathe too good.\\" Casey Parsons heard this and told her \\"to shut the fuck up\\". When he awoke the next morning, his parents had left early, which was unusual, and Erica was gone. His parents returned to the home without Erica and he felt something wasn't right; \\"Mama looked normal\\", he said. \\"Daddy looked sick, like he was about to throw up\\", James Parsons testified. \\"Mama went on her recliner with the computer. Daddy, it was a blank stare.\\" When asked where Erica was, they told Jamie that Erica had gone to live with her biological grandmother. Police began an investigation into Erica's disappearance. Casey and Sandy Parsons claimed that Erica was with her biological paternal grandmother Irene \\"Nan\\" Goodman in Asheville, North Carolina, a woman they claim to have first made contact with in July 2011 after Goodman wanted to forge a relationship with her granddaughter. Investigators have found no evidence of her existence. Billy Goodman's mother, Cloie Goodman, died in 2005. Before his death, Billy said that there was no Irene Goodman in his family. Casey Parsons described Erica and Goodman meeting at a McDonald's in Mooresville, North Carolina in September 2011, followed by several further visits. On one of those visits in December 2011, Casey Parsons said, Erica asked to stay with her grandmother permanently. In February 2012, shortly before Erica's 14th birthday, Casey Parsons says, she talked with Erica by telephone for the last time, as further calls reached a disconnected number. Casey told Dr. Phil McGraw on his show that she has since lost the phone number she used. Sandy and Casey Parsons appeared on the Dr. Phil show on August 20 and 21, 2013. Casey Parsons told Dr. Phil that Erica took none of her personal belongings with her because when she went to stay with Goodman, they had purchased all new clothing for her to wear. When Goodman picked her up, a woman who goes by the nickname \\"Strawberry\\" was also there and showed them a stash of clothing with tags in the back of their van. The house where she was reportedly staying had a stable with horses. The Parsonses claimed that they also took their other daughter, Brook, along with them, to take Erica to Asheville. Brook disputed the claim in her own interviews with police, saying she never rode to Asheville to take Erica to live there. =Abuse allegations= A number of witnesses testified at the Parsons' trial that Erica was routinely abused by the Parsons family, in particular by her adoptive mom, Casey. Casey Parsons's sister, Robin Ashley, testified that Casey beat Erica, often making her stand in the corner. Photographs of Erica standing in the corner on five occasions were presented to the court. Ashley testified that she saw bruises and marks on Erica, and that Casey relinquished the child to Ashley's custody for several months so that Casey \\"wouldn't kill her\\". Parsons took her back fearing she would get in trouble for receiving money for a child who was not in her home. Warrants showed the couple continued to cash checks when Erica was not living with them. Jamie Parsons testified that nearly everyone in the family had abused Erica routinely, something that Casey encouraged. According to Jamie, Casey would often bend Erica's fingers backwards to break them, but deny her medical assistance, instead making homemade casts. Jamie also testified that Erica was forced to live in a closet and would be locked inside for hours at a time and was beaten when she relieved herself in the closet. She was also reportedly forced to eat canned dog food. Jamie testified that Erica's adoptive father, Sandy, would often get mad and punch Erica on her head. Soon after Erica was reported missing, Sandy and Casey Parsons hired an attorney, believing they were suspects. Investigators found red stains in the house but have not said what tests showed about them. =Related federal charges= On July 30, 2014, Sandy and Casey Parsons were arrested in Fayetteville on federal fraud charges. The couple had been receiving monthly checks of $634 for adoption assistance and continued cashing those checks after Erica was no longer living with them. They also continued to claim Erica on their taxes. Casey Parsons pleaded guilty to 15 charges, while Sandy opted for a trial. A jury found Sandy Parsons guilty on most of the charges in October 2014. At a sentencing hearing in federal court on February 18, 2015, Jamie Parsons and Robin Ashley testified about abuse Erica received at the hands of the Parsons family. Federal prosecutor Anand Ramaswamy said there was no record of Erica during the time her adoptive parents illegally accepted money, claiming, \\"The reason is she's no longer alive.\\" The hearing was continued until March 27. Prosecutors also presented evidence of a series of scams allegedly perpetuated by Casey Parsons. In 2000, Casey was hired to be a surrogate mother. She became pregnant and took a payment of $10,000 for her services. Weeks later, she called the biological mother, Amy Miller, to say that she had miscarried. Miller says she believed Casey was still pregnant as Casey refused to turn over medical records, changed her phone number, and sent her \\"nasty emails\\". Casey then offered to sell the baby to her sister, Robin, who in turn searched for Miller online to tell her Casey was indeed still pregnant and that Casey had taken money from two other couples who wanted to adopt the baby. Miller was able to take custody of her child at birth after getting law enforcement involved. Evidence was also presented of an eBay scam where Casey accepted money for items listed on eBay, but never sent the items. Judge Schroeder called Casey a \\"serial swindler\\". On March 27, 2015, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder sentenced Casey Parsons to 10 years and her husband to 8 years for fraud. Schroeder \\"believes Casey was the brains behind what happened\\" and said Erica \\"endured horrific abuse\\", saying that the fraud distracted investigators from the other problems. The judge also said there was no evidence Erica was living. Federal records showed that as of July, Casey Parsons, whose release date as per her plea deal is December 11, 2023, was sent to Carswell Federal Medical Center in Texas. Sandy Parsons, whose release date is March 14, 2022, was sent to Butner Federal Prison in North Carolina. Casey Parsons was later sent to Federal Correctional Center Tallahassee. Both parents have appealed their sentences. The United States Supreme Court rejected Sandy Parsons's appeal in June 2016. =Additional information= Sandy and Casey Parsons appeared on the Dr. Phil talk show. As part of the show, Sandy Parsons took a polygraph, and was considered \\"strongly deceptive\\" by the former FBI agent who administered the test. Casey Parsons claimed to be experiencing a high level of pain, which could invalidate a polygraph, and never completed it. On August 27, 2013, Sandy and Casey Parsons moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Their two youngest biological children were removed from the home by the Department of Social Services shortly after the criminal case against them began. On January 30, 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation offered a $25,000 reward, in addition to the $10,000 offered by the sheriff, for information leading to the location of the girl. Six months later, the total reward increased to $50,000. In September 2015, an Illinois tracker dog company called K-9 Specialties came to Salisbury after being hired by local residents. On September 29, 2016, after another round of searches and questioning, Sandy Parsons led investigators to Erica's skeletal remains. They were buried in a small grave near the home of Sandy's mother on Blair Hendrick Road, between the towns of Pageland and Mount Croghan, South Carolina. Before the discovery, detectives recovered items in the search of a shed on property belonging to Sandy, including: a video tape, a hammer, teeth, and school records. Discovery of remains After talking to investigators on numerous occasions, Sandy Parsons led authorities to the remains of Erica Parsons that had been buried in Chesterfield County, South Carolina. Investigators conducted several interviews with Sandy Parsons in accordance with the warrant. According to the warrant, Sandy Parsons admitted his \\"harsh treatment\\" of Erica. \\"The treatment included, but was not limited to, locking Erica in a closet, beating her with a belt buckle, bending her fingers back and choking her\\", the warrant states. Dr. Cynthia Brown of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, characterized the treatment of Erica as \\"child torture.\\" The warrant also lays out exactly how investigators from Rowan County were able to locate Erica's remains in South Carolina. The warrant states that in August, Sandy Parsons acknowledged to Rowan County Sheriff's investigator Chad Moose that Erica was dead. Sandy Parsons described the treatment Erica received, and the disposal of her body. Sandy Parsons said that the body was discarded on December 19, 2011, and that it could be found off Taylor Chapel Road in Pageland, South Carolina, near the home of his mother. Investigators worked with Rowan County District Attorney Brandy Cook to obtain a release for Sandy Parsons to leave his prison campus so that he could lead investigators to Erica's remains. On September 20, an Order for Custody of a Federal Inmate was issued by a judge, allowing an Escort Team to take custody of Sandy Parsons and bring him from the Butner prison to Pageland so that he could \\"show the location of Erica Parsons' clandestine grave\\". The body was recovered in that location, and Sandy Parsons was returned to the prison at Butner. Autopsy results The North Carolina Office of the Medical Examiner reported that Erica died of \\"homicidal violence of undetermined means\\". According to the autopsy, Erica had many fractures in various stages of healing. Fractures were found in her nose, jaw, upper right arm, nine ribs and several vertebrae. The state of her bones also showed evidence of malnourishment. The Rowan County Sheriff received the report January 9, 2018 and began the process of determining criminal charges. Charges On February 19, 2018, a grand jury indicted both Sandy and Casey Parsons on counts of \\"first-degree murder, felony child abuse inflicting serious injury, felony concealment of death and felony obstruction of justice\\". Casey Parsons was brought to Rowan County for a court appearance on March 14, 2018, while Sandy Parsons was brought back for a court hearing on March 15. Prosecutors announced in April 2018 that they were seeking the death penalty for both Casey and Sandy Parsons. As of February 2019, defense attorneys have agreed to separate trials. Casey Parsons pleaded guilty to first degree murder on August 2, 2019 in Rowan County Superior Court and was sentenced to life without parole. The trial date for Sandy Parsons was set for April 6, 2020, and his attorney requested a change of venue. Sandy Parsons pleaded guilty to \\"second- degree murder, child abuse, concealment of death and obstruction\\" on December 17, 2019 and was sentenced to at least 33 years, to be served after his federal sentence.

It prohibited discrimination in the civilian federal workforce on the basis of gender identity and in hiring by federal contractors on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity. Provisions This executive order amended President Richard Nixon's Executive Order 11478 (1969), which originally prohibited discrimination in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, and age. It had been amended in 1998 by President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 13087 to include sexual orientation. Executive Order 13672 added \\"gender identity\\". This executive order also amended President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 Executive Order 11246, which originally punished discrimination by federal government contractors and sub-contractors on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Executive Order 13672 added \\"sexual orientation and gender identity\\". The section of this order that applies to the federal workforce is effective immediately. The changes that affect government contractors take effect once the Department of Labor provides regulations supporting them, which White House a spokesman said would occur early in 2015. Background While campaigning for the presidency in 2008, Obama had promised an executive order banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. On the basis of his campaign statement's, LGBT activists had long expected President Obama to issue an executive order prohibiting government contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In January 2012, a group of LGBT advocates made their case for an executive order to the staff of Representative Barney Frank, the principal sponsor of federal legislation, the proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), that would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment nationwide. It called an executive order an interim measure that would provide \\"a strong precedent for congressional passage of ENDA.\\" Their presentation included research from the Williams Institute at UCLA to show that many federal contractors' employees were already protected against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by corporate policy, state statute, or local law. While LGBT advocates remained guarded about the possibility that an executive would be forthcoming, some were optimistic and one even said: \\"I predict the president will sign the ENDA executive order during the next few months or, maybe, he will save it for pride month in June.\\" In March 2012, 72 Democratic members of Congress led by Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey asked the president to issue an executive order. They noted that most of the federal government's 25 largest contractors already had such policies, including all of the top five: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. Questioned about reports that President Obama was not about to release an executive order, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on April 12 that the administration was supporting ENDA, \\"a legislative solution to LGBT employment discrimination\\", a strategy he compared to the president's earlier efforts to win repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. He said: Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, called the president's position disappointing and said: \\"Given the number of employees that would be covered by this executive order, it represents a critical step forward.\\" House members reiterated their request in another letter in March 2013 with 110 signers. In April 2013, the Obama administration told LGBT advocacy groups that it was still supporting ENDA and cited growing support for the legislation in Congress. In late April 2014, Vice President Joseph Biden reiterated the administration position, but agreed there was \\"no downside\\" to issuing an executive order covering government contractors. A writer in U.S. News & World Report noted that the administration had made similar arguments about the need for Congress to legislate an increase in the minimum wage and then, in the absence of Congressional action, issued an executive order in January 2014 to raise the rate paid by government contractors. In a change of position, the White House announced on June 16, that the President planned to issue an executive order covering government contractors and that it would cover approximately 14 million workers. A columnist in Forbes wrote in response to the announcement that \\"Discrimination is a nuanced issue, tough to completely clobber with one order from above. But banning it is smart business‚Äìand Obama‚Äôs leadership on this specific issue is certainly a step in the right direction.\\" Some religious groups asked the President to add exemptions for religious groups that function as federal contractors and object to employing LGBT persons, while others opposed such exemptions, viewing them as \\"a cover for overt discrimination\\". On June 25, 160 leaders of churches, religious institutions, and organizations sent a letter to President Obama asking him to exempt them from the requirements of the anticipated executive order. Without \\"a variety of views on the merits of such an executive order\\", they suggested language to be included in the order to allow them to maintain \\"staffing practices consistent with their deep religious convictions as they partner with the federal government via contracting or subcontracting\\", specifically allow them \\"religiously grounded employee belief and conduct requirements\\" as allowed in other contexts under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Signers included Leith Anderson, President, National Association of Evangelicals; Nathan Diament, Executive Director for Public Policy, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America; Stephan Bauman, President/CEO, World Relief; John Ashmen, President, Association of Gospel Rescue Missions; and Rev. Glenn M. Coleman, Presbyterian Church USA. A similar group of 14, including some of his political supporters, wrote the President, on July 1. They reminded him that his earlier opposition to same-sex marriage was based on his religious beliefs and asked him to \\"find a way to respect diversity of opinion ... in a way that respects the dignity of all parties\\". Signers included Rev. Larry Snyders of Catholic Charities USA and Dr. Rick Warren of Saddleback Church. U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, one of the few national political figures to comment in advance of the order's release, also called for the President to include the comprehensive exemption for religious groups included in the version of ENDA that the Senate passed in November 2013. Just as the date for the release of the executive order approached, and religious exemption issue attracted increasing attention and on July 8 many LGBT advocacy groups withdrew their support for ENDA because of the religious exemptions included in the Senate version of the legislation. On July 15, a group of 69 civil rights organizations and religious groups urged the President to take a different course by not only providing no exemption for religious groups and also rescinding the exemptions for religious groups put in place by President George W. Bush in his Executive Order 13279 in 2002. It said: Organizations signing the letter included the American Jewish Committee, B'nai B'rith International, Catholics for Choice, the Hindu American Foundation, Human Rights Campaign, the Methodist Federation for Social Action, the NAACP, the National Education Association, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the National Organization for Women, People For the American Way, and the Unitarian Universalist Association. Release When signing this order, Obama said \\"America's federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people\\". He called for Congressional action to extend similar protections to all workers, noting that more states recognize same-sex marriage than prohibit discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation. By amending earlier executive orders, Obama did not create the extensive exemptions some religious groups were demanding, but left in place a narrower exemption established with respect to federal contractors in 2002 by President Bush's Executive Order 13279. That order protected the right of religious organizations engaged in social service activities to \\"the employment of individuals of a particular religion\\". It allows religious organizations, even when financed by federal contracts, to use religious belief as the basis for hiring and employment decisions. The White House signing ceremony on July 21, 2014 was attended by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, Tico Almeida, president of Freedom to Work, Rabbi David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign, Winnie Stachelberg of the Center for American Progress, and U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin Jeff Merkley, the leading proponents of ENDA in the Senate. Ten days later, Obama signed a related Executive Order 13673, \\"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces.\\" It required companies receiving federal contracts over a half-million dollars to demonstrate compliance with labor laws, including those with LGBT protections. On March 27, 2017, President Trump revoked Executive Order 13673, meaning that companies no longer must prove their compliance with labor laws to retain their federal contracts. This action indirectly weakened Executive Order 13672. Reactions In response, Roman Catholic officials expressed contrasting views. The chairs of two committees of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a joint statement: They objected in particular to the order's inclusion of gender identity, which they said \\"is predicated on the false idea that 'gender' is nothing more than a social construct or psychological reality that can be chosen at variance from one's biological sex.\\" They said its implementation would: Father Larry Snyder, president of Catholic Charities USA, said that the executive order \\"upholds already existing religious exemptions that will allow us to maintain fidelity to our deeply held religious beliefs.\\" He issued a statement that said: Michael Galligan-Stierle, president of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities (ACCU) issued a statement that said his organization: Douglas Laycock, a professor of law and religious studies at the University of Virginia, noted that the order maintained pre-existing protections for religious organizations: Jenny Yang, vice president of advocacy and policy for World Relief, which works under federal grants rather than contracts, said she was pleased that the order was limited, but worried that it might be extended in the future: Commenting on behalf of the Family Research Council (FRC), Peter Sprigg called the order and example of \\"rule by decree\\" and said: FRC President Tony Perkins echoed Spriggs' language but emphasized the issue of gender identity. He wrote that the executive order required: Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, told Todd Starnes of Fox News that: Starnes concluded a column that discussed the executive order with \\"The Obama administration seems hell-bent on forcing Christians to assimilate to the militant LGBT agenda. Resistance is futile.\\" Andrea Lafferty of the Traditional Values Coalition wrote to supporters that Obama: Few Republican members of Congress commented on the President's action. House Speaker John Boehner, when asked if he had a reaction, said: \\"Nope. The president signs a lot of executive orders.\\" Questioned again, he said: \\"Listen, the president is going to make his decisions. He can.\\" A spokesman for Exxon Mobil, a large- scale government contractor that has long refused to add sexual orientation and gender identity protection to its corporate personnel policies, announced on July 22 that it planned to comply with the executive order. Dell Inc. issued a statement supporting the president's action. Enforcement On December 3, 2014, the Department of Labor announced the text of its rule for enforcing this executive order, which takes effect 120 days following its publication in the Federal Register.

The episode originally aired on June 3, 2012, on Showcase. The episode was written by Jeff King and directed by Jon Cassar. Plot The episode opens with Kiera (Rachel Nichols) being scanned into and debriefed on her first day of work at CPS. The scene then jumps to the present where Travis Verta (Roger Cross) and Liber8 who are getting ready to travel back to their original intended destination of 2077, although Matthew Kellog (Stephen Lobo) decides to remain behind and use his knowledge of the future to try and convince people of the Government's corruption, however the other members of the group do not agree and bid farewell to their comrade. Kiera arrives at the precinct, slightly nervous and also begins to reassure herself, although she has a tense meeting with Betty Robertson (Jennifer Spence). Carlos (Victor Webster) is called into Dillon's (Brian Markinson) office to meet Sgt. Dan Barlow (Rocky Anderson) of Portland P.D. who blows Kiera's cover stating that he does not know her and that she is not who she says she is. Dillon arrests her and she is questioned in the interrogation room by Carlos. After asking if she was under arrest, Carlos informs her that she needs to be processed, causing Alec (Erik Knudsen) to explain that it means that they will run her prints and discover that she is not who she is claiming to be. Kiera informs Alec through a chatpad on the leg of her suit that she needs him to create a false ID that will fool Carlos and Dillon. Outside Dillon questions whether there is a conflict of interest regarding Kiera with Carlos, which Carlos denies. Dillon then tasks Carlos with having Kiera processed. Elsewhere, the members of Liber8 pull up outside a parking garage and attack the security guard before Lucas Ingram (Omari Newton) pulls out a sphere shaped device that releases an electronic pulse, disabling much of the city's electrical power, including the elevator that Kiera and Carlos are currently in. After Alec informs her of where Liber8 are, she apologizes to Carlos and tases him before leaving the elevator to go after Liber8 Using a frequency generator built into her suit, she unlocks a series of cars before being told by Alec to get into one of the cars that required no key to start. While at first she has trouble starting and driving the vehicle, she eventually figures it out and heads for the scene of Liber8's crime. Meanwhile Alec rushes into his house to grab breakfast and Dillon discovers Carlos handcuffed in the elevator. Soon after, Kiera arrives at the parking garage and asks the coroner what happened, to which he explains that they went in and then came out. Nearby officers take an interest in Kiera and Alec explains to her that there is a warrant out for her arrest. Alec shows here a picture of Dr. Simon Fraser (John Innes) and Kiera connects his work with rockets to the possibility of Time Travel. This leads to her attempting to get to him before Liber8, however Travis has already reached him and kidnapped him. Meanwhile, back at the station, Dillon says that Carlos needs to find Kiera as he vouched for her. Betty then comes over and reveals that a hacker hacked into the Portland P.D. database. Carlos and Betty both agree to catch the hacker and Kiera. Kiera arrives at Frasier's house to which his wife opens the door. Kiera convinces Mrs. Frasier to tell her where her husband had been taken, who reluctantly tells her that he was taken back to the University that he works at. Kiera calls up Carlos and says that she will text him with the location of the gang and also reveals that she has been working undercover in the gang. Elsewhere, Kellog is stood outside of his old house, when a girl walks out. He says that his mum used to live there, while the girl replies that they live there now. Kiera arrives at the University while Lucas places the Time Travel Device into the fusion generator, while Frasier warns him to be careful. He is hit in the head by Jasmine Garza (Luvia Petersen) who states that Lucas is a scientist. Travis asks if Lucas is done with the Doctor while Kiera arrives at the facility. She places her phone on a container and tries to contact Alec who is in the process of returning to his barn, where he sees the phone through hacked CTV and learns that she did not text Carlos the location. Kiera explains that she did not inform Carlos because she wants to go home, causing Alec to feel slightly hurt that his new friend is leaving. She sneaks up on Liber8 using her invisibility and takes Sonya (Lexa Doig) at gunpoint. She orders Travis to let Frasier go and that all she wants to do it go back with them. Liber8 agree to her terms and Lucas places the device into the generator. The resulting explosion fails to fulfill their objective and instead they are simply blasted away rather than being sent back to 2077. Kiera stands and tells the terrorists that the ceasefire is over and begins trying to kill them again. Meanwhile Carlos and his team enter the building although Liber8 see them and escape. Lucas later informs Travis that they are missing a piece of the Time Travel device. Carlos takes Kiera into custody and Frasier says that she shouldn't be arrested as she is a hero and saved him. Carlos pushes for more information on what happened inside but Fraiser refuses to divulge any more information. Kiera gets processed while Betty attempts to find the hacker and Alec attempts to create Kiera a new identity. In a flashback we see Kiera tucking her son (Sean Michael Kyer) in and promising to tuck him in the next night afterwards her husband, Greg (John Reardon) tells her that she shouldn't make promises she may not be able to keep. In the present day Kiera begins to cry at the memory. Soon, however, Dillon comes in and refers to her and Agent Cameron, which is revealed to be the new identity created for her by Alec and it places her as being part of the FBI. After thanking Alec through Dillon, Dillon asks if she wants to join his task force directed at taking Liber8 down. Carlos gives her the tour where she sees the final piece of the Time Travel Device is being logged into evidence.

On the more positive side she explained that Kiera's relationships with both Alec and Carlos were building well and called the scenes of Kiera with her son in the future \\"sweet\\" as well as noting the fact that the episode does not over do Kiera's grief over being separated from her son. The final thing she commented on was the plot twist where Matthew Kellog decided to leave Liber8 and began using his knowledge of the future to begin creating himself a fortune. Rob Kemp of Denofgeek UK gave a positive to mixed review of the episode stating that the showrunner had done a good job with making Liber8 appear as a real threat, noting specifically that \\"People die in Continuum\\" and \\"actions have real consequence\\", although he did condemn the fact that the future still has not been portrayed as terribly bad so Liber8's actions are stripped of all moral ambiguity and instead are portrayed more as selfish acts. He also noted that the writers appear to be concentrating on propelling the main story forwards and thus the small details are being sacrificed. Jen Johnson of the US Denofgeek gives a positive review, mainly noting Alec and Kiera's relationship. Chuck Franciso of Mania gave a mostly negative review of the episode, noting that of the two storylines in the episode, one is followed not enough while the other is followed tomorrow. He also states that the illusion in the moment that the main character may not make it out of a particular situation is not presented at all in within the show. He was grateful however that a member of Liber8 was not foaming at the mouth for murder, although he also expressed worry that the other members seeming love for murder could lead to them killing one of their ancestors by mistake. Randy Dankievitch of Proceeds Media gave the episode a grading of C+, stating that the episode, at times, \\"gets lost up its own ass\\", and noting that some small details such as Carlos not wondering how Kiera tased him, appear to go untouched. Tyler Olson of Crimson Tear gave a positive review of the episode, elaborating that the characters were taking on much larger roles and that the changes made worked well. However she did also note that the episode title \\"doesn't have any meaning for this episode at all\\". Overall she gave the episode a 4 out of a possible 5. KSennia Visitor of We Love TV gave the episode an 8 out of a possible score of 10 and stated that she enjoyed the episode immensely.

Horn's friend the drama critic Elsa Collin was the secretary. The objective was to counter the carefully neutral dramatic offerings by the official theatres during World War II and encourage playwrights to write drama relevant to contemporary politics. There are varying accounts of whose idea the group originally was, but Horn was the driving force behind it. Moberg was initially the president, later succeeded by the author Bertil Malmberg. The actor B√∂rje Mellvig was artistic director at one point.P. O. Qvist, B√∂rje Mellvig biography , Swedish Film Institute Swedish film database, 2004, retrieved 21 July 2014 . Horn herself took over as leader until 1958. Initially the Dramatist Studio had no fixed home, presenting plays in various locations including touring productions. It was later based at Hamngatan 28, in the former flat of the operetta prima donna Anna Norrie, where from 1950 the company presented chamber theatre as had previously been done in Germany, and in America by Orson Welles.\\"I en kammare mot Hamngatan\\", V√•r Tid, 1951, p. 18 . (The site is now occupied by an H & M and a carpark.)

The lake was created by the Norris Dam at the Cove Creek Site on the Clinch River in 1936 by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for flood control, water storage, and hydroelectric power. Norris Dam and its reservoir were the first major project taken on by the TVA. The lake, the dam, and the town of Norris, Tennessee are named for George W Norris, who was a U.S. Senator from Nebraska and who wrote the legislation that created the TVA.  History  Norris Lake was created by the Norris Dam, which was the first project taken on by the TVA as part of the New Deal. Construction began in 1933 and the project was finished in March 1936. The dam cost about $36,000,000 to build. The dam is 265 feet high and extends 1,860 feet across the Clinch River. Construction of the dam also created the nearby town of Norris which was created to house the workers and their families. Norris Dam was primarily built for flood control in the area and it still serves that purpose today. The dam also provides electricity with two generating units, each unit having a generating capacity of 65.7 megawatts (a combined generating capacity of 131.4 megawatts). The power plant generated about 302 gigawatt-hours in 2007.The dam and its reservoir have a flood storage capacity of about 1,113,000 acre-feet. Norris Lake extends about 73 miles up the Clinch River and 56 miles up the Powell River from Norris Dam. It has a flood storage capacity of about 1,113,000 acre-feet, and it has about 800 miles of shoreline and 52.9 square miles (33,840 acres) of water surface. The lake has a maximum width of about 1.2 miles and a maximum depth of 210 feet, and these make it the largest lake on a tributary of the Tennessee River. As of 2011, Norris Lake has an ecological health rating of fair. The TVA has put into effect a clean water initiative to improve the cleanliness of the lake.  Hydrology  Norris Lake has an average temperature of about 55 degrees Fahrenheit in the spring, 72 degrees in the summer, 56.5 degrees in the fall, and 36 degrees in the winter. Its region receives an average rainfall of about 4.6 inches per month. The lake level is at about 1,000 feet above sea level, depending on the fluctuation of the depth of the lake, with an average input level of about 1,500 to 2,500 feet above sea level, and an average output level of about 1,000 to 1,500 feet above sea level. There is also an average water fluctuation of about 46 feet, day by day.  Geology  Norris Lake lies within the Great Valley of East Tennessee and its shoreland covers about 375 square miles around the 52.9 square miles that the reservoir covers. The main rock formations in the land are limestone and sandstone, and because of the shifting of the land of the area, they are in many of the rock formations that are cut out in the hills.  Natural History  = Fish = Most nutrients for the fish that inhabit the lake come from the Clinch and Powell Rivers because the lake has difficulty creating its own. This is the major reason that the fish population in Norris lake is not as abundant as in other lakes in the area such as Boone Lake. The lake also has advisories against the consumption of the fish because of the mercury levels in the lake. Norris lake's main fish species are the black bass, the striped bass which has a population of about 104,000, crappie which has a population of about 102,000, walleye which has a population of about 240,000, and sunfish. = Vegetation = Norris Lake has little underwater vegetation. Stumps remain underwater from the construction of the reservoir. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) has a program installed for fish attraction, and it uses old Christmas trees for most underwater vegetation for fish. The vegetation type around Norris lake is known as Appalachian oak forest. The main type of forest vegetation is oak pine which includes black jack oak, chestnut oak, post oak, scarlet oak, and southern red oak inhabiting the areas that are drier. The areas around the lake that have more moist ground include trees such as white oak, southern red oak, and black oak with short leaf pine composing much of the canopy around the lake.  Economy  The counties that surround the reservoir had a combined population of about 189,150 people in 2013. The main source of industry of the area surrounding the lake is agriculture, with the main cash crops being tobacco, corn, and hay. Other sources of income for the area are in the industries of garment, coal, timber, and nuclear power.[11] Norris Lake offers many recreational opportunities. It has several conservation lands such as Norris Dam State Park, The Cove Creek Wildlife Management Area, and Chuck Swan State Forest that offer hiking and other activities and protect undeveloped areas. The Lake is also used for activities like waterskiing, fishing, swimming, and boating.

The company was founded in January 2001. In January 2013, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and regulators for three states shut down FHTM for being a pyramid scheme. Business model Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing used multi-level marketing to recruit representatives to sell a range of retail services and products. Sign up fees ranged from $99 to $299. Representatives were paid a commission on products sold, as well as a bonus for recruiting more representatives. FHTM sold relatively low-profit margin products, and paid a commission of between 0.25% and 1% on products sold, which is extremely low compared to other multi-level marketing companies. Examples of items sold included mobile-phone services (offered through Simplexity), Dish Network television (as a third party contractor), a line of hair-care products, and others. In its marketing materials, the company emphasized its ties to well- known brands, such as AT&T;, Dish Network, and Sprint, although the company's ties were often through intermediaries, and the companies were not made aware that FHTM was using their names in such a way. In 2010 FHTM reported that about 95% of representatives made less than $3,100 a year, with 29% making nothing. History Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing co-founder Paul Orberson The company was founded in 2001 by Thomas Mills and Paul Orberson, who had both previously worked with Excel Communications. Orberson had also previously worked as a high school basketball coach. In 2010, the company paid $1 million to settle charges brought by the Montana state securities commission. The charges accused FHTM of acting as an illegal pyramid scheme by primarily compensating affiliates for recruiting other affiliates, rather than for selling products or services. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing, and as part of the agreement, FHTM was required to lower its entry fee within the state from $299 to $75. In response to that and other investigations in other states, FHTM also lowered entry fees outside of Montana to $99. As part of the settlement, FHTM disclosed that 30% of representatives made no money, and 54% of those who did make money made an average of $94 a month before costs. Following the events in Montana, several other state and federal entities began investigations. In January 2013 the company was sued by the FTC and the Attorneys General of Kentucky, Illinois, and North Carolina. The company's Kentucky offices were raided, and the company was placed in receivership. At that time the company reported having 160,000 independent representatives. The FTC's complaint alleged that the bulk of profit made by affiliates was from recruiting more affiliates, and not from sales, which is a defining trait of pyramid schemes. Orberson died December 2013 at the age of 56 or 57 from cancer. In May 2014, the company reached a settlement with the state of Kentucky and the FTC to pay US$7.75 million to former customers, and company officials were banned from future involvement in multi-level marketing, or from selling or benefiting from customer's personal information. Under the settlement, the defendants neither admit nor deny that the company was a pyramid scheme.

One day a woman accuses Piazza of being an untore (i.e. a greaser): a spreader of disease by anointing walls and furnitures with a pestiferous ointment. According to a superstitious belief held by the people, these untori were in league with the Devil, and were responsible for the spread of the pestilence. Immediately the Church and the Inquisition scapegoat the two artisans for the outbreak, and subject them to trial by torture, despite the protests of Cardinal Borromeo.

It was built in the 10th century, and it was active since the years around 1500. The castle of Soncino from outside History A set of walls around a defensive structure were built in the 10th century, in order defend the borough from the marauding Hungarians. In 1200 it was besieged several times by the armies of Milan and Brescia, and in 1283, after being destroyed by the attacks of those armies, the commune of Soncino decided to rebuild the castle. In 1312 the castle was occupied by the Cremonese army, and in 1391 by the Milanese army, using it during the war against the Venetian Republic. In the year 1426 new walls were added to raise the previous ones. The actual building When the \\"peace of Lodi\\" was declared in 1454, the borders between the Venetian Republic and Duchy of Milan were established, and the Castle passed to the Duchy of Milan. The Duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza, reinforced the walls of and around the castle,Ville e castelli d'Italia: Lombardia e laghi, second edition, by Luca Beltrami; article by Beltrami, Editors of Tecnografica, Milan, (1907), page 201-210. which led to the request for construction in 1468 to Soncino people's desire requested by letter to the Duke of Milan, although he chose to erect just a new tower with the characteristic circular shape. Further reconstruction took place from 1471 by Benedetto Ferrini and Danese Maineri, engineers responsible for the fortresses of Soncino and Romanengo. and in 1473, Bartolomeo Gadio also contributed. From 1499 to 1509, the castle was held by the Venetians, until with French aid, the fortress was again held by the Milanese. The assignment to the noble Family Stampa In 1536 the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V assigned the Milanese Stampa family the Marquisate of Soncino. This family transformed the castle into a residence commissioning frescoes by Bernardino Gatti and Vincenzo Campi for internal rooms of the castle and the chapel. In 1876 Massimiliano Stampa, last Marquis of Soncino, bequeathed the castle to the town, and the town hall in 1883, in collaboration with Luca Beltrami, began the restoration of the castle. The round tower from outside The structure The Soncino Castle is strategically positioned near the town, although the four centuries it has been used as a residency has given it a harmony with the external sides, starting from the entrance that today is positioned into urban square. The entrance of the castle, a portal, that once a time was limited by a drawbridge, it was replaced at the end of 1800 by a ravelin that give access to a first courtyard used in the past as disengagement for the troops and provided of stairs to access the battlements of the external walls. The fortress entrance was permitted by two different drawbridges, one carriageable and one pedestrian. Passing through the disengagement, after the second entrance, there is the real courtyard, and in the center of that there is a well able to guarantee the necessary water in case of siege, and from this courtyard it is possible to access to the secret's underground. Among the four towers, the most interesting is the Castellan's tower (Torre del Castellano), called in this way because once a time it was the official residence of the Castle's Governor, and for this reason it was possible to isolate it from the rest of the castle in case of sieges. That tower was connected directly to the secret's underground and from here, through a secret passage, was possible to pass through the castle's ditch and run on the fields around. Is this one of the renaissance's decoration areas, with frescos and fireplaces with pyramidal hood. The internal courtyard of the castle The chapel built by the Marquis of Stampa is located in the 16th-century south-east tower. Here is possible, still today, to see traces of frescoes including the most ancient of that (dating at the end of the 15th century), depicting the Madonna with the child Jesus Christ. Still here, it is possible to find a fresco from an anonymous painter representing the Duchy of Milan's coat-of-arms flanked by torches and water buckets, symbols the personal motto of Francesco Sforza \\"Accendo e spengo\\" (I light up and I turn off), together with others heraldic enterprises. The ceiling is painted with an arbour drawing as in the Milan's Sforza Castle. The round tower, unique on its particular shape, at the battlements level presents a round room with a circular canopy in the center that has a cylindrical column that lead to the top of the bastion that is in conical shape and significantly higher respect to the others just to give a higher watch point. This tower, built in the 1500, has traces of several coat- of-arms paintings and of a crucifixion, today in a deep degradation status. This last painting means that the chapel was placed here, in the past, and moved eventually in the other tower. Scenes of the Film \\"Ladyhawk\\", where filmed in this castle.

The game features combat vehicles from the 1950s through modern day and includes destructible environments as well as player vs. environment and player vs. player gameplay. The game was originally in development by Obsidian Entertainment, who worked on the game until being dropped in 2017. Armored Warfare is built on the free-to-play business model with in-game micro-transactions available for certain features and upgrades. The game also has the option of signing up for premium account time, which allows bonuses to progression. Armored Warfare launched into open beta in October 2015.  Background/Story  In the late 2010s, Europe has suffered a severe economic and political crisis. When two dirty nuclear bombs are detonated outside the cities of Paris and Berlin, a revolution is started that forced the world into chaos. When the crisis ends, the largest of the corporations rise to power. The story starts with the world in the late 2030's, and many hate the state of the world that it is now, and many have created or migrated into the \\"Badlands,\\" areas where the corporations have no interest or are unable to control. The world is only growing more unstable, and it is only a question of time before the world is plunged into the chaos of war once more.  Gameplay  Armored Warfare is set in a modern virtual world where the player takes on the role of a mercenary employed by a private military company. The game offers players the opportunity to participate in battles across co-op player versus environment campaigns and team-based player versus player matches in a variety of armored vehicles, main battle tanks, and long-range artillery. Players can customize their vehicles with upgrades and retrofits that affect the way the vehicles perform in-game. = Player versus player = In player versus player (PvP) gameplay, the players take control of an armored vehicle and participate in 15 vs. 15 team battles across 13 different maps.https://aw.my.com/us/about/maps In order to secure the win, a team must either eliminate all the opponents in the enemy team or successfully capture the opponent's base (standard PvP mode) or the neutral base (encounter PvP mode). The duration of the battle for both 'Standard' and 'Encounter' modes is up to 15 minutes, nevertheless, it can be shorter if any of the aforementioned team goals are achieved earlier.https://aw.my.com/us/about/armored-warfare-faq = Player versus environment = Player versus environment (PvE) missions are designed for a group of five players to fight against artificial intelligence (AI) controlled bots. Players can queue for missions individually or grouped with up to four other players in a platoon. Missions can be selected from several difficulty levels up to insane, where success depends on the vehicles the players bring, coordination between the team members and skill in the PvE arena. = Global Operations = Global operations (Global ops or Glops) is the newest gamemode, introduced in update 0.18. It features expanded, specially designed maps with special features not found in the other modes. At its core, it is a PvP mode but when dying, players can respawn. This, however, makes your team's ticket counter go down. The main objective of this mode is to get the enemy team's tickets to 0 before yours do. The main way of accomplishing this is by capturing objectives which dynamically change over time on the map. In addition to these primary objectives, there are also secondary objectives in the form of \\"wildcards\\". These range from a bomber strike that a player can call in, a UAV drone to spot the enemy or even an AC-130 gunship. = Customization = Armored Warfare offers players a wide array of vehicle and base customization options. It is possible to unlock additional vehicles and equipment as players progress through the game as well as visually customize their vehicles with camouflage patterns and paints, as well as emblems on the side of vehicles. = Progression = Unlike other games such as War Thunder and World of Tanks, vehicles are not separated in a tech tree by countries, instead, they are separated by dealers, all who specialize in a specific advantage that their vehicles provide. For example, Sophie W√∂lfli, one of the dealers available, focuses on more of a passive/defensive posture, hence why she offers a variety of American and German main battle tanks, many of which are heavily armored, and very mobile, such as the M1 Abrams.  Reception  =Awards= The game received the \\"Best Multiplayer\\" award from TenTonHammer's Best of E3 Awards 2014.

Charlton married Hannah Elizabeth Breeze on 30 September 1850 at St. Mary, Lambeth, Surrey, and the couple emigrated to Australia. Career in Australia Charlton was elected member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Ripon, Hampden, Grenville and Polwarth in December 1853, a position he held until he resigned in September 1854.

The channel was launched on 4 August 2014 by Turner Broadcasting System as TruTV. On 12 February 2019, it was replaced by True Crime. History In May 2014, Turner Broadcasting System announced that they would launch TruTV, a separate British version of the US channel of the same name. On 13 June 2014, TruTV launched a placeholder on Freeview channel 68. On 24 July 2014, the TruTV placeholder launched on Sky channel 565. =TruTV= On 4 August 2014, TruTV was launched. In mid-December 2016, the then current owners Turner threatened to close down the channel if a last-minute funding deal could not be agreed. It cited the fact that the channel had failed to attract an audience, even with some of its biggest shows like America's Got Talent. Original commissions were a part of the channel's early plans to build upon US shows. Ian McDonough, senior vice-president and managing director of Northern Europe at Turner Broadcasting said in February 2015: \\"We want to move quite quickly with this channel, so I don‚Äôt think we'll wait too long. By year two, we want to start looking at UK commissions.\\" Due to the lack of audience, this never came to pass. On 16 February 2017, Sony Pictures Television acquired the channel from Turner. The channel continued to license its name and logo from its previous parent, which will still represent ad sales for the channel. In early 2019, the Freeview broadcast area of truTV was reduced to Greater Manchester only, via the legacy GMAN multiplex, with Sony Crime Channel moving to the Comux slot, and True Entertainment moving from its original allocation (which was unavailable in Wales) to the prior Sony Crime berth (truTV's pre-2018 position). The Turner-owned truTV name in the UK was closed on 12 February 2019 and was replaced by True Crime.[\\"TV Mag\\" (The Sun), issue date 9‚Äì15 February 2019 (published 2019-02-09] Local-TV simulcasts On 25 May 2017, TruTV began broadcasting on Freeview in two daily programming blocks on the Made Television network of channels, as part of a programming supply agreement. The eight stations in the Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Mold and Tyne and Wear areas simulcast TruTV every day from 13.00 to 17.00 and 21.00 to 01.00 (20.00 - 24.00 on Tuesdays to accommodate America's Got Talent).Made Television reveals all-new summer line up , Made Television, 25 May 2017TruTV on Made , Made Television, 25 May 2017 This, however, has since been replaced by a supply agreement with CBS Reality in November 2017. =Programming= Most of TruTV's programming originally aired in the USA. Programming ranges from TruTV programming, such as I, Detective and Bait Car to factual reality programming such as Hardcore Pawn and Container Wars, as well as programmes such as Fear Factor and Conan. Unlike its US counterpart which relaunched in October 2014 with a new focus on humour while retaining its reality format and a revamped logo, the British version never followed suit. In March 2015, it was announced that the channel would broadcast RuPaul's Drag Race. Season 4 started airing in June 2015. As a result, Conan was moved to the later time of 01.00, rather than airing in its original slot of 23.00. On 9 April 2015, TruTV began airing Branson Famous. On 9 June 2015, it was announced that TruTV would become the UK home of America's Got Talent, taking over from ITV2. It will start airing the tenth season later in the summer. In November and December 2016, TruTV began airing Adult Swim shows, such as Mr. Pickles, Robot Chicken and Rick and Morty, on Fridays from 23.00.

On 15 March 2017, TruTV +1 timeshares with TruTV to be broadcasting from 4am to 5am, The +1 service still broadcasts 24 hours a day on other platforms. On 6 February 2018, TruTV +1 closed on Freeview to be replaced by Sony Crime Channel and its normal service will be on channel 60, with Sony Crime Channel +1 taking its old TruTV +1 channel slot on channel 69. Because of this, TruTV is now in local TV areas. On December 30, 2016, truTV+1 was temporarily removed from Sky 271, and relaunched on channel 186 on 27 June 2017. On 1 May 2018, TruTV+1 moved from Sky channel 186 to Sky channel 280. On 19 June 2018, TruTV+1 returned to Freeview on channel 92 in Manchester only service, but moved to channel 69 on 4 July 2018.

The band formed in March 1966 and was called Neville Whitmill and the Humans. Founder members Nol, Neville, Derek and Keith rehearsed daily for 6 months composing new songs and covers before contracting their first professional gig at the Clifton Hotel. Nol Klinkhamer hailed from the Conservetoire of Music in Holland having a degree in Jazz played piano, organ and the vibraphone. Neville Whitmill a Soul singer from Cape Town had influences from Buddy Holly, Ray Charles, Ottis Redding, Marvin Gaye. Derek Marks from Cape Town enjoyed rock bass playing with influences from bands like The Beatles, Small faces, Dave Clark 5 and Keith Moffat from Cape Town also enjoy playing Rock music. During the rehearsal stage they landed a gig at the \\"Stables nite Club\\" in Church Street Cape Town which gave them a venue to hone and perfect their craft. The venue was usually packed to capacity to hear the band. At this time the band decided to record their music and in August 1966 met Ian Martin (recording engineer) and Lindsay du Plessis (owner) of A.V.S studios Bree Street CT. It was at this time that a name change was much needed. During a studio break the four got together to thrash out names and it was Nol Klinhamer who suggested \\"The Square Set\\". The band combined soul vocals and jazz organ (with the Hammond organ growing in popularity at the time) with rock bass and drums. The Hammond sound can be heard on most of The Square Set songs. The previously unreleased 'Silence Is Golden' had a makeover with Graham Beggs at the helm and was released on Gallos Continental label in or about March 1967. It reached number 1 on the Springbok radio charts around July 1967. This led to the release of the band's first full album, 'Silence Is Golden'. 'That's What I Want', a song first recorded by UK group The Marauders in 1963, was also recorded by The Ronnie Singer Sound, a Cape Town band Marks had previously worked with. The latter version was given to The Square Set to record. The song was changed to accommodate the lineup and added to the 'Silence Is Golden' album. This song was later released in South America on the Decca label and rose to number 1 in Brazil, Argentina 1971 and number 1 in Portugal in 1972. The band went on to record a follow-up album, Loving You is Sweeter than Ever, with the original members, but then the band took a break. Nol Klinkhamer went to study jazz at Berklee college of music in California, after which Nol Klinkhamer and Neville Whitmill were joined by Johnny Boshoff and Tony Moore on Bass and drums to record Those Many Feelings in 1972, an album influenced by contemporary jazz rock musicians like Michael Colombier.

The school is situated in the neighborhood Midtbyen, in the Latin Quarter, bounded by the streets Mejlgade, Kystvejen and Skolegyde. Aarhus Katedralskole offers the 3 year Matriculation examination (STX) programme with elective subjects in the natural sciences, social sciences and arts. The school is an independent self-owning institution financed by the Danish state with about 800 students divided across 30 classes.  History  Aarhus Katedralskole was founded in at least 1195 and has continuously worked as a school until present. The exact date of foundation is not known but on 9 February 1195, the bishop of Aarhus, Peder Vognsen, donated his books to the Aarhus Cathedral. The cathedral itself was first completed in 1300, but construction of it begun around at the same time. During the reformation the school was confiscated by the Crown and from 1 January 1986 ownership was transferred to Aarhus County. When the Danish counties were abolished in 2007, the school became independent and self- owning. Until Den videnskabelige Realskole in 1839-1853 and later Marselisborg School in 1898, Aarhus Katedralskole was the only place of higher learning in Aarhus. In 1996, the school buildings were, with a few exceptions, listed and protected by law. The yellow rector building from 1800. It was annexed by the school in 1957. The former cathedral student Morten B√∏rup was rector of the school from 1491-1520, Ole R√∏mer graduated here in 1662, and Grundtvig was a student in 1798-1800. = Buildings = The first buildings, of which none remain, were completed in 1200 and since then multiple buildings have been added or changed through the centuries. Aarhus Katedralskole contains 4 listed buildings in total; the rector house in Mejlgade no. 6 from 1808 and three buildings colloquially referred to by their exterior colors. The rector building is Classicist with references to the style as it was used in Copenhagen. The white building from 1763 by Christian Jensen M√∏rup was originally designed in a classicist style but was later extensively remodeled in a Neoclassical appearance. The red building 1903-05 by Hack Kampmann is in the Art Nouveau style while the grey building from 1956-57 by C.F. M√∏ller is modernistic, minimalistic and functionalist and bears some similarity to the City Hall.  Notable graduates  A relief in memory of Ole R√∏mer, graduate of 1662.

Biography  He was born in Warsaw in 1924. After the death of his mother and his father's expulsion from Poland, he was raised by his grandmother. His grandmother took him to Janusz Korczak's orphanage, where he lived for a number of years. It was at the orphanage, where he received his first harmonica from Dr. Korzack. Gogol eventually fled Warsaw during the war, and after spending time hiding in various places, including with his family in Mak√≥w Mazowiecki, he was captured and deported to Auschwitz. His harmonica was seized immediately upon arrival, but he eventually traded his rations to another prisoner for the prisoner's harmonica. Soon after, a Nazi heard him playing and he was forced to join the Auschwitz Orchestra, playing while Jews were entering into the gas chambers. While he played, Gogol saw his own family members being sent to the chambers, so he stopped opening his eyes when he played. He also vowed that if he survived he would teach Jewish children how to play the harmonica. This story was recounted in a sermon for Kol Nidre at Congregation Habonim Toronto. After the war, Gogol moved to Israel where he founded the Ramat Gan Harmonica Orchestra, which was later named after him. In 1990, Gogol returned to Auschwitz for the first time, where he performed with the band the song \\"My Town Belz\\" (Yiddish: \\"My Shtetele Belz\\"), the same tune Gogol played when he was in the camp 50 years earlier, as prisoners were marched to their deaths. In 1993, Gogol again traveled to Auschwitz, and in the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin performed the same songs he had performed there as a prisoner. About a month after this trip, Gogol died, at 69 years of age.

Life On his mother's side of the family, he was related to Beethoven. Although his parents originally intended for him to become a printer, they eventually gave in to his wishes and he was enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp),Biography in De levens en werken van Hollandse en Vlaamsche kunstschilders, Vol.1 by Johannes Immerzeel@ Google Books where he studied with Gustaf Wappers and Ferdinand de Braekeleer the Elder. He continued his studies in Leuven where he was influenced by the works of Ludolf Bakhuizen and Adriaen van de Velde and chose to focus on maritime scenes. His first exhibitions came in 1833. He took a trip to the North Sea in 1834, and a final study trip through the Netherlands in 1837 produced much material. Still, he was dissatisfied with what he had seen so, in 1838, he left on a long sea voyage that would take him to Gibraltar, the North African coast, Egypt, the Dardanelles, Istanbul (where he remained for several months), Asiatic Turkey and Rhodes. While in Ankara, he met and befriended his fellow Belgian painter, Florent Mols, and they continued travelling together; sailing down the Nile as far as Nubia. During these travels, he compiled two huge albums of drawings and notes that he would use for inspiration the rest of his life. In 1847, still restless, he toured Northern Germany and, in 1850, Scandinavia. In 1843, he succeeded Jean-Baptiste De Jonghe as head of the landscape painting classes at the Antwerp Academy, where some of his best-known students were Emile Claus, Frans Hens and Adriaan Jozef Heymans. Two years later, he was one of the many Belgian artists who provided illustrations for the Geschiedenis van Belgi√´ (History of Belgium) by Hendrik Conscience.

He has been a head coach since 1999, guiding several clubs in Italy and abroad to titles, also having taken charge of the Italian national team (as an assistant) and the Kazakhstan national team. Coaching career The Trieste native started his career in his home town with local clubs, as assistant coach or in charge of youth squads. In the same city he encountered Bogdan Tanjeviƒá, who would help him join the Italian national team setup as coach of the Under-17 team and assistant coach of the senior side. In that latter role he would be part of the team's run to the EuroBasket 1999 gold medal. He then moved to club coaching as head coach of Snaidero Udine in the second division Serie A2 in 1999. He led the Fruili side to the first division Serie A in his first season there, finishing seventh in the league the next year and earning a playoff spot. These performances caught the eye of Fortitudo Bologna who recruited him in 2001. With Fortitudo he would win the regular season in 2001-2002 but lost in the playoff finals. He was dismissed the next season after a run of poor results. He started the 2003-04 season at the helm of Sicilia Messina but left after 16 games due to struggles on and off the pitch for the club. The Italian then moved abroad, joining Telindus Oostende of the Belgian League the same year. He reached the Belgian Cup final and the league semifinal the same year. However he was dismissed by the Belgians in April 2005. He then spent an uneventful season with Navigo.it Teramo back in Italy, finishing the league in midtable. Boniciolli was appointed coach of Air Avellino in 2006, he helped the side win the Italian Cup in 2008, the first title in the club's history. This performance saw him awarded as the league's best coach for 2007-08. Joining Virtus Bologna the next season, he also led them a title, the European third tier 2008‚Äì09 FIBA EuroChallenge. In doing so he became the first coach since Ettore Messina to win a European title with the Bologna side. He was named head coach of Serie A and Euroleague side Lottomatica Roma in December 2009, replacing Ferdinando Gentile. Roma and Boniciolli parted ways in January 2011 despite him guiding the side to the Euroleague Top 16. Boniociolli moved to newly formed Kazakhstani side BC Astana in April 2011 to compete in both the Kazakhstani League and the VTB United League. He helped guide the Astana side to two consecutive domestic doubles (league and cup) and a VTB United League playoff appearance in only its second tournament appearance in 2013. Following his success with Astana, he was appointed to lead the Kazakhstan national team, he guided them to an 80-60 victory over Uzbekistan in May 2013 to qualify for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. With the aim of earning a place in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup at the tournament, Kazakhstan won their first three games to reach the next round, however they then lost the next six to finish in 8th place. However Astana and Boniciolli ended their contract by mutual agreement in December 2013, with the side sitting in 9th place in Group B of the VTB United League after winning the cup for the third time. In February 2015, Boniciolli returned to Fortitudo, by now in the third division Serie B, a few months the club won the playoffs to earn a promotion to the A2. On January 8, 2019, Boniciolli became new head-coach of VL Pesaro in LBA, the Italian highest basketball league.

Originally made as a mod of Valve's Portal series, it was released on July 15, 2014. The game lacks the iconic portal gun of the series and instead utilizes a newly created paint gun that fires two kinds of gel with different properties. The game features new characters and voice acting, along with a co-op mode that includes a level editor.  Gameplay  The primary tool used in the game is the paint gun which fires two kinds of gel, blue and orange. Both gels were featured in Portal 2, with the blue providing a jump boost and bouncing pad and the orange gel providing a speed boost. Unlike the stationary locations of gel in Portal 2, however, the paint gun allows the player to apply the gels to paint-enabled surfaces through the levels. The game also takes advantage of a cut part of the Portal series in Pneumatic Diversity vents/tubes, which were featured in early trailers for Portal 2. They are used in Aperture Tag to move the player from level to level in order to make the transitions faster.  Development  Eugenio Roman, the original organizer of the Aperture Tag Team, first began considering paint gun and gel concepts before the Portal 2 game was released and when the gel components of the game were announced. It was stated that the concept of paint for Portal 2 was first derived from the game Tag: The Power of Paint, whose team was hired to work on the paint aspects of Portal 2. After playing this precursor, Roman wanted to do more with the aspects of the game, especially the paint gun. The paint gun he ended up using for Aperture Tag was developed by another modder in the community. Roman asked the creator if he could use the device, was approved to do so, and made some modifications before releasing his own map utilizing it. After attending a Valve-hosted closed beta for the Perpetual Testing Initiative, Roman asked the employees if a paint gun add-on was going to be developed for Portal 2 so that it could be used in community made maps. They responded that while a weapon_paintgun file was in the game, it didn't do anything and had been dropped from the release entirely. Roman paid a visit to Valve in May 2013 and decided afterward to make Aperture Tag a full modification release and not just a series of episodic maps. The game's soundtrack was composed by Harry101UK, and Christopher McEvoy, and also included the song \\"All These Walls\\" by Abarax. Many of the tracks are remixes of tracks in the soundtrack of Portal 2.  Reception  ValveTime stated \\"[Aperture Tag] looks great, it plays well, and it last 2‚Äì3 hours. Giving it good value for money.\\" ValveTime praised the visual and level design for its gameplay mechanic and variety, level design structure, polish degree, soundtrack detail consistency and map scale without affecting performance. However, they also criticized the pacing of the story and dialog falling weak many times. PC Gamer rated the game 58 points out of 100, stating that it \\"lacks balance and grows repetitive, but provides a handful of good puzzle chambers if you're willing to pay for them.\\" A general statement by purchasers of the game in reviews on Steam have been that it has a \\"poorly written script, sub-par voice acting, and general lack of polish\\". Others, however, have largely complained about the existence at all of a $7 price tag for a licensed mod, rather than the game being free of charge.

Background In 1957, after failing to land a spot on the Ozark Jubilee, Willie Nelson moved to Fort Worth, Texas, and quit the music business for a year. He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door, and eventually became a sales manager for the Encyclopedia Americana. Returning to the music business, Nelson started to perform on the local show \\"Cowtown Hoedown\\" on KCUL.

His backing was composed of steel guitarist Bobby Penton, drummer Lonnie Campbell, bassist Johnny Smith and the Hoedown artists \\"The Reil Sisters\\" as his backing group. To pay for the session, Nelson gave Craig half of the publishing rights for \\"Man With the Blues\\".

The process identifies students at risk for droping out by examining the pupil‚Äôs: attendance, behavior and course grades. Interventions are implemented to assist at-risk pupils to remain in school. The program is funded by federal and private dollars. School safety and bullying The Ferndale Area Junior Senior High School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the District in 2013. Additionally, there were no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in thirteen incidents at the schools, with four arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the District to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Ferndale Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online.Ferndale Area School Board, Bullying/Cyberbullying Policy 249, November 12, 2008 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Grants =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Ferndale Area School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, the District received $99,141. The district received another $45,413 in 2008-09, for a total of $144,554. Among the public school districts in Cambria County, the highest award was given to Greater Johnstown School District which received $463,166. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. =Project 720= Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth‚Äôs high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High school‚Äôs applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Ferndale Area School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $231,000 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell.

Opened in 1900, it quickly grew to be Huntsville's largest cotton mill in the first quarter of the 20th century. After closing in 1955, the mills were converted to office space that was used by the U.S. space program. Two of the older production buildings burned in 1980, but one main building and numerous houses built for workers remain. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History The Lincoln Mill began in 1900 as an entirely locally funded concern. One of the investors was Trevanian Dallas, founder of the adjacent Dallas Mill. Named the Madison Spinning Company, the original building was built on Oakwood Avenue. The mill required more capital to continue operating by 1903, and outside investors were brought in, including William Lincoln Barrell. Despite the extra cash, the mill closed in 1906. It reopened in 1908 under the name Abingdon Mills. Abingdon constructed a new mill building in 1915, and an addition to it in 1916. The mill was expanded again in 1918, with a two-story addition to the twisting mill, bringing capacity to 28,080 spindles and 476 looms. 47 houses and the village's first school were also built. Despite the extra capacity, Abingdon went bankrupt in 1918. Barrell bought the company at auction, and production resumed later that year under the name Lincoln Mill. The next decade saw vast expansion of the mill and village. The company began constructing 40 more duplexes and apartment buildings north of Oakwood Avenue, on a tight grid pattern of streets which became known as Lincoln Village. A new mill building, costing $2 million and containing 750,000 square feet (70,000 sq. m.), was built in 1923‚Äì24. A one-story dye house quickly followed, and the mill employed 1,000 workers and operated 102,000 spindles. 600 additional houses and apartments were built to serve the expanded workforce. Another expansion in 1927 included more units for Mill No. 3 and 500 houses and apartments south of the mill. The expansion brought the operation to its highest capacity of 120,000 spindles, 1,200 looms, and 2,000 employees. In 1928, a mill store and community center were built, followed the next year by a larger school. Production slowed during the Great Depression, and ground to a halt in 1934. From July 17 until September 22, 1934, a strike by the United Textile Workers of America brought violence to Huntsville. Although business rebounded during World War II, no further expansions of the mill or village were made. In 1953, longtime superintendent Phillip W. Peeler retired, and the new management clashed often with the union. Another strike in 1955 turned violent, and lawsuits reached the Supreme Court, but were not heard before the mill closed. The mill buildings were converted to offices, some of which were used by the space industry; the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle was designed in the mill by Brown Engineering. The oldest two mills, along Oakwood Avenue, were destroyed by fire in February 1980. The remaining Mill No. 3 has been renovated to house a variety of tenants, including offices, a microbrewery, loft apartments, and a school focusing on children with learning disabilities. The remodeling focuses on using sustainable practices. Architecture The only surviving production structures are Mill No. 3 and the adjoining dye house, both built in 1924. Both buildings are of reinforced concrete which was cast in place. The defining feature of the buildings are floor-to-ceiling multi-pane windows with steel muntins. The Lincoln School, built in 1929 and separately listed on the National Register in 1982, echos this design, with large bays of windows separated by thick, concrete pilasters, although it contains more decorative details. The company store, today used as a theater and antique shop, retains the same proportions but has more conventional windows along with street-level storefronts. The remaining structures in the district are all residential. Most prominent is the two-story, Colonial Revival Superintendent's House along Meridian Street, that has been renovated as offices for an adjacent auto repair shop. The majority of the workers houses are duplexes, although there are also twelve extant apartment buildings and a handful of single-family homes. The majority follow the Type M plan, of a one-story, hipped roof duplex that is two rooms deep. The double entries are covered with a shed roofed porch. The apartments follow the Type M style, but have multiple units attached to one another, and separate, gable roof porches. Other styles include Type B, a rectangular, gable roofed plan with closely spaced entrance doors; Type D, a one-story plan with a central chimney and steeper gable roof; Type E, an L-shaped structure with a shed porch on the front; and Type H, a -story single-family design with a gable roof and shed roof dormer. Though mostly undecorated, the houses do show some basic Craftsman detail, such as exposed wood rafter ends. All houses are of wood- frame construction covered in stucco.

The program ‚Äì airing daily on the former two stations at 5:00 and 9:00 p.m. Central Time and on the latter two at 10:00 p.m. local time (Eastern Time in Miami, and Central in Houston) ‚Äì used a long-form format similar to a newsreel, with all stories presented primarily through video footage filmed by photojournalists employed by both stations and filed from affiliate news video services; it was targeted at a younger demographic (specifically those aged 12 to 34) that may receive news through online and other digital services rather than through television. On September 6, 2018, Tribune announced that the Dallas and Houston editions of the program would be cancelled effective September 14. Format The newscasts ‚Äì which are respectively produced by KIAH and WSFL, although the editions on KIAH and KDAF are structured as two separate programs featuring stories focused on the respective Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth markets ‚Äì de- emphasizes the use of news anchors to present the stories featured during the broadcast, opting to instead use footage involving the story with illustration on the story being reported through narration, intending to mirror how news video is delivered through the Internet in some respects. Other differences in presentation include the use of a world map augmented with markers resembling mobile app icons to identify the location and to serve as a toss to each story segment (which is referenced with a brief headline-style description under the icon marker), the use of contemporary music (instead of custom or pre-packaged theme music) for the program's theme music and the substitution of teases before breaks in favor of the aforementioned visual tags to indicate segments and stories set to air. The narrators for NewsFix are Greg Onofrio (for the weeknight editions) and Dennis Jon Bailey (for the weekend editions), who also deliver a commentary segment at the end of each broadcast. NewsFix maintains a faster-paced format than conventional television newscasts, incorporating an average of 33 segments per broadcast, about half of which focus on local stories. The program also incorporates a short weather segment (limited to current weather observations and a five-day forecast) and a sports segment (consisting mainly of scores, omitting highlights or game commentary), as well as features such as \\"Crime Bureau\\" (formatted similarly to a police blotter with photos of criminals on the run), \\"Day in Pictures\\" (featuring photographs of news stories and happenings in each city) and a historical music segment, \\"Day in Music\\". Background =Origins= At the time the concept was being developed, KIAH (channel 39) carried more traditional early evening and prime time newscasts, which regularly fell behind newscasts on most of its main English and Spanish station competitors ‚Äì particularly in the 9:00 p.m. time slot against the longer-established prime time newscast on Fox owned-and- operated station KRIV (channel 26) ‚Äì since the station launched its news department in January 2000 (then as WB affiliate KHWB). By September 30, 2009, KIAH had expanded its news programming to include an hour-long early evening newscast, with (later aborted) plans to launch a weekday morning newscast earlier that year. The idea for the program was conceived by Tribune Company chief innovation officer Lee Abrams (who resigned in October following complaints surrounding an inappropriate company-wide e-mail) in collaboration with KIAH news executive producer and Imaginator Gary Jaffe, as an alternative to newscasts Abrams deemed to follow \\"the 1970s television playbook\\". The Houston outlet would serve as the pilot station for the format to be named NewsFix, described by then-KIAH general manager Roger Bare in an interview with TVSpy as \\"a newsreel updated for the 21st century,\\" which would only utilize an off-camera narrator to provide continuity for story and segment packages, requiring a far smaller staff to produce the broadcasts compared to traditional local news programs. As a byproduct of not using on-air anchors and reporters, it was designed to eliminate the \\"happy talk\\" segments between news blocks to devote more time to stories, while emphasizing the use of photojournalists that write and edit each story. Tribune originally planned to launch the format on Dallas sister station KDAF, but ended up offering the idea to KIAH (then without a news director, following the departure of KyAnn Lewis for a producer role at The Daily Buzz) after being rejected by station management. Gary Jaffe was hired by KIAH to serve as the \\"imaginator\\" (or news director) of the program. =Launch in Houston= On July 22, 2010, Tribune announced plans to premiere NewsFix on KIAH that September, with plans to expand the format to some of the company's other stations \\"that don't have a strong legacy news product or where the local news tradition may not be as strong as it is in other markets\\" if NewsFix proved successful in the Houston market. Station employees were informed that the rebooted newscast would feature \\"fast-paced stories, added special effects and a minimum of on-camera appearance by reporters or anchors.\\" A pilot outlining the proposed format, produced at sister station WPIX in New York City, was presented to Tribune staffers in August 2010. Due to logistical issues that needed to be assessed (including workflow reconfiguration, staff training and production upgrades), the format launch was delayed three times ‚Äì first to December, then to January 2011 and finally to March 2011. KIAH reassigned most of its on-air staff (while others left) and hired additional production personnel in advance of the program's launch. Following 15-minute previews aired at the tail-end of KIAH's traditionally formatted newscasts the day before (March 18), the station relaunched its newscasts under the NewsFix format on March 19, 2011. Houston radio personality Greg Onofrio was hired to serve as the program's continuity narrator as well as an on-air commentator. At its start, the program was criticized for featuring stories often less current in nature, occurring the previous day and those that were light or offbeat in quality, with Jaffe stating in a Houston Chronicle interview that while the program \\"still [has] a component of day-of news,\\" it was trying to \\"bring new stories into the mix\\" while also not simply updating the same stories featured, \\"trying to push the timeline forward.\\" Some journalism analysts and professors also expressed doubt that the anchor-less format would attract viewers, particularly due to research by the Radio Television Digital News Association suggesting the importance of anchors to both older and younger viewers. In its first two weeks, ratings for NewsFix were lower than under KIAH's previous traditional format, with the 9:00 p.m. broadcast averaging a 0.5 rating (down from a 1.0 rating in the February 2011 sweeps period). Bare expected that viewership would decline somewhat among people seeking a conventional newscast, but expected the program to draw in new viewers (with comments from viewers estimated to be \\"about two-thirds\\" in support of the change). Monthly ratings for the late evening broadcast dropped from a 1.0 in April to 0.9 in the May sweeps period (from a high of 3.3 in December 2009 before the reformatting), before increasing to a 1.2 in August. On September 14, 2015, KIAH added a half-hour edition of its iteration of the format, CW 39 NewsFix, at 10:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday evenings. On September 6, 2018, Tribune announced that the Houston version of NewsFix would be cancelled effective September 14. Following the cancellation, the only local newscast on KIAH would be a local three-hour morning newscast titled Houston's Morning Dose that the station launched on October 22 . =Expansion to Dallas= Like KIAH, the news operation at its Dallas sister station KDAF (channel 33) had struggled; although it saw initial success with the 9:00 p.m. newscast that first launched its news department in January 1999 against established competition from Fox O&O; KDFW (channel 4), a switch from a traditional toward a more tabloid-style format under news director David Duitch (who left the station in July 2012 to become website editor for The Dallas Morning News) resulted in declining viewership for KDAF's newscasts beginning in 2009. Following the departures of four on-air staffers, Larissa Hall (senior producer of KDAF's morning program EyeOpener) was promoted to \\"director of content\\" to oversee the station's newscasts in August 2012, developing a format called Nightcap, incorporating multimedia journalists (which require a single person to film, edit and report news stories) and humor within most of its story content, in order to reduce costs and make the broadcast profitable. The revamped newscast continued to post low ratings from the time it debuted on November 1, 2012, even registering \\"hashmarks\\" (indicating viewership too low to register a ratings point) on some nights during the initial switch to the Nightcap format, though ratings slowly increased over time (particularly in the adult 25‚Äì54 demographic). Hall left the station one month after Nightcap launched after being reassigned to other duties within the Tribune Company. Steve Simon left KIAH to become news director at KDAF in November 2013, replacing Hall's replacement as news director, Denise Killian; he joined Bare who began overseeing the operations of KDAF (in addition to his existing duties at KIAH) in September. Following the change, reports indicated that Simon planned to bring the NewsFix format to the Dallas-Fort Worth market. The succeeding months saw the departures of many of KDAF's anchors and reporters, including longtime reporter Barry Carpenter and anchor Amanda Fitzpatrick (both of whom were with the station prior to the adoption of the Nightcap format), in preparation for the change. The Dallas edition of NewsFix (using the same narrators as the KIAH broadcasts) premiered on KDAF on May 20, 2014, beginning with the 5:00 p.m. broadcast; that edition would expand to an hour on Monday through Friday evenings on September 7, 2015 (matching the length of the weekend editions, which remained a one-hour broadcast after the early- evening newscast was reduced on weeknights prior to the adoption of the Nightcap format). As with its Houston counterpart, the Dallas version of NewsFix was cancelled on September 6, 2018, with the final edition airing on September 14. =Expansion to Miami= On September 28, 2015, Tribune expanded the NewsFix format to Miami, when CW affiliate WSFL-TV (channel 39) became the third station to launch the format, with the debut of a half-hour prime time newscast, NewsFix SFL at 10:00. The move marked the first time that the station had aired a full-fledged local news program since the August 4, 2010 cancellation of The Morning Show ‚Äì a four-hour morning news program that was produced at the Fort Lauderdale offices of its former newspaper sister, the Sun-Sentinel ‚Äì with news programming being relegated to hourly updates that aired during the station's evening programs (and eventually, local news inserts during EyeOpener on weekday mornings) afterward; it was also the first prime time newscast to air on the station since August 31, 2008, following the termination of a news share agreement between WSFL and NBC owned-and-operated station WTVJ (channel 6), in which the latter produced a half-hour newscast for WSFL. As of September 2018, NewsFix SFL no longer airs on the station.

The museum was assembled over many years and opened to the public in 1989 by the industrialist and philanthropist Galen Cole in his home city of Bangor, Maine. It is located at 405 Perry Road and is open seasonally from May 1 to November 11. Features of the museum The museum contains the former Maine Central Railroad Company station house that was located in Enfield, Maine. The structure was the original building from which Cole's father, Albert J. \\"Allie\\" Cole (1893-1955), started a business in 1917 hauling the mail. There is also a Maine Central Railroad car and the front car of the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad engine, which one may board and watch taped recordings about various museum exhibits. The Cole Museum houses a blacksmith shop, later a garage in East Lowell, Maine, where Allie Cole shod his horses. Many vehicles of the Cole Express Company are displayed to reflect the history of the company.\\"Cole Vehicles Cover Maine from Dirt Roads to Super Highways, 1917-1997\\", museum brochure, Bangor, Maine The Cole Museum features vintage automobiles, including a Stanley Steamer, a Ford Fairlane, a Ford Galaxie, a Buick, a Volkswagen, and the Oldsmobile 98, the official vehicle of Governor Joseph E. Brennan of Maine, who served from 1979 to 1987. There are early horse-drawn wagons and a prairie schooner, which is a scaled-down covered wagon. The museum also includes early motorcycles, mopeds, a few bicycles, snowplows and a snow roller, which are important for the Maine winters, farm tractors, a potato harvester, a horse-drawn hearse, a bus, trailers pulled by trucks, and delivery trucks of dairy products and ice. A special room includes a command car used in World War II, in which Galen Cole had been a young soldier. There are also outdoor military vehicle exhibits of both World War II and the Vietnam War. The museum's recordings include the moving life story of Galen Cole's handicapped sister, Jackie, who lived only to the age of forty. She was wheelchair-bound her whole life, but was an inspiration to all whom she met.Cole Museum exhibit Gallery File:Statement of Cole Land Transportation Museum legacy IMG_2061.JPGMuseum legacy statement (click to read) File:Bangor and Aroostook Railroad emblem IMG_2529.JPGBangor and Aroostook Railroad emblem File:Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, Bangor, ME IMG_2511.JPGBangor and Aroostook Railroad engine File:Maine Central railroad car, Bangor, ME IMG_2549.JPGMaine Central Railroad Company car File:Railroad section shack, Bangor, ME IMG_2507.JPGRailroad section shack File:Blacksmith shop, Bangor, ME IMG_2509.JPGBlacksmith shop File:Kitchen-wood saw, Bangor, ME IMG 2582.JPGThis circular saw cuts wood into segments to fit a wood-burning kitchen stove.

His two best-known companies were Cencom Cable Associates and Brooks Fiber Properties. Cencom was sold to Hallmark Cards for $1 billion, and Brooks Fiber Properties was sold to WorldCom for $3 billion. His companies were responsible for building hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber-optic and cable television wiring across the United States. Career A native of the Boston area, Brooks attended Boston Latin High and then Boston English High, from which he graduated in 1949. He enrolled at Northeastern University but dropped out the following year to join the United States Navy, where he gained familiarity with radio and radar equipment while serving during the Korean War. Upon leaving the military he returned to Northeastern University, receiving a degree in electrical engineering in 1958. While still in school, Brooks worked two part-time jobs, one as a local police officer, and one as an electrical engineer. With his knowledge of radar from the Navy, Brooks obtained a job in 1954 at Spencer-Kennedy Laboratories in Boston, focusing on the expansion of cable networks. Upon graduating from Northeastern, Brooks resigned as a police officer to pursue a full-time career at SKL. By 1964 he was promoted to Chief Systems Engineer, though he had become frustrated with Spencer-Kennedy's lack of technological innovation. Brooks believed that the future was in transistorized equipment, but SKL was still focused on vacuum tube technology. So in 1965 he left SKL to become Chief Engineer at the Anaconda Wire and Cable Company, based in Sycamore, Illinois. SKL's fortunes faltered, and by 1967 the company was in serious financial trouble, so out of loyalty, Brooks returned to the company as vice- president to try to help salvage things. His efforts were unsuccessful, the company was taken over by the bank, and Brooks resigned in 1969. In 1970 he began consulting for a St. Louis-based company that was doing work in Vermont, J.C. Barnard & Associates. Brooks then formed his own consulting company, Telecom Engineering, in St. Louis, which began to form some side franchises to run various cable systems in cities around Missouri. By the late 1970s he was head of Telecom Cablevision, which owned and operated cable TV systems west of St. Louis, in the cities of St. Charles, St. Peters, and Columbia. The company also operated some cable systems in the St. Louis area through a partnership with Teleprompter Corporation. Telecom Cablevision was eventually acquired by Group W Cable in 1980. Next, in 1981, with seed capital of $300,000, Robert Brooks founded Cencom Cable Associates, pioneering the deployment of fiber- optic technology for cable TV. Within the next ten years, Cencom became the 21st-largest cable company in the United States, and in 1991 was purchased by Hallmark Cards, Inc., through its subsidiary Crown Media Holdings. In 1993 some former managers of Cencom -- Howard Wood, Jerald Kent, and Barry Babcock -- purchased the company back from Hallmark and formed Charter Communications, which in 1998 was sold to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for $4.5 billion. The southern facade of the Brooks Fiber Properties Headquarters spelled out the company's name in Morse code. BFP was later sold, and the current (2014) occupant of the building is CenturyLink. Also in 1991, along with his son John, Robert founded Brooks Telecommunications Company, which then spawned multiple subsidiary companies including Brooks Fiber Properties, and Brooks Telecommunications International, which was tasked with building broadband networks in Guangzhou, China. Brooks Fiber Properties was founded in 1993 as a data CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) for $41 million. BFP's first year's revenue was $2,000, which grew to $2.8 million in 1994, and $14.2 million the following year. In January it purchased another network company, City Signal, bringing its annual revenue to $23 million. It went public two years later. In 1996, BFP built a new Headquarters building in Town and Country, Missouri. Designed by architect Seab Tuck, the building featured the company's name spelled out in Morse code in the southern facade of the windows. Brooks Fiber was acquired by WorldCom in 1998 in a transaction that valued the equity at $2.6 billion. Robert Brooks and several members of the Brooks Fiber team then went on to found Gabriel Communications, raising $80 million in three days, and naming the company after Archangel Gabriel. In 2000, just prior to Robert's death, Gabriel acquired Trivergent Communications, and the company was renamed to NuVox. In 2004, NuVox merged with NewSouth Communications, and in 2009 it was acquired by Windstream for $643 million.

It stars Joe Odagiri as Ginko, a traveler who dedicates himself to protecting the populace from supernatural creatures called Mushi. Otomo began work on the film in 2005 after declining a jidaigeki project. He was interested in creating a mix of live action and animation and felt the manga gave him an appropriate creative vehicle. The film debuted at the Venice International Film Festival in 2006 and was screened at several other festivals prior to its theatrical release on March 24, 2007, in Japan. The DVD was released in Japan in 2007, in the United Kingdom in 2008, and in North America in 2009. The film has received a mixed response from film critics. Many praised Odagiri's performance and its visual but critiqued the plot and mythology as confusing. Mushishi received nominations and awards at film festivals and was among the 100 highest-grossing films of 2007 in Japan. Plot Mushishi opens with Yoki and his mother walking along a mountain when a cliff suddenly collapses. This is followed by a nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)‚Äîan expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where there are two types of Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember. In the present, Ginko, to escape a blizzard, finds a village inn. After revealing himself as a Mushishi, he is asked to help several locals suffering from hearing loss. After he helps the locals, Ginko is asked by the innkeeper to look at her granddaughter, Maho, who is deaf, has horns on her forehead, and hears strange noises. Maho's mother had the same symptoms and was cremated after her death. Maho, however, kept her mother's horns, which turned out to be a disguised Mushi and the cause of her illness. Ginko heals the girl and then continues on his journey. Ginko receives a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her to write about Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi who is trying to capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition. Ginko faces the Tokoyami itself in the writings warehouse, while Tama and Koro try to remove the Tokoyami by bloodletting. The newly healed Tanyu accompanies Tama and Koro to the warehouse, where they find a collapsed Ginko. Tanyu begins to remove the writings from Ginko's body and reattach them to the parchments. After Tanyu removes the writings, Ginko awakens and continues on with Koro. The pair finds the rainbow-like Mushi. After this, they part ways, and Koro goes back to his hometown to build bridges. Ginko faces a Tokoyami-possessed Nui and carries her to the River of Light (or Koumyaku), a stream of glittering Mushi called Kouki‚Äîthe origin of Mushi life.

Japan Digital Content Trust planned to raise $2.2 million (¬•260 million) of the film's projected $8.5 million (¬•1 billion) budget. Its filming lasted three months, and production of the film took two years. Initially, producer Satoru Ogura came up with the idea of making a jidaigeki in collaboration with the team that worked on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Otomo was not confident in working on \\"a project of that size\\" as he had only directed one live-action film in 1991, titled World Apartment Horror. He instead suggested adapting Mushishi as he felt it would be \\"an opportunity to mix live action and computer graphics, to create a hybrid of the natural and the virtual\\". Otomo felt that the concept of Mushishi was sufficiently unique to interest him creatively. He found the episodic nature of the work challenging but was able to fashion a cohesive screenplay by combining elements of the different stories present in the manga. Although he sent his script to Urushibara for review, she gave him complete creative autonomy. Otomo describes the film as \\"a kind of fable\\", and as such, he chose the Meiji era as its setting because he felt it offered the best framing for the story, as he considered the sudden disappearances of certain characters were also consistent with the nature of that historical period. Release The worldwide premiere of Mushishi took place at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, which ran from August 30 to September 9, 2006. The film was shown at the \\"Visions\\" section of the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 under the title of Bugmaster. It was later screened in January at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival in the \\"Spectrum\\" section. It opened in Japanese theaters on March 24, 2007, after the release of a novelization by Naoki Tsujii on February 23, a soundtrack album by Avex on March 14, and a book with details about the film's production by Kodansha on March 22. In October of the same year, it was shown at the 2007 Sitges Film Festival. In Japan, the film was released in DVD format by Tohokushinsha Film on October 26, 2007. Revolver Entertainment licensed it in January 2008 and was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on February 25. In September 2008, Funimation announced that it had acquired the distribution rights of the film to North America. A Blu-ray version was released in Japan on February 20, 2009, while Funimation released its DVD version on August 25, 2009, calling it Mushi-Shi: The Movie. Reception In its opening weekend in Japan, Mushishi ranked eighth at the box office. In total, it grossed $4,194,890, making it the 81st best gross of a film released in Japan in 2007. It was nominated at the Venice Film Festival in the best film category and at the Sitges Film Festival in the best film, best special effects, and best soundtrack categories, winning in the latter two. On its exhibition at the Sundance Film Festival, all tickets were sold out, and some people watched it standing because they did not buy reserved seats. Although the film received mixed reviews, Odagiri's performance was highly praised Critical response was mixed. Todd Brown, writing for Twitch Film, characterized the film as \\"long, slow, fairly pedestrian in its visual style, confusing for the newbies, [and] over-familiar for the existing fan\\". Anime News Network's Bamboo Dong praised its visuals but noted that the film could be confusing for viewers who are unfamiliar with the manga series and that Ginko \\"looks more like a cosplayer\\". Tony Sullivan of Eye for Film said it is \\"beautifully acted, shot and scored\\" but cited the \\"lack of oomph\\" as a reason why \\"the movie is rather dull\\". Mark Schilling from The Japan Times praised Odagiri but criticized the film for being \\"a text too tangled and murky for the uninitiated to easily penetrate or parse\\". The cast performance was praised by Variety reviewer Derek Elley who declared its \\"longueurs and narrative obscurities consign this 'Bug' to highly specialized outings\\". Sullivan, Schilling, and Elley criticized its soundtrack, especially the use of didgeridoos. Sally Foster from Film Threat praised its visuals and \\"a few good Japanese-style creep-out scenes\\" but described the storyline as \\"incomprehensible\\" due to \\"the overabundance\\" of information about its mythology. John Sinnott of DVD Talk asserted the film could not reach the quality of the manga; he cited the lack of explanation about Ginko's background as one of the reasons. Sinnott criticized its slow pace considering its duration and said that \\"there isn't much mystery or suspense.\\" Anthony Enticknap from Den of Geek said its plot is \\"complex at times, and often drifts into the realms of the incomprehensible\\". Although he criticized the film's \\"pedestrian\\" pace, Enticknap praised Omori's performance as well as the film's cinematography and use of CGI. While praising Odagiri's acting and deeming the film's visuals an \\"A-game\\", DVD Verdict's Adam Arseneau said it \\"feels disjointed and fragmented\\". While he preferred the anime version, Mania.com's Chris Beveridge praised the film as \\"a soothing and atmospheric movie that captures everything that it should\\", singling out Otomo's direction and Odagiri's acting. Scott Green from Ain't It Cool News wrote that he \\"didn't find it as breathtaking as Otomo's anime spectacles or as effecting as earlier version of Mushi-Shi\\", but did \\"find it a fascinating movie to watch and consider\\". Joseph Luster from Otaku USA called it \\"fantastic\\" though declared Mushishi would not be \\"nearly as strong without him [Odagiri] in the lead\\". Kevin Kelly, writing for Cinematical.com, dubbed it \\"a film not for everyone\\" because of its storyline's complexity and \\"unusual type of mythology and storytelling\\". Kelly concluded, \\"if you like Japanese cinema, fantasy storytelling, and interesting characters, you'll love this film.\\" Similarly, Justin Howe of Tor.com declared it is \\"a bit too inert for most people's tastes\\" but said \\"Mushishi is a fantasy film that's worth seeing. It's more eerie than scary, often haunting, and occasionally beautiful.\\" References External links * Category:2006 films Category:2000s fantasy films Category:Films directed by Katsuhiro Otomo Category:Funimation Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese fantasy films Category:Japanese- language films Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Japanese nonlinear narrative films ","title":"Mushishi (film)"},{"id":"43361358","text":"Alfred Wiedemann (18 July 1856, Berlin ‚Äì 7 December 1936, Bad Godesberg) was a German Egyptologist.

It is located in the Thun Palace, a historic building in the heart of the Mal√° Strana (\\"Lesser Town\\"). The incumbent ambassador is Nick Archer. History A bust of Winston Churchill close to the British Embassy in Prague The long history of the Thun Palace, which is named after the Thun family, goes back to medieval times and there are Gothic traces in the cellars and foundations of the building. The first written record of a building at this place is from the middle of the 14th century. Since then, the location has marked some of the great events in Czech history. There are records that a house here was burnt during the Hussite Wars, along with much of Mal√° Strana. Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor bequeathed a rebuilt house to one of his faithful servants, and the house was subsequently traded by winners and losers during the catastrophic upheavals of the Thirty Years' War. In 1919, when Britain established relations with the new Republic of Czechoslovakia, the British leased the Thun Palace as a Residence for the Minister and the Legation offices. It has been the Legation, and then the Embassy, ever since and in 1925 the British Government bought it. The first Czechoslovak President, Tom√°≈° Masaryk, was a frequent visitor and according to some sources, Masaryk used to come from the Prague Castle through the Embassy garden. Over the years, many internal changes to the building have been made to provide more working office space. But the main architectural features, artwork and great treasures of history remain, and the building and garden continue to be amongst the most beautiful locations in the city.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6H3G_The_British_Embassy_in_the_Czech_Republic_Prague The American musicologist Daniel E. Freeman has recently established that Mozart did not stay in this palace during his first visit in Prague in January and February 1787, contrary to persistent claims found in guidebooks to the city of Prague.See Daniel E. Freeman, Mozart in Prague (Minneapolis, 2013), 86. The true Thun palace in which he stayed burned down in the late 1790s. It was replaced by a new palace that was built in the early 19th century and now stands at Snƒõmovn√≠ 4 in Mal√° Strana.

Early life Born in Clear Spring, Washington County, Maryland as first child of Rev. Joshua Peterkin of Baltimore, Maryland (1814‚Äì1892) and his wife Elizabeth Howard Hanson, George Peterkin had two younger sisters, Mary Beall Peterkin (1842‚Äì1857) and Rebekah Dulaney Peterkin. He attended the University of Virginia until the American Civil War interrupted his studies to become a priest like his father. Peterkin joined the 21st Virginia Infantry in Richmond, and after the battle of Seven Pines in 1862 joined the staff of artillery General William N. Pendleton, who had been a priest in Maryland before the war and knew his father.Susan Pendleton Lee, Memoirs of William Nelson Pendleton, D.D. (J.B. Lippincott, 1893) p. 180 available at Google Books As General Pendleton's aide, Lieutenant Peterkin witnessed the surrender ceremony at Appomattox.Lee at p. 405. Ministry After the war, Peterkin attended Virginia Theological Seminary and graduated in 1868. Ordained a priest the following year, Peterkin served parishes in Virginia and Maryland. When the General Convention created the Diocese of West Virginia in 1877, and the new diocese's first choice as bishop, Rev. Eccleston of New Jersey turned down the position, Peterkin, who had recently manage to reorganize the finances and ministry of Memorial Church in Baltimore, was elected its first bishop. On May 30, 1878, he was consecrated at the new diocese's largest church, St. Matthew's in Wheeling. Bishop Peterkin established his home at Parkersburg, West Virginia and during the next 24 years visited every county in West Virginia, increasing the Episcopal Church's influence in the state. He consecrated 37 churches, and conducted numerous ordinations in his diocese and four in Brazil. He also served as a missionary in Puerto Rico. In 1887 Bishop Peterkin founded Sheltering Arms Hospital in Hansford, to provide medical care for coal miners, znd two years later his sister Rebekah founded a similar hospital in Richmond in a former mansion.

In 1892, Peterkin published Records of the Protestant Episcopal Church in West Virginia. In 1899, the diocesan convention elected William Loyall Gravatt as his coadjutator, as Bishop Peterkin contemplated retirement, after the deaths of his father and sister as the decade began. In 1901, Bishop Peterkin helped erect a cross memorial to Confederate soldiers from his 21st Virginia regiment and those of the 15th Virginia on Valley Mountain in Randolph County, West Virginia. He retired the following year, succeeded by Bishop Gravatt, who moved the diocesan headquarters to Charleston. Family Peterkin married twice.

Life Albert Edward Cloutier was born in 1902 of Canadian parents in Leominster, Massachusetts, USA. The family moved back to Canada 1903. As a child he was encouraged to paint by his parents. He was mostly self-taught. He went on painting trips with A. Y. Jackson and Edwin Holgate. Cloutier was an apprentice with Smeaton Bros in Montreal in 1918‚Äì21. He worked with Associated Engravers in Montreal (1922‚Äì25) and with Batten Ltd. in Montreal (1926‚Äì29). From 1929 to 1940 he was a freelance graphic designer and illustrator in Montreal. He was part of the \\"Oxford Group\\" led by the painters Andr√© Bi√©ler and Edwin Holgate, which met in a below-ground room at the Oxford tavern at lunchtime. The group had roughly equal numbers of francophone and anglophone members. Other members were Adrien H√©bert, the art critic Jean Chauvin and the editor Carrier. Cloutier and Edwin Holgate made a mural for the Canadian pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, commissioned by the Canadian government. It showed a panorama of the country in terms of industries, people and products. The focus of the mural was a hydroelectric dam with a white horse in front of it, representing power.

The collection was established to preserve a perspective on Australian literary heritage, including a selection of books children in New South Wales had grown up reading since white settlement. The collection was not limited to Australian titles and included a professional collection of books and reviewing journals. The material in the collection had been sourced from donations by New South Wales public libraries, New South Wales Department of Education and Training Offices at Ryde, the New South Wales School Magazine office and private individuals. The collection included more than 20,000 items. The AORA patron was Dr Maurice Saxby AM, a world- renowned authority on Australian Children's Literature. History Aora can trace its history back to the 1960s when Dr Margaret Trask, a lecturer in children's literature, saved discarded books from public libraries to be a historical resource collection for her students. This collection was returned to Sydney public libraries in 1992 and a group of former children's librarians maintained the collection as it expanded with donations from the New South Wales Department of Education offices at Ryde, bibliographer Dr Kerry White, Penguin publishing, authors, public library deleted materials and individual donors. Housed at St Peters Public School in Sydney, the collection was jointly supported by the Metropolitan Public Libraries Association and New South Wales Department of Education and Training from 1992 until 2006. In 2008 ownership of the collection was handed over to a community volunteer committee in partnership with Department of Education and Training, New South Wales. A new management committee was established and work began to develop a plan for the future. The aim of the collection was to make it the children's literature research collection for New South Wales, available to students and researchers of children's literature and the general public. A newsletter was produced and circulated to public library librarians, school librarians, teachers, academics, publishers, bookshops and parents of students at the school. A business plan for its future launched by the State Librarian of New South Wales in 2010 was only partly implemented. Aora closed in December 2013 due to rising insurance costs and low membership. The collection was dispersed into the hands of many individuals.

The technique received wide media coverage in 2014 after researchers from Princeton University and KU Leuven University described it in their paper The Web never forgets. Description Canvas fingerprinting works by exploiting the HTML5 canvas element. As described by Acar et al. in: Variations in which graphics processing unit (GPU) is installed or the graphics driver cause the variations in the fingerprint. The fingerprint can be stored and shared with advertising partners to identify users when they visit affiliated websites. A profile can be created from the user's browsing activity allowing advertisers to target advertising to the user's inferred demographics and preferences. =Uniqueness= Since the fingerprint is primarily based on the browser, operating system, and installed graphics hardware it does not uniquely identify users. In a small-scale study with 294 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an experimental entropy of 5.7 bits was observed. The authors of the study suggest more entropy could likely be observed in the wild and with more patterns used in the fingerprint. While not sufficient to uniquely identify users by itself, this fingerprint could be combined with other sources of entropy to provide a unique identifier. It is claimed that because the technique is effectively fingerprinting the GPU, the entropy is \\"orthogonal\\" to the entropy of previous browser fingerprint techniques such as screen resolution and browser JavaScript capabilities. History In May 2012, Keaton Mowery and Hovav Shacham, researchers at University of California, San Diego, wrote a paper Pixel Perfect: Fingerprinting Canvas in HTML5 describing how the HTML5 canvas could be used to create digital fingerprints of web users. Social bookmarking technology company AddThis began experimenting with canvas fingerprinting early in 2014 as a potential replacement for cookies. 5% of the top 100,000 websites used canvas fingerprinting while it was deployed. According to AddThis CEO Richard Harris, the company has only used data collected from these tests to conduct internal research. Users will be able to install an opt-out cookie on any computer to prevent being tracked by AddThis with canvas fingerprinting. A software developer writing in Forbes stated that device fingerprinting has been utilized for the purpose of preventing unauthorized access to systems long before it was used for tracking users without their consent. As of 2014 the technique is widespread in many websites with at least a dozen high- profile web ads and user tracking suppliers using it. Mitigation Typical Tor Browser notification of a website attempting a canvas read.Tor Project reference documentation states, \\"After plugins and plugin-provided information, we believe that the HTML5 Canvas is the single largest fingerprinting threat browsers face today.\\" Tor Browser notifies the user of canvas read attempts and provides the option to return blank image data to prevent fingerprinting. However, Tor Browser is currently unable to distinguish between legitimate uses of the canvas element and fingerprinting efforts, so its warning cannot be taken as proof of a website's intent to identify and track its visitors. Browser add-ons like Privacy Badger, DoNotTrackMe or Adblock Plus manually enhanced with EasyPrivacy list are able to block third-party ad network trackers and will block canvas fingerprinting provided that the tracker is served by a third party server (as opposed to being implemented by the visited website itself).

It contested one electorate, but not the party vote, at the 2014 general election.  Policies  According to the party's Facebook page, the Expatriate Party seeks \\"to provide representation for, and to promote fairness in the treatment of all members of the mobile global workforce who identify as New Zealanders, irrespective of where they live or their residency or citizenship status.\\" The party put forward several policies during their 2014 campaign. The main policy for that election was fairer rules to allow New Zealanders to become Australian permanent residents, with the rights to services such as healthcare that this would bring. However, the party made clear it did not intend to seek access to unemployment benefits. It also supported reforms to New Zealand law regarding whether and how expatriates may participate in New Zealand elections (including studying the introduction of electronic voting); reduction of regulation and taxation (which it considers a disincentive for expatriates to remain connected to New Zealand); and stronger social and economic ties with New Zealand's traditional allies.  2014 election  The party spokespeople were Grant Cheesman and Nick Teulon, both of whom were New Zealand-born residents of Australia. By August 2014, the party had announced that it had sufficient numbers to register as a political party in New Zealand, which would have allowed it to contest the 2014 election. However, the registration process was not completed before Writ Day due to issues in verifying registered members, leaving the party unable to contest the party vote. The Expatriate Party ran one electorate candidate at the 2014 elections. Vicky Rose contested the Maori Electorate of Ikaroa-RƒÅwhiti, receiving 70 votes, which was 0.32% of the electorate vote; Rose came last of the six candidates.  2014‚Äì2017  During 2014, the party stated it did not rule out the possibility of participating in Australian elections in the future. However, it did not contest the 2016 Australian election.  2017 election and current status  On 8 February 2017, the party announced on their Facebook page that they had talked with the Electoral Commission about enrolling for the 2017 election, and another post on 3 March stated it has applied for broadcasting funding. However, in August 2017 the party announced they had not achieved the numbers needed to register the party and that it would not contest the election.

It was the tenth named storm and the fourth typhoon of the 2014 Pacific typhoon season. The typhoon is believed to be one of the main reasons behind the crash of TransAsia Airways Flight 222, which occurred a day after it made landfall. There were fifty-four passengers on board (four of whom were reported to be children) and a crew of four. Taiwan News reported that \\"first suspicions hinted\\" the accident might be related to Matmo. The typhoon developed from a cluster of thundershowers consolidating around an area of low pressure in the doldrums. It initially followed a westward track, then made a sharp northwest turn before making landfall on Taiwan, and then China. After moving further inland, Matmo slowly curved back northeastwards and became extratropical before its remnants affected the Korean Peninsula. The typhoon caused damage of US$418 million and there were 65 deaths related to the storm. Matmo brought tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall to the Philippines, typhoon force winds and torrential rainfall to China and Taiwan and heavy rains to Korea. Two deaths in the Philippines were attributed to the typhoon. The storm left 31,505 people in Taiwan without power. gusts were reported in the Gimpo International Airport of Seoul. Meteorological history The origins of Matmo can be tracked back to an area of low pressure that developed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 280 km (170 mi) east of Chuuk on July 9, 2014. Over the next few days, the system's low-level circulation center (LLCC) slowly consolidated with convective banding developing around its southern periphery and a burst of convection over its center. Located in a favorable region, the system slowly intensified, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system, on July 16. Around the same time, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Tokyo, operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system as a tropical depression. Tracking slowly northwestward, the depression continued to consolidate while the JTWC initiated advisories on it with the identifier 10W. During the evening of July 17, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, and assigned it the name Matmo. The subsequent six hours saw the JTWC recognizing Matmo as a tropical storm and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) naming it Henry as it entered the Philippine area of responsibility. Matmo accelerated somewhat on July 18 as it passed 450 km (280 mi) north-northwest of Koror, Palau. Around that time, the JMA upgraded Matmo to a severe tropical storm. By July 19, the center of Matmo had become obscured as deep central convection developed over it. Microwave satellite imagery showed improving convective banding despite the overall structure of the storm being slightly elongated. Subsequent intensification resulted in the JMA upgrading Matmo to a typhoon. The convective banding around the LLCC started to curl inwards as an eye-like feature started developing. Increasing wind shear stemming from the subtropical ridge steering the typhoon inhibited further organization. By July 21, the shear abated somewhat and allowed for some intensification. Tracking well to the southwest of Okinawa, the typhoon increased in both size and organization, with a secondary convective rainband developing along the northern half of the system by July 22\\\\. Upper-level outflow also improved and fueled the expansion of convection. A broad eye feature developed with strong convective rainbands wrapped tightly into it. The storm reached peak intensity on July 22, with maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a central barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). Around the same time the JTWC estimated Matmo to have acquired one- minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), ranking the system as a Category 2-equivalent on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The storm continued on its northwesterly track and made landfall in Taiwan, south of Hualien. The strongest gusts of 212 km/h (132 mph) were recorded on Orchid Island. Emerging over the Taiwan Strait early on July 23, Matmo was greatly weakened by its passage over Taiwan. Convective rainbands diminished significantly and its circulation became severely disrupted by Taiwan's rugged terrain. The JMA downgraded Matmo into a severe tropical storm and eventually a tropical storm during this process. The JTWC, however, maintained Matmo as a typhoon during this time. The storm made its second landfall on China, south of Putian, while parts of its rainbands were still over Taiwan and the Philippines. Once onshore, the JTWC downgraded Matmo to a tropical storm and issued their final advisory. The JMA, however, continued tracking Matmo as a tropical storm until it became extratropical on July 25. Preparations and impact Street flooding in Fuzhou following Typhoon Matmo The remnants of Matmo brought generally light to moderate rains across South Korea, with Seoul reporting . Similar rains were expected over Hokkaido, Japan, with forecasts showing over the island. =Taiwan= About 5,400 tourists evacuated in two islands of Taiwan. Taiwan's military had gathered and distributed sandbags in anticipation of flooding. As of the impacts from Typhoon Matmo, the storm made landfall over Taiwan at peak intensity early on July 23. One person was reported dead and some damages were reported. 5 people were injured, due to the storm. A tourist was reported missing after taking pictures on a shore. Agricultural losses throughout Taiwan amounted to at least NT$594.9 million (US$20 million). Hualien County sustained the greatest damage, accounting for half the losses. =China= In China, an Orange Tropical Cyclone Alert in areas near Fuzhou. Throughout the country, 16 people were killed and economic losses amounted to ¬•2.47 billion (US$398 million). Throughout Fujian Province, 182 EMU trains suffered outages.

He was the first person in recorded history to hike through the Grand Canyon's entire length. In 1983, he set the speed record for rowing through the canyon in 37 hours. Background Dories. Grua was an early guide for Litton, who pioneered the use of dories in the Grand Canyon in the 1970s. Kenton Grua was born and raised in Vernal, Utah.Oral history interview with Kenton Grua (includes transcript), December 2, 1997. :: Colorado Plateau Archives Retrieved 2018-09-09. At age 12, Grua was enthralled by a whitewater rafting trip taken with his father on the Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. He began college around 1968, but soon dropped out after he was offered a job as a motormana rubber raft guidefor Ted Hatch in the Grand Canyon. He was soon after hired by Grand Canyon Dories, founded by environmentalist Martin Litton, who piloted a fleet of wooden McKenzie River dories specially modified for the Colorado. His boundless energy, memorable personality and constant experimentation earned Grua a nickname, as historian Lew Steiger explains: > Years ago, his pals nicknamed him 'Factor' because that's what he was ... > this additional element you always had to factor in whenever you were on a > river trip, or in the warehouse, or anywhere with him ... frequently > brilliant, sometimes insane, usually intense ... always a factor. Rowing speed-record through the Grand Canyon In 1983, Grua, along with river guides Rudi Petschek and Steve Reynolds, set a record for speed rowing down the 277-mile length of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, with a time of 36 hours, 38 minutes and 29 seconds, breaking the previous record of just under 48 hours set in 1980 by Grua, Petschek, and Wally Rist, which in turn broke the record of 52 hours established in 1951 by the Rigg brothers. Normally, trips in motorized rubber rafts take up to a week and dory trips two weeks or more. Grua's 1983 trip took advantage of record-setting seasonal flood waters to propel a specially modified wooden dory called the Emerald Mile along the route. This famous speed run has been recounted in a number of books and articles, including Lew Steiger's story \\"Speed\\" in Christa Sadler's book, There's This River ... Grand Canyon Boatman Stories (2006), and Kevin Fedarko's The Emerald Mile: The Epic Story of the Fastest Ride in History Though the Heart of the Grand Canyon (2013). Grua's record stood until 2016, when a team of kayakers made the trip in 35 hours and 5 minutes - that record was broken 2 days later by a solo kayaker bringing the speed to 34 hours and 2 minutes. First walk of the Grand Canyon's length Anasazi granaries at Nankoweap Creek is typical of the terrain Grua hiked through. He never crossed or swam the river, staying to the south side, often along higher escarpments and cliff faces such as this one. The river rose and fell frequently from the influence of Glen Canyon Dam upstream. Kenton Grua was the first person in recorded history to walk the entire length of the Grand Canyon. The Colorado River forms the base of the canyon and he walked along or near it from the northern terminus near Lee's Ferry (started at Badger Canyon) to the southern terminus at Grand Wash Cliffs. Grua first had the idea after reading Colin Fletcher's best-seller The Man Who Walked Through Time (1968) in which Fletcher hiked the length of the Canyon inside Grand Canyon National Park, the first person to do so. However, this was only about half the length of the canyon, because at the time Fletcher conducted his trip in 1963, the National Park did not include the entire length of the canyon (it was later expanded). Others had hiked large portions of the canyon in multiple sections over a number of years. Grua wanted to \\"do it right\\" by hiking the entire canyon in a single trip. Grua's work as a professional river guide allowed him to scout potential routes, which he did for a number of years before his first attempt in the fall of 1971soon abandoned because of an infection after he stepped on a cactus. He made his second attempt in 1977, after caching food at various points along the route. During this walk (staying south of the Colorado) he discovered many ancient Anasazi signs that were upwards of one thousand years oldmezcal pit ovens for making alcohol, granary rooms for storing foodshowing that parts of the route had been used before. Some sections were perilous goat trails, hundreds of feet above the river, in otherwise sheer rock cliffs. Grua reached the end of the canyon, Grand Wash Cliffs, on April 4, 1977, exactly five weeks after he had begun. He estimated he had actually hiked about six hundred miles because of the circuitous route required by the canyon's treacherous topography and the need to return to the river periodically for drinking water. Unlike Fletcher who wrote a best-selling book and became a hiking icon, Grua did little to publicize his accomplishment, which went largely unnoticed until much later, other than among his fellow river guides. Elias Butler (2007) said it was \\"one of the greatest hiking accomplishments in Grand Canyon history, though he has received little publicity for it.\\" Death and legacy In 1988, Grua founded and was the first president of Grand Canyon River Guides, \\"a non-profit educational and environmental organization that weighs in on issues ranging from operation of Glen Canyon Dam to uranium mining near the rim, from overflight noise to quiet motors.\\" Grua died at 52 years of age from a heart attack related to a fall from his mountain bike on lower Schultz Creek Trail, near his home in Flagstaff, Arizona. He was survived by his wife and step-children. The Whale Foundation offers the Kenton Grua Memorial Scholarship, benefiting Grand Canyon river guides who are pursuing further education.

Wu and Wuxing commanderies were later formed between the Yangtze and the north shore of Hangzhou Bay; the administration of the remainder of Kuaiji Commandery was then removed to the site of the former Yue capital in modern Shaoxing's Yuecheng District, which also became known as Kuaiji from this role. By the Tang, Hangzhou was also separated and Kuaiji ran from a little north of the Zhe River in the west to Ningbo in the east.Liu Taotao & al. Unity and Diversity: Local Cultures and Identities in China, pp. 16-17\\\\. Hong Kong University Press (Hong Kong), 1996. Name The commandery was named for Mount Kuaiji, a site long important to the area's native Yue people and connected in Chinese legend with Yu the Great, whose putative gravesite was visited by Shi Huangdi in his tours of the Qin Empire. There are various folk etymologies of the Chinese characters, but they probably represent a transcription of a native proto-Wu placename. History The commandery was first formed by Shi Huangdi of the Qin to consolidate control over the lands of miscellaneous Baiyue peoples southeast of Chu captured in 222 BC. The initial capital was at Wu (present-day Suzhou) through the Qin and Han dynasties and it was also known as \\"Kuaiji\\" from this role. In 209 BC, its governor Yin Tong initiated a plot to rebel against the collapsing Qin but was assassinated and replaced by his conspirators Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu. They employed Kuaiji as a base for their own rebellion, which restored a puppet king to Chu before Xiang Yu's defeat by Han. During the Han dynasty, an army from Kuaiji Commandery under Han Anguo (t s H√°n ƒÄngu√≥) moved against the Min (Fujianese) in .Records of the Grand Historian, section 114.Hu Shouwei, Nan Yue Kai Tuo Xian Qu--Zhao Tuo, pp. 76‚Äì77.

The Government of the Qin and Han Empires: 221 ‚Äî220 , p. 165. By the Three Kingdoms period, the capital was restored to its pre-imperial position in present-day Shaoxing. The commandery was conquered by Sun Ce of Wu in 196 and he made its capital his base, assuming the title of governor himself. The area was later troubled by the bandits L√º He () and Qin Lang (), who were put down by Jiang Qin; bandits under Pan Lin (ÊΩòËá®) were put down by Lu Xun. During the period, Yuyao suffered a plague outbreak but its administrator Zhu Huan's deft handling of the situation was credited with an influx of immigrants. The era of Sun Quan saw migrations from the north and the opening of the Shanyue area and the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Textile production expanded, using imported cotton from Shu. Celadon pottery, later developed under the Jin, became more common. The primary centers of industrial production (specifically, ceramics) were at Kuaiji (Shaoxing), Yuyao (within Ningbo), and Shangyu, with secondary centers at Yinxian, Ningbo proper, Fenghua, Linhai, Xiaoshan, Yuhang (present-day Hangzhou), and Huzhou.Dien, Albert. Six Dynasties Civilization, pp. 237 ff. Yale University Press (New Haven), 2007. Accessed 23 July 2014. Kuaiji also had a copper mine which produced mirrors.Dien, p. 265. Trade missions reached Taiwan, Fun'an (south Vietnam), and Manchuria. The removal of the Jin dynasty to Nanjing in 317 sparked economic growth in the region known at the time as San Wu (\\"The Three Wus\\") from the commanderies of Wu, Wuxing, and Kuaiji (which had formerly been located in Wu).Dien, p. 120. During the Southern Dynasties period, Kuaiji Commandery was the scene of an abortive rebellion by the retired general Wang Jingze () against Emperor Ming of Qi in 498. The emperor was able to forestall the involvement of Emperor Gao's grandson Xiao Zike (), marquess of Nankang, by threatening a mass poisoning of his family and General Wang was killed in battle. It was the capital commandery of Eastern Yangzhou and the richest commandery in the empire during the 6th century. During the Sui, the Grand Canal reached Hangzhou in Kuaiji Commandery, which accordingly grew in importance. By the Tang, a separate commandery was established for Hangzhou out of Kuaiji's territory north of the Zhe River. Emperor Yang of the Sui ordered a palace to be constructed in Kuaiji in 616.

History Maria Cristina National High School was formerly known as Maria Cristina Barangay High School. The opening of said barangay high school was based on the provision of Republic Act 6050, otherwise known as the Barrio High School. In this event, request to open a barangay high school in Barangay Maria Cristina was initiated by the Barangay Captain with a joint petition of the residents of said barangay. With its approval, the Maria Cristina Barangay High School was established during the year 1972 of June with 183 students man with 5 teachers. There were 2 sections in first year and one section in second year as a start. There were classes held at the barangay hall and 2 classes at the elementary school. The school grows in population causing the PTA to construct a temporary classroom made of nipa to accommodate enrollees on the following school year. Due to the growing population, additional teachers were hired. What started with 3 sections man with 5 teachers become 17 sections man with 26 teachers funded under local school board and majority were funded by the national government. At present, the school has already 40 sets of computers and other facilities needed by the growing population. There is already a 3 hectare lot owned by the National Power Corporation as the new school site of Maria Cristina National High School. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) and the Local School Board of Iligan City Division to allow the usage of the unutilized portion of the lot of cadastral lot number 292, a land reserved for the project of National Power Corporation (NPC) by virtue of Proclamation Number 335 as the site of Maria Cristina National High School. It is the school‚Äôs desire to develop the new site in order for the school to transfer and grow in terms of population, buildings, facilities and school equipment. Last June, 2004, the new site was being occupied by the fourth year students first due to the existence of two buildings with 6 classrooms only. However, at present, all the year levels already utilized the said site.

Cast-in-place concrete piles were chosen for PY2 because the shallow depth of just 3.9m restricted access by the floating crane. Construction of the pylon legs was carried out using automatic climbing system formwork, in lifts varying from 3m to 4m height. Each segment took about seven days to complete.

A. mayri was one of two Aphaenogaster species described in a 1930 paper by Frank M. Carpenter. History and classification Aphaenogaster mayri is known from a series of fossil insects which are compression-impression fossils preserved in fine shales of the Florissant formation in Colorado. The formation is composed of successive lake deposits which have preserved a diverse assemblage of insects. The insects and plants suggest a climate similar to modern southeastern North America, with a number of taxa represented that are now found in the subtropics to tropics and confined to the Old World. When A. mayri was described, the Florissant formation was considered to be Miocene in age, based on the flora and fauna preserved. Successive research and fossil descriptions moved the age older and by 1985 the formation had been reassigned to an Oligocene age. Further refinement of the formation's age using radiometric dating of sanidine crystals has resulted in an age of 34 million years old. This places the formation in the Eocene Priabonian stage. At the time of description the species was known from a series of forty-one type fossils and over two hundred good fossils were examined for the species description. The holotype was deposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology paleontology collections at Harvard University. Along with a number of other insect type specimens, the A. mayri holotype is part of the Samuel Hubbard Scudder insect collection donated to Harvard in 1902. The fossil was first studied by paleoentomologist Frank M. Carpenter of the Museum of Comparative Zoology with his 1930 type description of the new species being published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The etymology for the specific epithet mayri was not given with the type description, but is likely in honour of the Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr. A. mayri was one of two Aphaenogaster species which Carpenter described in the paper, the other species being Aphaenogaster donisthorpei, both from the Florissant Formation.  Description  The Aphaenogaster mayri queens range from , with a fairly slender build. Body segment lengths are for the head, for the thorax and for the gaster. The head capsule is a little longer than it is wide and has a large pair of mandibles. The antennae are long and slender in appearance, composed of a scape that is extends past the hind margin of the head and funicular segments which are twice as long are they are wide. Both the head and thorax show visible distinct sculpturing. Male A. mayri are distinguished from queens by their smaller size, being around in length and having a head capsule with a triangular outline. Similarly the workers are distinct from queens by the smaller size, with a length of approximately and heavier sculpturing on the head capsule and thorax then queens. The head capsule has the same outline as that of the queens, distinguishing workers from males. A. mayri and A. donisthorpei are distinguished based on the more slender nature of A. donisthorpei, with more elongated head and thorax proportions.

It is a sequel to the 1883 novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Plot summary Twelve years after the events chronicled in Treasure Island, Jim Hawkins (the narrator) takes up ownership of the Admiral Benbow Inn. He improves the inn with his share of the treasure taken from the island, and becomes well known as a raconteur of his adventures. He is visited by a lady travelling by coach from Bristol, without any luggage but with a young boy. She identifies herself as Grace Richardson with her son Louis; she is much agitated and seeks information from Jim as to the location of Joseph Tait. Jim recalls Tait as being one of the pirates marooned on the island. Jim takes her to the safety of his inn. A party of men approach the inn; Louis is brutally attacked by one of them. Hawkins rushes to the rescue and in so doing, kills the attacker. The dead man's companions besiege the inn, demanding that Jim surrender to the law. Their leader, Sir Thomas Maltby, claims to be a Court Councillor, with power to hold inquiries, convene summary courts and pass sentence, but he is delayed by the intervention of Squire Trelawney, allowing Jim to escape. Maltby says that the dead man was his cousin, the Duke of Berwick. Jim seeks the assistance of his uncle Ambrose Hatt, a well-connected lawyer in Bristol, who manages to delay any legal moves to arrest Jim. It is decided that an expedition must return to Treasure Island to see if Tait is still alive. Grace will still not explain her connection with Tait, but Jim suspects that Louis is his son. The ship Hispaniola, which Jim knows well, is chartered. Under the command of Captain Reid, it sails to the island, but is shadowed by a black- sailed brig, unidentified but possibly owned by Maltby and his followers. Jim accompanies a party of sailors ashore. He is separated from them, and cannot find them again; they have vanished without trace. In a dark cave, he is captured by a man he cannot see, but suspects of being Tait. He barely escapes on a crude raft and drifts for several days before being rescued, more dead than alive. He is unable to speak or see, but discovers that he is on board the black brig, commanded by Maltby. He identifies himself as Mills, an assay clerk sent to value the silver left behind on the island. The ship enters port on a nearby coast, where Jim is given into the case of Dr Ballantyne. When he is sufficiently recovered, Jim explains his story to the doctor, who takes him to visit his neighbour, Long John Silver, now living in comfort in a fine villa. Jim, Silver and Ballantyne join the ship and return to Treasure Island. Jim contrives to board the Hispaniola, whilst Captain Reid keeps Maltby's crew at bay. He had previously claimed to have plague aboard, preventing Maltby from boarding. A fresh expedition searches the island. Many dead bodies are found and it becomes clear that Tait and an unnamed and unseen companion had survived by wrecking ships and brutally enslaving some of the survivors. Tait is captured; his giant companion is killed. Tait is taken on board the Hispaniola. Fighting ensues between the crews of the ships. Tait is killed, as is Maltby. The many dead are buried at sea. Jim now learns at least part of the truth. Maltby stood to inherit the title and estates of the Duke of Berwick if Grace's son Louis died. Grace had been secretly married to the heir of the estate, and Louis was their son. Tait, then a coachman, witnessed the ceremony. Grace and Louis had been fleeing from Maltby. Fortunately, Ambrose Hutt has persuaded Tait to sign a document attesting to the circumstances, before he was killed. Jim had hoped to marry Grace, but he is surprised and disappointed that his Uncle Ambrose, despite the age difference, has got in first. However, Louis comes to stay at the Admiral Benbow until he comes of age and can claim the inheritance. With the fresh treasure taken from the island, Jim further improves the inn and expands its clientele. He builds a small house nearby for Ben Gunn, who had assisted in the expedition.

Ltd., also known as HK, is an Indian diamond conglomerate, headquartered in The Capital, Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai, India. HK was established in 1992 by Savji Dholakia and his three brothers. The company has manufacturing units at Surat in Gujarat and its marketing and sales office in Mumbai. History In 1992, HK started as a small-time diamond cutting and polishing unit in Surat with a few machines and employees. It later expanded to Mumbai to meet a growing demand for raw diamonds. In 2005, HK launched its own jewellery brand - KISNA. Today, it is the largest distributed diamond jewellery brand in India, available in over 6,250 jewellery outlets. KISNA offers over 563 designs of rings, earrings, pendants, necklaces, bangles, bracelets and nose pins. It uses VVS diamonds and 18k hallmarked gold. From 2007 until 2008 HK grew by 49% and recorded a turnover of 1,025 crores ( 260 million at the time). Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd. grew, strength to strength, over the next decade. In 1994 the diamond exports increased multifold after an Israel client's referral to the international clients. In 2001, the ambitious export company made yet another leap as it started to trade and manufacture diamonds of sizes ranging from 0.18 Carat to 0.96 Carat. In the fiscal year 2002-03 Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd. recorded a 200% growth. Initially the export company started to trade and manufacture round diamonds with a value of less than 0.18 carats. The company recorded a turnover of Rs. 1 crore (10 Million) in its first fiscal year of operations to a US$975 million (INR 6,000 crores) in 2013-14 with customer friendly system & services in place. In a span of twenty two years, the company has traveled from being a small entrepreneurial outfit to the position of a Group with interests in domestic and international business arenas. The vertical integration process transformed the company from a mere diamond polisher to one that processes, manufactures and markets polished diamonds and jewellery in the domestic and international markets with affiliates in New York, Hong Kong and Antwerp and Dubai participating in achieving the task. The vertical integration process transformed HK from a small diamond manufacturer to a complete mine-to-market supply chain with supply from miners like Diamond trading company (DTC), Rio Tinto, DDC (earlier BHP), Alrosa. The company is also involved in diamond jewellery manufacturing and exporting H.K. Designs and Unity Jewels. Through H.K. Jewels Pvt. Ltd. the domestic market is being catered to. Kisna Diamond Jewellery is a pan India brand distributed through more than 480 distributors to more than 6500 retail outlets. HK is exporting polished diamonds to 79 countries Currently, HK manufactures over 40,000 carats of diamonds every month (500,000 carats every year).  Controversy  The company received media attention for 'gifting' his employees cars, jewellery and homes as bonuses on Diwali. In 2014, it gifted 491 cars, 525 pieces of diamond jewellery and 200 apartments worth . In 2016, the company gifted 1260 cars and 400 apartments. The company gifted 600 cars in 2018. The claims were disputed by Mera News portal which reported that the employees are paid salary on the cost to company basis and the down payment of the 'gifts' are sourced from the amount deducted from the salary under the title of bonus. The cars are brought under the name of the company and the employees have to sign a job bond of 5 years. The company benefits from the bulk discount and tax credit on the cars. In December 2016, the company was issued notice by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation's (EPFO) Surat regional branch for violating Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and Factory Act after two years of investigation. The company had registered only 17 employees under Employee Provident Fund (EPF) despite employing 3165 people then. It had not paid EPF to employees for several years. The EPFO ordered the company to deposit with 12% annual interest and 25% annual damage penalty.

Results  SHOT's statistical data has been used to decrease bacterial infections through better skin cleansing procedures and the incidence of life-threatening transfusion- related acute lung injury (TRALI) in the UK, by discouraging the use of fresh frozen plasma from female donors. The cause of TRALI is not fully understood, and may have more than one mechanism, but most cases are associated with transfusion of plasma or other blood products that contain some antibodies that the donor developed during pregnancy. Not using plasma donation from female donors for transfusions eliminates the risk of exposing the recipient to pregnancy-related antibodies, and therefore reduces the risk of TRALI. The collected information has also provided evidence to support the pre-existing practice of leukodepletion (depleting the number of leukocytes, or white blood cells, from the product) to reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft- versus-host disease and post-transfusion purpura in immunocompromised patients. SHOT's data has also focused attention on human errors, with the result that staff training and procedures have been improved. For example, SHOT's data demonstrated that increasing the use of wristbands for patient identification and portable, bedside barcode readers reduced the risk of an error caused by human factors.  History  SHOT was established in 1996. During the first ten years, it collected more than 2,000 confidential reports about transfusion safety problems or near misses. During the first two years of voluntary reports, about half of these errors involved giving the wrong type of blood or blood component to a patient. This happens, for example, if hospital staff accidentally take the wrong item out of the blood bank refrigerator. Less than 1% of errors resulted in an infection. By 2012, almost all NHS hospitals, trusts, and health boards had registered with SHOT and were submitting reports. Participation is now mandatory. The \\"Better Blood Transfusion\\" strategy by the UK's Department of Health was based on evidence collected by SHOT.

Like its cousin the sailfin or Japanese sandfish (Arctoscopus japonicus), the Pacific sandfish is a small, deepwater fish distributed over sandy and muddy depths. It is not valued for sushi like its Japanese cousin, but is occasionally caught from piers by recreational anglers.Love, Milton S. (2011). Certainly More Than You Want to Know About The Fishes of The Pacific Coast. Santa Barbara, CA. Pg. 471. . Description and life cycle Pacific sandfish are small, reaching a maximum length of 12 inches (30.5 cm) and a weight of 12 oz (350 g). They have a long, slender body, with a silvery belly and a darker top side with black spots. The fish's fins and tail are long and thin, with a scaleless body. The Pacific sandfish is found over muddy and sandy bottoms to depths of 1,230 feet (375 m). Females lay a clutch of about 1000 eggs during the spawning months in winter. After a one-year incubation, the eggs hatch 0.5 inch (14 mm) larvae. Sandfish larvae are excellent swimmers, swimming freely in open nearshore water, sometimes in the company of juvenile salmon. These schoolings of sandfish and salmon are considered beneficial to the former since the latter swarm in schools and give protection from predators to the normally solitary sandfish. Sandfish and salmon smolt are also considered to have the same diet, which is another theory for these schoolings. At 2‚Äì3 months and 2.5 inches(50‚Äì60 mm) in length, they have attained the laterally compressed adult form, and bury themselves in the seabed. The Pacific sandfish is known to live a maximum of 9 years; females grow larger than males. Adult sandfish are only known to inhabit sandy shores along beaches, whereas the egg masses are usually laid near rocky shores where they can be attached to rocks and seaweed easier. The larvae must begin swimming and schooling immediately after birth because they have a high metabolism and must eat almost constantly. The sandfish has a synchronized hatching method that ultimately prevents the eggs from getting beaten or destroyed by the waves. The eggs are laid and hatched at the lowest tides of the year to avoid the powerful storms. The baby fish begin to look like their parents at 25 days of age, when their mouth becomes upturned and their fins become bigger, like their parents'. At fifty-six days, they bury in the sand; this is when they truly begin to look like sandfish. Finally, at seventy days, they are considered to be full grown.MARLIAVE,J. B. 1980. Spawn and larvae of the Pacific sandfish, Trichodon trichodon. U. S. Nat. Mar. Fish. Serv. Fish. Bull. 78:959-964. Diet Pacific sandfish are mostly shrimp eaters, feeding by waiting for small fish, shrimp or krill to come into range and then sucking the prey up with its unusually large upturned mouth. The sandfish's teeth are needle-sharp for grasping prey. Most shrimp eaten are between 1 and 3 inches long. The sandfish waits for prey by burying itself in sand or mud and using is upturned eyes to watch passing prey. Sandfish themselves are preyed upon by Pacific cod and Pacific halibut. Seabirds such as pigeon guillemots, gulls, and puffins will also prey on sandfishes.Seabirds: feeding ecology and role in marine ecosystems. . 1986. Page 238.

Officially released on October 24, 2014, the Passport is inspired by its namesake and incorporates features designed to make the device attractive to enterprise users, such as a unique square-shaped display measuring 4.5 inches diagonally, a compact physical keyboard with touchpad gestures, and the latest release of the company's BlackBerry 10 operating system. Reception to the Passport was mixed; critics praised the quality of the device's design, screen, and keyboard for meeting the company's goals of creating a business- oriented device, along with an improved application selection through the integration of Amazon's Appstore for Android (taking advantage of the Android software support provided by BlackBerry 10) alongside BlackBerry's own store for native software. Criticism of the Passport was focused primarily on its irregular form factor, with its width being even wider than most phablet smartphones, making the device difficult to carry and use one-handed due to its increased width, while its keyboard was criticized for having made a subtle but perceptible layout change in comparison to past BlackBerry devices. Development In January 2014, BlackBerry Limited's new CEO John Chen indicated that, following the unsuccessful launch of BlackBerry 10 and its accompanying, consumer-oriented touchscreen devices (such as the BlackBerry Z10), along with the company's major loss of market share to competing smartphones such as Android devices and the iPhone line, the company planned to shift its focus back towards the enterprise market as part of its restructuring plan, and primarily manufacture phones that feature physical keyboards. In June 2014, Chen publicly teased two of the company's upcoming models, the BlackBerry Passport‚Äîa smartphone with a square display, along with a successor to the Q10 known as the BlackBerry Classic, incorporating the array of navigation keys featured on past BlackBerry OS devices. The company's return to a business-oriented focus influenced the design and functionality of the Passport; the overall design of the device was designed to evoke a similar form to its namesake, \\"a familiar and universal symbol of mobility\\". BlackBerry also touted that the use of a square-shaped, 4.5-inch display, rather than the rectangular 16:9 displays of other smartphones, in combination with its physical keyboard, would provide more room on-screen for business- oriented tasks such as document editing, image viewing (such as architectural schematics and x-rays), and web browsing. The company also noted that the increased width of the display would allow the Passport to show 60 characters per line of text, nearing a recommended measure for books at 66 per line. Development of the Passport began in 2013; while even Chen himself was hesitant about the device due to its unusual form factor, he decided to allow continued development of the Passport, believing that it carried unique design qualities in comparison to other, competing smartphones. BlackBerry officially released the Passport on September 24, 2014 during a press event featuring retired NHL player Wayne Gretzky; describing the device as being aimed towards \\"power professionals\\" who are \\"achievement oriented\\" and \\"highly productive\\", Chen remarked that the goals of the Passport were to \\"drive productivity\\" and \\"break through the sea of rectangular-screen, all-touch devices.\\" Chen also joked about Apple's recent \\"bendgate\\" incident during the presentation, remarking that unlike the iPhone 6, \\"bending [the Passport] needs a little effort.\\" BlackBerry announced plans to release the Passport in over 30 countries by the end of 2014; following the event, unlocked models of the Passport were made available for purchase on BlackBerry's website in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as Amazon. Telus in Canada and AT&T; in the United States were announced as the first two North American carriers to offer the Passport. According to Blackberry's blog page, the BlackBerry World App store (12/31/2019), the BlackBerry Travel site (February 2018), and the Playbook video calling service (March 2018) will cease functioning. However vital infrastructure services for both BBOS and BB10 will continue to be provided by BlackBerry beyond December 2019. Specifications The BlackBerry Passport has dimensions similar to that of an international passport, and incorporates a steel frame with matte plastic as part of its design. The device utilizes a compact variation of BlackBerry's traditional physical keyboard design, using a modified layout with three rows and a small spacebar located in the middle of the bottom row alongside the remaining letters. Functions previously found on the fourth row (such as symbols and the Shift key) are accessible through a context-sensitive on- screen toolbar. The keyboard is also touch-sensitive; acting as a touchpad, it can register sliding gestures across its keys for scrolling, text selection, word deletion, and autocomplete suggestions. The original Passport design was produced in Black, with both White and a limited edition Red coloured versions announced on November 24, 2014. Three additional variations were later released: An AT&T; version, a limited edition Black & Gold version and The Silver Edition. The AT&T; version, announced at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Nevada and later made available on February 20, 2015 has a rounded frame requested by the carrier rather than the hard-edged shape of the international version. The limited edition Black & Gold version was a limited run of only 50 devices that featured a gold coloured rim in place of the stainless steal and came with a Valextra soft calf leather case and was engraved with the production number. While BlackBerry did not disclose the number made available on its site, the device sold out the same day as it was made available. The Silver Edition retains the rounded corners similar to the AT&T; version at the bottom edge and has a metallic colour scheme with a reinforced steel frame to provide extra strength and durability.http://blogs.blackberry.com/2015/08/updating-an-icon-design-qa-on- blackberry-passport-silver-edition/ The keyboard in this version was improved to make typing easier while the corners and a diamond weave pattern on the back were intended to improve grip. Finally, bevelled edges around the front facing camera and a raised border around the rear facing camera were added to protect the lenses from wear and tear. BlackBerry Passport Silver Edition =Hardware= The Passport features a square-shaped 4.5-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1440√ó1440, as opposed to a 16:9 display, making the Passport considerably wider than other phablets currently available. The Passport includes a quad-core, 2.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 system-on-chip with 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of expandable, internal storage, along with a non- removable 3450 mAh battery rated for at least 30 hours of mixed usage. The Passport also includes a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization, and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera. During phone calls, the Passport can measure ambient noise using a microphone in its earpiece, which can then be used to automatically adjust call volume. =Software= The Passport is preloaded with BlackBerry 10.3, the latest version of BlackBerry's operating system at launch. The new version features a refreshed interface, a personal digital assistant known as BlackBerry Assistant, BlackBerry Blend, an application that allows the user to access information from their device on their smartphone and tablet such as email, documents, images and BBM, the company's own direct messaging service, alongside other new features. Alongside BlackBerry World for native applications, 10.3 also includes the third-party Amazon Appstore, offering Android apps that can run on the Passport. Connectivity-wise, both the AT&T; and International versions of the Passport ship with a quad-band GSM radio and penta-band UMTS radio. The international version of the Passport also ships with a 10-band LTE radio supporting Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17 and 20. The AT&T; version, however, supports only 9 bands and does not support LTE-FDD band 13 which is supported by the International version. Both devices also come with a 802.11ac WiFi transceiver with hotspot and Wi-Fi Direct capabilities and a Bluetooth 4.0 transceiver. Lastly, both versions sport an FM radio with RDS capabilities, support Miracast screen mirroring, as well as HDMI and VGA output via SlimPort. Reception The BlackBerry Passport received mixed reviews. Nate Ralph of CNET was positive in assessing the Passport, praising the quality of the Passport's display for meeting BlackBerry's stated goals of providing a display optimized primarily for reading and editing documents, its keyboard for having a \\"spacious typing experience\\", and unique touch gestures. The operating system was also praised for its performance, and for providing a better selection of apps through the Amazon Store, although the Assistant was panned for being slower than its competitors, and it was also noted that some apps (particularly Android games) might not be optimized well for the Passport's square screen. However, he believed that BlackBerry had gone \\"a step too far\\" in its attempt to design a device specifically for the enterprise market, noting that the size of the device made it difficult to use one-handed even in comparison with phablets, concluding that the company's \\"myopic focus on text and productivity comes at the cost of creating a device as pleasant to hold as it would be to use, and that decision keeps the Passport from eclipsing its well-rounded peers.\\" Dan Seifert of The Verge praised its design for being robust and not needing a \\"clunky Otterbox\\" to withstand multiple drops, along with its display for having a high resolution and good viewing angles, its call quality, a sufficient camera (although it was panned for being slow to launch and take photos), and full-day battery life. The majority of criticism was derived from its form factor; the dimensions of the Passport (which made the device wider than both the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the iPhone 6 Plus) were criticized for making the device \\"uncomfortable\\" and difficult to carry in a pocket or use one-handed. The dimensions were also considered a hinder on productivity, noting that some use cases (such as watching videos and using Twitter) did not adapt well to the square screen, and that the device's keyboard was not as good as past BlackBerry phones due to its irregular layout, but still praised it for maintaining the company's traditional quality. The BlackBerry 10.3 operating system was praised for its refreshed appearance, and its attempt to address the platform's small number of third-party apps by bundling Amazon Appstore (despite still lacking key apps), but was criticized for its learning curve, performance issues (despite the device's relatively powerful hardware), and for similarly having mechanics that were \\"clumsy\\" and hindered productivity. In conclusion, Seifert stated in response to BlackBerry believing \\"power pros\\" would still carry another smartphone alongside their Passport, \\"if I can get my job done with just [an iPhone], why bother carrying two?\\" Joanna Stern of The Wall Street Journal was similarly negative, remarking that while BlackBerry still had the best e-mail client of any smartphone platform, the Passport's keyboard was inferior to that of past BlackBerry devices, and shared criticism surrounding the device's design. She felt that the Passport demonstrated that BlackBerry was still \\"living in the past\\" in regards to its view of the smartphone industry and users' apparent need for a phone specifically for work usage‚Äîespecially one that is such irregularly designed. In a preliminary review, Engadget noted that even with Amazon Appstore available, there was not enough software for the device, and concluded that \\"[the Passport] is built well and the keyboard is comfortable, but be prepared for a few odd stares from those around you.\\" It was also noted that the size and shape of the Passport were similar to a previous Android phablet‚Äîthe LG Optimus Vu. =Sales= Within 6 hours, 258,000 Passports were sold, and pre- order stock on both Amazon and BlackBerry's websites was sold out within 6 hours.

A Native American mascot, \\"Chief Moccanooga\\", was used until 1996. There was a short time in the 1980s when a moccasin shoe was used as the mascot. Due to politically sensitive issues, it was decided to drop the use of Native American imagery. The nickname \\"Moccasins\\" was shortened to \\"Mocs\\" and the state bird was selected as mascot. The primary logo was Scrappy at the throttle of a steam locomotive from 1997 until 2007. This tied in with Chattanooga's history as a major railroad hub. Scrappy underwent a re-design in 2008 to better match the appearance of a Northern mockingbird, and dropped the railroad imagery at the same time. Scrappy has remained the same since 2008, other than a few minor alterations. In 2009, Scrappy appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon prior to the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.

Background  The 1846 Mallarino‚ÄìBidlack Treaty, signed by Republic of New Granada (Colombia and Panama) and the United States, obligated the United States to maintain \\"neutrality\\" in the Colombian state of Panama in exchange for transit rights in the isthmus on behalf of Colombia. Chile's influence in the region followed its victory in the War of the Pacific. In this war, Chile defeated Bolivia and Peru and gained large swathes of territory from both, removing Bolivia's access to the sea. U.S. sympathies lay with Bolivia and Peru, and Chile rejected American attempts to mediate. A Peruvian attempt to cede a naval base to the U.S. in Chimbote Bay in 1881 was blocked when Chile, learning of the deal, sent marines to occupy Chimbote.  Panama Crisis  In March 1885 Colombia thinned its military presence in Panama by sending troops who had been stationed there to fight rebels in Cartagena. These favourable conditions prompted an insurgency in Panama. The United States Navy was sent there to keep order, in light of invoking its obligations according to the treaty being signed in 1846. On 7 April, the screw sloop USS Shenandoah arrived in Panama City and three days later, other American ships started arriving in Col√≥n, Panama. On 27 April a force of marines was landed in Panama City to help suppress rebels who had taken over the city when local troops had moved out to deal with a revolt in Col√≥n. The next day, federal troops from Colombia arrived from Buenaventura, Colombia's nearest Pacific port. By this time, there was also a small force of the National Army of Colombia supported by a strong contingent of American troops in Col√≥n. In response to the American intervention, Chile sent the protected cruiser Esmeralda to Panama City, arriving on April 28. The Esmeraldas captain was ordered to stop by any means an eventual annexation of Panama by the United States.William Sater, Chile and the United States: Empires in Conflict (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1990), 52. . According to a U.S. publication in August 1885, right after the Panama events, \\"[The Esmeralda] could destroy our whole navy, ship by ship and never be touched once.\\" By the time Esmeralda arrived, however, the situation in Panama had been settled. The Americans withdrew from Panama City, which was occupied by the Colombian government on 30 April. See also *Burning of Col√≥n *Bowman H.

Cui was a well-known contemporary artist in China. Her works have been collected by museums such as Tate Modern and the Brooklyn Museum.Tate Modern Collection at CAFA Info  Life and work  Cui Xiuwen was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. She attended the Fine Arts School of Northeast Normal University and graduated in 1990. She then went on to study at China's Central Academy of Fine Arts and received her Master's of Fine Arts in 1996. At the time of her death in 2018 she lived and worked in Beijing, China. She exhibited her work at Tate Modern, Florence Museum, Today Art Museum (Beijing), Fabien Fryns Fine Art, Eli Klein Fine Art Gallery (New York), Blindspot Gallery (Hong Kong), and Art Stage Singapore. Cui has been identified as part of the Chinese Feminism movement, although she stated the following in an Artslant interview: \\"I think it's very limiting. It seems to just be a feature of the art market and very difficult to escape.\\" She is best known for her work Ladies' Room (2000), which was censored from being exhibited at the first Guangzhou Triennial. In this work, Cui hid an inconspicuous spy camera inside the ladies' bathroom of a popular Beijing karaoke club, recording unfiltered conversations and candid moments of local call girls getting ready for clients. In her series of photographs titled Existential Emptiness (2009), a schoolgirl and her life-sized doll companion are depicted in sparse and snowy landscapes, tackling themes of adolescence, identity, and mortality. In her Angel series, Cui featured a pregnant Asian woman with porcelain skin and rosy cheeks in a ‚Äúvirginal‚Äù white dress. Since pregnancy of young unmarried girls is considered taboo in China, this series makes social commentary about the double standards and treatment of women in China. Most of Cui's work incorporated traditional Chinese scroll paintings, in which the natural landscape beauty is more important than the people. Sanjie is Cui's remake of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, in which all thirteen characters are played by the same girl, with a red scarf around her neck, in order to represent communist themes. Cui's major exhibitions include: Reincarnation, Shanghai Gallery of Art, Shanghai, China (2014); The Love of Soul, Today Art Museum, Beijing, China (2014); Inspired by the Opera: Contemporary Chinese Photography and Video, Smart Museum of Art, the University of Chicago, Chicago (2014); IU: You & Me, Suzhou Art Museum, Suzhou, China (2013); Spiritual Realm, Today Art Museum, Beijing, China (2010); Talk Statement, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei, Taiwan; National Museum of China, Beijing, China (2009); Our Future: The Guy & Myriam Ullens Collection, UCCA, Beijing, China (2008); Floating ‚Äì New Generation of Art in China, National Museum of Contemporary Art, Gwacheon, Korea (2007); The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now, MoMA PS1, New York, NY (2006); Untitled: Julia Loktev, Julika Rudelius, Cui Xiuwen, Tate Modern, London, UK (2004) and Alors, la Chine?, Centre Pompidou, Paris, France (2003). Cui has received numerous awards and distinctions that have placed her among the most influential modern Chinese artists.

In 2008, she was awarded the Outstanding Female Artist Biennial Award from Shu-Fang Hsiao Art Foundation as well as the Shu-Fang Hsiao Art Fund Award for Outstanding Female Artist given by Wu Zuoren International Foundation of Fine Arts.

Registered in the UK, The Group provides integrated operating services within the oil and gas sector and is also developing its exploration and production capabilities.  History and development  Nobel Oil Ltd was originally established in 2005 by Nasib Hasanov > Nobel Upstream, a UK company ‚Äúwith a best practice governance framework and > sound risk management and internal control systems‚Äù, is owned by Nasib > Hasanov, a ‚Äúprivate oil and gas entrepreneur and philanthropist‚Äù from > Azerbaijan, who is the sole shareholder of the Nobel Upstream group and > Nobel Oil Services group of companies... as a technical service provider, offering services to the oil and gas industry in the Caspian region. These include wells‚Äô work over, drilling, installation, construction, engineering and maintenance, repair and operations services. In 2013, Nobel Oil undertook a comprehensive strategic review of its business, with a focus on assessing the company's organizational capabilities, strategic goals, operating markets and growth options both regionally and globally. In 2014, Nobel Oil reorganised its corporate structure to place its Azerbaijan- based businesses under a parent company headquartered in the UK and align its business processes with international standards. As a result, all service segments of the oil and gas industry were united under Nobel Oil Services (UK) Limited, while the exploration & production business was separated under the name of Nobel Upstream. Nobel Oil Services (UK) Limited was founded on 25 June 2014 and registered in the United Kingdom. Nobel Oil Services (UK) Limited is a parent company of Global Energy Solutions LLC, Prokon LLC, Absheron Drilling LLC, Llamrei DMCC, etc. In 2014, Nobel Oil E&P; (UK) Limited was established under a Nobel Upstream trademark. Nobel Oil E&P; (UK) Limited is a parent company of Nobel Oil E&P; Caspian Limited, Nobel Oil E&P; North Sea Limited, Nobel Oil E&P; North America (UK) Limited, and Nobel Oil E&P; North America LLC. In 2016, Nobel Upstream made an investment in the UK North Sea, buying a 7.59% stake in the Maclure oil field from Shell Oil. Royal Dutch Shell sold North Sea oil field, in a transaction with UK Nobel Upstream for an undisclosed fee. Later, Nobel Upstream's CEO Jeremy Huck resigned; no farewell statement or reason was issued by the Group. Nobel Upstream is the majority shareholder of a large acreage position in the Permian Basin (North America). With its operating partner Three Span Oil & Gas, Nobel Upstream started producing oil and gas in August 2014. =Owners and top management= Nasib Hasanov, an Azerbaijan-born businessman, is the founder and owner of Nobel Oil Services (UK) Limited and Nobel Oil E&P; (UK) Limited, both registered in the UK. =Development of Umid gas field= Since 2008, the Group has been developing its exploration and production capabilities through its participation in the exploration of the Umid offshore gas-condensate field located 75 kilometres south of the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. The Umid offshore gas-condensate field is in the water depth range 40 ‚Äì 80 m. It is being explored under the agreement between SOCAR and Nobel Oil Exploration and Production Ltd. The Parties have following participating interests in the Umid project: SOCAR ‚Äì 80%, Nobel Oil Exploration and Production Ltd. ‚Äì 20%. President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan placed strong hopes in development of the Umid gas field, remarking in 2010, \\"This field has a great future.\\" He made similar comments in 2012. The joint venture with Nobel Oil Group has drilled three wells in the Umid gas field since 2012. One well failed, while the other two produced decreasing amounts of natural gas: in 2012 ‚Äì 1,500 thousand cubic meters of gas, 2013 ‚Äì 638,000 cubic meters, and in 2014 - 630,000 cubic meters of gas per day. The plan was to drill a total of six wells, producing one million to 1.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day. But, as of October 2014, Nobel Oil Group and its partner decided to stop all drilling due to \\"technical problems in the production process.\\" They announced a new international tender for a foreign partner to lead the way and create a new strategy. As of January 2016, they have not received such a tender. Since March 2015 Nobel Oil Group and its partner decided to drill a new appraisal well to get a better estimate of gas reserves in Umid; they hope that this drilling expense will be absorbed by the future foreign partner. The Nobel Oil Group and its partner require the new foreign partner to have not only the skills and experience of deep-water offshore drilling, but also have available cash reserves. According to analysts, the Umid (\\"Hope\\") gas field was too technologically challenging for the two companies developing it, despite their spending some US$5 billion already by 2010. Given that this was a period of high gas prices, they projected about $45 billion in net operating income. Since 2010 expenses have increased whilst natural gas market prices have fallen. Services Nobel Oil has a number of services carried out by different subsidiaries of their company. *Absheron Qazma: Provides integrated drilling and well management services. Such services include well design and planning, drilling operations, casing string design, well completion, well workover and more. *Global Energy Solutions: Provides equipment maintenance services, typically to customers in Azerbaijan's energy industry. *Prokon: Offers project management services. *Llamrei: Offers procurement, logistics and warehouse activities. *Nobel Oil Downstream: Nobel's retail gasoline service stations in Romania.

As a graphic designer, he achieved recognition for his New Yorker magazine covers.  Early life  Original Painting for cover of New Yorker Magazine, January 9, 1932 Gouache on board, 14 1/2\\" X 11\\" Theodore Haupt was the second youngest of five children born to an Episcopalian Minister, Reverend Charles Edgar Haupt and Alexandria Dougon, in St. Paul Minnesota on October 11, 1902. Reverend Haupt's father was General Herman Haupt who supervised the railroads, built bridges for the Union Army during the Civil War and became an outspoken voice in President Lincoln's White House during that troubled time. Haupt's early gifts for drawing and painting were noted but not encouraged by his family. Nonetheless, he persevered and was further inspired when, at age twenty-one, his paintings received highly favorable reviews in a large exhibition mounted by The Beard Gallery in Minneapolis. Haupt attended the Minneapolis School of Art, studying with Anthony Angarola, recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and an acclaimed Chicago modernist. A critical turning point came for Haupt in 1923, when he won a scholarship to the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. Haupt remained in Europe for two years, studying with the sculptor and painter, Andr√© L‚ÄôHote in Paris, Vienna and Gratz.  Graphic designer career  In 1927 Haupt moved to New York, renting an apartment on East 10th Street in Manhattan. For five years Haupt supported his studio art with graphic design assignments for The New Yorker, Charm and Vanity Fair magazines; his debut cover for The New Yorker being produced almost immediately in September of that first year. Between 1927 and 1933, Haupt turned out a staggering forty- five covers for The New Yorker presenting a gamut of subjects from; * New York City at night * a view of Park Avenue (October 26, 1929 issue), now in the collection of the Museum of the City of New York. * art deco-style interpretations of annual events and social commentaries  The 1930s  Barbara in Plume Hat 1933 Oil on Canvas, 22\\" X 18\\" Haupt's modernist paintings were being exhibited in New York art galleries and at museums around the country. Two of his paintings were selected for The Art Institute of Chicago‚Äôs 45th Annual Exhibition (October 24-December 8, 1935), Sea Beach (#91) and Shadow Lane (#92). Haupt‚Äôs works were shown at a number of museums, among them The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art; The Minneapolis Institute of Art; and The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Haupt continued turning out paintings and executing art for public spaces including work for the Whitney Museum and a mural for the Central Park Zoo, which was destroyed in a restoration of the zoo. Along with many other artists during the depression, Haupt was active in the period‚Äôs government sponsored WPA Art Programs, an experience that encouraged an open-minded and experimental attitude in his art practice for the remainder of his life. Haupt recalled the sculptor Louise Nevelson‚Äôs lively ‚Äúrent parties‚Äù which he attended with other WPA artists including Ivan Albright and Moses Soyer.The reference for family dates and Theodore Haupt‚Äôs personal history and recollections are those of his niece, Sally Pleet, also an artist, to whom Haupt left many of his surviving paintings and papers. Additional documents are on file with the Archives of American Art, New York.  A new direction  The Duchess 1946 (Miriam Haupt) Oil on Board, 24\\" X 20\\" In 1942, Haupt married a school teacher, Miriam Diehl. Her steady employment sustained the couple financially. Haupt and his wife purchased a house in Peekskill, New York in 1941 and in 1948 moved to San Miguel de Allende, an artist's community in Mexico. Haupt became increasingly engrossed in that country's cultural contrasts, an interest that expressed itself in paintings and sculptures of this period. While in Mexico the couple built a house and adopted two children, Gloria and Maricella. After Miriam's unfortunate early death, her pension continued to sustain the artist as the demand for illustration lessened. Now in a financial position to walk away from the machinations of the art market, Haupt embarked upon an extended period of renewed investigation and experimentation, working his way through abstract, color-drenched, non-representational painting styles and developing a series of Surrealist-inspired canvases. Haupt later investigated chromatic vibrations and dynamic optical effects in a series of compelling Op Art canvases. His career began as a realistic portrait painter and he often returned to that subject matter, reinterpreting the process each time in light of his stylistic investigations.  Last years  When his wife died in the 1960s, the artist moved to Hawaii with his children, later resettling in New York in the Westbeth Artist's Community in Greenwich Village. Returning briefly to Hawaii in 1968, he connected with a lifelong supporter, Dan Wall, at the University of Hawaii. Theodore Haupt died at the age of 87, in Indianapolis, June 13, 1990.

Her summertime friend, Beth Ellen, sometimes called Mouse, is also in Water Mill with her grandmother. Mysterious anonymous notes start showing up all over town; they have a religious slant and expose the faults of the recipients. Harriet is determined to find out who is leaving them. She suspects anyone who reads the Bible. Harriet drags Beth Ellen along on spying expeditions directed against Bunny, the piano-playing manager of the local hotel, and the Jenkinses, an eccentric southern family preoccupied with money- making schemes. Harriet's friend Janie and Mrs Plumber from Harriet the Spy also appear. Beth Ellen learns that her mother, who left when she was five, is returning from Europe with her new husband. Her grandmother expects Beth Ellen to be excited by the news but she is indifferent. Her mother Zeeney turns out to be a beautiful but shallow socialite who is dissatisfied with her shy and serious daughter. Beth Ellen's dislike of her mother finally explodes in a temper tantrum which clears her head, leaving her happier and more confident.

The International Whaling Commission (IWC) and The Committee of Three Allen worked on the International Whaling Commission's panel termed The Committee of Three that found new methods to calculate whaling quotas.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/11/world/douglas-g-chapman-76-expert- in-the-demographics-of-whales.html The group analyzed whaling data (catches, the number of whaling boats etc.) to come up with proposals for annual quotas for whales. The panel's report, in 1961, was the international whaling commission's first attempt to come up with quotas that would permit whaling while allowing the whale population to increase. The three scientists on the panel (Allen, Douglas G. Chapman and Sidney Holt) were selected because they specialized in fisheries research but were not officially connected with Norway, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Japan or Britain, the countries conducting the whaling they were to study. The quotas recommended were so much lower than usual that the whaling countries argued over them for many years but eventually they had to lower the quotas. However the whaling countries first adopted interim, compromise quotas which were higher than recommended.
