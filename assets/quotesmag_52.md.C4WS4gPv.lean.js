The site is east of present-day Colorado Springs, Colorado on the southeast side of U.S. Route 24 and east of the junction with State Highway 94. Located along Trapper's Trail / Cherokee Trail, it was a rest stop for travelers and was known for its spring. Jimmy Camp was a ranch by 1870 and then a railway station on a spur of the Colorado and Southern Railway. After the ranch was owned by several individuals, it became part of the Banning Lewis Ranch. Now the land is an undeveloped park in Colorado Springs. Fur trading and trail station =Jimmy's Camp Trail= The site was located on Jimmy's Camp Trail, along old Native American trails which became the Trapper's Trail and Cherokee Trail, which ran between the North Platte, South Platte and Arkansas Rivers. The north-south route had two southern branches. One branch from Bent's Old Fort and another that began in Taos and Santa Fe. They met at the confluence of the Arkansas River and Fountain Creek near present-day Pueblo, then the route ran north along the banks of Fountain Creek to Jimmy Camp Creek at Fountain. The trail went overland through present-day Black Forest to Cherry Creek where it was followed to the South Platte River. From there, the trail forked and Trapper's Trail went to Fort Laramie and Cherokee Trail went northwest to intersect with the Oregon-California Trail. There was another trail that ran closer through present-day Colorado Springs along the foothills. It approximates the route of Interstate 25, but the trail was not as safe as this more direct route used by many Native Americans and trappers because it was safer and not frequented by hostile Native Americans. Jimmy Camp Road or Jimmy Camp Trail branch of the longer Trapper's Trail / Cherokee Trail connected Fountain and Russellville. Cattle trails. The Goodnight‚ÄìLoving Trail is the westernmost north-south trail to Cheyenne. Cattle was driven north along the Goodnight‚ÄìLoving Trail to Cheyenne through Jimmy's Camp. =Trading post, stage station and camp site= Jimmy built a cabin or a crude adobe hut on lowland between Jimmy Camp Creek and a spring. Trappers, Utes and other Native Americans traded furs and food (deer, buffalo, other game, and corn) for goods, guns and whiskey that Jimmy acquired from the East. Jimmy lit a signal fire to let Native Americans know when he returned with a new selection of goods. The spot was known for its spring and a place where people and their horses could rest along the trail. In addition to shade afforded by pine and cottonwood trees, there was plenty of grass for grazing around the spring. The first recorded trapper to use the trail past Jimmy's Camp Creek was William Sublette (1829). Kit Carson came through in 1831. Individuals who camped at the site included frontiersman Jim Baker, explorer John C. Fr√©mont, Rufus Sage (1842), Francis Parkman (1846), and the Mormans (1847). It was also visited by gold prospectors passing through the area during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush who learned about the trail from guidebooks. There was stage service from Denver to Pueblo, with Jimmy's Camp and other stops in between. =Namesake= Jimmy's Camp was often said to have been named after Jimmy Daugherty, who had been a member of Major Stephen Harriman Long's expedition. He was believed to have built a cabin in the 1820s or 1830s. Jimmy Camp Creek was first called Daugherty Creek. Authors Alice Polk Hill and L.W. Cutler state that it was named for a small Irishman Jimmy Boyer, employed by the fur trading company, who established a trading post in 1833. Frank Hall states in the History of the State of Colorado and local resident Edgar Howbert and local historian John O'Byrne state that Jimmy Hayes or Hays established a trading post in 1833. John Steele of the Mormon Battalion of 1847 believed that Jimmy's Camp was named for Dr. Edwin James of Long's 1820 expedition. =Jimmy's murder and marker= Native Americans came to his cabin or hut one day to find that he has been robbed and murdered. They followed tracks left by men from Mexico until they found them, and hung them from trees by their toes. They returned to Jimmy's cabin, buried him, and covered his grave with a large flat stone. James Beckwourth, a scout, said that he led the Native Americans who killed the Mexicans. Rufus Sage said that Jimmy was killed by a Mexican man who traveled with him and stole some calico. This occurred prior to September 1842 when Sage camped at the site. The crude hut crumbled away after Jimmy's death. A marker was installed by the Kinnikinnik Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1949. It says, \\"This tablet is the property of the State of Colorado\\" / \\"One mile southeast are the spring and site of Jimmy's Camp / Named for Jimmy (last name undetermined), an early trader who was murdered there. A famous camp site on the trail connecting the Arkansas and Platte Rivers and variously known as \\"Trappers' Trail, \\" \\"Cherokee Trail\\" and \\"Jimmy's Camp Trail.\\" Site visited by Rufus Sage (1842), Francis Parkman (1846), Mormons (1847), and by many gold seekers of 1858-59.\\" Jimmy Camp Ranch The site, called Jimmy Camp Ranch and old Jimmy Camp mine, was purchased in 1870 by early settler Matt France, who established a ranch and raised stock there. He became a mayor of the city of Colorado Springs. France and Mort Parsons built a house in 1870. In 1873, France raised a group of men from Colorado Springs to march out to Jimmy‚Äôs Camp to meet with a group of 3,000 Cheyenne. They had been killing cattle on the ranch because \\"the white man has been killing our buffalo.\\" The France coal mine was established by 1885 near Jimmy's Camp. Railway The Denver and New Orleans Railroad ran alongside Jimmy Camp Creek from Denver to Jimmy's Camp and then to Fountain and Pueblo by 1880. Between 1898 and 1913, Colorado and Southern Railway operated on the rails. A half a mile east of Jimmy Camp was a railway station called Manitou Junction for Denver and New Orleans Railroad and the Colorado and Southern Railway. From there, passengers could take a nine-mile train road to Colorado Springs. A post office station, called Jimmy Camp, operated between 1878 and 1879. Banning Lewis Ranch After France, there were other people who ranched on the land, which was ultimately became part of the Banning Lewis Ranch. It is currently an undeveloped park in Colorado Springs.

Route description Highway 250 near the western terminus Highway 250 begins at U.S. Highway 71 Business (US 71B) south of Waldron in Southwest Arkansas. It runs east through a sparsely populated rural area before entering the Ouachita National Forest. The route runs east, paralleling Dutch Creek until an intersection with Highway 80, where it terminates. The ArDOT maintains Highway 250 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the Department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. As of 2016, the highway was estimated to have 320 vehicles per day (VPD). Highways under 400 VPD are classified as very low volume local road by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). No segment of Highway 250 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Major intersections History Highway 250 was created on July 10, 1957 by the Arkansas State Highway Commission during a period of expansion in the state highway system..

They are known as the 'Lions'.  History  The club was founded by the merger of Colonel Light Western (1927-1930, South Adelaide District & YMCA Association) and Mortlock Park (1927-1930, Mid Southern Association) in 1931. For its first two seasons of playing in the SAAFL, the club applied to join the South Australian National Football League. The club was admitted to the newly formed SA National Junior Football Association before moving back to the SAAFL in 1937. In 1938, it was represented at state level by Sturt player Gil Langley who was one of the five state players the club produced. The Lions rose to Division 1 and contested the finals three seasons in a row while the club was also fielding teams in the Sturt District Association. During the 1960s, Colonel Light Gardens saw a downfall, dropping down to Division 2 and then to Division 4 in the 1970s before moving again to the Glenelg South league in 1976. The Lions remained there until 1986 when it combined with the Kenilworth Football Club to form Kenilworth-Colonel Light and thus going back to the SAAFL. The merger only lasted for five years, with the Lions reverting to Colonel Light Gardens in 1991. In 1995 it was forced to share its home ground, Mortlock Park, with the Goodwood Indians Baseball Club who had their own facilities on the site, with the Mitcham Council ultimately ceasing the club's uses with the clubrooms for events due to complaints from local residents.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. Azurite Peak is situated north of Azurite Pass on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Tower Mountain, to the south-southeast, and Mount Ballard lies to the north. Remnants of a small pocket glacier are found on the east aspect. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the base of Azurite Peak. Climate Azurite Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains.Azurite Peak from east As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Azurite Peak seen from North Cascades Highway near Ross Lake The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was built by Kerr, Stuart and Company in 1909, and was delivered to the Kerry Tramway in Mid Wales, in 1917. After varied service in the Welsh slate industry, Diana was purchased by railway enthusiast Graham Mullis in 1964. After many years at a variety of location, Diana was purchased by a Talyllyn Railway volunteer in 2014, and restored to working order in 2015.  Industrial service  Diana was built in 1909 by Kerr, Stuart as part of an order for six gauge locomotives for Mauritius. Although several of the locomotives in the order were sent to Mauritius, Diana wasn‚Äôt delivered and stayed at Kerr, Stuart's factory in Stoke on Trent. In 1917, the locomotive was purchased by the Home Grown Timber Committee of the Board of Trade for use on the Kerry Tramway, near Newtown, Powys in Mid Wales. It was regauged to and delivered to Kerry, Powys. The Kerry Tramway closed in 1922, though a short length was retained, and worked by an unknown locomotive, probably Diana. In 1925, Diana was sold to the Oakeley Quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog, where it worked for the next twenty years. In 1945, it was sold on to the Pen-yr-Orsedd Quarry in the Nantlle Valley, where it and worked until its boiler was condemned in 1950.  Preservation  In August 1964, Graham Mullis visited Pen-yr-Orsedd. He purchased Diana, which by then was derelict. He moved the locomotive to his private Wychbold Railway at Droitwich. He sold his collection in October 1970, and Diana was purchased by Tony Hills, who moved it to Gilfach Ddu on the Llanberis Lake Railway. In 1972, Diana moved to Hills' new base at the recently opened Brecon Mountain Railway. At some point, Diana was sold to D. Davies of Clydach near Swansea. It was partly restored by Alan Keef in the late 1990s. Following Davies‚Äô death, Diana was purchased in 2014 by Talyllyn Railway volunteer Phil Mason. Mason completed Dianas restoration to working order at the workshops of the Vale of Rheidol Railway, in Aberystwyth. Restoration of the locomotive was completed in October 2015, and it was launched into service on the Bala Lake Railway at the end of that year. In 2017 the loco was 100 years old and was taken on a tour around some of the UK's railways visiting Statfold Barn , Beamish, The Ffestiniog & Welsh Highland, Apedale, Amerton and Leighton Buzzard. Following the tour, the locomotive underwent minor alterations at Statfold Barn in late 2017. In early 2018, Diana moved to the Amerton Railway.

The event was first brought to attention after a report was published by Human Rights Watch, which detailed accounts of rape and killings from survivors.  Background  The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that mainly live in the northern region of Rakhine State, Myanmar, and have been described as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. In modern times, the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar dates back to the 1970s. Since then, Rohingya people have regularly been made the target of persecution by the government and nationalist Buddhists. The tension between various religious groups in the country had often been exploited by the past military governments of Myanmar. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have suffered from human rights violations under past military dictatorships since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had assisted with the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas remained in IDP camps after communal riots in 2012. On 25 August 2017, insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched a large-scale attack against security forces, leading to new \\"clearance operations\\" by the Myanmar government, one of which was conducted in Chut Pyin.  Massacre  According to eyewitnesses, the village of Chut Pyin was razed by Myanmar's security forces and local Rakhines on 26 August 2017, a day after attacks by ARSA on 25 August 2017. Prior to the village's destruction, members of the security forces allegedly threatened and raped Rohingya women, whilst Rohingya men were either killed or detained as ARSA suspects. In September 2017, the death count was reportedly 130; in May 2018, the final death count from violence in Chut Pyin was 358. Satellite imagery released on 16 September 2017 revealed that Chut Pyin had been completely burnt down.

The Japanese Rail Sim series uses real-life footage of Japanese railways. A few of the Airport Hero and most of the Japanese Rail Sim games are translated and released in North America and Europe. And following the game Waku Waku Sweets: Happy Sweets Making for 3DS being localized and released in 2018, over 4 years after its original release in Japan, it seems fair to assume the company is not focussing solely on the Japanese market anymore.

MS 438 continues eastward and ends at Sunflower River Road and Kinlock Road on the Washington‚ÄìSunflower county line near Kinlock. The route was constructed around 1950, connecting from MS 1 to US 61. The route was extended to the Washington‚ÄìSunflower county line by 1958, and to US 49W in Inverness by 1960. The section east of the county line was removed from the route by 1974. Route description All of the route is located in Washington County. MS 438 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and all of it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 438, known as Arcola‚ÄìTrail Lake Road, starts at the intersection of MS 1 and Thaggard Road in the unincorporated area of Wayside and travels eastward. The route, travelling through farmland, crosses over a drainage ditch near L&W; Fish Farm Road and Black Bayou at Dever Road. West of Bennett Street, MS 438 enters the town of Arcola. The route passes through a residential area inside the town, and intersects Old US 61 near Downtown Arcola. At Deer Creek, the road leaves the city limits of the town. MS 483 then intersects US 61 outside the town and re- enters farmland. The route crosses Bogue Phalia near Martha Plantation Road, and intersects Tribbett Road in Tralake. East of Sanders Road, the road begins travelling along the Washington‚ÄìSunflower county line. MS 438 ends at a three- way junction with Sunflower River Road and Kinlock Road, adjacent to the Sunflower River. History MS 438 was constructed around 1950, connecting MS 1 in Wayside to US 61 in Arcola as a paved road. Eight years later, the route was extended along a paved road eastward to the Washington‚ÄìSunflower county line. By 1960, a county-maintained gravel road in Sunflower County was added to MS 438, connecting the route to US 49W in Inverness. The county road became paved and state-maintained by 1967, and a $1,709,403 () project to grade the route and other improvements started. Due to budgetary issues, MS 438 was proposed to be decommissioned and returned to county maintenance twice: Once in 1968 after the route became poorly conditioned, and in 1969 to prioritize another road that needed paving in Greenville. A project to improve of MS 438 in Washington County started in 1969, costing $1,327,260 (). The section in Sunflower County was removed from the route by 1974.

Biography Documentation of Bendtsen's early biography and career is scant. He was the second child, born 28 October 1917, of Dagmar Cecillie Bendtsen (born Larsen, 1881) and Steffen Anton Bendtsen, pastry chef (born 7 December 1883 in Alles√∏, Denmark), who married in 1913 had 5 children including Edvin, Wermund and 3 others. Early career An ink drawing from 1941 depicting an alchemist, signed by Bendtsen, indicates his artistic talent that he was applying already to a career in photography. The site arkivdk provides online access to 500 Danish national archives including the Odense City Museum, and the photographs by, and of, him held there sketch out the course of his life. The earliest are in an album of 6 very competent black and white prints by him recording the damage to buildings from British bombing in Vestergade 41 and B√ºlowsvej streets in Odense in 1941 during German occupation in WWII, when it was then a town of over 100,000. Imagery from 1948 records his peacetime activities as a scout master. A 1950 newspaper portrait of him shows him as an affable man in his mid-thirties dressed in a white darkroom smock coat. Cinematographer In March 1953 Bendtsen was the cinematographer for the Odense film company Orion Film when it visited The Funen Village, Sejerskovvej, Odense, Denmark to make a documentary about the heritage village, an open-air museum preserved as it was in the time of Hans Christian Andersen. The director and producer were Tage Larsen and Svend Larsen and they were advised by the Funen village architect Eigil Hansen. Bendtsen was director of photography for Orion Film's half-hour documentary Fra √∏ til √∏ i Kattegat (From Island To Island In The Kattegat) of 1955, with screenplay by Christian Seeberg. Recognition Though Odense art gallery was hiring Bendtsen as early as 1953 for documentation of their artworks, in the 1950s regard in Denmark for photography as an independent art form was ambivalent. Edward Steichen's exhibition \\"The Family of Man\\" (the Danish title translates as 'We People') challenged this attitude when it was installed at the Charlottenborg in Copenhagen in 1957.Kristen Gresh (2005) The European roots of The Family of Man, History of Photography, 29:4, 331-343, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2005.10442815 There, on its world tour from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, it had 60,000 visitors in just a few months, and the exhibition became an influential success. It included several Swedish photographers: Caroline Hebbe and her husband Hans Hammarski√∂ld, Lennart Nilsson, Hans Malmberg, Karl W. Gullers, P√•l Nils Nilsson and Karl Sandels, but only one from Denmark; Wermund Bendtsen, while none were included from the other Nordic countries. Bendtsen's low-angle shot that Steichen selected shows a shirtless construction worker mopping his brow, and the same image, more tightly cropped, appears on the 1979 vinyl LP cover for Vi L√¶nges Sikkert Mod Noget Andet ('We are longing for something else') by Bertolt Brecht, Lars Forsell, Harald Herdal, Rudolf Nilsen. Bendtsen was conducting popular photo- tours of Funen Village in the mid-50s, and in 1957, as an indication of his standing, was able to successfully release a book that promoted art photography, entitled, in English translation, 'Photo Inspiration and Image Composition',Bendtsen, W. (1957). Fotoinspiration og billedkomposition. Skandivanisk bogforlag. to which he added several picture books published after 1960 on Scandinavian landscape and travel and on museum collections. He undertook research on the lineage of Hans Christian Andersen for Danmarks Grafiske Museum. Professional photographer In February 1964 Bendtsen moved into a new studio near the town centre at 10 Adel Street (Adelgade 10, running through to Overgade 19), once a charity-run infants' school that surrounds a large courtyard. The Funen Stiftstidendes (the 'Funen Herald-Tribune') newspaper photographed him at the launch of the new premises accompanied by theatre photographer Gunnar Graham (1915‚Äì2004) and, as an indication of Bendtsen's clientele of the period, they are joined by author, historian and Odense Museum Director Niels Oxenvad (1928‚Äì2014), Apollo Theatre director Tage Larsen (who was also founder of Orion Films in 1947) and Ethel Johansen, director of Ethel Johansen Advertising in nearby N√∏rregade. In the 1960s Bendtsen's studio was producing a broad range of imagery including advertising photographs for Danish companies, including Star refrigerators in Marslev, and Wittenborg Machine Factory, manufacturer of automats. For the Odense City council he produced architectural photography of interiors of newly constructed municipal offices, records of land reclamation and town and street scenes for publicity. Other clients were the tourist organisation, the art gallery and theatre, and his pictures also appeared in the newspapers of the region. Bendtsen was still photographing into his seventies, until 1997 when he passed his business on to colleagues, whereupon Wermund Bendtsen Photography ApS was founded on Thursday 11 December 1997 at Stenhuggervej 18 5230 Odense M, moving 3 years later to √òsterbro 18, Odense, but ceasing its activity seven years later on 1 February 2005, during an industry-wide shift to digital imaging. During this latter period his name appears in credits for specialist reprography of artworks in significant art publications for museums including the Johannes Larsen Museet. He died in 2003.

It provides consultation and advocates for youth rights in India, which currently has over 600 million young people below the age of 25 in India. Almost 70% of the country's people is below the age of 30. While the organization focuses on electoral politics and awareness campaigns, it also provides opportunities for youth representatives from different areas of India to exchange ideas and experiences and coordinate program plans, . The foundation is also running a campaign to lower the age of candidacy from 25 for MPs (Members of Parliament) and MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly) in India. Y . Team The Young India Foundation consists of a team of entrepreneurs and activists, from Columbia University, Stanford University, Lady Shri Ram College, and University of Oxford among others, who have been actively involved in youth-oriented development programs, policies and mobilisation. Activities and campaigns While YIF deals with all issues affecting youth in India on a national, regional, and local level, its primary motive is to help young people get elected in local and regional electoral positions in municipality and positions in the panchayati raj system. YIF organizes events in India to raise awareness for their age of candidacy campaign which focuses to lower the age when an MP or MLA can run for elections. The campaign highlights how India has the youngest and largest demographic yet the oldest age of candidacy. As of October 2018, YIF is running a campaign to lower the age of candidacy in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha elections from 25 years. The campaign to lower the minimum age for candidacy to be an MP or MLA from 25 years was also recognised by Shashi Tharoor, a Member of Parliament serving Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. # YIF will file a Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court to recommend a legislation to lower the age of candidacy for MPs and MLAs from 25. # After the Supreme Court of India‚Äôs recommendation, YIF plans to lobby the elected parliamentarians for amendment of three bills: Article 84, Article 173 (b) and Section 35 (2) of the Representation of the People‚Äôs Act 1950. # To bring more young people into the movement, it has engaged in social media campaigns,aimed at creating awareness to make the young vote bank more relevant, and give youth a fair share in electoral representation In April 2018, YIF supported 23-year old Jagbir in his campaign for the position of Panch in his ward. To increase the reach of the youngest candidate fighting elections, YIF‚Äôs campaign worked to encourage voters in his constituency to vote for him, and he won the Panch‚Äôs seat in rural Haryana. Candidate selection process YIF selects candidates using the following parameters: * Progressiveness (assessed on whatever \\"progressiveness\\" by definition fits their community) * Network, connections and understanding of the ground level problems * Knowledge about campaigning and duties as a leader * Willingness to work * Personality, the potential to exploit and perspective about volunteers working for them, on a scale of 1‚Äì10, how excited would they be? The YIF community support program is extended to those with the inclination for volunteering and public service. It operates an active Slack community where candidates can network with other people who are considering running for office or for volunteering for YIF. This community has been structured based on specialty and demographics , and helps the candidates and volunteers in self-organizing, setting up in-person meetings, and commiserating when they encounter challenges. YIF candidates are given mentorship by experts from a range of domains, such as digital media and political communication. YIF shares links to training and other informational programs by partner organizations with its staff and volunteers. YIF has conducted boot camps to effectively prepare young people to run for elections. These bootcamps take place in a variety of cities and cover topics ranging from nomination paperwork to social media profiles. Membership and structure As of October 2018, YIF has over 100 volunteers in a variety of capacities, including YIF representatives, Regional Wishers and college and high school ambassadors. There are three ways to participate: Central YIF, State YIF, and university branches. The Central Core Committee is the main statutory decision-making body of YIF that governs the state, university and other programs. The university branches function and recruit people from universities all over India. Volunteers can apply to a campus ambassadorship program, to become the focal point of the youth rights movement in their respective university or college campuses. The primary objective of the team is campaign management, undertaking research, daily administration, recruitment of candidates and chart the roadmap for better reach.

It is endemic to Karnataka, southwestern India. It was described from a female holotype from Mangalore, Karnataka.  Description  Adults are small compared to other members of this genus; head is wider than long; snout appears pointed; nostrils are closer to the tip of snout rather than the eye; the nostrils are farther apart as compared to the distance between the eyes; tympanum is distinct and large, forming nearly 75% of the eye diameter; no webbing between fingers; first finger longer than the second but smaller than the third; foot longer than the femur and shank length; toes moderately pointed; fourth toe longer than others; webbing between toes are full, reaching the tips of all toes and sharply incised between toes; inner- metatarsal tubercle is indistinct; supratympanic fold present, but does not reach the base of arms; dorsum interspersed with small, rounded ridges; flanks, thigh and venter are smooth; a pair of dermal projections seen from anterior edge of forelimbs until groin. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that E. aloysii is closely related to E. hexadactylus and another potentially un- described species. alt= = Color in life = Dorsum appears greenish brown with a thin, greenish mid-dorsal line running from tip of snout to vent; upper jaw near snout appear greenish as do the flanks, with the green coloration reducing gradually towards the groin. Based on the coloration, the adults of this species may be confused with juveniles of E. hexadactylus.  Etymology  This species is named in honor of Aloysius Gonzaga, a prince in Italy who entered the Jesuit order and died in Rome, serving people during an epidemic plague. The institution where one of the authors completed most work in describing the species is named after St. Aloysius as well.  Ecology and natural history  The ova in female specimens are pigmented and about 1 mm in diameter. Gravid females have been collected from the months of May until late July and implied that they may spawn in early August. E. aloysii co-occurs with other congeners such as E. hexadactylus; E. cyanophlyctis and E. karaavali. Other species include Hoplobatrachus tigerinus, Microhyla ornata, Minervarya sahyadris, Minervarya caperata and, Indosylvirana intermedia.

It was the director's second feature film. Her script is a loose adaptation of the novel ' by Javier Mar√≠as, which the novelist repudiated. The subsequent controversy ended with a lawsuit, which resulted in an indemnification towards the writer and an order to withdraw his name from the credits of the film. Plot Robert Rylands, a seductive archaeologist and university professor aged 60, voluntarily presents himself to testify at the police station. His story to the deputy, which lasts all night, begins with the arrival in Oxford of Juan Noguera, a young teacher who is going to teach a Spanish literature course at the university. Juan stays at the home of his colleague and friend Alfred Cromer, who lives with his sister and her little daughter. Juan soon perceives that the recent return of Robert Rylands to the city, after an absence of ten years, disturbs the family. He tries to investigate the cause, but both Alfred and Jill refuse to reveal the secret between them. Meanwhile, Alfred falls ill and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Rylands tries repeatedly to contact Alfred, but he refuses to see him. Little by little Juan and Jill begin to fall in love. In the end Juan discovers the cause of the resentment against Robert Rylands. Robert and Alfred were lovers, and Jill interposed by going to bed with Robert one day. Jill became pregnant with his daughter, and when Alfred found out, the relationship between the two men broke up, and then Robert embarked on one of his exploration trips with no return date. Alfred leaves the hospital in a wheelchair, and soon after, Juan collaborates in a plot to meet Robert. After the reproaches of the reunion are reconciled, Robert tells him that he wants them to live together for the time that he has left, but Alfred tells him that if he really loves him, he has to help him die with dignity. Robert finally agrees, and after shooting him with his old gun, he goes to the police station to confess.

Conditional probability and conditional events Fig. 1 ‚Äì A diagram of A, B, and A \\\\rightarrow B. The statement \\"The probability that if A, then B, is 20%\\" means (put intuitively) that event B may be expected to occur in 20% of the outcomes where event A occurs. The standard formal expression of this is P(B\\\\mid A)=0.20, where the conditional probability P(B\\\\mid A) equals, by definition, P(A \\\\cap B)/P(A). Beginning in the 1960s, several philosophical logicians‚Äîmost notably Ernest Adams and Robert Stalnaker‚Äîfloated the idea that one might also write P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = 0.20, where A \\\\rightarrow B is the conditional event \\"If A, then B\\".H√°jek and Hall (1994) give a historical summary. The debate was actually framed as being about the probabilities of conditional sentences, rather than conditional events. However, this is merely a difference of idiom, so long as sentences are taken to express propositions and propositions are thought of as sets of possible worlds. That is, given events A and B, one might suppose there is an event, A \\\\rightarrow B, such that P(A \\\\rightarrow B) could be counted on to equal P(B\\\\mid A), so long as P(A) > 0. Part of the appeal of this move would be the possibility of embedding conditional expressions within more complex constructions. One could write, say, P(A \\\\cup (B \\\\rightarrow C)) = 0.75, to express someone's high subjective degree of confidence (\\"75% sure\\") that either A, or else if B, then C. Compound expressions containing conditional expressions might also be useful in the programming of automated decision- making systems.Reading \\"If A, then B\\" as \\"Not A, unless also B\\" makes compounding straightforward, since A \\\\rightarrow B becomes equivalent to the Boolean expression A' \\\\cup B. However, this has the unsatisfactory consequence that P(A \\\\rightarrow B) \\\\geq P(A'); then \\"If A, then B\\" is assigned high probability whenever A is highly unlikely, even if A's occurrence would make B highly _un_ likely. This is a version of what in logic is called a paradox of material implication. How might such a convention be combined with standard probability theory? The most direct extension of the standard theory would be to treat A \\\\rightarrow B as an event like any other, i.e., as a set of outcomes. Adding A \\\\rightarrow B to the familiar Venn- or Euler diagram of A and B would then result in something like Fig. 1, where s,t,\\\\ldots, z are probabilities allocated to the eight respective regions, such that s + t + \\\\cdots + z = 1. For P(A \\\\rightarrow B) to equal P(B\\\\mid A) requires that t + v + w + y = (s + t)/(s + t + x + y), i.e., that the probability inside the A \\\\rightarrow B region equal the A \\\\cap B region's proportional share of the probability inside the A region. In general the equality will of course not be true, so that making it reliably true requires a new constraint on probability functions: in addition to satisfying Kolmogorov's probability axioms, they must also satisfy a new constraint, namely that P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A) for any events A and B such that P(A) > 0. Lewis's result pointed out a seemingly fatal problem with the above proposal: assuming a nontrivial set of events, the new, restricted class of P-functions will not be closed under conditioning, the operation that turns probability function P into new function P_C (\\\\cdot) = P(\\\\cdot\\\\mid C), predicated on event C's occurrence. That is, if P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A), it will not in general be true that P_C(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P_C(B\\\\mid A) as long as P(C)> 0. This implies that if rationality requires having a well-behaved probability function, then a fully rational person (or computing system) would become irrational simply in virtue of learning that arbitrary event C had occurred. Bas van Fraassen called this result \\"a veritable bombshell\\" (1976, p. 273). Lewis's proof is as follows. Let a set of events be non-trivial if it contains two possible events, A and B, that are mutually exclusive but do not together exhaust all possibilities, so that P(A) > 0, P(B) > 0, P(A \\\\cap B) = 0, and P(A \\\\cup B) < 1. The existence of two such events implies the existence of the event A \\\\cup B, as well, and, if conditional events are admitted, the event (A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A. The proof derives a contradiction from the assumption that such a minimally non-trivial set of events exists. ::Step 1. Consider the probability of (A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A after conditioning, first on A and then instead on A'. :::* Conditioning on A gives P_A((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) = P(((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\cap A)/P(A). But also, by the new constraint on P-functions, P_A((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) = P_A((A \\\\cup B) \\\\cap A)/P_A(A \\\\cup B) = P((A \\\\cup B) \\\\cap A\\\\mid A)/P(A \\\\cup B\\\\mid A) = 1/1 = 1. Therefore, P(((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\cap A) = P(A). :::* Conditioning on A' gives P_{A'}((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) = P(((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\cap A')/P(A'). But also, P_{A'}((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) = P_{A'}((A \\\\cup B) \\\\cap A)/P_{A'}(A \\\\cup B) = P((A \\\\cup B) \\\\cap A\\\\mid A')/P(A \\\\cup B\\\\mid A') = 0/P(A \\\\cup B\\\\mid A') = 0. (The mutual exclusivity of B and A ensures that P(A \\\\cup B\\\\mid A') eq 0.) Therefore, P(((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\cap A') = 0. ::Step 2. Instantiate the identity P(X \\\\cap Y) + P(X \\\\cap Y') = P(X) as P(((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\cap A) + P(((A \\\\cap B) \\\\rightarrow A) \\\\cap A') = P((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A). By the results from Step 1, the left side reduces to P(A), while the right side, by the new constraint on P-functions, equals P((A \\\\cup B) \\\\cap A)/P(A \\\\cup B) = P(A)/P(A \\\\cup B). Therefore, P(A) = P(A)/P(A \\\\cup B), which means that P(A \\\\cup B) = 1, which contradicts the stipulation that P(A \\\\cup B) < 1. This completes the proof. =Graphical version= Fig. 2 ‚Äì A diagram of disjoint A and B, and (A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A. A graphical version of the proof starts with Fig. 2, where the A and B from Fig. 1 are now disjoint and A \\\\rightarrow B has been replaced by (A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A.A proof starting with overlapping A and B, as in Fig. 1, would use mutually exclusive events A \\\\cap B' and A' \\\\cap B in place of A and B. By the assumption that A and B are possible, x+y>0 and u+v>0. By the assumption that together A and B do not together exhaust all possibilities, u + v + x + y < 1. And by the new constraint on probability functions, P((A \\\\cup B) \\\\rightarrow A) = P(A\\\\mid A \\\\cup B) = P(A \\\\cap (A \\\\cup B))/P(A \\\\cup B) = P(A)/P(A \\\\cup B), which means that ::(1) y + v + w =\\\\frac{x + y}{x + y + u + v}, Conditioning on an event involves zeroing out the probabilities outside the event's region and increasing the probabilities inside the region by a common scale factor. Here, conditioning on A will zero out u, v and w and scale up x and y, to x_A and y_A, respectively, and so ::(2) y_A + 0 + 0 = \\\\frac{x_A + y_A}{x_A + y_A + 0 + 0}, which simplifies to y_A = 1. Conditioning instead on A' will zero out x and y and scale up u, v and w, and so ::(3) 0 + v_{A'} + w_{A'} = \\\\frac{0 + 0}{0 + 0 + u_A + v_A}, which simplifies to v_{A'} + w_{A'} = 0. From (2), it follows that x_A = 0, and since x_A is the scaled-up value of x, it must also be that x = 0. Similarly, from (3), v = w = 0. But then (1) reduces to y = y/(y + u), which implies that y + u = 1, which contradicts the stipulation that u + v + x + y < 1. Later developments In a follow-up article, noted that the triviality proof can proceed by conditioning not on A and A' but instead, by turns, on each of a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events A, C, D, E, \\\\ldots\\\\,. He also gave a variant of the proof that involved not total conditioning, in which the probability of either A or A' is set to 1, but partial conditioning (i.e., Jeffrey conditioning), by which probability is incrementally shifted from A' to A. Separately, pointed out that even without conditioning, if the number of outcomes is large but finite, then in general P(B\\\\mid A) = P(A \\\\cap B)/P(A), being a ratio of two outputs of the P-function, will take on more values than any single output of the function can. So, for instance, if in Fig. 1 s, t, \\\\ldots are all multiples of 0.01 (as would be the case if there were exactly 100 equiprobable outcomes), then P(A \\\\rightarrow B) must be a multiple of 0.01, as well, but P(A \\\\cap B)/P(A) need not be. That being the case, P(A \\\\rightarrow B) cannot reliably be made to equal P(B \\\\mid A). also argued that the condition P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A) caused acceptable P-functions to be implausibly sparse and isolated from one another. One way to put the point: standardly, any weighted average of two probability function is itself a probability function, so that between any two P-functions there will be a continuum of weighted-average P-functions along which one of the original P-functions gradually transforms into the other. But these continua disappear if the added P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A) condition is imposed. Now an average of two acceptable P-functions will in general not be an acceptable P-function. Possible rejoinders Assuming that P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A) holds for a minimally nontrivial set of events and for any P-function leads to a contradiction. Thus P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A) can hold for any P-function only for trivial sets of events‚Äîthat is the triviality result. However, the proof relies on background assumptions that may be challenged. It may be proposed, for instance, that the referent event of an expression like ‚ÄúA \\\\rightarrow B‚Äù is not fixed for a given A and B, but instead changes as the probability function changes. Or it may be proposed that conditioning on C should follow a rule other than P_C(\\\\cdot) = P(\\\\cdot\\\\mid C). But the most common response, among proponents of the P(A \\\\rightarrow B) = P(B\\\\mid A) condition, has been to explore ways to model conditional events as something other than subsets of a universe set of outcomes. Even before Lewis published his result, had modeled conditional events as ordered pairs of sets of outcomes. With that approach and others in the same spirit, conditional events and their associated combination and complementation operations do not constitute the usual algebra of sets of standard probability theory, but rather a more exotic type of structure, known as a conditional event algebra.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. It is one of the oldest and most well- preserved Romanesque churches in Scandinavia. History and architecture The church was built during the first quarter of the 11th century, originally consisting of an apse, choir and nave. Its design, with an apse almost as wide as the choir, suggest influences from England, probably conveyed via churches on Zealand and on Jutland. Original decorative details still remain, like the Romanesque semi-circular frieze on the apse and a sculpted plaque made of limestone from Saltholm immured above the entrance to the apse. The vaults of the choir and apse ceiling inside the church are also original. Furthermore, Hofterup Church contains preserved Romanesque murals on the walls of the choir and the apse; these date from the late 12th century. They were probably made by the same artist that made the murals of Finja Church in H√§ssleholm Municipality. Hofterup Church is the oldest and best-preserved church of its kind (built with an apse) in Sk√•ne. The vaults of the nave date from the 15th century and are decorated with late-Gothic murals. The tower was built during the 13th century and made taller in 1851. The northern transept was built in 1845. The furnishings of the church date from the time after the Reformation. The richly decorated altarpiece is from 1597 and contains the monogram of Christian IV of Denmark (as the province of Sk√•ne didn't become part of Sweden before the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658), but the central oil painting (by Christian Holst) dates from 1754.

The monster is created by an unorthodox scientific experiment. Aspects of genetics including mutation, hybridisation, cloning, genetic engineering, and eugenics have appeared in fiction since the 19th century. Genetics is a young science, having started in 1900 with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's study on the inheritance of traits in pea plants. During the 20th century it developed to create new sciences and technologies including molecular biology, DNA sequencing, cloning, and genetic engineering. The ethical implications were brought into focus with the eugenics movement. Since then, many science fiction novels and films have used aspects of genetics as plot devices, often taking one of two routes: a genetic accident with disastrous consequences; or, the feasibility and desirability of a planned genetic alteration. The treatment of science in these stories has been uneven and often unrealistic. The film Gattaca did attempt to portray science accurately but was criticised by scientists. Background The 1953 discovery of the double helix chemical structure of DNA transformed genetics and launched the science of molecular biology. Modern genetics began with the work of the monk Gregor Mendel in the 19th century, on the inheritance of traits in pea plants. Mendel found that visible traits, such as whether peas were round or wrinkled, were inherited discretely, rather than by blending the attributes of the two parents. In 1900, Hugo de Vries and other scientists rediscovered Mendel's research; William Bateson coined the term \\"genetics\\" for the new science, which soon investigated a wide range of phenomena including mutation (inherited changes caused by damage to the genetic material), genetic linkage (when some traits are to some extent inherited together), and hybridisation (crosses of different species). Eugenics, the production of better human beings by selective breeding, was named and advocated by Charles Darwin's cousin, the scientist Francis Galton, in 1883. It had both a positive aspect, the breeding of more children with high intelligence and good health; and a negative aspect, aiming to suppress \\"race degeneration\\" by preventing supposedly \\"defective\\" families with attributes such as profligacy, laziness, immoral behaviour and a tendency to criminality from having children. Molecular biology, the interactions and regulation of genetic materials, began with the identification in 1944 of DNA as the main genetic material; Reprint: the genetic code and the double helix structure of DNA was determined by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. DNA sequencing, the identification of an exact sequence of genetic information in an organism, was developed in 1977 by Frederick Sanger. Genetic engineering, the modification of the genetic material of a live organism, became possible in 1972 when Paul Berg created the first recombinant DNA molecules (artificially assembled genetic material) using viruses. Cloning, the production of genetically identical organisms from some chosen starting point, was shown to be practicable in a mammal with the creation of Dolly the sheep from an ordinary body cell in 1996 at the Roslin Institute. Genetics themes =Mutants and hybrids= H. G. Wells's 1896 The Island of Dr Moreau imagined the use of hybridisation to create human-like hybrid beings. Mutation and hybridisation are widely used in fiction, starting in the 19th century with science fiction works such as Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein and H. G. Wells's 1896 The Island of Dr Moreau. In her 1977 Biological Themes in Modern Science Fiction, Helen Parker identified two major types of story: \\"genetic accident\\", the uncontrolled, unexpected and disastrous alteration of a species; and \\"planned genetic alteration\\", whether controlled by humans or aliens, and the question of whether that would be either feasible or desirable. In science fiction up to the 1970s, the genetic changes were brought about by radiation, breeding programmes, or manipulation with chemicals or surgery (and thus, notes Lars Schmeink, not necessarily by strictly genetic means). Examples include The Island of Dr Moreau with its horrible manipulations; Aldous Huxley's 1932 Brave New World with a breeding programme; and John Taine's 1951 Seeds of Life, using radiation to create supermen. After the discovery of the double helix and then recombinant DNA, genetic engineering became the focus for genetics in fiction, as in books like Brian Stableford's tale of a genetically modified society in his 1998 Inherit the Earth, or Michael Marshall Smith's story of organ farming in his 1997 Spares. Comic books have imagined mutated superhumans with extraordinary powers. The DC Universe (from 1939) imagines \\"metahumans\\"; the Marvel Universe (from 1961) calls them \\"mutants\\", while the Wildstorm (from 1992) and Ultimate Marvel (2000‚Äì2015) Universes name them \\"posthumans\\". Stan Lee introduced the concept of mutants in the Marvel X-Men books in 1963; the villain Magneto declares his plan to \\"make Homo sapiens bow to Homo superior!\\", implying that mutants will be an evolutionary step up from current humanity. Later, the books speak of an X-gene that confers powers from puberty onwards. X-men powers include telepathy, telekinesis, healing, strength, flight, time travel, and the ability to emit blasts of energy. Marvel's god-like Celestials are later (1999) said to have visited Earth long ago and to have modified human DNA to enable mutant powers. James Blish's 1952 novel Titan's Daughter (in Kendell Foster Crossen's Future Tense collection) featured stimulated polyploidy (giving organisms multiple sets of genetic material, something that can create new species in a single step), based on spontaneous polyploidy in flowering plants, to create humans with more than normal height, strength, and lifespans. =Cloning= Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park portrayed the recreation of dinosaurs from cloned fossil DNA. Cloning, too, is a familiar plot device. Aldous Huxley's 1931 dystopian novel Brave New World imagines the in vitro cloning of fertilised human eggs. Huxley was influenced by J. B. S. Haldane's 1924 non-fiction book Daedalus; or, Science and the Future, which used the Greek myth of Daedalus to symbolise the coming revolution in genetics; Haldane predicted that humans would control their own evolution through directed mutation and in vitro fertilisation. Cloning was explored further in stories such as Poul Anderson's 1953 UN-Man. In his 1976 novel, The Boys from Brazil, Ira Levin describes the creation of 96 clones of Adolf Hitler, replicating for all of them the rearing of Hitler (including the death of his father at age 13), with the goal of resurrecting Nazism. In his 1990 novel Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton imagined the recovery of the complete genome of a dinosaur from fossil remains, followed by its use to recreate living animals of an extinct species. Cloning is a recurring theme in science fiction films like Jurassic Park (1993), Alien Resurrection (1997), The 6th Day (2000), Resident Evil (2002), Star Wars: Episode II (2002) and The Island (2005). The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in artificial wombs. In the long-running British television series Doctor Who, the Fourth Doctor and his companion Leela were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples (\\"The Invisible Enemy\\", 1977) and then‚Äîin an apparent homage to the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage‚Äîshrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire. Films such as The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones have featured human foetuses being cultured on an industrial scale in enormous tanks. Cloning humans from body parts is a common science fiction trope, one of several genetics themes parodied in Woody Allen's 1973 comedy Sleeper, where an attempt is made to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose. =Genetic engineering= Genetic engineering features in many science fiction stories. Films such as The Island and Blade Runner (1982) bring the engineered creature to confront the person who created it or the being it was cloned from, a theme seen in some film versions of Frankenstein. Few films have informed audiences about genetic engineering as such, with the exception of the 1978 The Boys from Brazil and the 1993 Jurassic Park, both of which made use of a lesson, a demonstration, and a clip of scientific film. In 1982, Frank Herbert's novel The White Plague described the deliberate use of genetic engineering to create a pathogen which specifically killed women. Another of Herbert's creations, the Dune series of novels, starting with Dune in 1965, emphasises genetics. It combines selective breeding by a powerful sisterhood, the Bene Gesserit, to produce a supernormal male being, the Kwisatz Haderach, with the genetic engineering of the powerful but despised Tleilaxu. 1921 conference logo, depicting eugenics as a tree uniting many fields Genetic engineering methods are weakly represented in film; Michael Clark, writing for The Wellcome Trust, calls the portrayal of genetic engineering and biotechnology \\"seriously distorted\\" in films such as Roger Spottiswoode's 2000 The 6th Day, which makes use of the trope of a \\"vast clandestine laboratory ... filled with row upon row of 'blank' human bodies kept floating in tanks of nutrient liquid or in suspended animation\\". In Clark's view, the biotechnology is typically \\"given fantastic but visually arresting forms\\" while the science is either relegated to the background or fictionalised to suit a young audience. =Eugenics= Eugenics plays a central role in films such as Andrew Niccol's 1997 Gattaca, the title alluding to the letters G, A, T, C for guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine, the four nucleobases of DNA. Genetic engineering of humans is unrestricted, resulting in genetic discrimination, loss of diversity, and adverse effects on society. The film explores the ethical implications; the production company, Sony Pictures, consulted with a gene therapy researcher, French Anderson, to ensure that the portrayal of science was realistic, and test-screened the film with the Society of Mammalian Cell Biologists and the American National Human Genome Research Institute before its release. This care did not prevent researchers from attacking the film after its release. Philim Yam of Scientific American called it \\"science bashing\\"; in Nature Kevin Davies called it a \\"\\"surprisingly pedestrian affair\\"; and the molecular biologist Lee Silver described the film's extreme genetic determinism as \\"a straw man\\". Myth and oversimplification The geneticist Dan Koboldt observes that while science and technology play major roles in fiction, from fantasy and science fiction to thrillers, the representation of science in both literature and film is often unrealistic. In Koboldt's view, genetics in fiction is frequently oversimplified, and some myths are common and need to be debunked. For example, the Human Genome Project has not (he states) immediately led to a Gattaca world, as the relationship between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward. People do differ genetically, but only very rarely because they are missing a gene that other people have: people have different alleles of the same genes. Eye and hair colour are controlled not by one gene each, but by multiple genes. Mutations do occur, but they are rare: people are 99.99% identical genetically, the 3 million differences between any two people being dwarfed by the hundreds of millions of DNA bases which are identical; nearly all DNA variants are inherited, not acquired afresh by mutation. And, Koboldt writes, believable scientists in fiction should know their knowledge is limited.

Silverman praised the series for its iconography, adding that the demons are drawn with the same symbols and styling seen in Buddhist imagery, like bodhisattva with horns, fangs, and talons. She added that Ohtaka's art improved with the series and appreciated her departure from the \\"boob jokes\\" presented in her earlier works, making the series feel \\"less juvenile while still being good for middle grade readers\\". Silverman concluded: \\"in the shounen action line, this is looking like a safe bet\\". Faye Hopper of the same website, gave the first volume 2¬Ω out of five stars. Hopper praised the series' art, but criticized it for its execution and pacing, adding: \\"New characters appear out of nowhere and are not given proper introductions, character arcs are not meaningfully advanced, and any potential tension is lost in how the characters don't face meaningful consequences for their actions. It is a mess.\\" Hopper concluded: \\"a final impression is just as important as an introductory one. And sadly, at the end of the day, Orient just does not keep up its momentum\\".

He enlisted in the Manchester Regiment at the age of 14 and was promoted to lance corporal within a week. When his father realised what Battersby had done, he intervened and had him commissioned as an officer in the East Lancashire Regiment. Battersby was wounded in action leading a platoon over the top on the first day of the Somme but returned to duty to fight in the 1917 Operations on the Ancre. It was here that he was struck by shrapnel from a German shell, resulting in the amputation of his left leg. Battersby was asked to resign his commission owing to disability but insisted he could still be of use to the army if fitted with a prosthetic leg and successfully returned to duty with a Royal Engineers transport unit. After the war he studied theology and became a vicar at Chittoe, Wiltshire. During the Second World War he organised the local Home Guard unit and between 1943 and 1945 served as a chaplain to the Royal Marines at Chatham Dockyard.  Early life  Reginald Battersby was born on 26 February 1900, the second son of the Reverend Walter Schofield Battersby and his wife Susannah. His father was the first vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Blackley, a suburb of Manchester, after a new parish was created from parts of the parishes of St Peter's, Blackley, and Christ Church, Harpurhey. His mother died in 1914 and Battersby was raised by his father alone.  First World War  Battersby did not get along with his father and on 30 January 1915, at the age of 14, ran away from home to join the British Army. He enlisted at the recruiting office in Blackley, telling the sergeant on duty that he was a 19-year-old draper. Within a week he had been promoted to lance corporal with the 14th (Reserve) Battalion of the Manchester Regiment at Whittington Barracks. Battersby's father discovered he had enlisted and rather than request his release from the army for being underage, instead insisted that his son be recommended for a commission as befitted his social standing. He arranged for the headmaster of Battersby's grammar school and the Lord Mayor of Manchester to support the application. The army approved the application and Reginald Battersby was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the East Lancashire Regiment on 6 May 1915. At just 15 years old he is thought to have been the youngest commissioned officer in the British Army of the First World War. Battersby was posted to the 10th (Service) Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment and was later transferred to the 3rd (Militia) Battalion to complete his training. He joined the regiment's 11th (Service) Battalion (Accrington) (commonly known as the Accrington Pals) for active duty in France on 18 April 1916. The unit, one of the so-called pals battalions of Kitchener's Army, was at that time in reserve at B√©thencourt-sur-Somme. Battersby served with the unit in the trenches and on one occasion during a raid on the German front line with his batman was caught by an enemy patrol. The two men escaped by throwing pepper in the German soldiers' eyes. On another occasion he recalled occupying trenches dug through a mass grave dating to the Franco-Prussian War, and how the officers used the bones that protruded from the trench walls as coathooks. alt= The battalion participated in the first day on the Somme offensive of 1 July 1916 and, at the age of 16, Battersby became the youngest officer to fight in that battle. He was placed in command of a 60-man platoon in C Company, made up largely of men from the Chorley area, and led them over the top of the reserve trenches at 7.30am. Their objective was to cross the British front line trenches and assault the German defences at Serre-l√®s- Puisieux, some 500 yards away. Before they reached the last British trench, his platoon was hit by fire from a German machine gun that was methodically sweeping along the attacking troops and Battersby fell, struck by bullets in his side, back and left arm. He expected to be killed by the gun swinging back along the line, but it jammed at a critical moment, which he credited with saving his life. As he was wounded so close to the British lines, Battersby was able to be taken to the field dressing station at Railway Hollow where he received medical attention and was evacuated to England to convalesce. Returning to his battalion in France one month later he found it much changed, some 75% of the unit having been wiped out in the attack. Battersby and the Accrington Pals spent the winter of 1916‚Äì17 in the trenches opposite Serre, which survived repeated British attacks in that period. In March 1917 they were occupying Orchard Trench to the north of Serre at Puisieux-au-Mont. On 7 March he was at the battalion HQ, under a bridge across the British trench, when it was struck by a German shell. This killed or wounded all bar one of the officers present, including Battersby who was hit in his upper left leg by a piece of shrapnel. Battersby received treatment at the Number One Hospital in √âtretat where his leg was amputated before being evacuated to England. At around this time his father died; he became estranged from his elder brother and went to live with an aunt. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 1 July 1917. Battersby was asked by the army to relinquish his commission later that year owing to his wounds, but replied that he would be capable of returning to duty if he received an artificial leg. He was fitted for a prosthetic limb and was passed fit for service on 13 March 1918, ten days later joining the Royal Engineers Record Office Transportation Branch. He remained with the Engineers until he resigned his commission in 1920.  Post- war  After leaving the military, Battersby was admitted to King's College London to study theology, despite not having completed his secondary education. He was ordained as a priest in the Church of England in 1928 and served as a curate at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and Beaminster, Dorset. Battersby was appointed vicar of Chittoe, Wiltshire in 1934. He married Celma Kemal, the daughter of Turkish politician Ali Kemal, who would become the aunt of writer Stanley Johnson and great aunt of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. They had one son, Anthony, who later served in the Royal Marines. In his spare time Battersby studied genealogy and was an heraldric artist. During the Second World War, Battersby organised the Chittoe branch of the Home Guard, establishing its headquarters at the vicarage. He volunteered his services to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1943, becoming a probationary temporary chaplain to the Royal Marines at Chatham Dockyard. He was promoted to temporary chaplain on 7 December 1944, with seniority backdated to 4 August, and remained in that rank until his resignation at the war's end in 1945. In the 1950s, Battersby served in the volunteer Civil Defence Corps and received the Civil Defence Medal for long service. Battersby retired from the church in 1972. He suffered from phantom pain in his missing leg which forced him to take strong painkillers and towards the end of his life suffered flashbacks to his time in the trenches. He died on 1 December 1977 and is buried under an oak tree in his own churchyard at Chittoe, facing his parishioners.

Life  Marie Gunz was born in Root, a Catholic village to the north of Luzern, along the road towards Z√ºrich. Konstantin Gunz, her father, was a train driver. The third of her parents' seven recorded children, she was described during her school years as \\"a wild girl who loved to draw\\". She received not quite seven years of schooling, which was normal for her class at this time, and then took a series of jobs in domestic service, both as a nanny and as a housemaid. There was no question of higher education: she is identified in some sources as a \\"self- taught artist\\". That does not tell the full story, however. She was ambitious and strikingly beautiful. As a young women she took studio work as a nude model which gave her a connection to the dynamic artistic network in central Switzerland in the 1920s. She approached her artistic career from the arts and crafts movement, studying with the goldsmith Martha Haefeli in Luzern between 1926 and 1928. Her first textiles work, her first wall hangings and her first drawings quickly followed. Marie became Annemarie. She took her inspiration, especially, from popular religious art. Frequent themes were saints and madonnas (carvings on slate, sculpture, oil and tempera paintings, domestic altars). At the same time, the fevered beau monde optimism radiated out from Paris and New York towards central Switzerland. Her art increasingly challenged conventions and celebrated the pleasure principal. At the end of the 1920s she found acceptance in artist circles, joining the Schweizerischer Werkbund and, later, the \\"Gesellschaft Schweizerischer Malerinnen, Bildhauerinnen und Kunstgewerblerinnen\\" (\\"Association of Swiss women painters, sculptors and Artists\\" / GSMBK). She enjoyed increasing public recognition and received commissions, including one for a postage stamp celebrating the Female Auxiliaries (\\" Frauenhilfsdienst\\"). Her works featured regularly in exhibitions in Switzerland between 1929 and 1940. Another member of the youthful artistic circle of the time was the painter-sculptor Hans von Matt (1899‚Äì1985) whom Annemarie Gunz married she was thirty, in 1935. Hans was from Stans, an ancient city in the hills to the south of the lake, and it was here that the couple made their home. Her new husband was a member of a long established Nidwalden family. Annemarie von Matt's own profile as an artist, exhibiting and winning arts prizes at festivals in the region, seems to have been enhanced by her marriage. At the same time she herself became the model for some of his sculpted figures. Hans and Annemarie von Matt remained married until her death in 1967. Sources differ over when Annemarie von Matt first met the charismatic author-theologian Josef Vital Kopp, but their love affair blossomed in 1940. The affair was conducted, in part, by letter, and at times achieved what one source identifies as \\"literary merit\\". Annemarie's art was no longer so widely displayed in central Switzerland, where the impact of war in all the surrounding countries had in any case triggered economic austerity and a reduced appetite for challenging public art. The love affair became increasingly a thing of unhappiness, and she became increasingly withdrawn, spending much of her time in solitude reading, writing or arranging and cataloguing her art collection. The years 1946-1955 can be seen as Annemarie von Matt's second period. The few sculpted forms she produced had a magical symbolism and later came to be seem as precursors of concept art. There are also drawings and collages which mirror her own \\"individual mythology\\". During the time she also authored numerous aphoristic observations, \\"word pictures\\" and poems that draw attention to her fascination with language. After 1955 she was no longer productive, and by the time of her death she had been largely forgotten. Interest in her work has revived subsequently, however.

The church was possibly designed by Edmund Blacket and was built from 1878 to 1879 by Mr Brinsmead. It is also known as All Saints Anglican Parish Church. The property is owned by the Anglican Diocese of Bathurst. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 May 2008.  History  =Indigenous history= The Wiradjuri are an Indigenous Australian group of people from central New South Wales. In the 21st century, major Wiradjuri groups live in Condobolin, Peak Hill, Narrandera and Griffith. There are significant populations at Wagga Wagga and Leeton, New South Wales and smaller groups at West Wyalong, Parkes, Forbes, Cootamundra and Young. The Wiradjuri were the largest Aboriginal group in New South Wales. For tens of thousands of years they occupied a large area in central NSW, from the Blue Mountains in the east, to Hay in the west, north to Nyngan and south to Albury: the South Western slopes region:Wiradjuri (NSW) - Aboriginal Tribes of Australia. South Australian Museum Clashes between European settlers and Aborigines were very violent from 1821 to 1827, particularly around Bathurst, and have been termed the \\"Bathurst Wars\\". The loss of fishing grounds and significant sites and the killing of Aboriginal people was retaliated through attacks with spears on cattle and stockmen. In the 1850s there were still corroborees around Mudgee but there were fewer clashes. European settlement had taken hold and the Aboriginal population was in decline. =Settlement of Condobolin= The name Condobolin is suggested by some to have evolved from the Aboriginal word \\"Cundabullen\\" for shallow crossing. The crossing was located a short distance below the junction of the Lachlan River and the Goobang Creek.Historical Towns Directory. Hallmark Editions: Australian Heritage Magazine. Others suggest that the town's name from the Wiradjuri word for \\"hop bush\\", or 'hop brush'.Travel. Sydney Morning Herald, 2005 The area was explored by John Oxley in 1817 and Thomas Mitchell in 1836. The \\"Condoublin\\" run was established by 1844 (Historical Towns Directory. Hallmark Editions: Australian Heritage Magazine). There had been squatters in the district since Mitchell's 1836 exploration. Closer settlement of the area began in 1880 when the large runs were broken up into smaller holdings. The town of Condobolin was proclaimed in 1859. The railway arrived in 1898, and the town's population boomed, assisted by finds in 1885 of copper north of the town and in 1896 of gold in the district, north-west of the town. A major copper and gold mine was in operation at Condobolin from 1898 until around 1910. Agriculture is still a major influence on the town, production having expanded with the damming of the Lachlan River in 1935 by the Wyangala Dam.Travel. Sydney Morning Herald, 2005 Wheat, barley, canola, wool, sheep and cattle are produced in the district. In more recent years irrigation has brought horticulture and cotton to the Lachlan River area.About our area: history, Western Plains Regional Development Inc.: Community Technology Centre. =Building history= The foundation stone of All Saints' Condobolin was laid on 24 July 1878 by Bishop Samuel Marsden, grandson of Samuel Marsden, the famous Anglican colonial priest. The first service in the new Church was conducted on 4 January 1880. Prior to construction of the church, it appears that services were initially held in the open air. In about 1872 services were held in the home of Mr Piercey, the Schoolmaster. Subsequently, services were held in the Courthouse until the new church was built. At this time priests would travel from Forbes to Condobolin to conduct the services. The first Anglican priest resident in Condobolin was the Rev. G. Soare who was licensed to reside at the Naroonage. He resigned in 1876 and was succeeded by The Rev. Samuel Hart. In 1879 Rev. Hart resigned and in that same year the Parish of Condobolin was established. On 21 December the Rev. Henry Thomas Holliday was licensed as Assistant Minister, under the superintendency of the Rev. E. Dunstan (Rector of Forbes) and appointed to reside at Condobolin. He arrived in Condobolin just after the completion of All Saints' Church and conducted the first service on 4 January 1880. The builder of the church was Mr Brinsmead. It was constructed from local bricks and was reputedly the first brick building in Condobolin. The roof was of ironbark shingles (which were later replaced by aluminium tiles) and the furniture was made from local timbers. Although the records do not state the name of the architect, it is almost certain that it was built from a design by colonial architect Edmund Blacket. Plans of St Augustine's at Bulli (held by the Mitchell Library), designed by Blacket, as originally built before the addition of a sanctuary, are identical to that of All Saints', except that All Saints' has one less window on each side, plus buttresses on the exterior walls. The western walls, windows and bell towers are identical. All Saints' Condobolin is also similar to All Saints' Albion Park which was built of stone in the mid-1870s. It is possible that All Saints' Condobolin adapted a Blacket design that was in general use during the 1870s and 1880s. In her exhibition catalogue on Blacket, the Australian architectural historian Joan Kerr wrote: 'Condobolin Church is another typical rural design. The design has been attributed to Blacket and the style of the building makes this attribution convincing.'Kerr, 1983, 21 It is thought that the bricks used were the first bricks produced by a Condobolin brickworks, using local clay, giving a characteristic red colouring to the church (the same local bricks were used for the Condobolin Catholic Church in the 1920s).Hedditch, 2006 The windows are by Lyon, Cottier & Co, which created much of Australia's Victorian and Federation-period stained glass. They were the foremost stained glass manufacturers in Australia and became famous in domestic, commercial and ecclesiastical work. Lyon was the window designer and glass painter whilst Cottier kept the firm up to date with the latest overseas developments. Their company had an office in London and Sydney and Cottier also had a studio in New York. John Lamb Lyon won international and national awards for his work. A full set of original Lyon & Cottier windows of the quality of these are rare today.Comber, 2005 No documentary evidence has been discovered that determines the exact date of the windows' manufacture. There are few Lyon and Cottier company records surviving. It is estimated that the windows at All Saints were made and installed in several stages between 1880 and the 1890s. More research into the biographical dates and details of the donors and memorial subjects could narrow down the dates of manufacture, i.e. memorial windows would have been installed after the death of the subject and donor windows during their lifetime. The smaller geometric design of the east window and its importance above the altar suggests that this window was made and installed first, possibly by the time the first service was held. It is in keeping with early- to-mid nineteenth-century Gothic Revival desire to reproduce the smaller scale, \\"mosaic\\" quality of medieval windows. It includes smaller pieces of richly coloured glass, less painted details and greater prominence given to the lead lines. It is possible, though speculation only, that the west window was the last to be installed, due to the larger scale of its design, softer colouring, and more fluid, interlacing design, which is suggestive of Art Nouveau influences of the 1890s. All windows share the same borders. The west and nave windows share the small inscription lettering, and the vestry windows and the Richard Little memorial window (northern wall of the nave) share similar painted details and foliated designs. The use of common borders and painted quarries suggest the use of stock designs. Comparisons with other known Lyon and Cottier windows reveal the same painted quarries and design details. The windows are not really 'grisaille' but more accurately described as \\"geometric\\" or as quarry glass. In the late 1920s new ecclesiastical furniture was added to the Church. The furniture is elaborately carved and made in a style called \\"tabernacle work\\". The pieces are two Bishop's Thrones, the Altar, Credence Table, Prayer Desk, Lectern and Font. The elaborately carved Font was displayed at the Brisbane Exhibition before being placed in the Church. In 1940 the shingled roof was replaced by aluminium tiles which caused a sensation at the time, due to the glare caused when the sun shone on it. In the 1960s cement pathways and surrounds were laid. In 1978 all the windows were removed and sent to Sydney where they were repaired by Bolton Studios in Ashfield. Restoration involved re-leading the windows, adding false leads to cover cracks in the glass pieces, and some new painted glass pieces. The church continues in its original use as a place of worship for the Anglican community of Condobolin.  Description  In her exhibition catalogue on Edmund Thomas Blacket, Australian architectural historian Joan Kerr wrote: Gothick-styled church built on sandstone foundations with 300mm walls and external buttresses. The construction is red brick, made locally. Internal walls are white plaster. Double pitched gabled roof, covered in pressed aluminium tiles (previously shingles, replaced in 1940). [Are shingles underneath?] The design of the original wooden pews are attributed to Blacket. The stained glass windows within the church were produced by Lyon, Cottier & Co. It has been suggested they represent a style known as \\"Grissaille\\". However, Robin heddtich suggests that they are not really 'grisaille'but more accurately described as \\"geometric\\" or as quarry glass. The windows were restored in 1978. In the late 1920s new ecclesiastical furniture was added to the Church. The furniture is elaborately carved and made in a style called \\"tabernacle work\\". The pieces include two Bishop's Thrones, the Altar, Credence Table, Prayer Desk, Lectern and Font. The elaborately carved Font was displayed at the Brisbane Exhibition before being placed in the Church. All Saints' is historically associated with nearby buildings but none of these are included in this listing - the first Rectory on Marsden Street, which was sold in 1917, a new Rectory on the corner of Orange and McDonnell Streets completed in 1917, a new demountable Church House as well as the Church Hall behind the All Saints Church. = Condition = As at 23 March 2006, excellent/good. = Modifications and dates = *Stained glass windows were restored in 1978. *Cement paths and surrounds were laid in the 1960s. *Shingle roof was replaced with aluminium tiles c.1940. = Further information = Heritage Council Religious Properties Advisory Panel Statement of Significance 12 June 2007: no direct evidence for design of the church to Blacket has been found despite considerable research. However, there is substantial circumstantial evidence to collaborate very clearly that it was the work of this important 19th century church architect. The Blacket opus is principally known from the collection of maps and plans he left through his sons to the Mitchell Library and catalogued in Joan Kerr's publication.Our great Victorian Architect Edmund Thomas Blacket. National Trust of Australia (NSW) Observatory Hill, Sydney. 1983. It is the case however, that not all Blacket's works are mentioned in this collection for instance the prominent house Jenner at Potts Point and not all plans in the collection are known to have been built. =Typological comparison= Condobolin is a small nave church, with no chancel, and entry through a north door with a bell surmounted to the west gable. In this form, it conforms completely to the small church type that Blacket developed for rural churches. The first of these was at Carcoar (1845-1849) to which was added later a tower and spire. Other early examples are Canterbury (1848), and Gosford (1857-1858).Heritage Office file on All Saints Condobolin It is particularly like his contemporary church for St James Croydon (1884). It is usual for Blacket to have designed church furniture. The pews at Condobolin match almost exactly by those designed by Blacket for the first part of the church at Croydon 1884. Kerr herself is prepared to make the attribution a convincing one (page 21 of the above-mentioned monograph). =Personal ties with Blacket= Blacket is also known to have had direct personal ties with the district and those who would have been responsible for the commissioning of the church. He designed the rectory at Forbes in 1877. His daughter, Edith, married Harbury Clements of the Eugowra Station who attended the opening of the Forbes church. The trustees of the two churches, Condobolin and Forbes, were known to each other. Mathew Bolton of Condobolin married the daughter of Josiah Strickland, trustee of Forbes. The Blacket family went on to do other works in the district. Arthur Blacket designed water works in Forbes in 1880. Cyril Blacket designed the rectory at Forbes. =Intactness= Blacket built about 34 small churches of this kind according to the known information. Almost all of them have had additions made subsequently: Porches, towers, and chancel. From our survey of the churches, only Condobolin church is known to have survived in its original configuration. =Significance= The isolated rural setting known from the research conducted by Noelene Morris demonstrates well the success of Blacket and his clients in getting architectural results in remote rural NSW. It is a plain simple church designed with discipline by a leading Victorian architect of prodigious experience in many kinds of buildings. It is among the most intact of his small church type. For these reasons, it is of state significance  Heritage listing  As at 13 December 2007, All Saints' Anglican Church was of State significance for its aesthetic, rarity and representative values in exemplifying the qualities of a small and relatively intact Gothic-styled church attributed to Edmund Blacket. It is understood that Blacket built about 34 small churches of this kind but almost all have had additions such as porches, towers, and chancel. This is the only church known to have survived in its original configuration. It is also rare for being a regional church with a full set of Lyon & Cottier windows. Also adding to its significance is the moveable heritage of the interiors, both the pews (believed to have been designed by Blacket), and the elaborate ecclesiastical furniture carved in the 1920s in a style called \\"tabernacle work\\". All Saints' Anglican Church is of local heritage significance for its long-term and continuing role in the establishment and practice of the Anglican Christian faith in Condobolin. While of local social significance for its associations with the Condobolin Anglican congregation, it is also valued by the wider community for its associations with religious development of the town and the early establishment of facilities within the region. The exterior appearance of the church and its setting is aesthetically pleasing and it is a local landmark within the town of Condobolin. All Saints' Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 May 2008 having satisfied the following criteria.

She entered service on 26 August 2018. Built by the Cemre Shipyard in Yalova for ¬£30 million, she is the newest ship in the fleet and completed Wightlink's ¬£45 million investment in the Portsmouth to Fishbourne route. In addition, upon introduction into service Victoria of Wight became the largest ship in the fleet and the new flagship. While she is the broadest vessel to make regular crossings to the Isle of Wight, she is not the longest passenger ship, with Red Funnel's Raptor class ferries exceeding Victoria of Wight in lengthhttps://www.redfunnel.co.uk/en/isle-of-wight- ferry/fleet-information/vehicle-ferries/mv-red-falcon/. The Victoria of Wight is notable for its use of a hybrid technology, combining battery power and conventional engines. This results in the ship being both quieter and releasing fewer emissions than the rest of Wightlink's fleet. History The Victoria of Wight originated as part of Wightlink's ¬£45 million investment, which aimed to improve facilities at Portsmouth terminal with a new building, and to introduce new double tier boarding ramps at Fishbourne and Portsmouth for quicker boarding of the St Clare and the new ferry. 22 tenders were received to construct the ship with Cemre Shipyard in Yalova eventually chosen for its cost effectiveness and ability to construct the ship within two years. In October 2016, the steel cutting ceremony of the new ship marked the beginning of its construction. Later the new ferry was renamed the Victoria of Wight in a staff competition held by Wightlink. The name is in recognition of Queen Victoria's history on the Isle of Wight, who would retreat to Osborne House during the summer. After being launched in February 2018, she was fitted out, carrying out sea trials in the Sea of Marmara. On 16 July 2018, Victoria of Wight departed the Cemre shipyard to finally be transported to the Solent for crew training and introduction into service. Being towed by Amber II, a specialist tug, the journey took 25 days to complete. On 26 August 2018, the Victoria of Wight began its maiden voyage on the 10:30 service from Portsmouth to Fishbourne, entering regular service. During the autumn, it was taken out of service during the weekdays to allow for more crew to be trained to operate it. On 1 November 2019, during an early morning crossing from Fishbourne, the Victoria of Wights propulsion system suffered a fault. She arrived in Portsmouth under reduced power accompanied by a tug, leading to the cancellation of further crossings that day. Technical The hybrid elements of the ship's powertrain are powered by a pair of 408 kWh batteries by Corvus Energy. The Orca Energy batteries provide support to four 1,475bhp 6 cylinder W√§rtsil√§ diesel generators in operation and work as harbour generators in harbour mode. The batteries are charged from diesel generators.

It is possible to synthesize zinc finger nucleotides with zinc finger components that selectively (almost selectively) bind to specific portions of DNA. Conceptually, targeting and editing could focus on host cellular co-receptors for HIV or on proviral HIV DNA. Host cellular co-receptors for HIV It has also been observed that 20% of the Caucasian population possess a mutation, called CCR5-Œî32 (frequency of 0.0808 for homozygous allele), that prevents the CCR5 chemokine receptor protein, which is the main means of viral access into the cell, from being expressed on the surface of their CD4+ T-cells. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation are immune to HIV strains that use the CCR5 receptor to access the cell, while those that are heterozygous for this mutation have been found to reduce plasma viral load and delay progression of AIDS.Lai, Y. CCR5-targeted hematopoietic stem cell gene approaches for HIV disease: Current progress and future prospects Current Stem Cell Research and Therapy, 2012; 7 (4), pp. 310-317. By combining these facts, researchers have proposed a novel method of treatment for HIV. This method attempts to treat the infection by disrupting the CCR5 gene, such as introducing the CCR5-Œî32 mutation using a recombinant adenoviral vector or forcing DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining, which is prone to error and results in a non-functional gene. As a consequence, resulting in the expression of nonfunctional CCR5 co-receptors on CD4+ T cells, providing immunity against infection. The zinc finger nucleases that have been synthesized for this treatment are manufactured by combining FokI Type II restriction endonucleases with engineered zinc fingers. The number of zinc fingers attached to the endonuclease controls the specificity of the ZFN since they are engineered to preferentially bind to specific base sequences in DNA. Each ZFN is made up of multiple zinc fingers and one nuclease enzyme.  Proviral HIV DNA A recent and unique application of ZFN-technology to treat HIV has emerged whose focus is to target not the host genome, but rather proviral HIV DNA, for mutagenesis.Wayengera, M. \\"Proviral HIV-genome-wide and pol-gene specific zinc finger nucleases: usability for targeted HIV gene therapy. Theor Biol Med Model, 2011; 8, pp26. The authors of this work have drawn their inspiration from the innate defense mechanism against bacteria- infecting-viruses called bacteriophages, present amongst those bacteria endowed with restriction modification (R-M) systems. These bacteria secrete a restriction enzyme (REase) that recognizes and repetitively cleaves around palindromic sequences within the xenogenic DNAs of the bacteriophages or simply phages, until the same is disabled. Further support for this approach resides in the fact that, the human genome comprises in large part remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated by several mechanisms, some of whose action resembles that of ZFN. It should not be surprising, therefore, that the initial work leading to the application of ZFN technology in this manner revolved around and involved the isolation and testing of HIV/SIV targeting bacteria-derived REases, whose non-specificity (due to their short recognition sequences) unfortunately, rendered them toxic to the host genome. The latter-potential host-genome toxicity posed by the raw bacteria-derived REases limited their application to ex-vivo modalities for HIV prevention, namely synthetic or live microbicides. Subsequently, however, the unique specificity offered by ZFNs was quickly recognized and harnessed, paving way for a novel strategy for attacking HIV in-vivo (through target mutagenesis of proviral HIV DNA) that is similar to the manner by which bacteria equipped with R-M systems do, to disable the foreign DNAs of in-coming phage-genomes. Because latent proviral HIV DNA resident in resting memory CD4 cells forms the major barrier to the eradication of HIV by highly active antiviral therapy (HAART), it is speculated that this approach may offer a 'functional cure\\" for HIV. Both ex-vivo (manipulation of stem or autologous T cell precursors) and in-vivo delivery platforms are being explored. It is also hoped that, when applied to non-HIV infected persons, this strategy could offer a genomic vaccine against HIV and other viruses.

AIDS vaccine- Washington, Seattle 2007, :P05-01. Zinc finger binding The FokI catalytic domain must dimerize to cleave the DNA at the targeted site, and requires there to be two adjacent zinc finger nucleases (see picture), which independently bind to a specific codon at the correct orientation and spacing. As a result, the two binding events from the two zinc finger nuclease enables specific DNA targeting. Specificity of genome editing is important for the zinc finger nuclease to be a successful application. The consequence of off-targeting cleavage can lead to a decrease in efficiency of the on-target modification in addition to other unwanted changes. The exact constitution of the ZFNs that are to be used to treat HIV is still unknown. The binding of ZFNs for the alteration of the Zif268 genelink, however, has been well-studied and is outlined below to illustrate the mechanism by which the zinc finger domain of ZFNs bind to DNA. The amino terminus of the alpha helix portion of zinc fingers targets the major grooves of the DNA helix and binds near the CCR5 gene positioning FokI in a suitable location for DNA cleavage. Zinc fingers are repeated structural protein motifs with DNA recognition function that fit in the major grooves of DNA. Three zinc fingers are positioned in a semi-circular or C-shaped arrangement. Each zinc finger is made up of anti-parallel beta sheets and an alpha helix, held together by a zinc ion and hydrophobic residues. The zinc atom is constrained in a tetrahedral conformation through the coordination of Cys3, Cys6, His19, and His23 and Zinc ‚Äì Sulfur bond distance of 2.30 +/- 0.05 Angstroms and Zinc ‚Äì Nitrogen bond distances of 2.0 +/- 0.05 Angstroms. Each zinc finger has an arginine (arg) amino acid protruding from the alpha helix, which forms a hydrogen bond with Nitrogen 7 and Oxygen 6 of the guanine (gua) that is located at the 3‚Äô end of the binding site. The arg-gua bond is stabilized by aspartic acid from a 2nd residue, which positions the long chain of arginine through a hydrogen bond salt bridge interaction. In residue 3 of the 2nd (i.e., middle) zinc finger, histidine49 forms a hydrogen bond with a co-planar guanine in base pair 6. The stacking of Histidine against Thymine in base pair 5 limits the conformational ability of Histidine49 leading to increased specificity for the histidine-guanine hydrogen bond. At the 6th residue, fingers 1 and 3 have arginine donating a pair of charged hydrogen bonds to Nitrogen 7 and Oxygen 6 of guanine at the 5‚Äô end enhancing the site recognition sequence of zinc fingers. = Contacts with DNA backbone = The histidine coordinated to the zinc atom, which is also the seventh residue in the alpha helix of the zinc fingers, coordinates the Zinc ion through its NŒµ and hydrogen bonds with phosphodiester oxygen through NŒ¥ on the primary DNA strand. In addition to histidine, a conserved arginine on the second beta strand of the zinc fingers makes contact with the phosphodiester oxygen on the DNA strand. Also serine 75 on the third finger hydrogen bonds to the phosphate between base pairs 7 and 8, as the only backbone contact with the secondary strand of DNA. Nuclease dimerization and cleavage It has been discovered that FokI has no intrinsic specificity in its cleavage of DNA and that the zinc finger recognition domain confers selectivity to zinc finger nucleases. Specificity is provided by dimerization, which decreases the probability of off-site cleavage. Each set of zinc fingers is specific to a nucleotide sequence on either side of the targeted gene 5-7 bp separation between nuclease components. The dimerization of two ZFNs is required to produce the necessary double-strand break within the CCR5 gene because the interaction between the FokI enzyme and DNA is weak. This break is repaired by the natural repair mechanisms of the cell, specifically non-homologous end joining. Introducing the CCR5 mutation Introducing genome alterations depends upon either of the two natural repair mechanisms of a cell: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Repair through NHEJ comes about by the ligation of the end of the broken strands and, upon the occurrence of an error, can produce small insertions and deletions. HDR, on the other hand, uses a homologous DNA strand to repair‚Äîand gene making use of this repair mechanism and providing the desired nucleotide sequence allows for gene insertion or modification. In the absence of a homologous nucleotide base sequence that can be used by a homologous recombination mechanism, the main DSB repair pathway in mammals is through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ, although capable of restoring a damaged gene, is error-prone. DSB are, therefore, introduced into the gene until an error in its repair occurs at which point ZFNs are no longer able to bind and dimerize and the mutation is complete. To accelerate this process, exonucleases can be introduced to digest the ends of the strands generated at DSBs. Limitations Increasing the number of zinc fingers increases the specificity by increasing the number of base pairs that the ZFN can bind to. However too many zinc fingers can lead to off-target binding and thus offsite cleavage. This is due to an increased likelihood of zinc fingers binding to parts of the genome outside of the gene of interest. Current ZFN treatments focus on the CCR5 gene as no known side effects result from altering CCR5. There are strains of HIV that are able to use CXCR4 to enter the host cell, bypassing CCR5 altogether. The same gene editing technology has been applied to CXCR4 alone and in combination with CCR5 Several issues exist with this experimental treatment. One issue lies in ensuring that the desired repair mechanism is the one that is used to repair the DSB following gene addition. Another issue with the disruption of the CCR5 gene is that CXCR4-specific or dual-tropic strains are still able to access the cell. This method can prevent the progression of HIV infection. To employ the ZFNs in clinical settings the following criteria must be met: i) High specificity of DNA-binding ‚Äì Correlates with better performance and less toxicity of ZFNs. Engineered ZFNs take into account positional and context- dependent effects of zinc fingers to increase specificity.Cathomen, T., & Joung, J. K.. Zinc-finger nucleases: the next generation emerges. Molecular Therapy, (2008) 16(7), pp 1200-1207. ii) Enable allosteric activation of FokI once bound to DNA in order for it to produce only the required DSB. iii) To deliver two different zinc finger nuclease subunits and donor DNA to the cell, the vectors that are used need to be improved to decrease the risk of mutagenesis. These include adeno-associated virus vectors, integrase-deficient lentiviral vectors and adenovirus type 5 vectors. iv) Transient expression of ZFNs is preferred over permanent expression of these proteins to avoid ‚Äòoff- target‚Äô effects. v) During gene targeting, genotoxicity associated with high expression of ZFNs might lead to cell apoptosis and thus needs to be thoroughly verified in vitro and in vivo transformation assays. Administration of treatment The cells in which the mutations are induced ex vivo are filtered out from lymphocytes by apheresis to produce analogous lentiviral engineered CD4+ T-cells. These are re-infused into the body as a single dose of 1 X 1010 gene modified analogous CD4+ T-cells. A viral vector is used to deliver the ZFNs that induce the desired mutation into the cells. Conditions that promote this process are carefully monitored ensuring the production of CCR5 strain HIV-resistant T cells. = The Berlin Patient = Timothy Ray Brown, who underwent a bone marrow transplant in 2007 to treat leukemia, had HIV simultaneously.Rosenberg, T. \\"The man who had HIV and now does not\\". New York Magazine. Retrieved January 2013. Soon after the operation the HIV dropped to undetectable levels. This is a result of the bone marrow donor being homozygous for the CCR5-Œî32 mutation. This new mutation conferred a resistance to HIV in the recipient, eventually leading to an almost complete disappearance of HIV particles in his body. After nearly 2 years without antiretroviral drug therapy, HIV could still not be detected in any of his tissues. Though this method has been effective at reducing the level of infection, the risks associated with bone marrow transplants outweighs its potential value as a treatment for HIV.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. History and architecture Interior view of the choir The presently visible church was most probably preceded by a wooden church. A written source speaks about a church in Kiaby being given by Archbishop Eskil of Lund to monks in V√§. The present church was built as a Brick Gothic church in the 1250s, originally with exposed bricks and decorations in the form of blind arches and lesenes. The church still retains the original brick roof over the northern side of the choir roof. The tower with its crow-stepped gables was probably built during the 16th century, and the present-day vaults of the church date from the 15th century. They are decorated with Gothic murals made circa 1475. They have been covered by whitewash but were restored in 1938-39. In 1790 a northern transept was added to the church. Furnishings Among the church furnishings, the richly decorated Romanesque baptismal font is the oldest, made of sandstone in the beginning of the 13th century. It may originally have belonged to the possible earlier, wooden church in the same location. The altarpiece is from the early 16th century and probably made in northern Germany; however, it has also been speculated that it may have been made in the nearby monastery of B√§ckaskog. It shows great similarities with the altarpiece of neighbouring Oppmanna Church. It displays God with the crucified Christ, flanked by Mary and the archangel Michael in the centre, surrounded by the twelve apostles. The church also contains two other medieval pieces of sculpture. The triumphal cross is made of oak and dates from the 13th century; a peculiarity is the sandals made of silver that Christ is carrying. It has been attributed to the so-called Ignaberg Master, and shows influences from French Gothic art. The same sculptor has also been assumed to have made the wooden Madonna that is placed at the entrance to the choir. The sculpture shows direct influences from the sculptures of Chartres Cathedral in France. The other furnishings are from the time after the Reformation.

The use of households as units may also be problematic as the city stated an assumption of 4 people per household. For any households with less or more people, the allocation of 350 litres per day is not necessarily accurate.

The party's focus for the election campaign was jobs and the economy. Disqualification Two months before the election however, Charlotte Osei, chairman of the Electoral Commission of Ghana announced that 13 presidential candidates, including Hassan Ayariga, had been disqualified from standing as presidential candidates in the December elections due to problems with the nomination documents they filed with the commission. These included failure to declare his hometown or constituency of residence on his forms as well as two of the subscribers on his forms having been named on another candidates forms which are in contravention of the electoral laws. The forms were also alleged to contain forged signatures and were to be referred to the Ghana Police Service for investigation. The subscriber duplication involved someone who had also signed papers for his former party, the PNC's nominee.

It caused severe damage and caused major disruption to armed forces‚Äînaval forces especially‚Äîin the region engaged in the Crimean War. At the time of the storm, the British and allied supply fleet was in the Black Sea with all of the supplies for the winter campaign. A strong gale blew up and began battering the fleet. Eyewitness accounts record the flattening of tents and uprooting of trees, and at least 37 ships were either severely damaged or wrecked. Most of the winter supplies were lost, including food, fuel, and winter uniforms. As a result, many men died from hypothermia and disease. The storm caused a series of scandals. Funds raised to help the troops disappeared, much of it into the pockets of officers. It was also discovered that the storm had been tracked across Europe prior to its arrival off Crimea, but no warning was sent. As a result of this latter occurrence, several countries quickly launched independent meteorological services. In France, Urbain Le Verrier, director of the Observatoire de Paris, was commanded to set up a storm warning system; this later developed into an international meteorological service. Though it is impossible to precisely calculate the strength or speed of the wind, estimates have placed it around force 11 on the Beaufort Scale.

It is the result of the April 2013 merger between Allen Consulting Group and ACIL Tasman. ACIL Allen employs 65 consultants in offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.  Background  = Tasman Institute = The Tasman Institute was founded by Michael G. Porter in 1990 as a neoliberal think tank, based on his attempts in 1987 to found a private university and his earlier think tank, the Centre of Policy Studies. During the 1990s, it became one of the three largest neo-liberal think tanks in Australia. Through its consultancy arm, Tasman Asia-Pacific, it advised Asia- Pacific and Eastern European countries on privatisation and deregulation, in what academic Damien Cahill identifies as a rare example of a think tank \\"that puts neo-liberal theory into practice\\". The Tasman Institute consulted for the Greiner government in 1991 on the privatisation of the Hunter Water Board. With the libertarian think tank the Institute of Public Affairs, and funding from Victorian employer associations, the Tasman Institute prepared \\"Project Victoria\\" which proposed a neo-liberal program for the incoming Kennett government. The Tasman Institute was also awarded a government contract to consult on electricity privatisation in the state. Transport Minister Alan Brown would later describe the Tasman Institute as having a \\"profound effect\\" on government policy. In 1995, the Tasman Institute and Tasman Asia-Pacific affiliated with the University of Melbourne. = Mergers = In 2000, Tasman merged with the deregulation and privatisation consultancy London Economics (Australia), forming Tasman Economics. In 2002, Tasman Economics merged with ACIL Consulting, forming ACIL Tasman. Tasman Institute founder Porter became the executive chair. London Economics founder and Tasman Economics CEO Nick Morris became the CEO. Nick Morris stepped down as CEO in October 2005 and left ACIL Tasman in February 2006, after he and ACIL Tasman senior consultant Jeffrey Rae were charged with hacking rival consultant Access Economics. = ACIL Tasman = ACIL Tasman merged with rival consultants Allen Consulting Group in 2013. ACIL Consulting had operated for more than two decades covering key industries of energy, natural resources, agriculture and water.  Consulting topics and clients  ACIL Allen covers a wide range of industries and has worked for a wide range of government and private sector clients. ACIL consulted extensively to Philip Morris and the Australian Tobacco Industry, preparing economic and public polling reports. ACIL Tasman was criticised in newspaper The Australian in September 2012, with Tristan Edis saying that its predictions on renewable energy, fossil fuels and electricity markets were poor - although it \\"does have an excellent understanding of operating costs for existing large electricity generators in Australia\\". Edis noted that, at the time, large emitter lobby group the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network's last two chief executive officers were ACIL Tasman consultants and the organisations shared an office. In the 2018 South Australian state election, the Liberal Party was required to issue a retraction by the electoral commissioner after they misrepresented ACIL Allen modelling.

Early life Leonard Pfeil was born in London, the son of accountant Leopold Pfeil, and educated at St Dunstan‚Äôs College, Catford and the Royal School of Mines, where he graduated with a B.Sc in 1921. Career Leonard Pfeil was first appointed a Junior Lecturer in Metallurgy in the newly formed Metallurgy Department of the University College of Swansea, where he worked on the metallographic problems of steel and was awarded a D.Sc by the University of London in 1927. In 1930 he moved to Birmingham to work at the Mond Nickel Company as Assistant Manager of their Research and Development Department. A variety of projects on the use of nickel alloys were suspended during the Second World War in favour of military ones, particularly the development of heat resisting alloys for use in the newly developed gas turbine engines for aircraft. Manufacturing techniques for the successful Nimonic range of nickel alloys were significantly improved. When the Whittle jet engine was conceived, the need was for a stronger version of the Nimonic alloy then under development (Nimonic 75). Accordingly Nimonic 80 was developed and the manufacturing difficulties overcome to the point where an experimental jet plane (E28) with a Whittle engine (Power Jets W.2B) could be flown in 1942, easily outperforming conventional piston-engined fighters. Other projects included the development of diffusion membranes for the separation of uranium isotopes. For his wartime contributions he was awarded the OBE in the 1947 New Year Honours. After the war Pfeil moved to London as manager of Mond's Research and Development Department to continue his work on Nimonic alloys, becoming a director of Henry Wiggin and Co in 1946 and a director of Mond Nickel in 1951. He served on many official and institutional advisory committees and as President of the Institution of Metallurgists for 1953/54 and of the Institute of Metals for 1957. In 1960 he became Vice- Chairman of International Nickel Limited, the United Kingdom branch of the parent firm, holding the post until his retirement in 1963. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. Leonard Pfeil died in 1969. He had married Olive Williams in 1929 and had two sons.

In 1953, he went to work in the mines in South Africa, where he formed his first band, the Bantu Negroes, which disbanded when he returned to Zambia the following year to become a business executive. Kazembe also spent time in Congo, Uganda, and Kenya, the latter being where he settled in 1958. His musical activities in Nairobi included numerous collaborations with fellow Zambian emigre Peter Tsotsi, as well as membership in collectives such as Daudi Kabaka's African Eagles (also known as Eagles Lupopo) band, and The Equator Sound Band. Peter Tsotsi Juma and Nashil Pichen helped develop the Equator Sound Band's \\"twist\\" style, modeled after the South African kwela rhythm.http://www.afromix.org/html/musique/pays/kenya/index.en.html Nashil Pichen ended his career as a solo artist after moving from Kenya to Lusaka. His big hit \\"A-Phiri Anabwera\\" was the first single to sell more than 50,000 units in Zambia. It was a song about Mr Phiri, a long-lost migrant worker who returns home from the city empty-handed, only to find that no one in his village remembers him. Pichen had earlier scored a string of hits with his Super Mazembe band singing in Zambian, Congolese and Kenyan. He worked with Mazembe as a producer and manager in Zambia, but he also came to have his own successful career as a solo artist in Kenya.http://eastafricanmusic.com/np_kazembe.htm It was in Kenya that he developed his style of combining Zambian traditional music with Congolese, Kenyan and Southern African urban rhythms like soukous, benga music and kwela. He returned to Zambia in the 1980s and recorded further albums there, and he was also very popular in Zimbabwe. Kazembe died in 1991. Although he had a successful music career, at the time of his death he was a very poor man. He is survived by his daughter, Hadija Nawezi Pichen.

Located within the Pulau Tikus suburb, the neighbourhood lies west of the city centre. The neighbourhood is situated near the corner between Burmah Road and Burmah Lane, immediately adjacent to Wat Chaiyamangkalaram. The neighbourhood is still inhabited by ethnic Siamese, who had moved into the area as early as the 19th century. However, the enclave has also, in recent years, been under threat from rapid urbanisation and redevelopment.  History  The first Siamese settlers were believed to have arrived at Pulau Tikus in the early 19th century. According to a census conducted in 1828, as many as 1,117 ethnic Siamese were residing within Kampung Siam. In 1845, the land where Kampung Siam now stands was granted by the British authorities to the ethnic Siamese as a gesture of goodwill to Siam. The four female Siamese trustees who became custodians of the land also built Wat Chaiyamangkalaram next to the village. More recently, Kampung Siam's residents have been embroiled in a tussle over land rights, as the neighbourhood is earmarked for the construction of a hotel. Although the land was held in trust, it was sold without the trust holders' knowledge to a developer in 2014. When the residents were issued eviction notices, a lawsuit was filed in retaliation against the developer. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2015, leading to fears that the Siamese enclave will be bulldozed to make way for redevelopment.

It is also their first album as a trio since 2000's Chronometree, and their last to date. A musical departure for the band, it is a pop rock album with much less progressive elements than all their previous and following works.

As the result, the album received mixed-to-negative reception from the fans of the band; although Babb and Schendel always defended the album, they later recognized that they should not have released it under the Glass Hammer moniker.  Production  The album was originally conceived by Babb as a solo album which would feature Bogdanowicz on vocals, but Schendel convinced him to make it a Glass Hammer album due to really liking it.  Reception  Three Cheers for the Broken- Hearted divided the fans of the band due to its pop-oriented songs, with Babb recognizing that the album was \\"fairly unappreciated by the majority of our fans\\".

He was notable for composing the music for the national anthem of Bulgaria from 1947 until 1951, Republiko nasha, zdravey!. Other notable compositions including Foot and Cross, Kulak, and The Chervenkov Way.  Early life  Dimitrov was born to a Bulgarian family of Angelina and Dimitar Petrovi in Belogradchik, Bulgaria. His name was taken from the Gergyovden day (Saint George's Day), that occurred in the eve of his birth. He spent his youth and teenage years in Belogradchik and Lom, where he studied at the famous Lom Pedagogical School. His initial interest for music came from his family; his father was a violinist and his mother was an excellent singer. This attracted him greatly to music and he started to learn to play the violin. Further development of his musical potential was carried out under the care and guidance of music teachers Belcho Belchev and especially Obreten Evstatiev. Young Georgi's life was stormy and full of rumors. This is the life of an educated and sensitive young man who opposes public order irregularities and strives for a better life for people. This is not a \\"rallying rebellion\\" or \\"spontaneous\\" demonstration of \\"early-stage students\\", but an active and conscious struggle. His failure in it made him emigrate at 19 years old, and for many years he \\"has been wandering away from a foreign country\\". For some time he lived in Romania, then in Yugoslavia and finally - about 15 years in Poland, which became his second homeland. There he got his musical education and in direct contact with the culture of the Central European countries, he created a worldview, a culture and a strategy for his further personal and professional realization. In the fall of 1927, Georgi Dimitrov became a student at the Warsaw Conservatory. His lecturers were the prominent Polish musicians Stanis≈Çaw Kazuro, Kasimir Sikorsky, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Stanis≈Çaw Viekhovich, and others, from whom he received a solid professional musical- theoretical training choral and symphonic conduction, harmony, polyphony, composition, voice production, violin. Of great importance for his prosperity is his communication with the then-head of the Polish music, Karol Szymanowski (1883-1970). Georgi Dimitrov married the artist Lyuba Palikarova. This puts him in a new dilemma for family support, and therefore, alongside his studies at the conservatory, he started working as a high school music teacher in the town of Grueth. Thanks to the accumulated pedagogical experience, in 1931 he moved to Warsaw and became a teacher in one of the most famous high schools at the time- Stanislav Lorenz. 1934 occupies an important place in the life of the young musician because he graduates with honors the Conservatory; on the recommendation of Karol Shimanovski, the most famous Polish publishing house, Gebetner and Wolf, prints a scroll with \\"Three Bulgarian Folk Songs\\" (\\"Seyla is a Little Girl\\", \\"Ummrell Djerman\\" and \\"I Move, I Want\\"); he became a conductor of the Bulgarian Student Society \\"Hristo Botev\\" and a head of the chorus at the Polish boarding schools for young people without parents. Led by his desire to gain more knowledge, the graduate teacher, conductor and composer began studying musicology at the Warsaw University. And the position of Chief Leader of Polish Youth Choirs gives him the exceptionally good opportunity to travel around the country and to discover and realize his managerial qualities that he has not suspected so far.  Career  In 1938, Georgi Dimitrov returned to Bulgaria, filled with ideas and business plans. The qualities of the 35-year-old musician do not go unnoticed and gradually he starts to \\"climb\\" on the steep music and public ladder. In this process an important role played the impressive success achieved by the man-made chamber choir - which mainly promotes the work of the Bulgarian composers, who regularly concerts \\"live\\" in Radio Sofia. His work as a music inspector at the Ministry of National Education and the Artistic Secretary of the Sofia Opera have confirmed him as a prospective conductor, composer and public figure with a high state feeling. His rich personal, creative and managerial potential, Georgi Dimitrov, unfolds completely in the years after the end of the Second World War, when he headed the new state structure \\"Directorate for Music, Creativity and Performing Arts\\". It can be said that it is becoming a true \\"Ministry of Music\\", through which the state policy on the culture in the country was implemented. Under Georgi Dimitrov's leadership, an incredibly active and fruitful activity has developed. For this purpose, on his initiative, a large-scale prospective plan is being developed, carried out gradually in the coming years. I can not fail to mention his main accents: \\\\- the creation of new state symphony orchestras - and, in this case, operas in Plovdiv, Varna, Rousse, Pleven, Bourgas, Shumen, Vidin, Vratsa; \\\\- the introduction of \\"government procurement\\" practices into culture as an important stimulus for the creation of new musical works; \\\\- the regulation of Bulgarian music as the main indicator in the repertoire of all music institutes in the country; \\\\- to intensify the concert life in the country by increasing the percentage of the world's most prominent artists; \\\\- turning the export of Bulgarian musicians to acting abroad as an element of state policy; \\\\- the establishment of various types of national competitions for instrumentalists and singers, and the reviews of state symphony orchestras and operas; \\\\- the creation of the State Folk Song and Dance Ensemble \\"Philip Kutev\\" and defining its role as an example of the rapid development of folklore art in the country; \\\\- developing a concept of the important role of non-professional (amateur) art as a natural reserve and an integral part of the public phenomenon of musical art; \\\\- systemic state support for young musicians and ballet dancers by participating in international competitions and raising their professional qualifications in the most renowned schools in Europe. In this series a special place is occupied by Professor Georgi Dimitrov in 1951, choir-conductor specialty at the State Music Academy. For the needs of the choir-conducting education, the professor creates several teaching aids, among which the \\"Choral arts talks\\", the multi-volume \\"choir chorus\\" (in co-authorship) and others. Parallel to this, starting in 1949, for more than 15 years he has held \\"summer courses\\" for the improvement of the professional qualification of the choral conductors and especially of the teachers-choral conductors. The Choir-conducting School of Prof. Georgi Dimitrov and his chore-conducting cadres are an important part of his \\"Golden Deposit\\" not only in the Bulgarian, but also in the world cultural treasury. He created a host of conductors-conductors, conductors-phenomena such as (in alphabetical order) Prof. Vassil Arnaudov, Prof. Veneta Vicheva, Varban Rangelov, Prof. Georgi Robev, Prof. Kiril Stefanov, Prof. Lilia Gyuleva, Lubomir Karoleev, Marin Tzonev, Acad. Hristo Nedyalkov, Acad. Valentin Bobevski, etc., whose art is recognized everywhere in the world. And one more thing - with an inner conviction, he won the \\"battle\\" to overcome the former discrimination of women regarding their participation in the \\"male\\" conducting profession. I would like to emphasize that for us - his students, he was not only a teacher but also a caring father, Another important part of the contribution of Prof. Georgi Dimitrov in our national culture is his choral work. It is unclear how, in his incredibly large public engagement, he found strength and inspiration for the creation of choral songs. Unlike his most famous songs written in Poland (\\"Ummrell Djerman\\", \\"I Move, I Move\\", \\"Seyla e\\"), Bulgarians are characterized by their vitality, patriotism, optimism, ingenuity and captivating humor (\\"Flowering Lichko-lyric \\",\\" D√ºlger's Sword \\",\\" Evening Twilight \\",\\" Siniger's Wedding \\",\\" Spring of Me, \\"\\" Sword of the Lilac \\", etc.). the first Bulgarian a cappella cantata \\"Kratka na Rodina\\", for children, girls, I have tried to calculate how many hours is the working day of Prof. Georgi Dimitrov. By rough calculations it's about 20 hours! In the morning, he was getting up early and going to the directorate, then to lectures and every night - he was necessarily present at a concert in Bulgaria Hall, where he had a \\"reserved\\" place on the first row before the first lodge or a show to be accurately informed. There was a visit to the Club of the Union of Bulgarian Composers and at midnight hours ... composing! He had iron health and easily endured the enormous daily stress. He was a man with a strong sense of humor, which he used \\"sparingly,\\" but \\"right on the spot.\\" He loved to cook and I admit that I tasted more gullish than his one in Hungary! He was not speechless, but all his speeches were precise and constructive. Since Prof. Georgi Dimitrov was a man with a well-respected personal dignity and an excellent manager, everyone was in touch with his expert assessments. It also helped him to oppose the supreme institutions, which often cost him the experience of negative emotions. With regular people, familiar and strange, he always communicated as an equal, without a drop of pride. He managed to welcome guests and create a fresh atmosphere. The more the time progresses, the more he confirms the significance of the work of the artist, teacher and statesman Prof. Georgi Dimitrov. Despite the serious illness that has diminished his public activity during the last 15 years of his life, he never ceased to be interested in his problems and to give his wise advice about the development of Bulgarian musical art.

Young's theory of the liturgical origins of dramatic performance gained wide acceptance in the later twentieth century.  Life and career  Young was born in Clinton, Iowa; his father was lawyer and his grandfather a Presbyterian clergyman.Regula Meyer Evitt, Karl Young, in: Handbook of Medieval Studies Terms ‚Äì Methods ‚Äì Trends, ed. Albrecht Classen (Berlin 2010), p. 2724-2729. He grew up in Ypsilanti, Michigan and graduated from high school there. He attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate and went on to get a Master's Degree (1902) and doctorate (1907) at Harvard University. During his graduate studies, he taught at the Naval Academy in Annapolis for two years, then returned to Harvard to finish the doctorate. After taking his Ph.D. (The Chaucer Society published his dissertation on Troilus and Criseyde in 1908Karl Young, The Origin and Development of the Story of Troilus and Criseyde (London, 1908).), he taught from 1908 to 1923 at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The high point in his career were the two decades spent on the faculty at Yale University (1923‚Äì1943). In 1933, he became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1940, he was elected President of the Modern Language Association; he received several honorary doctorates and prizes, among them the Gollancz Memorial Prize in 1941. Young's research on what he called \\"liturgical drama\\" began with a publication in 1908; he relied heavily on Charles Magnin's notion that modern European theatre performance originated in the Catholic Mass, in the Quem quaeritis Trope. This thesis, also propagated and widely disseminated by L√©on Gautier, was brought to an even wider and anglophone audience through Young's The Drama of the Medieval Church (1933), which was reprinted several times and often taught at universities. Later scholars criticized Young's model, claiming that it misunderstood the diverse and manifold liturgical culture of medieval Christianity, in which certain roles and tropes are legitimate elements of the liturgy and not necessarily self-conscious dramatic performance. Indeed, later generations re-examined notions of \\"performance\\" to such a degree, that Young's theses became difficult to propagate. He died in New Haven, Connecticut; a collection of his personal notes and scholarly files (mostly concerning medieval liturgy) is a part of the holdings at Yale University Music Library.

Education and family Guest was born in London, England). He studied at University College London (UCL) and he graduated there in 1962. He and Mary Guest, his wife, had two sons, Ben and James Career Guest remained as an employee of his alma mater for the remainder of his career. He worked on his PhD under Sydney Ewart Hollingworth on the subject of tertiary ignimbrites in the Chilean Andes, where Hollingworth had been mapping the geology. Planetary geology and physical volcanology were developed at UCL under his auspices. He did research on a number of volcanoes around the World, but most notably Mount Etna in Sicily. He was the leader of the United Kingdom's efforts in a long-term collaboration with Italy to study the evolution of Mount Etna and, for the first time in over 100 years, make a geological map of it. In 1984, he was asked by the government of the United Kingdom to assess the volcanic threat to the British military personnel at a NATO base in Sicily. After submitting his report, it found its way - the following day - into the Italian press with the headline, \\"Bye, bye, Naples!\\" and Guest used his skills as required to allay the concerns of Italian politicians. He did postdoctoral study on lunar craters: he worked with Gilbert Fielder, a vocal supporter of the volcanic origin of the craters, at the university observatory. Guest soon rejected Fielder's commonly-held belief and instead supported the meteorite-impact mechanism; the new data unequivocally supported his view. He joined NASA's programme for planetary exploration, including the 1973 Mariner 10 mission to Mercury and the 1975 Viking programme to Mars. In 1980, he founded the first NASA Regional Planetary Image Facility outside of the U.S.A. at UCL where he taught many leading international scientists including Rosaly Lopes, Chris Kilburn and Ben Bussey. He was involved with scientists from the Soviet Union on their 1988 Phobos 2 mission to Mars and further with the American 1989 Magellan mission to Venus. He contributed to the first geological map of Mercury and the first detailed map of eastern equatorial Mars, along with Ron Greeley. Guest and Greeley helped to select the Viking 2 landing site. With Philippe Masson, :de:Gerhard Neukum, and Marcello Fulchignoni, he founded the European Planetary Geology Consortium in 1976 to foster cooperation in planetary surface studies. In 1999, he moved from the UCL observatory to the Department of Geological Sciences. As a story-teller, educator and colleague, he was much-loved, supportive, inspirational to generations of students and considered his role more as a vocation than a job. Showing his great humour, he duped his students into believing in rats occupying lava tubes and that the principal danger to be encountered while working amongst rope-like Hawaiian pahoehoe lavas was a poisonous snake. He had a great talent for interpreting geology from morphology, even from photographs. Very inquisitive, he was fascinated by the international cultures and customs he encountered on his travels. His fast thinking and remarkable skills of magnanimity were greatly admired: he would address the nub of a problem quickly and thus had a very influential effect in discussions, debates, decision-making and project planning. He died at home in Church Stretton, Shropshire.

With a construction and alteration history dating from the late 18th to 20th centuries, the house is one of Southbury's finest examples of residential Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Reuben Curtiss House is located in a rural-suburban setting east of the center of Southbury, on the west side of Bucks Hill Road south of Luther Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. A series of ells extend the building to the rear. The front facade is five bays wide, with broad corner pilasters rising to an entablature and frieze containing embedded small attic windows. The main entrance is at the center of the facade, set in a recess with sidelight windows; the recess is framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. The rear sections of the house are finished in a combination of Colonial and Greek Revival elements that blend with the features of the main block. The interior of the house is finished in a variety of styles, reflecting the building's long life and a variety of uses. With The exact construction date of the house's oldest portion is not known with certainty. The land on which it stands was occupied by the Curtiss family in the first half of the 18th century, and a house is known to have stood here, or near here, in 1740. Architectural evidence suggests that the upper 1-1/2 stories of the main block were built in the late 18th century, probably by Reuben Curtiss. The main block's present appearance and Greek Revival features date to about 1840, when that structure was raised and a new first floor built underneath it. Between 1840 and 1866, another Reuben Curtiss operated a school for boys on the property.

It contained the residence of the Governor of Cochinchina, administrative offices, reception rooms and ballrooms. The imposing and very expensive neo-Baroque building was intended to impress the people of Saigon with the power and wealth of the French. In 1887 the main seat of government in French Indochina was moved to Hanoi, and soon after the Lieutenant Governor of Cochinchina moved to a new, less pretentious mansion. The building continued to be used for ceremonial purposes, and became the residence of the President of South Vietnam in 1954. It was bombed and badly damaged during an attempted coup in 1962, torn down and replaced by the present Independence Palace. Construction In 1865 a competition for a new gubernatorial palace in Saigon was announced. There were two entries, one of which may perhaps have been Achille-Antoine Hermitte's. The Governor of Cochinchina, Admiral Pierre-Paul de La Grandi√®re, later made Hermitte head of his architectural department, as recommended by admirals Pierre-Gustave Roze and Gustave Ohier, who had met him in Hong Kong. Hermitte's priority was to design a new Governor's Mansion since the existing wooden building was in disrepair. La Grandi√®re laid the cornerstone for this building on 23 March 1868, a block of blue granite from Bi√™n H√≤a containing a lead coffer that in turn contained newly-minted gold, silver and copper coins of Napoleon III. Work on the huge governor's palace began in earnest when Hermitte brought in skilled workmen from Canton and Hong Kong. The site of the Palais du Gouverneur turned out to be waterlogged and the foundations required constant repair to counteract subsidence throughout the building's life. Most of the materials were imported from France, adding to the cost. Completion of construction was celebrated informally on 25 September 1869 with a banquet and a ball for everyone involved in the project. The final, formal opening of the palace took place in 1873 under Governor Marie Jules Dupr√©. Dupr√© moved into the building that year, and the decorations were completed in 1875. The total cost was 12 million francs, over a quarter of the budget for public works in Cochinchina. Structure The Saigon Governor's Palace was intended to impress the local people with France's power and wealth. The building was in neo-Baroque style. The walls were in yellow stucco, on foundations of granite imported from France. The facade was decorated by carvings in smooth white stone, also imported. The central pavilion had marble floors, while the other floors were tiled. The palace was T-shaped, and had two rows of arched windows along the front, looking out on the city. Offices and official reception rooms were on the ground floor, with the governor's residential rooms above. The leg of the T held the reception hall and adjoining ballrooms, surrounded by lush foliage. As reported by the Courrier de Saigon on 20 December 1868, In 1869 the Vietnam Press reported, Palais du Gouverneur, Saigon, 1882 The facade was long, and it was placed in the center of a rectangle . The park covered . Eight main roads extended from the road that ran round the park and the palace. As of 1872 a large cistern was being built to supply of clean water daily to the palace. There was debate about whether to create a large lawn in the long space between the main entrance and the front steps, or whether to install a water feature. It was described in 1885 as follows, Later history In October 1887 Cochinchina became part of the Indo-Chinese Union, whose governor-general was based in Hanoi. The Governor of Cochinchina became a Lieutenant Governor, and a less pretentious residence was created for him by adapting a nearby trade exhibition hall that was under construction, completed in 1890. For the rest of the French colonial era the palace, renamed the Norodom Palace in the early 20th century, was used only for ceremonial purposes and by Governors General when they visited Saigon. Subsidence often forced costly repairs to the foundations. The central dome had to be replaced in 1893. On 7 September 1954 the French handed the palace over to the South Vietnamese government, which renamed it Independence Palace and used it as the presidential palace of Ngo Dinh Diem. During a coup attempt on 27 February 1962 two airplanes bombed the building and demolished the left wing. The president ordered the whole building demolished and the present Unification Palace was built in its place.

It was established in December 2017 by former NATO Secretary General and former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen together with businessman Fritz Schur and lawyer Klaus S√∏gaard. According to its founder, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the United States is retreating form the world stage, leaving behind a vacuum that is filled by autocrats like Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, and Bashar al-Assad. Democracy is under pressure from protectionism, populism, nationalism, terrorism, and autocracy. Against this backdrop, the Alliance of Democracies foundation seeks to unite world democracies. According to Rasmussen, the new alliance of democracies would not be a new U.N. but rather an organisation that would supplement it. The Foundation runs three programs: The Copenhagen Democracy Summit The Copenhagen Democracy Summit is a conference bringing together political and business leaders, including current and former heads of government, from the world‚Äôs democracies. In light of a decline of liberal democracies across the world, the aim is to be a top international forum for analysis on the security and economic challenges facing the democratic world as well as a forum for analysis on the interplay between technology and democratic norms. The first annual Copenhagen Democracy Summit took place in Copenhagen on July 22, 2018. Among those who attended were the then-Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, Joe Biden, Tony Blair, Stephen Harper, Felipe Calder√≥n, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, and former Estonian President Toomas Ilves. A total of 350 participants attended from over 40 countries. One of the publications released at the conference concluded that people's trust in government is lower in democracies than in non-democratic states. The Alliance of Democracies seeks to organise a Copenhagen Democracy Summit every summer and a similar winter conference in Denver, Colorado. The Expeditionary Economics Program The Expeditionary Economics Program is rooted in Cold War efforts by the United States to strengthen post-war Europe and create a better economic model than the communist one offered by the Soviet Union. The program supports entrepreneurial projects in developing states, emerging democracies, and post-conflict areas for the purpose of strengthening democracy in fragile states by developing a local economic base. The Campaign for Democracy The Campaign for Democracy seeks to connect supporters of democracy across the world and build an intellectual movement for democracy through a network of local associations, online presence, media engagement, and support for dissidents. On the sidelines of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit Anders Fogh Rasmussen together with Michael Chertoff launched the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which has Joe Biden, Nick Clegg, Toomas Ilves, and Felipe Calder√≥n among its members. The Commission is tasked with bolstering the defences of Western democracies against outside interference.

Random column packing is an alternative to structured column packing.  Packed columns  Packed columns utilizing filter media for chemical exchange are the most common devices used in the chemical industry for reactant contact optimization. Packed columns are used in a range of industries to allow intimate contact between two immiscible/partly immiscible fluids, which can be liquid/gas or liquid/liquid. The fluids are passed through a column in a counter current flow. In the column it is important to maintain an effective mass transfer, so its essential that a packing is selected which will support a large surface area for mass transfer.Perry%27s_Chemical_Engineers%27_Handbook  History  Random packing was used as early as 1820. Originally the packing material consisted of glass spheres, however in 1850 they were replaced by a more porous pumice stone and pieces of coke.  Applications  This shows a photo of Raschig rings Pall rings (beige and large white) and Bia≈Çecki rings (others) Dixon rings Random packed columns are used in a variety of applications, including: * Distillation * Stripping * Carbon dioxide scrubbing * Liquid%E2%80%93liquid extraction  Types  = Raschig ring = The Raschig ring is a piece of tube that is used in large numbers in a packing column. Raschig rings are usually made of ceramic or metals, and they provide a large surface area within the column, allowing for interaction between liquid and gas vapors. = Lessing ring = Lessing rings are made of ceramic and are type of random packing which was designed from the Raschig ring. Lessing rings have partitions insides which increase the surface area and enhance mass transfer efficiency. Lessing rings have a high density and an excellent heat and acid resistance. Lessing rings withstand corrosion and are used in regenerative oxide systems and transfer systems. = Pall ring = Pall rings are the most common form of random packing. They are similar to Lessing rings and were developed from the Raschig ring. Pall rings have similar cylindrical dimensions but has rows of windows which increase performance by increasing the surface area. They are suited for low pressure drop and high capacity applications. They have a degree of randomness and a relatively high liquid hold up, promoting a high absorption, especially when the rate of reaction is slow. The cross structure of the Pall ring makes it mechanically robust and suitable for use in deep packed beds. = Bia≈Çecki ring = The Bialecki ring was patented in 1974 by Polish chemical engineer from Krak√≥w Zbigniew Bia≈Çecki rings are an improved version of Raschig rings.

The film explores female sexuality in the 21st century around the globe.  Content  The film argues for the liberation of female sexuality in equal, sensual relationships between the sexes in the 21st century. It accompanies five women from different cultural backgrounds who stand up against the repression of female sexuality in their cultural and religious communities. The film reveals similarities among the different protagonists and shows their struggle for self-determined sexuality and \\"each woman, all invaluable in terms of the work they are doing, frame their stories in different ways\\", as Jordan Julian points out in her article in The Daily Beast: the US-American author Deborah Feldman left the New York City Hasidic community; the Somali psychotherapist Leyla Hussein had to undergo genital mutilation as a child and fights against this practice; Japanese manga artist Rokudenashiko was arrested several times because of her work featuring female genitalia; Bavarian scholar Doris Reisinger, a former nun, reported publicly on the experiences of abuse in a spiritual community in Rome; and Vithika Yadav, who works as a sex education publisher in Delhi.  Release  The film premiered on August 5, 2018 at the International Film Festival Locarno in the Semaine de la Critique. The film's release was on November 8, 2018 in Germany and Austria, and November 15 in Switzerland. In April 2019, the North American premiere followed at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. On October 18, 2019 was the film's U.S. theatrical release.  Background  The production of the film was led by Mons Veneris Films GmbH, Zurich, Das Kollektiv f√ºr audiovisuelle Werke GmbH, Zurich, and Indi Film GmbH, Stuttgart, in a co-production with SRG SSR, Arte, SRF, RTS and RSI. The film was directed by Barbara Miller. Reception = Box office= In Switzerland, the film had the biggest box office of all Swiss documentaries of the year 2018. In Germany, #Female Pleasure opened as the most successful film of the weekend and it was in the Top 4 of 2018. According to the German Television, the film was one of the most relevant documentaries of the year 2018. =Critical response= At the date of the theatrical release in the U.S., the Alliance of Women Film Journalists labeled the documentary as the movie of the week, because it \\"shows us why that fight is so important ‚Äî and how it connects women across distances both geographical and cultural.\\" Even if the five women are disparate in terms of their stories and experiences, \\"Miller underlines the fact that women‚Äôs struggle to embrace and own their sexuality in a world dominated by misogyny is universal\\", wrote Betsy Bozdeck. As #Female Pleasure focuses on patriarchal constraints on women's sexuality, film critics located the film as a contribution to the #MeToo debate. John DeFore from The Hollywood Reporter concluded that this documentary \\"reminds us that cultures around the world and throughout time have used sexual mores to assert control over women.\\" Martin Kudlac wrote on Screen Anarchy: \\"At the beginning of 21st century, gender and cultural stereotypes undergo major reassessment while women and their voices in the society are being empowered and heart loud and clear. (‚Ä¶) Miller adds her contribution to the hottest debate through the eyes of five brave women willing to act and testify.\\" He continued that Miller did not attack religions though the film made \\"an informed point on inherent sexism and misogyny frequently exerted on behalf or under the pretense of a higher being while using women body as a key.\\" Annette Scharnberg from Swiss Radio and Television underlined the importance of the film for mutual understanding between the sexes: \\"One can only hope that those individuals who are upset over the supposed whining about equality, MeToo and gender issues will be better able to comprehend, thanks to films like #Female Pleasure, why there is no other alternative than to fight back against this culture of oppression.\\" She said that Miller demonstrated how discrimination, misogyny and sexualized violence were connected around the world to patriarchal structures, legitimized by sacred texts, whether those of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists or Hindus. Similar Muriel Del Don on Cineuropa.org: \\"What this documentary seems to want to tell us is that it‚Äôs never too late to assert our right to exist. Women can and must assert their sexuality, not for the sake of duty, but in the name of pleasure, because this sexuality fast becomes a weapon with which to fight a patriarchy-prison of grotesque proportions.\\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Maria Garcia estimated the objectivity and universality of the topic: Each of the protagonists \\"provides an insider view of the unique brand of misogyny that informs their respective cultures. All are survivors of rape or other forms of sexual assault. The issues they confront are not new, yet the stories of their radicalization are engaging, and Miller‚Äôs deft editing and objective approach result in a surprisingly intimate and life-affirming film.\\" Malin J√∂rnvi from FF2 Media identifies two further important aspects of the film. First, the role of the religion: \\"the documentary take[s] an explicit stance when it comes to religion: all the narratives involve biting critique against the treatment of women and women bodies within organized human faith.\\" And second, a \\"powerful tool for learning. Because, not only does the documentary present the responsibility we have as global citizens to educate ourselves in the contemporary state of the world, it also highlights the responsibility we have to be critical to the inevitably one-dimensional perspective enforced by the use of camera.\\" =Accolades= The film received several awards and nominations: After the Zonta Prize at the Critics Week at the Locarno Festival 2018, the film won the Special Prize of the Interreligious Jury at the International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film. For the Swiss Film Award 2019, #Female Pleasure was nominated in the three categories Best Documentary Film, Best Film Score, Best Film Editing, in Austria it won a Romy Award in the category Best Cinema Documentary. In 2019 the film received the Amnesty International Award at the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival and the Audience Award at Millennium Docs Against Gravity in Warsaw.

History  The Waxahachie Daily Light started publishing in 1867 and it is the only paper serving Ellis County that started before 1900 and is still operating today. Though papers such as the Waxahachie Argus, the Enterprise, and the Telegraph preceded the Waxahachie Daily Light, by 1917 only the Enterprise and the Daily Light were still in operation. In 1962, the Waxahachie Daily Light became part of Craco, Inc. and Donald L. Coppedge became co-publisher of the paper with Craig Woodson. In 1969, the paper purchased machinery and equipment for printing papers and began printing in off-set and later in four-colors. They were also printing 13 other papers, and continued to do so until 1970. Macquarie Media Group of Sydney purchased the paper, along with 40 other titles, from American Consolidated Media, Inc. in 2007. In 2014, New Media Investment Group Inc. acquired the paper as part of the divestiture of American Consolidated Media. The Waxahachie Daily Light is now owned by Gatehouse Media.  National attention and controversies  After the tragic New London School explosion in 1937, the Waxahachie Daily Light covered stories of survivors and of families whose children were killed. The New York Times reported that the Waxahachie Daily Light called for an Easter Sunday memorial to be held in every Texas community in honor of the hundreds of teachers and children who died. The Waxahachie Daily Light received national attention for its reporting on the Sherita Dixon Cole controversy. In May 2018, a woman named Sherita Dixon Cole reported that she was kidnapped and raped by a Texas state trooper, who had arrested her for her \\"attitude‚Äù after she was pulled over for suspected intoxicated driving (she passed all DWI/DUI protocols, including a breathalyzer test). The woman‚Äôs report received national attention when activist Shaun King wrote a post on Facebook about it. The Texas Department of Public Safety issued a response indicating that the dashboard camera footage did not support Cole‚Äôs report. The Waxahachie Daily Light then published a statement from the Texas Department of Public Safety and published the dashboard camera footage. The article also questioned whether or not Cole‚Äôs lawyer is authorized to conduct business in Texas. Cole‚Äôs lawyer later retracted her claims and called for the police officer to be cleared of all claims of wrongdoing.

Early life Lanier was born at his grandmother's residence, 10 Fifth Avenue in New York City, on June 25, 1858. He was the son of Charles D. Lanier (1837‚Äì1926) and Sarah (n√©e Eggleston) Lanier (1837‚Äì1898). Among his siblings was Sarah Eggleston Lanier, who married Francis Cooper Lawrance Jr. (parents of engineer Charles Lawrence and Kitty Lanier Lawrance who married W. Averell Harriman; Francis married Susan Ridgway Willing after Sarah's death); Fanny Lanier, who marriedFrancis Randall Appleton; and Elizabeth Gardner Lanier, who married George Evans Turnure. His paternal grandfather was Thomas Eggleston. His paternal grandparents were his namesake, James Franklin Doughty Lanier and Elizabeth (n√©e Gardner) Lanier.

Harriet was the daughter of Heber R. Bishop. In early 1900, Lanier purchased two adjacent 1854 brownstones located between Park and Lexington Avenues in Murray Hill, for $31,000 which he torn down to build his family residence. In 1903, Lanier and his wife moved into the, now landmarked, home they had built at 123 East 35th Street in Murray Hill., p.106 The home was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Hoppin & Koen.

The villa is one of the largest wooden buildings of Japan and blends traditional Edo and early modern Meiji era and Taisho era architecture .  History  The core of the Tamozawa Imperial Villa is the former Edo residence of the Kishu Tokugawa clan. Under the name ‚ÄòAkasaka Riyu‚Äô, this residence became imperial property in 1872, being used by both the emperor as well as the crown prince until 1898. All former Tokugawa symbols replaced the imperial ‚Äúchrysanthemum‚Äù symbol. The residence was brought over from Tokyo to Nikko in 1899, and the villa was erected around it as summer residence for then crown prince Taisho. The villa also incorporates the villa of banker Kobayashi Nempo, on which grounds the residence is built. During World War II, the villa was a hide-out for emperor Hirohito. Also emperor Akihito stayed as an evacuee in the residence for more than a year starting 1944. After 1947, the imperial family did not use the villa anymore and it fell into oblivion. After major renovation work by the Tochigi Prefectural Government, the villa was opened as museum for the public.  Architecture  The villa is one of the largest wooden buildings of Japan and counts 106 rooms, most of which were used by the imperial court. The interior is a blend of Japanese and Western design, mixing carpet floor, chandeliers with sliding doors as well as tatami flooring. The villa is surrounded by a large park, currently only one quarter of what it was in its heyday.

The medal was first announced by former Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon on 19 September 2017. It was first awarded, to service personnel, on 18 July 2018 in London by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. This Operational Service Medal is the first to be awarded to individuals who served outside of the operational area, reflecting the changing nature of warfare.  Operational Service Medal  The Operational Service Medal (OSM) was established in 1999 to replace the General Service Medal (1962) for all new operations. A separate medal of the same design is awarded for each campaign, differentiated by a distinct ribbon. Prior to its most recent version, the medal has been awarded for three separate campaigns: * Afghanistan (from 11 September 2001) * Sierra Leone (May 2000 ‚Äì July 2002) * Democratic Republic of Congo (June ‚Äì September 2003) Medal The Operational Service Medal for Iraq and Syria is silver and circular in shape. * Obverse: the crowned effigy of Queen Elizabeth II with the inscription ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA FID.

A silver rosette denotes the clasp when worn on the ribbon bar. Criteria The medal is awarded either for 30 days continuous, or 45 days cumulative, service in theatre. Aircrew must either fly ten sorties over Iraq or six over Syria. In the past, operational service medals were awarded to individuals who served in a specific campaign where they were exposed to physical danger. The Queen approved eligibility criteria for the medal to include those personnel who have made a significant contribution to efforts in Iraq and Syria, including civilians, even if those efforts were outside the operational area. Those personnel awarded the medal who served outside the operational area will receive the medal without the clasp. The criteria for service outside of the immediate operational zone is still under development by the Ministry of Defence.

The Spanish word feria originally designates a fair (agricultural, books, ...). Bullfights are often given on the occasion of fairs, so the Spaniards came to designate by the term \\"fair\\" a series of bullfightings organized on this occasion, and often - especially in Andalusia - the festivities that accompany these bullfights. In many parts of Spain, there are nevertheless still a parting between the festivities and the feria which takes place on this occasion, as is traditional the fair ends with a Bullfight in the La L√≠nea de la Concepci√≥n Bullring.  History  Its origins go back to 1879, 9 years after the town was first founded, the fair began when farmers gathered to sell and buy beautiful animals, usually drinking to celebrate the deals.  Celebration  Nowadays it is celebrated in the Parque Municipal Reina Sof√≠a and is always celebrated in July. The Feria is divided in two parts: one is a kind of small village, with streets that have bars and restaurants at both sides (these restaurants are called Casetas). The other is a Theme Park/carnival style area where kids and grown ups can have fun on different rides such as roller coasters, bumper cars etc... At the Feria de La L√≠nea all the casetas are public, so anyone can just walk into any one and enjoy the food, drinks, and dancing. This is one of the main features that differentiates it from the Seville Fair as most of the \\"casetas\\" there are private and therefore only card holding members are allowed in. In the casetas, throughout the day and night, people will usually be found drinking a traditional drink known as fino sherry, and in more recent years a new trend is to mix the fino with lemonade and ice cubes creating a cocktail commonly known as Rebujito. At night time there is a sort of \\"roof\\" of pretty decorative lights lighting this little \\"village\\" like area, which allows the party to last all the way till dawn.

Comparable in size to Greenland, the AAC is the largest of the Neoproterozoic‚Äìearly Paleozoic continental fragments now dispersed around the Arctic Ocean; some of which possibly formed the continent Arctida. The AAC originated on the shores of the Iapetus Ocean and is a composite terrane made of fragments from the Baltica, Laurentia, and Siberia continents, as well as the ocean floor of the Panthalassic ocean. The AAC has a complex geological history that includes the Grenville, Timanian, Caledonian‚ÄìAppalachian, and Ellesmerian orogenies. The Proterozoic‚ÄìCarboniferous histories of Arctic Alaska and Chukotka are similar but their Triassic‚ÄìJurassic histories are apparently distinct.

As a female artist who sold her paintings, Ma's art style is markedly different from both that of the imperial court and contemporary \\"talented young ladies\\" (). Biography Little information exists on Ma Quan's life, but sources suggest that she was born in Changshu and was either the daughter or granddaughter of the artist-scholar Ma Yuanyu. In later life, Ma suffered from blindness, and her students' paintings were sold with her signature. She made bird and flower paintings to sell when she and her husband encountered financial difficulties. Gradually, her paintings became so popular that other people prepared the paint for her to allow her to make more works faster. In her later years, she was compared favourably to Ming dynasty artists like Shen Zhou, and many people in Changshu, particularly women, sought her out to request tuition, including an artist who would later gain fame, Jiang Lixi (). Art Ma's subjects include butterflies, bees, and dragonflies, with modern critics identifying her brushwork as very controlled producing particularly fine strokes. She mainly painted flowers and birds seen in an ordinary garden, contrasting with the paintings of the imperial court. To one painting of chrysanthemums, Ma added a poem about how she has no place to plant such flowers but can tend them with her brush. In comparison with Ma Yuanyu, Ma Quan's works have been described as similarly realist, but capable of conveying an aesthetic essence. The later Qing artist Tai Zuyong () described her paintings as having alluring brushwork of serene interest. Ma was strongly influenced by Song dynasty art styles, which she expresses in her frequent tags that an image had been painted in the \\"style of the Song\\". Ma's paintings have been compared with those of Yun Bing (), another female artist in the Jiangsu region and the aunt of Yun Zhu.

The developers planned a 40-story, high-end condo building designed by HWKN Architects. Victor Group purchased the site in June 2014 for $99 million and later purchased 273 and 275 Fifth Avenue for $50.3 million. In total, Victor Group reportedly spent a total of $174.1 million for the land and air rights underpinning the project.

The missile is claimed to have virtually unlimited range. The Burevestnik is one of the six new Russian strategic weapons unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 1 March 2018. The cruise missile received the name Petrel (a bird species name that literally means \\"storm crier\\" or \\"stormbringer\\" in Russian) as a result of an open vote on the website of the Ministry of Defence of Russia. History =Origins= The Soviet Union and later Russia have been uncertain since the 1980s to what extent their ICBM nuclear arsenal is nullified by the United States' anti-ballistic missile system Strategic Defense Initiative, proposed during the Reagan Administration and commonly known as the Star Wars program. This type of weapon flies under the ballistic weapon shield and is part of President Putin's broader program to attempt to re-balance Russian nuclear strike capability. =Development= The Russian defense industry began developing an intercontinental-range nuclear-powered cruise missile capable of penetrating any interceptor-based missile defense system. It is said to have unlimited range and ability to evade missile defenses. A major stage of trials of the cruise missile of the Burevestnik complex, the tests of the nuclear power unit, were successfully completed in January 2019. =Design speculation= According to Vladimir Putin and the Russian Ministry of Defense, the missile's dimensions are comparable to those of the X-101 cruise missile and it is equipped with a small-sized nuclear power unit. The claimed operational range is orders of magnitude greater than that of X-101. As shown in official presentation, the missile starts from an inclined launcher using a detachable rocket booster. Pavel Ivanov from VPK- news states that the cruise missile is one and a half to two times the size of the X-101, the wings of the Burevestnik are rooted \\"on top of the fuselage, rather than below it like on the X-101\\", and also notes that there are \\"characteristic protrusions where air is most likely heated by the nuclear reactor\\". According to Ivanov, the mass of the Burevestnik is \\"several times to order of magnitude\\" greater than that of the X-101, which eliminates Tu-160 and Tu-95 as potential carriers of the missile. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Burevestnik is a nuclear thermal rocket with a solid-fueled booster engine. The length of the missile is at launch and in flight. The nose has the shape of an \\"ellipse √ó in size\\". Military expert Anton Lavrov in the Izvestia article suggested that the design of the Burevestnik uses a ramjet engine, which, unlike the more traditional propulsion systems for nuclear weapons, will have radioactive exhaust throughout its entire operation. Stratfor, an American geopolitical intelligence platform, assumes that Burevestnik utilizes a turbojet engine and a liquid-fueled booster. According to James Hockenhull, the UK's Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), the Burevestnik is a \\"sub-sonic nuclear-powered cruise missile system which has global reach and would allow attack from unexpected directions\\". Per Hockenhull, the missile would have \\"a near indefinite loiter time\\". Nyonoksa radiation accident On 9 August 2019, the Russian nuclear energy agency Rosatom confirmed a release of radioactivity at the State Central Navy Testing Range at Nyonoksa near Severodvinsk in northern Russia and stated it was linked to an accident involving the test of an \\"isotope power source for a liquid-fuelled rocket engine\\". Five weapons scientists were killed in the accident. Nonproliferation expert Jeffrey Lewis and Federation of American Scientists fellow Ankit Panda suspect the incident resulted from a test of the Burevestnik cruise missile. However, other arms control experts disputed the assertions: Ian Williams of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace expressed skepticism over Moscow's financial and technical capabilities to field the weapon, while Michael Kofman of the Wilson Center concluded that the explosion was probably not related to Burevestnik but instead to the testing of another military platform. According to CNBC, the Russians were trying to recover a missile from the seabed which was lost during a previously failed test. On 10 October, Thomas DiNanno, member of the United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly First Committee, stated that the \\"August 8th 'Skyfall' incident [...] was the result of a nuclear reaction that occurred during the recovery of a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile\\", which \\"remained on the bed of the White Sea since its failed test early last year\\". On 26 August, Aleksei Karpov, Russia's envoy to international organizations in Vienna, stated that the accident was linked to the development of weapons which Russia had to begin creating as \\"one of the tit-for-tat measures in the wake of the United States' withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\\". On 21 November, at the ceremony of presentation of posthumous awards to the dead men's families, Vladimir Putin stated that the scientists killed in the August 8th explosion had been testing an ‚Äúunparalleled‚Äù weapon: ‚ÄúWe are talking about the most advanced and unparalleled technical ideas and solutions about weapons design to ensure Russia‚Äôs sovereignty and security for decades to come\\". He also noted that the \\"weapon is to be perfected regardless of anything\\".

A male soprano, he was especially active in the late 1960s and the 1970s as a backing vocalist for rock artists seeking to achieve a more polished vocal performance on their recordings. As a songwriter during that time, he frequently collaborated with Billy Preston, co-writing the latter's Grammy-winning 1972 hit \\"Outa-Space\\" and other songs. Among the many artists whose recordings Greene appeared on are Quincy Jones, the Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond, Ringo Starr and Harry Nilsson. According to AllMusic, together with singers such as Vanetta Field and Clydie King, Greene was \\"on the 'A' list\\" of studio backing vocalists in the U.S. He was also one of the singers in \\"The Soul Choir\\" that accompanied George Harrison, Starr, Preston and Leon Russell at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. Greene co-wrote the song \\"Let the Music Play\\" on Preston's 1970 album for Apple Records, Encouraging Words. In June 1971, he signed a songwriting deal with Preston's publishing company, WEP Music, whereby he would receive 35 per cent of the company's net profits. Two years later, Greene sued Preston and WEP for $500,000, claiming he had been paid nothing for hits such as \\"Outa-Space\\". He continued to work with Preston, including co-writing the title track to the artist's 1979 album Late at Night and singing on the album. In the ensuing decades, Greene withdrew from rock music and focused on gospel and choral projects.

Effat Tejaratchi, who at the age of 22 had a burning desire to fly, was the first to join the club. She became the first Iranian woman to earn a pilot licence in 1940. Early Life Tejaratchi was born in 1917 in Tehran, Iran. She graduated from high school in 1934 and worked as a French translator, first for the National Bank and then for the library of Tehran‚Äôs Medical School. Her father encouraged her to take up flying when in those days, only men had a career in flying. After Arab invasion of Iran and until early 1930, Iranian women did not have a role in the society. This changed in 1925 when the then Reza Shah Pahlavi took charge. He defied earlier rules of the states and started an effort to modernize Iranian society. As part of this, the Iranian Aero Club was founded in 1939. Career In 1939, a group of 9 women enrolled in pilot training program in Iran. In 1940, Tejaratchi became the first to be given a pilot license. She trained with Tiger Moth aircraft. Tejaratchi joined the Iranian Aero Club and became the first woman volunteer. On November 18 1940, she took her first independent flight which lasted for 15 minutes. In September 1941, due to political turmoil the club was closed. At that time, she was training. During her later years, she wrote poems and published them in a book in 1958. When World War II ended, she returned to flying.

He came from a working-class background and did not complete his secondary education. He served with distinction in Senegal, was interim Governor of French Cochinchina in 1869‚Äì70, and played important roles in the two sieges of Paris during and after the Franco-Prussian War. Early years (1819‚Äì57) Joseph Faron was born in Brest, Finist√®re, on 12 December 1819. He had very modest origins. He had solid interpersonal skills, great bravery and a good basic education, but no secondary diploma. He entered the naval infantry service on 17 April 1836, and was appointed second lieutenant in 1840, lieutenant in 1843, captain in 1845 and battalion commander in 1857. Senegal, Guadeloupe, Cochinchina (1857‚Äì70) Faron arrived in Saint-Louis, Senegal in October 1857 as chief of a battalion of naval infantry. Louis Faidherbe had just obtained authorization to create a battalion of Senegalese infantrymen, and placed Faron in charge of the new formation. In 1859 he promoted Faron to Lieutenant Colonel, but Faron remained in charge of the battalion, which was steadily growing in size. He was praised for his ability at Niomr√© (1858) and at Gu√©mou (1859). In 1862 he participated in the Futa Tooro expedition, for which Bernard Jaur√©guiberry praised him for \\"proverbial bravery, important services commanded with complete success, zeal and indefatigable activity.\\" He commanded the first battalion of Senegalese tirailleurs until 1863. On 1 January 1864 Faron was commandant of the detachment of the 2nd naval infantry regiment in Guadeloupe. He was promoted to colonel on 14 March 1864. Faron was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour on 27 July 1867. He was appointed brigadier general on 8 January 1868. In 1869 Faron was commander-in-chief of the naval troops in Cochinchina. He succeeded Gustave Ohier as interim governor of Cochinchina on 10 December 1869, and held this position until Alphonse de Cornulier-Lucini√®re arrived to assume the governorship. He was Interim Governor of Cochinchina from 10 December 1869 to 9 January 1870. Franco-Prussian War and Commune (1870‚Äì71) Faron returned to France at start of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, and was placed in command of a brigade in the thirteenth army corps of General MacMahon, which was never engaged. He was then given command of a division in the first corps of the Second Army of Paris, under the command of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot. Faron was appointed Major General on December 2, 1870. His division, which included 35th and 42nd line regiments among others, was constantly active in the sorties around Paris, and preserved its arms at the moment of capitulation. During the Second Siege of Paris, when the city was controlled by the Paris Commune Faron's troops formed the nucleus of the reserve army commanded by Joseph Vinoy. He operated on the southern front of Paris, where they seized in turn Moulineaux, Clamart station and Fort d'Issy . His division entered Paris on 22 May 1871 by Grenelle and Vaugirard, pushed to the Pont d'Austerlitz and contributed to the taking of the Gare de Lyon, the Place de la Bastille, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the Place du Tr√¥ne and Belleville, the last refuge of the insurrection. Last years (1871‚Äì81) Faron was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour on 16 May 1871. At the age of 57 Faron was a divisional general, inspector general of the naval troops, and also very rich due to judicious speculations on the stock exchange. Faron died in Paris on 19 November 1881, at the age of 61.

If import prices were below this level, the profits would go into a reserve fund that would be used to subsidise imports when the price rose above the average. As grain prices at that time were lower than they had been for most of the previous 40 years, the effect of the Kanitz Plan would been considerable price rises. The Chancellors Leo von Caprivi and Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst both opposed the scheme, with the latter condemning it as a dangerous step to socialism.

The type and only species is Akainacephalus johnsoni, known from the most complete ankylosaur specimen ever discovered from southern Laramidia, including a complete skull, tail club, a number of osteoderms, limb elements and part of its pelvis, among other remains. Discovery and naming Preserved elements and skeletal reconstructions In 2008, in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Kane County, Utah, an ankylosaurian skeleton was discovered at a site first located by Scott Richardson, an employee of the Bureau of Land Management. In 2009, the excavation was completed by a team headed by R. Irmis. The skull of the skeleton was during four years prepared by volunteer Randy Johnson, a retired chemist. In January 2014, the skull was investigated by means of a CAT-scan. In 2018, the type species Akainacephalus johnsoni was named and described by Dutch paleontologist Jelle P. Wiersma and Randall Benjamin Irmis. The generic name combines a Greek ·ºÑŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒ±, akaina, \\"spike\\", a reference to the spiky head armour, with Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephal√®, \\"head\\". The specific name honours Randy Johnson as preparator. The holotype, UMNH VP 20202, was found in a layer of the Kaiparowits Formation dating from late Campanian. The age of the layer was determined at 75.97 million years by zircon dating. The holotype consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It contains the complete skull and lower jaws, including the predentary; four back vertebrae; eight sacral vertebrae; eight \\"free\\" tail vertebrae; eleven tail vertebrae forming the handle of the tail club; the tail club itself; ribs; both shoulder blades; a left coracoid; a right humerus; a right ulna; a left ilium; a left thighbone; a left shinbone; a left calfbone; a toe phalanx; a claw; two cervical halfrings; and fourteen osteoderms of the back and flanks. It represents about 45% of the skeletal elements. It is part of the collection of the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City. Description Tail handle and club The describing authors indicated several distinguishing traits. Some of these are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The supraorbital bosses are massive in side view, forming a high back-swept ridge, also extending sideways over the eye socket, while encompassing the front top corner and the rear edge of the eye socket. The cheek horns are triangular, pointing almost vertically to below. On the frontal bones, a central large flat hexagonal osteoderm is present. The zone spanning the frontal bones and nasal bones is covered by symmetrically positioned, closely packed, pyramid-shaped and conical caputegulae. The nasal bones exhibit a distinct central row of conical caputegulae, symmetrically separated from the osteoderms above and to the sides of them. At the rear of the skull, the part of the foramen magnum formed by the basioccipital is located obliquely above and in front of the occipital condyle. Skull from above and below The head armour of Akainacephalus is strikingly similar to that of Nodocephalosaurus, a related form also found in southern Laramidia, in New Mexico. The description therefore closely compared the two genera in order to prove that Akainacephalus was a valid taxon. Akainacephalus and Nodocephalosaurus share certain traits such as pyramid- shaped osteoderms on the snout and flaring armour above the nostrils. There are, however, also differences. With Akainacephalus, the osteoderms of the front and rear supraorbitals form a single back-swept high structure. In N. kirtlandensis, these remain separate elements of far smaller size. Akainacephalus has a much smaller squamosal horn. Its cheek horn points straight to below as an enormous triangle, while that of Nodocephalosaurus curves to behind like a smaller curved fin. A comparison is complicated by the fact that the skull of Nodocephalosaurus is only partly known. Besides, with the holotype of Akainacephalus the squamosal horns have broken off, making it impossible to determine their exact shape, and the skull as a whole has been compressed from front to rear, creating a kink from which snout and rear are appending, and narrowing and raising the area around the eye socket. However, Nodocephalosaurus was found in the Kirtland Formation, in layers that are three million years younger, which precludes the taxa from being identical. Sacrum and caudosacral vertebrae The front snout bones, the premaxillae, form a wide, U-shaped, upper beak, wider than long. The sides of the snout are not covered by armour. The number of maxillary teeth, per side, has been estimated at a minimum of sixteen. The bony nostrils are oriented to the side of the snout. The nostril is rather small and not clearly subdivided into smaller openings. The quadrate bone is strongly inclined, causing the jaw joint to be positioned, visible in side view, in front of the cheek horn point, which has not been reported in other ankylosaurids. Classification The skull ornamentation of Akainacephalus (left) compared to its close relatives (from left to right): Nodocephalosaurus, Tarchia, and Minotaurasaurus Akainacephalus' phylogenetic analysis reveals it to form a clade with fellow Laramidian ankylosaurid Nodocephalosaurus. Additional data from cladistic analysis also shows that Akainacephalus and Nodocephalosaurus are likewise more closely related to Asian ankylosaurid genera such as Saichania and Tarchia than to North American genera such as Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus itself. The discovery indicates a strong case for provincialism between dinosaur populations in Northern and Southern Laramidia. Furthermore, the discovery of Akainacephalus also indicates at least two faunal migrations between Asia and North America, created when dropping sea levels allowed migrations between the continents via the Beringian Land Bridge. Paleoecology During the Late Cretaceous period, the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.Titus, Alan L. and Mark A. Loewen (editors). At the Top of the Grand Staircase: The Late Cretaceous of Southern Utah. 2013. Indiana University Press. Hardbound: 634 pp. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. Akainacephalus shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as dromaeosaurid theropods, the troodontid Talos sampsoni, tyrannosaurids like Teratophoneus, the duckbilled hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus and Gryposaurus monumentensis, the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi, Nasutoceratops titusi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus giganteus. Some fossil evidence suggests the presence of the tyrannosaurid Albertosaurus and the ornithomimid Ornithomimus velox, but the existing assessment of the material is not conclusive. Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.

The novel is set in China and on the Moon. It was reviewed in several national media outlets, but received mixed reviews.  Plot  In the year 2047, Fred Fredericks is sent to the Moon to deliver a quantum communications device. Upon his arrival he is nearly killed during the handover of the device, but cannot remember what happened. He is held on suspicion of murdering the official to whom he was delivering the device. A journalist helps Fredericks and the dissident leader Qi, who is due to give birth soon, escape back to Earth. They are pursued by Chinese authorities who believe that Qi will lead a revolution of disaffected workers and displaced migrants to overthrow the Party leadership. After a series of chases and escapes, Fredericks and Qi return to the Moon, where they encounter a wealthy Chinese businessman building his own ideal colony and visit free settlers creating a lunar city outside government control. One faction of the Chinese leadership orders missile strikes on the Moon to kill Fredericks and Qi, but they receive advance warning of the attacks and flee to a remote lunar shelter, where Qi gives birth as millions of Chinese workers gather in Beijing to start the revolution.  Reception  According to literary review aggregator LitHub, the book received a slightly larger number of negative reviews than it did positive ones. Jason Sheehan of NPR criticized the book's emphasis on exposition and digressions into discussions of the environment, politics, and orbital mechanics, suggesting that Robinson's approach was \\"no way to tell a story\\". Writing for The Guardian, Chris Beckett praised Robinson's depiction of the relationship between Fredericks and Qi, calling it \\"a delightful and touching depiction of two people who would normally have nothing to do with each other, finding a way of getting along\\". The Times criticized the \\"great indigestible tracts of expository dialogue\\" and \\"horrible doldrum of narrative drift\\", but concluded that Red Moon \\"confirms its author's status as a sci-fi master\\".

Biography Mayfield was born on August 6, 1898, as Cleo Empey, the youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence B. Empey in Hutchinson, Kansas. As a child, she attended the North Side school in Hutchinson, before moving with her family to Kansas City, Missouri at the age of twelve. Mayfield with husband Cecil Lean in 1924 Mayfield first met Cecil Lean in Chicago in 1912, during the production of The Military Girl at the Ziegfeld Theatre. By 1913, she had assumed the stage name Cleo Mayfield. For the remainder of Lean's career, the two would frequently appear together in theatrical productions. In February 1914, Mayfield married Cecil Lean in a civil ceremony in Chicago. Prior to their marriage, Mayfield and Lean had been in a romantic relationship for over two years that only a few of their closest friends knew about. In July 1935, in the presence of Mayfield, Lean collapsed and died of an apparent heart attack in Manhattan. Over the course of her career, Mayfield made numerous appearances on Broadway stages and toured widely‚Äîas far afield as London‚Äîin a variety of musicals. Her Broadway appearances include productions of: The Man with Three Wives, The Blue Paradise, Miss 1917, Look Who's Here, The Blushing Bride, and Innocent Eyes. Her notable theatrical appearances away from Broadway include the touring production of No, No, Nanette that debuted in Detroit in January 1925. Mayfield made her final Broadway appearance in 1944, in a comedy play called Right Next to Broadway.

It is located on the outskirts of Al Khor City, the municipal seat, and is considered to be a district of the city. The hill Mashaf Al Egda is nearby to the south. Etymology The Arabic word \\"oqda\\" is roughly translated to \\"hold on to\\" in English. As the area is a rawda (depression), it would collect and retain vast amounts of water and sediments during rainy season, hence its name. Infrastructure Al Uqdah Equestrian Complex opened to the public in 2013. Strategically centered just outside Al Khor City, it is one of the most important equestrian facilities in the country. It accommodates no less than 1,000 horses, and its infrastructure includes a horse training area, indoor show halls and outdoor arenas. In 2015 the Public Works Authority included Al Egda in a project geared towards improving the sewage and road infrastructure, alongside Al Heedan and Al Khor City. Since then, the Al Khor Municipal Council has requested that the government distribute housing vouchers in the district. According to statements made by government officials in March 2017, the infrastructure projects in Al Egda will be completed by 2020 in order to meet the needs of 254 housing vouchers which had been allocated by the government.

There are some claims however for a later date (not earlier than the Kushana period), as well as of Graeco-Roman influence in the sculpting.The Lohanipur torso is thought to represent a Jaina Tirthankara. K. P. Jayaswal and M. A. Dhaky have regarded this to be the earliest Jain sculpture found.Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History, John Cort p. 32-33 The Didarganj Yakshi is another polished statue from Patna whose date is disputed, with the possible range between the Mauryan and Kushan periods.  Finding  The 2-foot torso is one of the two found in 1937 in an area of Patna. The smaller torso is one foot tall.Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History, John Cort p. 32-33. Historian K.P. Jayaswal reported that the excavation of the site revealed a Mauryan coin and a number of Mauryan bricks from a square shaped temple, suggesting the torso is from the Mauryan period.  Description  The Lohanipur torso is thought to represent a Jaina Tirthankara. The statue is an outstanding example of Mauryan polish, an advanced polishing technique essentially characteristic of the Mauryan Empire, which almost fell out of use after that period, although, if it is of a later date, it might suggest that polishing techniques survived the Mauryan era.  Comparison with the Harappa torso  The Lohanipur torso bears a striking resemblance with the Harappan jasper torso excavated in the 1928/29 season by Madho Sarup Vats, to the south of the \\"Great Granary\\" at Harappa. This ought to belong to the Mature Harappan period based on the dating of the site strata, but its date is questioned or disputed by scholars such as the British archaeologists Mortimer Wheeler or John Marshall, who suggested a historical period, probably Gupta (circa 500 CE). In 2002, the anthropologist Gregory Possehl commented that \\"it seems reasonable\\" that the piece belongs to the Mature Harappan period, exhibiting \\"the heights to which Indus artists could reach\\". In that case, the Harappa torso would date to 2300‚Äì1750 BCE.

Cryptomnesia is a failing of memory, usually referring to the mistaken belief that something the individual remembers is actually an original idea. Social cryptomnesia is a failure to remember the origin of a change, in which people know that a change has occurred in society, but forget how this change occurred; that is, the steps that were taken to bring this change about, and who took these steps. This may lead to reduced social credit towards the minorities who made major sacrifices that led to the change in societal values. Social cryptomnesia is an extension of Moscovici's (1985) four stages of minority influence.  Historical example: Women's rights  The progress made in the first wave of feminism includes but is not limited to: healthcare, education, and the right to vote. These rights are considered to be just by the general population, yet the actions taken by the suffragettes (and suffragists) to get to this point are frequently ignored. Feminists are sometimes subject to negative stereotypes, and sometimes seen as extremists or radical. Furthermore, such negative stereotypes may prevent social change from occurring, even when people agree it is necessary. It may be possible to reduce these negative effects of social cryptomnesia by making individuals aware of how social cryptomnesia may contribute to their biases.

By 1993, the population had declined so much, to 325, that the district decided to close its junior and senior high school divisions and send students to other school districts: Laurens-Marathon, Ruthven-Ayrshire, Sioux Central, and Spencer. Within the same year, as whole-grade sharing was in place, the student population was down to 232. After the closure of the high school, according to superintendent David Schulz, the community perceived the district to be doomed and speculated on how long the South Clay district would survive. According to Schulz, administrators were, at the time, operating on the presumption that the district would close circa 1996 to 1998. After 1993 the area population further declined, and increasing numbers of elementary students transferred to other schools. In 2010, the district had 132 students; there were seven preschool students, no kindergarten students, and no 4th-grade students. At the same time there were 97 students living in the district boundaries attending secondary school in other districts. There were also 18 employees, both full-time and part-time. At that time the district leadership decided to suggest dissolution of the district. On February 2, 2010, the residents voted to dissolve the school district. Schulz had stated that since taxpayers had requested the vote, he expected it to be approved by voters, but even if it had not been, the state would have involuntarily dissolved the school district anyway, with the local education agency (LEA) placing students in new schools. On July 1, 2010, the district was dissolved.

He is the head of the Computational Biology Group at MIT and is a Principal Investigator in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) at MIT. Kellis is known for his contributions to genomics, human genetics, epigenomics, gene regulation, and genome evolution. He co-led the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project effort to create a comprehensive map of the human epigenome, the comparative analysis of 29 mammals to create a comprehensive map of conserved elements in the human genome, the ENCODE, GENCODE, and modENCODE projects to characterize the genes, non-coding elements, and circuits of the human genome and model organisms. A major focus of his work is understanding the effects of genetic variations on human disease, with contributions to obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and cancer.  Education and early career  Kellis was born in Greece, moved with his family to France when he was 12, and came to the U.S. in 1993. He obtained his PhD from MIT, where he worked with Eric Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute, and Bonnie Berger, professor at MIT and received the Sprowls award for the best doctorate thesis in Computer Science, and the first Paris Kanellakis graduate fellowship. Prior to computational biology, he worked on artificial intelligence, sketch and image recognition, robotics, and computational geometry, at MIT and at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  Research and career  As of July 2018, Manolis Kellis has authored 187 journal publications that have been cited 68,380 times. He has helped direct several large-scale genomics projects, including the Roadmap Epigenomics project, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, the Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project. = Comparative genomics = Kellis started comparing the genomes of yeast species as an MIT graduate student. As part of this work, which was published in Nature in 2003, he developed computational methods to pinpoint patterns of similarity and difference between closely related genomes. The goal was to develop methods for understanding genomes with a view to apply them to the human genome. He turned from yeast to flies and ultimately to mammals, comparing multiple species to explore genes, their control elements, and their deregulation in human disease. Kellis led several comparative genomics projects in human, mammals, flies, and yeast. = Epigenomics = Kellis co- led the NIH government-funded project to catalogue the human epigenome. He said during an interview with MIT Technology Review ‚ÄúIf the genome is the book of life, the epigenome is the complete set of annotations and bookmarks.‚Äù His lab now uses this map to further the understanding of fundamental processes and disease in humans. = Obesity = Kellis and colleagues used epigenomic data to investigate the mechanistic basis of the strongest genetic association with obesity. They showed that this mechanism operates in the fat cells of both humans and mice and detailed how changes within the relevant genomic regions cause a shift from dissipating energy as heat (thermogenesis) to storing energy as fat. A full understanding of the phenomenon may lead to treatments for people whose 'slow metabolism' cause them to gain excessive weight. = Alzheimer's disease = Kellis, Li-Huei Tsai, and others at MIT used epigenomic markings in human and mouse brains to study the mechanisms leading to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. They showed that immune cell activation and inflammation, which have long been associated with the condition, are not simply the result of neurodegeneration, as some researchers have argued. Rather, in mice engineered to develop Alzheimer‚Äôs-like symptoms, they found that immune cells start to change even before neural changes are observed = Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) = Kellis is a member of the Genotype- Tissue Expression (GTEx) project that seeks to elucidate the basis of disease predisposition. It is an NIH-sponsored project that seeks to characterize genetic variation in human tissues with roles in diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. To date, his lab has developed specific domain expertise in obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and cancer. = Teaching = In addition to his research, Kellis co-taught for several years MIT's required undergraduate introductory algorithm courses 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms and 6.046: Design and Analysis of Algorithms with Profs. Ron Rivest, Erik Demaine, Piotr Indyk, Srinivas Devadas and others. He is also teaching a computational biology course at MIT, titled \\"Computational Biology: Genomes, Networks, Evolution.\\" The course (6.047/6.878) is geared towards advanced undergraduate and early graduate students, seeking to learn the algorithmic and machine learning foundations of computational biology, and also be exposed to current frontiers of research in order to become active practitioners of the field. He started 6.881: Computational Personal Genomics: Making sense of complete genomes. This course is aimed at exploring the computational challenges associated with interpreting how sequence differences between individuals lead to phenotypic differences such as gene expression, disease predisposition, or response to treatment. = Awards and honors= Kellis received the US Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the National Science Foundation CAREER award, a Sloan Research Fellowship, the Gregor Mendel medal for Outstanding Achievements in Science by the Mendel Lectures committee, the Athens Information Technology (AIT) Niki Award for Science and Engineering, the Ruth and Joel Spira Teaching award, and the George M.

Early years William Heber LeBaron was one of 54 children sired by Ervil LeBaron, a member of a polygamous Mormon fundamentalist group. The LeBarons were descendants of Benjamin F. Johnson, one of the earliest followers of Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith. When The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints renounced polygamy, Johnson and his family became Mormon fundamentalists and continued the practice. Johnson's grandson, Alma Dayer LeBaron Sr., believed that Johnson was the rightful successor to Smith, and that Johnson had appointed Alma to follow him. Alma LeBaron moved his family to Mexico, where the government showed no interest in prosecuting polygamists. After Alma's death, his son Joel founded The Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times and named himself the One Mighty and Strong. Ervil LeBaron served as his brother's second-in-command for several years, but in 1967 began preaching that he, and not Joel, was the true leader of the church. By 1972, Ervil founded his own sect, the Church of the First Born of the Lamb of God. He preached the importance of blood atonement, a long-renounced Mormon principle that required that the blood of sinners be shed to ensure that they have a place in Heaven. Ervil LeBaron also claimed that he was the true leader of all polygamous Mormon sects, and that they should all tithe to support him and his church. Those who refused were threatened with violence. Ervil died in jail in 1981, after being convicted of plotting the murder of Rulon C. Allred, leader of one of the largest polygamous sects. While incarcerated, Ervil crafted a list of people who deserved blood atonement, consisting of people who had left his church or otherwise upset him. Ervil's manifesto also included a list of men who would succeed him as leader of the cult. His son Heber was listed second, after Ervil's eldest son Arturo. Cult leader Heber LeBaron was 20 years old when he assumed leadership of the cult after his elder half-brother's death. Under his leadership, the cult fully embraced criminal enterprises.Anderson He was convicted in Arizona of operating a large auto theft ring. He was also charged with attempted murder of a guard during a bank robbery in Texas. LeBaron committed to enforcing his father's wish to blood atone perceived traitors. After his younger half-brother Richard agreed to testify against him, LeBaron was convicted of killing former cult member Mark Chynoweth in one of what was known as the 4 O'Clock Murders. Chynoweth's brother Duane, Duane's 8-year-old daughter Jennifer, and LeBaron's half- brother Ed Marston were also killed at approximately the same time, 4 pm on June 27, 1988. Post-conviction LeBaron claims to have converted to Christianity and to be ashamed of his actions while with the cult.

They are a respected band from the new wave of British heavy metal period who settled on the name Slayer in 1980, meaning (as with S.A Slayer) they had to change their title to Dragonslayer to avoid confusion with the thrash band Slayer from Los Angeles, who released their debut album Show No Mercy worldwide on 3 December 1983. They can be described as early Power Metal, sharing classic rock influences with and fantasy-themed lyrics with other N.W.O.B.H.M. bands from the West Midlands such as Tyrant, Cynic, Grim Reaper and Arc. Biography The band initially formed in 1978 as Heavy Thunder. As they started to play more heroic fantasy-themed songs, they changed their name to Slayer on moving to Rochdale, Greater Manchester in 1980, developing a good live reputation and recording a five-track demo at Cargo Studios, which was produced by Colin Richardson who would later find fame producing bands such as Fear Factory and Machine Head. In late 1983, the \\"I Want Your Life\\" EP was recorded at Cavalier Studios in Stockport. However, following the pressing and just before the single's release, Slayer from Los Angeles released their debut, so the band chose to rebrand themselves as Dragonslayer. Stickers were placed over the EP labels with their new logo, although these were thin so the original label could still be seen through. The single was well-received, and they continued to play headline local shows, even supporting Tractor for a number of dates. The band looked for a record deal throughout 1984 and 1985, choosing to record another 7 track demo early in 1986 to keep the band pushing forward. Following this recording bassist Steve Morgan decided to leave the band and was replaced by Marc Webb, formerly of a band called Voltage. With this lineup, they recorded the track \\"Rock the Radio\\" for an Ebony Records compilation called \\"The Metal Collection Vol. II\\". They played some farewell gigs then split up in mid-1987. Strangely, the only member who kept playing in bands was guitarist Phil Odins. In 2008 a compilation of most of their recorded material was issued by Shadow Kingdom Records. Following this successful reissue, the band started rehearsing again and posting on Facebook in 2013, announcing they were writing new songs and planning to play live again. However, after not posting for a while in 2016, they announced \\"the Dragon still sleeps for now\\". The compilation does not feature the track 'Rock the Radio' from the 1987 Ebony Records compilation The Metal Collection Volume II. Musical style Dragonslayer is best described as a new wave of British heavy metal band, playing proto-power metal.

Born and raised in Virginia, Mifflin established himself as a planter in Delaware in 1769. As a member of the Society of Friends, he was strongly opposed to slavery and became dedicated to assisting slaves who tried to free themselves, to defending free blacks from abuse, as well as encouraging Quakers and others to free their slaves. Early life and family Mifflin was born in Accomack County, Virginia on the Eastern Shore in 1745, into a family descended from Quaker immigrants who arrived in New Jersey in 1677. Although often sickly, he grew to be seven feet tall, with a confident, charismatic personality. He was a second cousin of the more famous Thomas Mifflin of Pennsylvania. The several dozen slaves on the family's plantation produced cereals, flax, fruit, and livestock. The young Mifflin's conscience was troubled as he came to understand that the children he had played with growing up on his father's plantation were slaves. Mifflin wrote that he became an abolitionist at the age of fourteen, after a conversation with a young man who was one of his father's slaves. He \\"determined never to be a slave-holder,\\"Mifflin, Warner. \\"The Defence of Warner Mifflin Against Aspersions, cast on him on account of his Endeavors to promote Righteousness, Mercy and Peace, among Mankind\\", Samuel Sansom, 1796. Republished in Life and Ancestry of Warner Mifflin, Friend--Philanthropist--Patriot, p. 77-101, Ferris & Leach, 1905. but in 1767, he married Elizabeth Johns (c.1749-1786), and her family provided them with a plantation in Kent County, Delaware and several slaves as a dowry. Their plantation's slaves produced many of the same foodstuffs, such as cereals and meat, that Mifflin's father's plantation had. Like his father, Mifflin also eagerly bought more land whenever possible. Elizabeth was a lapsed Quaker who had become an Anglican, which briefly caused the Mifflins problems with the Duck Creek Quaker Meeting they sought to join, but both became reconciled with that meeting and were full members by 1769. After Elizabeth died, probably of cancer, Mifflin remarried in 1788 to Ann Emlen (1755-1815), another Quaker reformer. Of her pregnancies, two sons would survive to adulthood. In total, Mifflin fathered twelve children, six of whom died before they were four years old, and only five of whom survived to adulthood. Career Although the Quakers' Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting had begun condemning slaveholding by Quakers in 1755, and despite Mifflin's previous commitment to never own slaves, it was only when the Yearly Meeting became militant about the problem that he became an activist. Mifflin began freeing his own slaves in 1774, and convinced his father to do the same. Thomas Clarkson wrote that Mifflin \\"was the first man in America to unconditionally emancipate his slaves.\\" By the time his father Daniel liberated one hundred slaves in 1775, Warner was in the process of freeing twenty-two slaves and repurchasing five others he had previously sold in order to free them too. He entered into free labor contracts with them to keep his work force intact, and he provided schooling for their children. As Quaker Meetings began requiring disownment of members for slave-keeping after 1776, Mifflin traveled extensively to encourage compliance, and to encourage non- Quakers like John Dickinson to liberate their slaves too. During the American Revolutionary War, Warner Mifflin also became a leading Quaker peace activist, despite the danger of being associated with loyalism for doing so. He traveled through most of the Mid-Atlantic states and New England to promote his anti- war message on behalf of his fellow Quakers. In 1777, he passed through British lines to meet with General George Washington during the Battle of Germantown. His refusal to pay any taxes that would support the war effort resulted in seizures of part of his property by sheriffs. Mifflin expanded the abolition campaign beyond what even most Quakers were likely to support, to include reparations (or \\"restitution\\") to former slaves. He also began to expound the Free Produce Movement, that is, not to buy or consume any products of slave labor. He also arranged tours of groups of former slaves into plantation areas to advertise the successes of free blacks, in order to discredit the anti-abolitionist argument that freed people would not work. After the war, Mifflin became a leading exponent of abolition of the African trade and general abolition of slavery, putting pressure on state legislatures. He traveled widely in the Upper South states in this effort. He also began trying to halt the domestic slave trade, and to stop the kidnapping of free blacks to enslave them in other states. He was a member of the committee sent by the Pennsylvania Abolition Society to Congress in 1790 to present an abolition petition, which caused a prolonged and bitter debate. He met again with George Washington, now president, who remembered him from Germantown and treated him \\"with kindness and respect\\". In 1791, he sent a strong personal appeal to President Washington and Congress: his \\"memorial\\" on slavery. Congress returned the memorial with contempt, setting precedent for the later \\"gag rule\\" of 1836. Mifflin answered by publishing \\"A Serious Expostulation with the Members of the House of Representatives of the United States\\" (1793), which challenged the moral conscience of the congressmen. Mifflin was recognized in pre-revolutionary France for his views. In 1782, J. Hector St. John de Cr√®vec≈ìur included an anecdote about him in his Letters from an American Farmer. Mifflin had a strong personal influence on Jacques Pierre Brissot, a French radical who visited America in 1788 and later became a leading Girondist in the French Revolution. Mifflin's last public event was the Quakers' Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1798, which was held during an outbreak of yellow fever. He ministered to the victims of the epidemic and ultimately died from the fever. Legacy He was far in advance of most Americans in his political views. He believed not only that slavery should be abolished, but that African Americans wanted nothing more than a level playing field to demonstrate their natural equality with white people. He was usually more progressive in his views than most Quakers, and made substantial personal sacrifices of his own personal fortune to live up to his ideals. However, his typical Quaker self-effacement meant his political involvement was not as direct as it might have been, and he faced the antagonism of non-Quakers because Quakers' antiwar activity made them appear unpatriotic during the Revolution. His second wife, Ann, became an indefatigable itinerant reformer like him, traveling to the western states on various missions. She was the first woman to advocate the project for African colonization of former slaves, and one of the earliest proponents of the cultural assimilation, rather than removal, of Native Americans. Warner Mifflin's numerous sisters and daughters also carried on his legacy of social reform, and Philadelphia's African Americans formed the African Warner Mifflin Society in the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, Mifflin declined into obscurity in the twentieth century. Gary B. Nash, a historian, published Warner Mifflin: Unflinching Quaker Abolitionist in an effort to revitalize interest and illustrate that he \\"was the key figure connecting the abolitionist movements before and after the American Revolution\\".

It is a cylindrical, unsegmented worm which burrows in soft sediment on the seabed. It has a circumpolar distribution. Taxonomy and evolution Priapulus caudatus is one of only nineteen known species in the phylum Priapulida. French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck first described it in 1816. Phylogenetic studies have indicated that scalidophorans, to which priapulids belong, are a basal clade of ecdysozoans (animals that grow by shedding their exoskeleton), and thus a sister group to all other ecdysozoans, an assortment including nematodes and arthropods. Priapulids were abundant and widespread in the Early Cambrian period and their tunnelling activities in soft sediment created many trace fossils. P. caudatus is likely to be very similar to the animals existing at that time. Description A cylindrical unsegmented worm, P. caudatus grows to a length of . The body is divided into two distinct regions; at the front is the introvert, ridged longitudinally and heavily armed with rows of spines. The mouth is at its tip and is surrounded by seven rows, each with five teeth. The introvert is retractable into the trunk, a longer and broader region with transverse, ring-like markings. It is terminated on the ventral side by a much-branched, tail-like appendage. The front of the tail is sometimes obscured by a swelling of the trunk. The whole animal is a pinkish-brown colour. Distribution and habitat This species has a widespread, northerly circumpolar distribution, being present in New England, eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland and Scandinavia, as well as eastern Russia, Alaska and western United States, and sporadically further south. It is found in the subtidal zone, where it burrows in soft sediments. It is plentiful in Auke Bay, Juneau, in Alaska, where a research study was undertaken in the 1980s. Here it occurred in the depth range of but elsewhere it has been found as deep as . Ecology P. caudatus has been little studied and its ecology is poorly known. It is believed to be carnivorous while other closely related species are thought to be deposit feeders and detritivores. The sexes are separate and fertilisation is external. Eggs are small and yolky, and cleavage is holoblastic, radial and equal. The larvae live on the seabed and have an introvert, and a trunk enclosed by a thick cuticle into which the introvert can be retracted.

It was of advanced aerodynamical design, showed promise but was wrecked before the best winds arrived. Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, flown on the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland leading to the First Polish Glider Contest, held at Czarna G√≥ra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site. The clear winner was the SL 1 Akar which managed a 186 s flight and the Polon was its only serious competitor, with an early 98 s flight before being written off in a spectator- related accident. Compared with the Akar the Polon was lighter and aerodynamically cleaner. It aso had a high aspect ratio (12.1) wing compared with most 1923 gliders apart from that of the German Darmstadt Konsul (16.7). This wing, essentially rectangular in plan apart from rounded tips and widened ailerons, was built around twin spars and fabric covered. It was shoulder mounted to the upper fuselage longerons, with lift wires between the spars and the lower fuselage longerons. The Polon had a rectangular section fuselage built around four longerons. The forward part was plywood-covered and the rear fabric-covered, with a wire-braced ply and fabric-covered empennage. The fin was triangular and mounted a generous rhrombic rudder, leaving a gap below in which the elevator could work. The tailplane very small, essentially just a mounting for a large area, roughly semi-circular, balanced rudder. The Polon had a narrow-track undercarriage, its mainwheels close to the fuselage bottom and sides on a cross-axle with shock absorbers mounted within the fuselage. Operational history After the repair of some minor damage sustained on the Polon's first, brief flight on 28 August 1923, B≈Ça≈ºy≈Ñski managed three flights in the Contest, under low wind conditions. The last and best lasted 98 s (49 s according to another source). He took off again after an encouraging wind set in but found a spectator in his flight path, tried but failed to avoid him and ended inverted in the broken Polon. Neither he or the spectator were seriously hurt, though the Polon never flew again.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is set within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Chair Peak is situated three miles northwest of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Chair Peak is located immediately south of Snow Lake which is a popular hiking destination. The nearest higher neighbor is Kaleetan Peak, to the west- northwest. Climate Chair Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Kaleetan (left} Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Chair Peak from Kendall Peak Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

The usage of buses in student transport varies worldwide, ranging from the usage of public transportation by students, transit buses set aside to transport students, or purpose-built school buses owned and operated by school systems. Yellow school buses are most commonly associated with North America, where federal and state/provincial regulations have influenced its design characteristics, including its yellow color. When loading or unloading students, yellow school buses are given traffic priority. Their red warning lights and stop signs allow them to stop traffic. Outside of North America, school buses typically do not have traffic priority while loading or unloading students. Asia =China= A Yutong school bus produced with an American-style cowled chassis In China, purpose-built vehicles for transporting schoolchildren are not commonly used. The earliest professional school bus in China appeared in October 2008. Compared with many developed countries, Chinese schools have a relatively short history of providing transportation services. It was not until 1990 that the first private schools began to offer bus services. Due to a lack of buses, it is common for buses to be overloaded with schoolchildren. According to a 2011 article by Beijing Evening News, there are around 90 million students in China who need to ride school buses, which amounts to requiring over 1 million legally safe school buses. However, in 2010, the number of safe school buses just eclipsed 10,000, far below the recommended threshold. Consequently, accidents happen frequently, and 18,000 children die from traffic accidents every year. Furthermore, legally safe school buses that are manufactured in China are largely exported and rarely seen in China, further contributing to a lack of supply of safe school buses. The frequency of school bus-involved traffic accidents has raised concerns throughout China. In 2011, 41 primary and middle school students were killed in school bus accidents, including a collision between a kindergarten bus and a coal van in Gansu province. The nine-seat minibus was carrying 64 people: the driver, a teacher, and 62 children. Both adults and 19 children were killed, and all surviving 43 students were injured. Following this, 15 children were killed when a school bus overturned into a ditch in Jiangsu province. In a third incident, two schoolchildren were killed and 20 injured when a carriage carrying students collided with a truck in Yunnan province. Three days later, in Yunnan province, five junior high school students were killed when a bus fell off a cliff.  Legislation  On September 1, 2007, the national standards committee issued a national standardization amendment titled \\"Motor Vehicle Operation Safety Technical Conditions\\". China began to implement the school bus operation mandatory standards. The same day, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice, and ten other committees jointly issued the implementation of the \\"Primary and Secondary School Students Kindergarten Safety Management Office Law\\". Between September 1, 2007, and September 31, 2010, the Ministry of Public Security, in accordance with the Motor Vehicle Operation Safety Technical Conditions amendment, carried out school bus operations in various areas of the country. The social demand of school buses has attracted attention from all levels of government. The related management departments have been in the process of researching and discussing the most feasible ways to develop school bus industrialization in China. In the twelfth Chinese five-year plan (2011‚Äì2015), the State Administration of Work Safety stressed the need to establish and improve the legal and safety management systems of school buses, clarify the right of way for school buses, strengthen the supervision of school buses, and ensure the safety of school buses. Each school bus must have satellite positioning and speed-limit devices installed. The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine has released the following safety guidelines for school buses: # School bus appearance: School buses are uniformly marked with eye-catching colors (e.g. yellow) and can be equipped with warning lights and sirens. # Inside the school bus: School bus safety regulations are higher than ordinary vehicles (e.g. anti-collision). GPS and real-time monitoring systems of the vehicle's running routes and speed are to be installed. A speed limiter should also be implemented to prevent speeding. The upper and lower doors are to be equipped with cameras to monitor personnel in real time. Buses are to be equipped with emergency hammers. # Crew: Drivers must have professional licenses and conduct regular spot checks. If there are issues, including driving violations, they should be corrected in a timely manner. The organization of training is mandated, and repeat offenders should be disqualified from driving school buses. Vehicles should be strictly restricted and one or more teachers should be assigned to maintain order. # Right of way: The school bus has the same right of way as a conventional bus. In case of emergency, the use of lights and alarms is required.  Models  Some Chinese bus manufacturers have developed school bus models to be purchased by Chinese schools. Yutong, for example, designed the ZK6100DA model, which was described as a \\"big-nose school bus\\" with a \\"classic western- style appearance\\" and \\"the highest safety rating of all school bus products in China\\" in a 2011 China Daily article. FAW Bus and Coach has developed a similar model, the CA6750, which can hold 37 students. In addition to large school buses, minibuses are produced by various manufacturers. Chengdu Automobile Factory produces the \\"Chendu School bus\\", and Maxus produces the \\"Maxus V80 School bus\\". The models can hold 24 and 16 students, respectively. In February 2012, the potential of American-imported school buses was explored as several American manufacturers, including Blue Bird Corporation and Navistar International, displayed buses at the Beijing International School Bus Exhibition. =Hong Kong= A \\"nanny van\\" is a special type of school bus in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, younger students are transported between their homes and schools by \\"nanny vans\\". These vehicles are typically van-based and are smaller than a minibus. When nanny vans originated, they were regulated primarily by the schools and the van drivers. Today, in the interest of safety, nanny vans are government-regulated vehicles that run on fixed routes. =Singapore= A shuttle bus in NUS, 2007 In Singapore, student transport by bus is usually provided by local scheduled public transport bus services, such as the 31, 72, 88, 179 and 199 services, as well as various train services. Dedicated bus services for school students are usually contracted out to local bus companies, using ordinary buses which are used for other purposes when not in use for school journeys. The Singaporean Ministry of Education has created the Information Notice Board for School Bus Services (IBSB) platform, on which different bus operators can submit bids for the opportunity to provide school bus services. The school bus fares in Singapore are paid by the students' parents. Under the newly-introduced 9-month payment schedule, parents can spread the yearly amount over 9 equal payments. This schedule has been implemented to reduce the financial strain put on parents from having to pay fees in advance in January, May and October. Even though the monthly fee under the 9-month payment schedule is higher, parents only need to pay for the 9 months of which the school year is comprised. The National University of Singapore (NUS) has its own internal shuttle bus system that is operated by ComfortDelgro. = South Korea = South Korea attaches great importance to student traffic safety. Over the years, laws and regulations have specified the school bus and vehicle management rules for picking up students. The research and development of educational projects and facilities has gradually formed a student traffic safety management system.  Current status of Korean elementary and middle school cars  South Korea has a 12-year compulsory education system. Primary and secondary schools are compulsory. Most kindergartens and primary schools in Korea are private schools. Because schools are located near residential areas, most Korean students go to schools on foot. Therefore, people can often see a group of students walking to the school in the morning. Students who live further away from school uses public transportation like subway or bus. There are limited number of private schools who need school buses.  The status quo of Korean university bus  Korean university school buses are common, and almost every university has its own school bus. These school buses vary in color with yellow buses being rare and are distinguishable from other buses by a yellow school zone sign or a sign that reads \\"School Bus\\" on the top rear end of the bus. Private and public schools often have 'activity' style buses, sometimes in a color matching the 'school colours' although more commonly with just the name and logo of the school on the side and/or front of the bus. Moreover, these buses commonly also being used for normal scheduled routes as required. These school buses are generally convenient places from school stations to subway stations or some supermarkets or hospitals. The school bus has a fixed schedule. These buses are mainly designed to provide convenience to students from all over the world. Increasingly, jurisdictions are requiring new buses purchased for use on school routes to be fitted with seat belts and 'compartmentalisation' features, or even requiring students to use seat belts at all times.  Korean school bus style  The school buses in South Korea are basically directly converted from commercial vehicles. Among them are the modern H1, Ruifeng, Kia VQ, Ssangyong Ludi and so on. These school buses are all painted in yellow and add with headlights. There are few internal changes. Schools with good economic conditions will prefer modern business vehicles as school buses. The car will be painted with a cartoon image that is fascinating. If the economic conditions are not very good, they will use the old Ssangyong and Kia models. It's just that the model is old and the other is basically the same. The Hyundai H1 is equipped with a 2.2-litre diesel engine and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Up to four row seats can be selected for a total of 12 seats.  Korea Road Traffic Law Policy  South Korea has strict requirements for school buses to ensure children are safe at home. According to the 2004 study of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, over the past 20 years, the number of children killed by its member states on the road has reached 100,000, and the death rate of children's traffic accidents is four times that of adults. Traffic accidents have become the leading cause of death among children. The countries with high death rates for children with traffic accidents are the United States, New Zealand, and South Korea, while the lower countries include Sweden, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Japan. In view of this situation, the Korean government made a comprehensive revision of the Road Traffic Law in 2006, further supplementing and improving the safety management of pre-school children and students commuting vehicles, applying for school bus, replacement, performance, marking, insurance, Detailed rules have been set for the driving rules, the obligations and responsibilities of the drivers. In South Korea, the school bus that picks up and collects children's classes and schools has a protected status on the road and is legally guaranteed. The Korean Road Traffic Law stipulates that when a vehicle carrying a preschool child or student stops on the road, the driver of the car driving on the parking road or on the roadside must stop first, and wait until the parking indicator of the student car gradually disappears, confirming the safety. Then drive slowly. The law also stipulates that all vehicles must not overtake when driving with children; school buses can be used on bus-only routes, and priority should be given to school buses when encountering small traffic accidents; when carrying children under 6 years of age You must wear a seat belt inside the car. If you violate the regulations, you will be fined 30,000 won. Kindergartens, primary schools, schools for the disabled, and nurseries will be classified as \\"children's protection zones.\\" More than 30 kilometres per hour. The Road Traffic Law also stipulates that when a school bus picks up a child, there should be a lecturer, a special school teacher, a childcare worker, a sports facility administrator, and other relevant protection workers. South Korea's motor vehicle application for becoming a school bus is relatively strict. First, it applies to the local police station and obtains a certificate of approval. The school bus driver or operator must affix the approved certificate to the right side of the front glass to begin operation. Vehicles that are not approved may not imitate the color of the school bus or make similar marks, and may not undertake the work of picking up students. The car owners have changed the model and internal structure, and also put forward strict requirements, including a set of application procedures, including the submission of necessary materials for the inspection of traffic safety vehicles, the comprehensive renovation certificate, the vehicle structure inspection certificate, and the declaration of the police station inspection certificate. and many more. South Korea also has specific requirements for the school bus itself. For preschool children and students, the color of the \\"protected car\\" is uniformly yellow; the height of the first step of the door is 30 cm; the height of the second step is 20 cm; the right side of the front glass and the center of the rear of the car are affixed with \\"child protection vehicles\\". \\"The school bus should clarify the owner of the car. If there is a partnership operator, it must be explained; the school bus must be integrated into the insurance; the seat belt must conform to the child's body shape; the vehicle doors and windows must be open; the folding chair should not be placed inside the car.South Korea has strict school bus regulations to ensure children get home safely,China education news,2017 Èü©ÂõΩÂØπÊ†°ËΩ¶Ë¶ÅÊ±Ç‰∏•Ê†ºÁ°Æ‰øùÂÑøÁ´•ÂÆâÂÖ®Âà∞ÂÆ∂ South Korea has strict school bus requirements to ensure children get home safely Europe =Germany= Mercedes-Benz O307 school bus in M√∂rlenbach, Germany In Germany, students travel to school on scheduled public train and bus routes. In most cases, these services operate at times to suit school hours and are not run during weekends and holiday periods, though the services are open to use by non-school-related travelers. Local authorities subsidize the routes, but parents or guardians are sometimes required to pay a contribution to the cost of a season ticket for use of the services. Many scholars use their own bicycles to travel to school and may take these with them when a part of the journey is by train. As student transport is heavily dependent on the public transport system in urban areas, most students are transported on mass-transit or intercity buses along with minibuses in support. To distinguish themselves from other buses, routes that only transport students are required to have a destination sign worded with a yellow background. German traffic law gives traffic priority to school buses unloading and loading students; buses are to warn traffic using their four-way hazard lights. The maximum speed for German school buses varies. While coaches are typically limited to , any buses with standing passengers are limited to . =Italy= A Cacciamali Thesi/Iveco school bus in Rimini, Italy In Italy, school buses are typically painted yellow or orange. The vehicles used for student transport are usually minibuses. As in North America, school buses run on fixed routes and stops. While only a legal requirement for bus transporting Materne (preschool) students, school bus drivers are provided with an aide to manage the students on the bus. =Poland= 2009 Autosan Tramp school bus in Gmina Jasion√≥wka, Podlaskie Voivodeship, Poland In Poland, school buses are used in a similar fashion to those in the United States, to connect residents of rural areas to schools located further away. While officially lettered (Polish for \\"school bus\\"), they are colloquially known as gimbus. Along with their counterparts in North America, school buses in Poland have several design features to differentiate them from standard buses. First, all school buses are painted orange. Inside, the driver's compartment is not allowed to be blocked from the passenger compartment. The rear door, if present, must be able to be locked by the driver. All doors must lock automatically at speeds above . =Russia= PAZ-32053 in use as a school bus in Tomsk Oblast Like school buses in North America, school buses in Russia are allowed to stop traffic (with both lights and alarms) when loading and unloading students at bus stops. School bus drivers are also accompanied by aides, who are given their own seating on the bus; buses also have onboard luggage space. School buses transporting children are identified by the wording –ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–∑–∫–∞ –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π (Perevozka Detey, Transporting Children). All school buses are restricted to a maximum speed of . Prior to 1999, buses intended for transporting school children differed only in their route identification; no government regulations were required. In 2001, the Russian government began to acquire dedicated school buses, particularly to transport students in rural areas. =Spain= In Spain, school buses aren't painted in any specific way. While Spanish public schools are usually obliged by law to guarantee a free bus route for every student if it's the closest to their place of residence, these buses are common chartered buses hired by schools with a special public fund, yet on behalf of themselves. However, when performing as school buses, vehicles carry an approved V-10 Sign (\\"Transporte Escolar\\", School Transport) in the front side of the vehicle, indicating their duty and the need to take precautions around it. =Ukraine= As in many other countries, in Ukraine, school buses are painted yellow or orange. In Ukrainian school buses are called \\"—à–∫—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–±—É—Å\\" (Shkil'niy Avtobus). =United Kingdom= Wright Eclipse SchoolRun bodied Volvo B7R of Ulsterbus In the United Kingdom, student transport by bus is usually provided by local scheduled public transport bus services. Dedicated bus services for school students are usually contracted out to local bus companies, using ordinary buses that are used for other purposes when not in use for school journeys. In the United Kingdom all children between 5 and 16 years old are qualified for free school transport if they live more than two miles (children under 8 years old) or three miles (children 8 years old or older) from the nearest school. In addition all children qualify if there is no safe walking route. Special needs children qualify if they cannot walk to school no matter the distance. During the 1990s, local governments began to establish a dedicated network of school bus service. To replace Leyland double-decker buses of the early 1980s, right-hand drive Blue Bird Corporation school buses were imported from the United States. In the private sector, in 2000, FirstGroup launched First Student UK, using the same school bus yellow livery as on American school buses. While initially using right-hand drive Blue Bird TC/2000s imported from the United States, the company switched to Turkish-produced BMC 1100 buses later in the 2000s. MyBus is a group of bus contractors (including First Student UK) that use school buses solely for school transport. Buses are fitted with seat belts, and full- time drivers are assigned to each route. Alongside importation of right-hand drive American vehicles and BMC-produced school buses, from 2006 to 2008, Wrightbus (of Northern Ireland) produced the Wright Eclipse SchoolRun. Adapting the Wright Eclipse into a high-floor design for school bus use, the SchoolRun was a 66-passenger bus, with 2+3 seating (most full-size American school buses have 3+3 seating) along with a side wheelchair lift (standard on the final 50 examples produced). Children with more complex needs or disabilities are often transported to special schools in purpose-built minibuses. In a similar fashion to their counterparts in North America, these minibuses are school bus bodies fitted to full-size van chassis. In Europe, the Ford Transit and the Mercedes-Benz Vario are popular donor chassis for such vehicles.

The primary functional difference is the adaptation to the bilingual population of Canada. In francophone Quebec, the signage on the outside of the bus is in French; the front and rear legends read \\"‚ÄîFrench for \\"Schoolchildren\\" (\\"School Bus\\" translated into French is the much longer \\"\\"). The stop signal arm legend may read , French for \\"Stop\\", or may have both \\"\\" and \\"\\". In addition, all emergency exit designations and instructions are required to be bilingual. Further safety requirements may be introduced at a provincial or even local level; for example, some coastal jurisdictions where fog is common insist on buses being fitted with roof-mounted strobe lights for use in poor visibility. As Canada does not use the customary system, instrument panel gauges are calibrated in metric units. School buses, like all other Canadian vehicles, are equipped with daytime running lights (DRLs). Older buses not equipped with DRLs are driven with headlights on. Buses are sometimes marketed to customers in Canada differently from in the United States. In one example, the Blue Bird All American is rebadged as the Blue Bird TX3 in Canada (and other export markets). Additionally, of the three regionally focused brands sold by Collins Industries, only Corbeil is sold in Canada, due to its previous manufacturing base in Quebec. The Lion Electric Company (in French, La Compagnie √âlectrique Lion) is a manufacturer based in Saint-J√©r√¥me, Quebec that specializes in vehicles powered by battery-electric powertrains. =Mexico= Purpose-built school bus in Mexico In Mexico, in addition to yellow school buses seen from the United States, various other types of buses are used in the role of student transport. As in the United States, many schools own their own fleets of school buses; school bus yellow is not a government regulation, so most buses are painted in individual school colors. Depending on capacity needs, vans, minibuses and midibuses are also used. Among retired American school buses, some newer ones are imported into Mexico and put back into school service. Unlike the United States and Canada, school-owned buses are not primarily used for route service (due to high cost); instead, they are often used for field trips and other related excursions. In addition to students using regular transit systems, several Mexican companies specialize in scheduled student transportation.  School transportation program of the Mexico City (PROTE)  The program began with a first phase of application during the 2008‚Äì2009 school year and the second during the 2009‚Äì2010 school year. Only for private basic education schools. Until August 2014, there were a total of 943 buses that offer school transport service, guaranteeing clean emissions and safe routes for students. This service is provided by companies that grant the service. Counting each unit with satellite tracking providing information in real time of the journey, in addition to having the Ministry of Public Security so that in case of any unfortunate situation. Until December 2016 there were 63 private basic education schools that are integrated into the school transportation plan. = Price of the school transportation = These types of transportation are not mandatory in all schools and most parents only who request it pay for it, having a fee agreed with the principal of the schools. In 2008, when the program was implemented, the cost was approximately $600 M.N. per month. Until February 17, 2017 obligatory school transportation had an average cost of $800 M.N. per month. = Segregation in the school transportation = When the program was implemented, it was only mandatory for schools with more than one thousand 240 students, that amount is reduced in each school year, reaching the 2013‚Äì2014 school year, reaching schools that have more than 490 students and can exempt the use of transportation obligatory school. Many educational institutions that oppose, cataloged the unfair program and even some coming to cover themselves, achieving that the minister, Jos√© Fernando Franco Gonz√°lez Salas, belonging to the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN), cataloged the School transportation program of the Mexico City (PROTE) as a program that It grants a differentiated treatment without an objective and reasonable justification, since this program obliges the schools of the district to offer the service according to the number of students they have.  Universities with school bus  Route 8 of Pumabus = Pumabus (UNAM) = The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has a free bus service called Pumabus, which is accessible to the university community and visitors. It has 12 routes and an express route, which circulate through a special lane within the University, also having an app called pumawaze, which helps find routes. This routes connect several points of the campus with Massive Transport Systems located near the complex (Metro, Metrobus and several local bus lines). Each pumabus has an approximate capacity of 75 to 90 people, it also has special places for the disabled people, has security cameras and alert buttons. Currently the UNAM has 58 buses that transport more than 136 thousand users per day, of which eight are reserved, 10 are ecological and 50 with permanent circulation all the routes with a schedule from 06:00 to 22:00 hours during weekdays, on weekends only the routes that doesn't gives services to cultural and sport centers, like the Universum Museum, Nezahualcoyotl Concert Hall and University Stadium. This service uses Low-Floor Mercedes Benz Citaro buses along with conventional units. = TransporTEC (ITESM) = The school transport offered by Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey (ITESM) called TransporTEC, is only for students enrolled in that institution, teachers and active collaborators. This type of transportation is in each campus of the Mexican Republic and its price may vary according to the established prices of each campus; it can only be used with the current school credential. Oceania =Australia= The majority of schools rely on public bus services to transport children to and from school. This Transperth bus is doing a school special run to City Beach on Route 707. Buses, like these transport school children only and as such do not allow the general adult public to ride along with the children. In Australia, school buses vary in colour with yellow buses being rare and are distinguishable from other buses by a yellow school zone sign or a sign that reads \\"School Bus\\" on the top rear end of the bus. As school route buses are almost universally run by direct government contract, the livery of the bus is generally that of the contractor, with the bus commonly also being used for normal scheduled routes as required. In NSW, however, the State Government has begun a program to bring all public transport in the state under one livery including strict livery regulations for new vehicles purchased for government contract use. The style is typically the same as public buses in other countries. Buses used on school routes are required to bear speed limit signs on their rear and to flashing yellow lights on the front and rear, similar to those in the US and other places. When stopping or stopped, the lights flash indicating other drivers must not travel past the bus in either direction faster than 40 km/h (the same speed limit is used in 'school zones' on roads adjacent to schools at times when most students are expected to be arriving or leaving). Drivers must also cede right of way to all buses (school or otherwise) attempting to pull out from a stop. Dedicated bus lanes are common in larger cities, where buses are also allowed to move off first from traffic lights before other traffic is shown a green light. Some areas also have dedicated busways. Increasingly, jurisdictions are requiring new buses purchased for use on school routes to be fitted with seat belts and 'compartmentalisation' features, or even requiring students to use seatbelts at all times. Private and public schools often have 'activity' style buses, sometimes in a colour matching the 'school colours' although more commonly with just the name and logo of the school on the side and/or front of the bus to save the cost of custom painting. They are used by many schools for smaller excursions, i.e. to transport a single sport team or class, in order save on external hire costs and are consequently generally also driven by school staff. In order to allow staff to drive them with a standard car or light truck license these vehicles are generally quite small, 22 seat buses are very common in this role. The vast majority of schools in Australia (both government and private) do not have their own buses for transporting children between the school and their home and thus most school children in Australia that do travel by bus travel on public transport buses, either on standard scheduled public transport routes, or on specific 'school travel' routes. Most school routes do not allow the general adult public to ride along with the children, although this does vary by location according to practicality (i.e. remote areas) and local regulation. Many Australian school children travel 'free' on non-fare paying bus services to their local school or using a bus pass that they get issued at the beginning of the school year that covers transport with the relevant bus (and often other public transport such as train or ferry) network/s for travel to and from school only, for which the contractor in turn receives a government subsidy amount for each trip, although specifics of the schemes vary from state to state, some only providing subsidy to remote or low income families. Many thousands of children in Australia thus have to travel daily to school using a number of different public transport routes with different bus, train, tram and ferry networks. In most places, as of 2013, this is even achieved with a single pass. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, student transport is sometimes provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Education through school bus contractors or general bus companies. Bus companies generally have a fleet of older transit buses or coaches, different from the newer public service fleet vehicles to cater for school services. While carrying students, buses are marked by either \\"SCHOOL\\", \\"SCHOOL BUS\\", \\"KURA\\" (Maori for \\"school\\"), or pictograms of children in black on a fluorescent chartreuse background, and a limited on the open road to . These signs all indicate that a motorist should slow to when passing a stationary bus in either direction.\\"Speed limits\\" on NZTA official New Zealand Road Code website, retrieved 2010-11-14See this article on an instance of Maori bus sign usage in Rotorua:\\"Principal remains adamant over 'kura' bus signs on Rotorua Daily Post website, retrieved 2010-11-14 References ","title":"School bus by country"},{"id":"57943178","text":"Madagascar‚ÄìSouth Africa relations refers to the diplomatic relations between Madagascar and South Africa. Both nations are members of the African Union, Group of 77, Non-Aligned Movement and the Southern African Development Community.

The Malagasy had been sold to the Dutch East India Company on Madagascar to be used as company slaves in its Cape Colony. During the mutiny half the ship's crew and almost 30 Malagasy lost their lives and the two surviving leaders of the mutiny were sent to Robben Island where they remained until their deaths. The incident became known as the Meermin slave mutiny.Bilateral relations between South Africa and Madagascar During the struggle against Apartheid, the Malagasy government hosted and supported South African liberation movements, and the Malagasy government allowed them access to its public broadcasting facilities for their fight against apartheid. Radio Freedom was operated by South African freedom fighters in Madagascar between 1979 and 1993. In June 1991, apartheid legislation was repealed in South Africa and Nelson Mandela was elected President in May 1994. That same year, Madagascar and South Africa officially established diplomatic relations. During the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, Malagasy President Marc Ravalomanana fled to South Africa where he remained in exile for the next 5 years.Madagascar's ex-president returns home from exile in SA In August 2012, South African President Jacob Zuma traveled to the Seychelles to assist in brokering a deal between Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina and Marc Ravalomanana.Zuma arrives for Madagascar crisis talks In January 2014, President Rajoelina stepped down from power.

Lapsley (born February 24, 1965) serves as Dean and Vice President of Academic Affairs and Professor of Old Testament at Princeton Theological Seminary. She earned her M.A. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, her M.Div. from Princeton Seminary, and her Ph.D. from Emory University. In Old Testament studies, Lapsley is known for her writings and teachings in feminist biblical interpretation and the intersection of environmental issues and biblical interpretation, as well as in Ezekiel studies. Her interests are in literary theory, ethics (especially creation ethics), gender theory and theological anthropology as tools for reading the Old Testament theologically. Her past courses cover sin, women in Old Testament narratives, and salvation in the Old Testament, wherein she focuses on the ways in which moral formation and identity are articulated in the scriptures. Her current courses are in gender theory and creation ethics in the Old Testament. Her current research and writing focuses on the relationship between human dignity and creational dignity. With Bruce C. Birch, Cynthia D. Moe-Lobeda, and Larry L Rasmussen, she authored the Bible and Ethics in the Christian Life: A New Conversation (Fortress, 2018); edited the ‚ÄúGender and Method‚Äù issue of Hebrew Bible and Ancient Israel (2016); coedited with Patricia Tull, After Exegesis: Feminist Biblical Theology (Baylor University Press, 2015), coedited with Carol A. Newsom and Sharon H. Ringe, a revision of A Women‚Äôs Bible Commentary, 3rd edition (Westminster John Knox Press, 2012), was associate editor of A Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics (Baker Academic, 2011), authored Whispering the Word: Hearing Women‚Äôs Voices in Old Testament (Westminster John Knox Press, 2005), among other works. She serves on the editorial boards of The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, Hebrew Bible and Ancient Israel, and the new Interpretation Commentary Series (with co-editors Brian Blount, Beverly Gavanta, and Samuel Adams). She was for many years the director of the Center for Theology, Women, and Gender at Princeton Theological Seminary and co-chair of the Ethics and Biblical Interpretation section of the Society of Biblical Literature. Lapsley is also an ordained Presbyterian elder and teaches and preaches in congregations. In addition to writing and teaching, she has been on The Farminary steering committee at Princeton Theological Seminary and was the chair of the Earth Care Team in her local congregations. For Lapsley: \\"The Bible offers important perspectives on human finitude and limits. It also offers perspectives on human vocation--what are we supposed to be doing while on earth? In the Bible, we read about a God who cares not just about us, human beings, but also about how we treat non-human creatures. This biblical vision of the nature and integrity of creation is diametrically opposed to the attitude of the industrialized West toward the environment. How did the Bible's vision become so distorted in the Christian West that we have produced such widespread environmental degradation?\\" She also claims that ‚Äúan appreciation of gender diversity can move our society toward real justice for women and other persons who are marginalized because of gender and/or sexuality.\\" As a scholar Lapsley is committed to the academic study of the Bible for the life of faith and all active participants in living faith communities and feel called to witness to the power of informed scriptural interpretation for the flourishing of self, faith communities, and the world.

Background The review was written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1817 to help promote the novel and to counter expected negative reviews. It remained unpublished, however, until after the third edition of Frankenstein appeared in 1831.\\"On Frankenstein.\\" Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin submitted it to the British literary magazine The Athenaeum for the Saturday, November 10, 1832 issue on page 730.Robinson, Charles E., ed. The Original Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (with Percy Bysshe Shelley). New York: Vintage Books, 2008, pp. 434-36. It was part of the series \\"The Shelley Papers\\" which appeared in The Athenaeum starting in September, 1832. In his biography Life of Shelley, Medwin had written that he sought to have the review published to demonstrate that, contrary to claims, Shelley did not write the novel and did not have any role in its creation: \\"I have heard it asserted that the idea [of Frankenstein] was [Percy Bysshe] Shelley's, and that he assisted much in the development of the plot.\\" Notwithstanding Medwin's own claims, the drafts and proofs of the novel showed that this statement was accurate. Shelley had come up with the idea for the novel, as Mary herself acknowledged in the 1831 Introduction, and he had, at the very least, made substantial contributions to the writing of the novel. Mary had not, however, included the review in her compilations and publications of Shelley's prose works. John Lauritsen in The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein argued that Mary suppressed the review because she feared it would expose Shelley as the true author of the novel. The review was republished in Thomas Medwin's Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley; and Original Poems and Papers by Percy Bysshe Shelley: Now First Collected in 1833.Medwin, Thomas. Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley; and Original Poems and Papers by Percy Bysshe Shelley: Now First Collected. London: Whittaker, Treacher, & Co., 1833, pp. 165-70. The review also appeared in The Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley edited by E. B. Murray in 1993.Murray, E. B., ed. The Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, I, 282-4, together with commentary and collations on pp. 489-92, 553, and 565. The review was republished in The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein by John Lauritsin in 2007 and The Original Frankenstein edited by Charles E. Robinson in 2008. Summary Shelley wrote that the dialogues between the Being and De Lacey were the most powerful and moving in the novel. He wrote that the central moral of the novel is intolerance, describing innocent victims of prejudice in society, \\"who are best qualified to be its benefactors and its ornaments.\\" Shelley argued that the Being was a product of a xenophobic society: \\"Treat a person ill, and he will become wicked.\\" Shelley referred to the monster as the \\"Being\\" five times in his review. He also referred to the anonymous author using a masculine pronoun, \\"he\\". The British Library analysis noted the direct connection to Shelley's poem \\"Mont Blanc\\" which was published in 1817 in History of a Six Weeks' Tour. Frankenstein develops the theme of \\"necessity\\" which Shelley wrote about in that poem. It is a philosophical idea of the novel.Review of Frankenstein from The Athenaeum. The British Library. Retrieved 19 July, 2018. The review related Frankenstein to Percy Bysshe Shelley's own works: > \\"The environment is an aspect Shelley also emphasises in his preface to the > 1818 edition.

For Shelley this is an example of the > philosophical idea he defined as necessity, 'an immense and uninterrupted > chain of causes and effects', which is explored in 'Mont Blanc' and is 'the > direct moral' of Frankenstein.

It is situated between Al Khor City, the municipal seat, and Al Thakhira. The government placed a moratorium on the area in 2005 but lifted it in 2017. History In 2005, the Ministry of Municipality and Urban Planning froze all building permits in the area, opting to create a new industrial area near Umm Birka and Simaisma instead. Over the following years, infrastructure in the Al Khor Industrial Area suffered; the buildings were in disrepair and debris lined the streets. Rent prices were drastically raised in both the Al Khor Industrial Area and its neighboring areas, and some companies based in the area had to suspend their projects. The Al Khor Municipal Council petitioned the ministry to lift the moratorium in order to boost economic growth, and in 2017 the ministry obliged. Infrastructure In December 2014, Ashghal (The Public Works Authority) signed a $16.8 million contract with ALCAT Contracting Qatar to refurbish the industrial area amidst its plan to reopen the area for business. As part of the project, a 9 km-long boundary wall will surround the premises. The project had a planned start date of early 2015 and an estimated completion date of late 2015.

Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and Warner Bros. Television. The series was said to be a \\"reimagining\\" of Stargirl. On July 6, 2020, The CW renewed the series for a second season, resulting in the series moving exclusively to the network as a CW original series. =Writing= Johns described Stargirl as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Back to the Future. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the Justice Society of America (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \\"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\\" The members of the Injustice Society mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as Alan Scott and Jay Garrick, Johns called them the \\"elderly statesmen\\" and that they \\"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\\" with \\"their legacies... felt throughout the show\\". There were also \\"plans in the future for things\\". For the first season, star Brec Bassinger felt the original Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider would have \\"a significant role to play\\", while Johns added the season would establish the Seven Soldiers of Victory as the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff. Regarding the death of Henry King, Jr., Johns revealed that he always \\"had a finite story\\", going \\"from this almost unlikeable bully to possibly a redeemed hero, and then ultimately die protecting his new friends when facing his father, while also learning a lesson that Courtney imparted on him and apologizing to Yolanda.\\" Johns spoke with actor Jake Austin Walker before he signed on to play the character to inform him of his and discuss the character with him. The character's return in the season one finale with his father pretending to be his son was done to subvert the \\"nobody ever dies\\" superhero trope. Yolanda Montez's struggle with killing Brainwave will be \\"a big part of season 2\\". Johns added that compared to Rick Tyler, who is \\"starting to kind of turn a corner\\" after overcoming his anger for his parent's death, Yolanda is \\"turning the other way... She‚Äôs lost in her own world, thinking about what she has done\\" since she was not ready to kill someone, unlike Rick. Additionally, more motivations from the surviving members of the Injustice Society will be explored in the second season. =Casting= In September 2018, it was announced that Brec Bassinger had been cast as Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl. Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actresses for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \\"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\\". In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid- Nite, Yvette Monreal as Yolanda Montez / Wildcat, and Christopher James Baker as Henry King / Brainwave. In January 2019, Luke Wilson was cast as Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E. Amy Smart joined the cast as Barbara Whitmore the next month, along with Neil Jackson as Jordan Mahkent / Icicle, Trae Romano as Mike Dugan, Hunter Sansone as Cameron, and Cameron Gellman as Rick Tyler / Hourman, with Jake Austin Walker cast as Henry King Jr. and Meg DeLacy cast as Cindy Burman, rounding out the cast. In December 2018, the following members of the Justice Society of America were cast: Joel McHale as Sylvester Pemberton / Starman, Lou Ferrigno Jr. as Rex Tyler / Hourman, Brian Stapf as Ted Grant / Wildcat, and Henry Thomas as Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite. As well, Joy Osmanski was cast as Paula Brooks / Tigress, Neil Hopkins was cast as Lawrence \\"Crusher\\" Crock / Sportsmaster, and Nelson Lee was cast as Dr. Ito / Dragon King, members of the Injustice Society. In April, Hina Khan was cast as Anaya Bowin. =Design= Costume designer LJ Shannon \\"tried to stay as true to the [comics] lore as possible\\" in her designs. Each of the costumes are \\"utilitarian\\" with individual looks. Johns described Doctor Mid-Nite's as \\"[a] little steampunky\\" with canvas and leather and Hourman's as \\"a little more slick\\". Legacy Effects created a practical S.T.R.I.P.E. for use during filming. =Filming= Filming had begun by March 14, 2019, with Glen Winter directing the pilot. Christopher Manley and Scott Peck were directors of photography on the series. Filming occurs throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area, including: Marietta, Virginia‚ÄìHighland, Duluth, Lithia Springs, Dallas, Marietta Square, West End, Westlake High School, the Atlanta Center for Medical Research, Campbell Middle School, Paulding County, Smyrna, Arbor Place Mall, Vinings, Mableton, and Douglas County High School. Walter Garcia serves as the series' stunt coordinator and second-unit director. He was hired to help Stargirl's staff \\"have a personality and be alive when she fights with it\\". The series will continue to film in Atlanta for the second season, with filming beginning at the end of October 2020. =Visual effects= Zoic Studios provided visual effects for the series. According to Johns, Stargirl was the first Warner Bros. Television series to use previsualization (a process most commonly used by feature films) for their effects scenes. Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor, Inc. Johns brought his experience working on the films Wonder Woman (2017), Aquaman (2018), and Shazam! (2019) to help the series have visuals not \\"seen in superhero shows before\\". =Music= In June 2019, Pinar Toprak revealed she would be composing for the series. Release Stargirl premiered on DC Universe on May 18, 2020, and consists of 13 episodes. The series was originally intended to premiere on May 11, 2020. The series is released in 4K Ultra HD on DC Universe. In November 2019, it was announced that The CW would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast. Stargirl started airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm. Some episodes have content removed when they air on The CW to allow for the network's commercials, notably approximately eight minutes in each of the first two episodes. DC Universe streams the full episodes, and Johns said starting with the third episode, both releases are \\"almost identical\\". The series release plans shifted and it stayed in post-production longer to accommodate the broadcast on The CW to accomplish the adjustments that had to be made. Scenes removed in the first episode from The CW broadcast included: establishing shots of Barbara Whitmore's new job, and Pat's auto shop; an interaction between Courtney and Cindy Burman in the halls of Blue Valley High School that Alex Zalben of Decider said was \\"clear set-up for later\\" but helped strengthen Courtney's emotional arc; and Mark Ashworth's scenes as \\"a mysterious, extremely creepy bearded janitor\\", which Zalben said was more of \\"a fun Easter egg that will pay dividends down the road\\"; and Courtney finding a newspaper article about Starman and Stripesy. The second season of the series will air exclusively on The CW, and is scheduled to air in 2021. =Marketing= On December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released. In early August 2020, The CW released several posters for its Arrowverse series with the superheroes wearing face masks, including Stargirl, with all posters having the caption \\"Real Heroes Wear Masks\\". This marketing tactic was used to \\"stress the importance of wearing masks while out in public to help stop the spread of\\" COVID-19. Reception =The CW ratings= The following table represents viewership data for each episode's airing on The CW, as DC Universe does not release viewership information. The pilot episode was tied for the second-best series debut on The CW for the 2019‚Äì20 television season with Nancy Drew after Batwoman, and was the best summer series premiere on the network since Whose Line Is It Anyway? season nine in 2013. Through the first seven episodes of the season, Stargirl was averaging a 0.2 rating for adults 18‚Äì49 and close to 1 million initial viewers per episode, which was \\"on par\\" with The CW's Arrowverse series. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 89% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 7.61/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A stellar series perfect for anyone looking for a little hope, Stargirl is delightful fun the whole family can enjoy.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Brian Lowry of CNN described the series as \\"hardly seeks to reinvent the wheel, or even expand the mold. Still, its mix of solid characters, clever writing and youthful exuberance casts a brighter light than most.\\" Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave a review stating \\"Derivative, but should fill the superhero-origin-story-shaped hole in your heart\\" and wrote, \\"The result is that a show that is frequently derivative to the point of distraction might actually fill a need for viewers able to concentrate on its occasional charms until better superhero shows return.\\" Arrowverse Stargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" in January 2020, from footage from \\"The Justice Society\\" episode. Stargirl is set on a new Earth-2, created during the crossover. Stargirl from the pre-Crisis Earth-1 had previously appeared in three episodes of season two of Legends of Tomorrow, portrayed by Sarah Grey, between October 2016 and February 2017. Regarding any proper crossovers with the Arrowverse, Johns and Bassinger were keen on the idea. In April 2020, Johns said, \\"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that Stargirl is the best show it can possibly be.\\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with The Flash, and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with Melissa Benoist on Supergirl.

The coaster was designed by S&S; \\\\- Sansei Technologies, and reaches , with nine inversions. Themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the ride is located on the former site of the Log Jammer, a flume ride which closed in 2017.  History  The roller coaster is named after the defensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team from the 1970s, which was nicknamed the Steel Curtain. Previously known as Project 412, the ride was revealed on July 19, 2018, to be a record-breaking looping roller coaster and opened on July 13, 2019. The roller coaster, designed by S&S; \\\\- Sansei Technologies, features nine inversions, including the highest inversion in the world ‚Äì a corkscrew at , and reaches a maximum height of . In addition, the ride reaches a maximum speed of and lasts two minutes. In the annual Golden Ticket Awards publication from Amusement Today, Steel Curtain placed first in the category \\"Best New Roller Coaster of 2019\\". Steel Curtain is one of several rides that have not operated during the 2020 season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Characteristics  Steel Curtain holds a number of records, including being the tallest roller coaster in Pennsylvania, having the most inversions of any coaster in North America, being the world's tallest inverting roller coaster, and having the world's tallest inversion. The ride is also the first amusement attraction themed after a professional football team, and opened alongside a 3-acre football themed area named Steelers Country which will also feature ‚ÄúTerrible Tower‚Äù, a climbing attraction, as well as ‚ÄúEnd Zone Cafe.‚Äù It is also one of three coasters to feature a banana roll element, the other two being Takabisha at Fuji-Q Highland and TMNT Shellraiser at American Dream Meadowlands' Nickelodeon Universe. =Ride experience= The ride begins with the train climbing a lift hill immediately as it exits the station. After cresting the hill, it dips slightly and veers left into the world's tallest inversion, an inverting dive drop element off the ground. The train drops out of the inversion. It then banks sharply left, reaching a point close to the ground and traveling back toward the station. It veers left again and enters a banana roll, an element named after its characteristic shape, that inverts riders twice and raises the train to its second-highest point off the ground. Riders descend low to the ground once more into a small airtime hill heading back toward the first drop, entering a sea serpent element with two more inversions. This is followed by an airtime hill and the coaster's sixth inversion, a dive loop that turns the train 180 degrees and sends it back toward the station. After a brief straightaway, riders experience a weightlessness maneuver in a zero-g stall inversion, sometimes referred to as a top gun stall. The coaster's finale follows, with the train entering a corkscrew and cutback in short succession, completing the eighth and ninth inversions respectively. The cutback ends with a slight jump up onto the final brake run, where the train will make its way back into the station.

As Director of Engineering at the British Atomic Energy Project, he oversaw the construction of the Springfields Chemical and Fuel Element Plants, the Windscale Piles, Windscale plutonium extraction plant, Capenhurst gaseous diffusion plant and the Calder Hall nuclear power station. Biography Owen was born in 1897 in Walton, Liverpool, England, the only child of Thomas John Owen, a mariner, and his wife, Levina Elizabeth Victoria Isabella Smith. He was educated at Liverpool Collegiate School. The First World War broke out while he was there, and he joined the 6th Liverpool Regiment, and served on the Western Front. After the war he entered the University of Liverpool, where he studied engineering. He was awarded his Bachelor of Engineering degree with honours in 1922, and a Master of Engineering degree in 1924. He married Phyllis Condliff in 1923; they had two children, both sons. Owen took a position with the Brunner Mond Company in Northwich in 1922, and became a project engineer at one of its chemical plants. The plant was involved in the large-scale production of bulk chemicals, and his engineering department was concerned with the design of additions to the plant. In 1926, Brunner Mond merged with other firms to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). He began working with Christopher Hinton in 1929, and the two would be colleagues for the next 30 years, although they never became friends. In the years immediately prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Hinton and Owen were involved in the British shadow factories scheme, under which new factories were established so British industry, particularly the aircraft industry, could rapidly expand on the outbreak of war. After the war began, Hinton and Owen were seconded to the Ministry of Supply, with Owen serving under Hinton as a director of the Royal Filling Factories. In this role he was responsible for their plant and equipment. After the war ended, Owen joined Hinton at ROF Risley, near Warrington, as Director of Engineering in the Atomic Energy Department at the Ministry of Supply, working on the British Atomic Energy Project. In 1947, he became Hinton's deputy as Assistant Controller in Department of Atomic Energy Production. As such, he oversaw the construction of its facilities, including the Springfields Chemical and Fuel Element Plants, the Windscale Piles, Windscale plutonium extraction plant, Capenhurst gaseous diffusion plant and the Calder Hall nuclear power station, the world's first nuclear power station to produce electricity on a commercial scale. For his services, Owen was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1950. With the establishment of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in 1954, Owen became the Director of Engineering and Deputy Managing Director of its Industrial Group. When Hinton moved on to become the chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1957, Owen became the Managing Director. He became the UKAEA Member for Production in 1959, and Member for Production and for Engineering in 1961. He served in this role until he retired from executive duties in 1962, but remained as a part-time member of the UKAEA until 1964. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1957, and awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Manchester in 1960. After leaving the UKAEA, Owen became a Director of United Gas Industries, and was Chairman of three of its subsidiaries. He was also a Director of Cammell Laird, a shipbuilding company that built nuclear-powered submarines, including the Polaris ballistic missile submarines and , and , which sank the cruiser in the Falklands War. He was on the Council of the University of Liverpool, and was chairman of the committee responsible building the new Mechanical Engineering Building and the Oliver Lodge Laboratory. He was chairman of the British Nuclear Energy Society and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, serving on its Publications Committee and its General Purposes Committee. Owen died at his home, in Beaumaris, Anglesey, in north Wales on 25 March 1971. His papers are in the University of Liverpool.

It is also known as Bombo Quarry. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1979 a nomination was received from the Geological Society of Australia (NSW Division) for the Bombo Quarry. The importance of the geological features was brought to the Heritage Council's attention by Dr Suzanne Wass of Macquarie University's School of Earth Sciences. The quarry was owned by the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board and it was proposed that a pollution control plant be constructed on the floor of the disused quarry. It also made an appearance in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie as part of the planet Phaedos. Following site inspections and lengthy consultations between the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board, NSW Heritage Council, NSW Planning Commission and other key agencies a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the site in 1983. It was transferred onto the State Heritage Register in 1999.  Description  Two units of the Late Permian Gerringong volcanic facies are exposed on Bombo Headland. The Kiama Sandstone member forms a narrow wave-cut platform and adjacent vertical cliff face around the south-eastern extremity of the quarry. To the north the sandstone dips below sea level and is overlain by about 20m of porphyritic basalt, termed Bombo Latite member. The contact between the two units is well- exposed in the cliff section at the eastern end of the section of the two points comprising the headland. The red-brown colour (due to oxidisation of haematite) of the sandstone contrasts markedly with the grey-black latite, which displays spectacular columnar jointing elsewhere in the quarry. Isolated columns 5‚Äì5 meters in height stand adjacent to the coast between the north and south parts of the quarry; just to the north the sea wall exposes cross sections of the columns 1-2.5 metres in diameter, resulting in a \\"Giants Causeway\\" appearance. Petrographic descriptions of the latite emphasise its conspicuous porphyritic texture; large labradorite to andesine phenocrysts with minor clinopyroxene are set in a groundmass of feldspar microlites with interstital chlorite and iron oxide. The latite is commonly vesicular. Agglomerates or volcanic beccias are developed in some areas of the quarry. E.g. in the south-western portion near the access road. This lithology is readily distinguished from the latite by its chaotic appearance and light- coloured matrix. A capping of cream-coloured weathered latite, still retaining the characteristic porphyritic texture, may be studied at the top of the northern and western quarry faces. This sharpley-defined zone of surface weathering and soil formation overlies relatively fresh rock exhibiting columnar jointing. The Bombo Latite Member was subsequently intruded by at least 5 basaltic (monchiquite) dykes of probable tertiary age which flowed around and between the columns of latite often taking 90 degree changes in direction. Early workersJaquet 1905 & Harper 1915 mapped and described these dykes but subsequent development of the quarry provided further exposures and obliterated others. Today dykes are mainly in the northern half of the quarry but at least one extends across the floor of the excavation in the vicinity of the isolated columnar stacks. They are of interest due to their inclusions of xenoliths and xenocrysts, which are believed to represent fragments of the earth's mantle incorporated in magmas originating from within that zone. Sussmilch (1905) described xenoliths of hypersthene gabbro, augite peridotite, enstatite peridotite and pyroxenite occurring as rounded fragments and boulders embedded in the monchiquite. From a deeper level of what was probably the same dyke, Wilshire & Binns (1961) recorded hornblendite and glimmerite as the dominant xenoliths. Present exposures of most of the other dykes appear to lack macroscopically visible xenoliths.  Heritage listing  Bombo Headland Quarry Geological site is of research/technical significance in the numerous dykes which cut the Permian Bombo Latite. One of the dykes is geologically unique and contains an abundant xenoliths which represent material brought up to the earth's mantle, about 80 kilometres below the surface of Eastern Australia. The mineral assemblages including apatite, amphibole, pyroxene, spinel and ilmenite, and the range of compositions are unique and are not represented anywhere else in the world. The Bombo Latite Member is also of international scientific significance in providing one of a number of samples upon which the concept and limits of Kiaman Magnetic Interval were defined. Like rocks of Permian age throughout the world, the latite shows a reversed polarity (at the time of its extrusion the North and South magnetic poles were reversed). This interval, named after Kiama, has been used for intercontinental palaeomagnetic correlation of Late Palaeozoic rock sequences. The area is of high educational value. In addition the area is scenically attractive and has considerable potential for recreational and tourist use. Bombo Headland Quarry Geological Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was built in 1858 by James Marks. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Culwalla was constructed in 1858 by James Marks, whose brother built nearby Terragong House at the same time. James and his brother were sons of an early settler of the district, James Marks, who built Kiama's second inn, the Steam Packet in 1842. Both were sons of James Marks who had a licence for Kiama's second inn, the Steam Packet in 1842. Both married daughters of William Moffitt, a Pitt Street bookseller and stationer.Terragong House - history - NTA, 1976 Terragong House stands on land granted to Malcolm Campbell, an overseer of convicts at Coolangatta (Illawarra) in 1830. He built a brick cottage and place a Mr. Black in charge and went to live in Sydney where he died in 1837. There were two claimants for his estate, James Marks and Ewen Campbell, and finally the 500 acres were divided between the two men. In 1985 the owners who were in the process of subdividing and selling Culwalla nominated it for a Permanent Conservation Order to facilitate restoration and maintenance of the house, which was completed during the late 1980s. On 2 April 1999 Culwalla was transferred to the State Heritage Register.  Description  Culwalla occupies a magnificent site above Jamberoo Valley and is a prominent landmark in the district. To the north of the building there are the remains of an extensive garden now confined to some mature trees and shrubs. To the south, west and east there are grassed areas with a detached timber garage and laundry at some distance to the south, a thicket of shrubs forming a screen to the east and the remains of rainwater tanks and their supports close to the ground at the corners of the main building. ;Homestead A fine late Georgian house which is one of the earliest remaining buildings in the Kiama district. It is relatively intact. The building is of vernacular colonial Georgian design, the detailing suggesting the middle Victorian period. Walls are of local freestock basalt rubble construction, stuccoed externally and marked out to represent ashlar work and plastered and set internally. Most joinery is of a fine quality and of polished native cedar while the hipped roof retains its original split shingling under later corrugated iron sheeting. A detailed schedule of finishes is included in the appendices. There are some minor brick additions to the old kitchen wing while all chimneys are of sandstock brickwork. The single storey house is symmetrical with front and rear timber verandahs and an attached kitchen wing at one side. The brocken hipped roof retains its timber shingles under corrugated iron while flooring is of wide pine boards, the ceiling painted boarding with plaster cornice. Internally the house is in excellent condition while externally it is generally good apart from some verandah flooring and a corner damaged by earth temors. Bought late in the 19th century by the Spinks family, its name was given to Culwalla Chambers, Sydney's first \\"skyscraper\\" built in 1912. A symmetrical layout of the main wing provides for three rooms either side of a central corridor, a front timber verandah to three sides and a rear concrete floored verandah terminated at teach end by box rooms, one being larger than the other. To the rear on the West side is the attached Kitchen wing having its own hipped roof and verandah now enclosed into a room and corridor, presumably being a later Pantry annex. The building is of one storey only. The timber verandah has tapered posts, simple classical inspired capitals and scalloped timber valances. The front verandah is reached by a flight of rendered masonry steps having the remains of cast iron bootscrapers on either side. The front and return facades appear to retain their original colour schemes of ochre coloured walls and Venetian red joinery. The main front rooms have french windows at the sides surmounted by cedar ogee pattern panels above. All reveals of doorways are panelled to correspond with the panelling of the doors. The front door, D1, is 5 panelled, the upper panels now glazed. It appears to be an Edwardian period replacement. Internal doors are 4 panelled with panels at matching levels in the reveals. The doors to the rear verandah are 6 panelled flush beaded type. Windows are generally 12 pane double hung type but panelled inside to the floor. There are french doors to the side verandahs which have wide architraves reaching to the picture rail line the space below to the head being infilled by a cedar board of ogee pattern. All windows have cedar splayed reveals and most are of the colonial twelve paned pattern. Windows to the two front rooms have cedar panels extending twelve paned pattern. Windows to the two front rooms have cedar panels extending from the sill to the floor. All chimney pieces are cedar fluted with roundels except one which is white marble. Three chimney pieces have roundels at the corners and fluting with wide simple mantle shelf. The largest front room has a white marble chimney piece with classical console brackets. All fireplaces have elegant cast iron inserts and grates. All cedar to the main rooms is polished including skirtings and architraves. = Modifications and dates = These appear confined to the receiling of the rear rooms, verandahs and part enclosure of verandahs. The south east box room has been converted into a bathroom dating from about . There is evidence to suggest that the box rooms, kitchen wing and verandah at the rear have been partly or completely rebuilt at a time about or later.  Heritage listing  Culwalla is of State significance as a substantial and largely intact Georgian farmhouse which is one of the earliest remaining dwellings in the Kiama area. It is associated with its first owner and early settler James marks and his family and the Spinks family for most of the 20th century period. It is a notable example of traditional vernacular construction techniques displaying fine craftsmanship and the use of local materials such as freestone, native red cedar and hardwood. It occupies a magnificent site above the Jamberoo Valley and is a prominent landmark in the district. Culwalla Homestead was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The first works in the series were exhibited at the 1855 Exposition Universelle. The series tells of a soul's life on earth, incarnated in a young man, accompanied by his female double. His companion then disappears and he spends the rest of his life alone, as did the artist. The series is now in the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.
