The company was named Corning Glass Works until 1989. Corning divested its consumer product lines (including CorningWare and Visions Pyroceram-based cookware, Corelle Vitrelle tableware, and Pyrex glass bakeware) in 1998 by selling the Corning Consumer Products Company subsidiary (now known as Corelle Brands) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8 percent. , Corning had five major business sectors: display technologies, environmental technologies, life sciences, optical communications, and specialty materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996. Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone; Corning develops and manufactures Gorilla Glass, which is used by many smartphone makers. It is one of the world's biggest glassmakers. Corning won the National Medal of Technology and Innovation four times for its product and process innovations. History One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow \\"Noviol\\" glass version shown. Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr. Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown. The California Institute of Technology's telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934‚Äì1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass. In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass. In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938. 1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above. The company had a history of science- based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and \\"disruptive\\" and \\"on demand\\" product innovation. In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed. This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a \\"fusion process\\" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility. Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier. After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC). As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products. Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's \\"biggest and most expensive failures.\\" However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business. In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber. In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business. Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance. Current technologies The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a robust display screen for its upcoming iPhone. Later, other companies also adopted its Gorilla glass screen. In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan. The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays. The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad. In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations. Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali- aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many touchscreens. According to the book Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007. On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays. Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.. findarticles.com. Corning Incorporated manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types. Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products. In September 2019, Apple announced that it would invest $250 million to Corning, in an effort to develop and manufacture the glass needed for many of its products, including the iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad. Though not confirmed by either company, the investment could be used to develop new products in the future. Apple has already invested $200 million to Corning back in 2017. Other activities Corning employs roughly 51,500 people worldwide and had sales of $11.29 billion in 2018.https://s22.q4cdn.com/662497847/files/doc_financials/annual/2018/AR_LowRes.pdf The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015. Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and was chairman, chief executive officer, and president. Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892. It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years. In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning's telecommunications business unit.Corning to Acquire MobileAccess , Evelyn M.

His invention is also the reason that the London Underground is colloquially named the \\"Tube\\".  Early life  Greathead was born in Grahamstown, South Africa; of English descent whose grandfather had emigrated to South Africa in 1820. He was educated at St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, and the Diocesan College private school in Cape Town. After emigrating to England in 1859, he completed his education from 1859 to 1863 at the Westbourne Collegiate School, Westbourne Grovehttps://literator.org.za/index.php/literator/article/view/1324/2405 . He returned briefly to South Africa before finally moving to London in 1864 to serve a three-year pupillage under the civil engineer Peter W. Barlow, from whom he became acquainted with the rectangular shield system of tunnelling. Greathead spent some time (around 1867) as assistant engineer on the Midland Railway between Bedford and London (working with Barlow's brother, William Henry Barlow).  Tunnelling  Soon after, in 1869, he rejoined Barlow and they began work on designs for the Tower Subway, only the second tunnel to be driven under the river Thames in central London. Barlow was the engineer for the tunnel and Greathead was in charge of the actual drive. Greathead became the main contractor for the Tower subway under Barlow. William Copperthwaite asserts that whilst Barlow had patented a tunnelling shield idea, Greathead not only designed a different type of shield but patented it and used it on that contract. Barlow had been awarded a provisional patent on his second idea but Greathead was unaware of this until several years later (as discussed in minutes of a meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) published in January 1896). Greathead was the Blackwall Tunnel consulting engineer and oversaw its design and construction as notedhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwall_Tunnel.  Railways  In 1873 Greathead became resident engineer on the Hammersmith extension railway and the Richmond extension of the District Railway, a post which he held for four years. After this he assisted in the preparation of the Regents Canal Railway (1880), the Metropolitan Outer Circle Railway (1881), a new London-Eastbourne line (1883) and in various light railways in Ireland (1884). Also in 1884, Greathead resumed his involvement in tunnelling, being engaged as engineer on the London (City) & Southwark Subway, later the City & South London Railway (and now part of the Northern line) which was, when it opened in 1890, the world's first underground electric railway. In 1888, he became joint engineer with Sir Douglas Fox on the Liverpool Overhead Railway and also worked with W.R. Galbraith on the Waterloo & City Railway. His final work was on the Central London Railway with Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.  Inventions and patents  =Greathead Shield= This possibly derived from Marc Isambard Brunel's original patented 1818 ideaUK Patent No 4204, 1818 and erroneously was accorded by Robert Vogel to have been inspired by Barlow's 1864 patent that led to Barlow's 1868 provisional patent. However, there were considerable design differences that make Greathead's patented designs distinguishable from Brunel's provisional patent idea, allowing a patent application for Greathead's design. Brunel's shield was rectangular and comprised 12 separate, independently moveable frames; the Greathead solution was cylindrical, and the \\"reduction of the multiplicity of parts in the Brunel shield to a single rigid unit was of immense advantage and an advance perhaps equal to the shield concept of tunneling itself\\", though the face was still dug out by manual labour to begin with. Greathead's patented Shield for Tunnelling Soft Earth used water jets under pressure at the tunnel face to assist in cutting through soft earth as described in the patent. Pneumatic tunnel pressurisation was used to ensure better safety for workers by equalising internal tunnel pressure to its estimated exterior underground pressure beneath water. The 'second edition' of his shield used hydraulic action at the face along with cutting teeth to create slurry (this slurry then hardened upon drying and led to his next invention: the Greathead Grouting Machine). Brunel may be credited for the idea of using a shield, but Greathead was recognised first as the African engineer who built one of his own design and granted a patent of the one-piece cylindrical shield. Greathead designed the prototype circular shield that has since been used in most tunnelling projects, with other engineers' advancement and technological improvement in the general shield design. In his book, Tunnel Shields and the Use of Compressed Air in Subaqueous Works, Copperthwaite (who worked under Greathead as his pupil) says: > Barlow was certainly the first to patent, in 1864, a shield capable of > motion in one piece, and surrounded by a thin cylinder of iron... to build, > in successive rings, a cast iron tunnel... this was in 1864 and in 1868 he > provisionally patented a shield... neither of these designs took practical > form and, in 1869 Greathead in England and Beach in New York actually built > and used shields having many features in common with Barlow's patents but > differing from each other in details. Copperthwaite also argues (p.20) that all three men, Barlow, Greathead and Beach, designed their tunnelling shields independently of each other. There is evidence that Greathead was unaware until 1895 of Barlow's 1868 provisional patent, which his shield resembled the most; Beach's shield more closely resembled Barlow's 1864 patent. Copperthwaite adds: \\"the exact apportionment of the credit of the invention between these two will be decided by each reader according as he may consider the inventor, the inventor of a new mechanism, or the man who applies it practical use, the more deserving of credit.\\" Whilst Barlow patented his idea in 1864, in 1869 both Greathead in England and Beach in New York practically simultaneously constructed their own shields that were similar but independent of each other. Greathead's achievements went further than any other engineers' tunnelling with the additional patents of 1738 (1874), 5665 (1884) and, in 1886 his patent no. 5221: grouting by means of compressed air. Copperthwaite clarifies the origins of the shift in thinking from a rectangular tunnel shield to cylindrical cutting shields as first built by Greathead. Minutes in the ICE library suggest Barlow quietly patented his ideas for a cylindrical cutting shield but never built one. Greathead, unaware of Barlow's initial patent and succeeding provisional patent, went on to design, patent and build the credited first cylindrical tunnelling shield in history. Simultaneously, Alfred Ely Beach built a cylindrical tunnelling shield in New York and designed a shield that very closely resembled Barlow's patented idea around the same time as Greathead. According to a 2017 video lecture given by Professor Lord Mair for the ICE, the Brunels' shield ideas were well known in both USA and UK. Since Barlow was a Brunel pupil, he was likely well acquainted with the rectangular tunnelling shield design. It must have been obvious that a cylindrical design was far more suitable and stable which lead to three famous men independently designing their own unique tunneling shields within a few years of each other. Since Portland cement had only been invented in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin of Leeds, it was not fully appreciated by the construction industry for many years. It was only because of Portland cement's hydraulic properties and ability to set in wet environments that these first tunnel ventures under the Thames came to fruition at all. Beach never came to England to learn of Barlow's patent and later provisional patent, and Greathead did not know about Barlow's provisional patent idea until 1895 when it was discussed in the Institution of Civil Engineers meeting attended by Greathead shortly after Barlow's death and shortly before his own death. The documents may be obtained by request from their library in pdf format for further clarification.https://www.ice.org.uk/knowledge-and-resources/ice-library The Greathead shield consisted of an iron cylinder in diameter fitted with screw jacks which enabled it to be jacked forward. In use, the shield was inched forward as the working face was excavated, while behind it a permanent tunnel lining of cast iron segments was fitted into place, itself an important innovation. Greathead patented many of his ideas including the use of compressed air and forward propulsion by hydraulic jacks, both of which are now standard features of tunnel construction. Another patent by Greathead was the addition of the grouting pan at ceiling height that allowed cement grout to be applied hydraulically behind the vast cast iron shields to stabilise the tunnel wall outside the shield sections. A third tunnelling shield was patented by Greathead that introduced hydraulic pressure nozzles at the tunnel face to blast away soft earth. The nozzle itself was also another Greathead patent invention. At some point Greathead discovered that concrete could be sprayed onto earthen surfaces to stabilise them and became the father of shot concrete and spray cement used so extensively in construction. =Greathead Injector Hydrant (c. 1879)= The hydrant was an invention to inject grouting behind cast iron tunnelling shield cavities to strengthen tunnel wall linings during construction with a permanent position. =Greathead Grouting Machine= This is mentioned in relation to the repair of Winchester and Lincoln Cathedrals. \\"His system of grouting by means of compressed air, which perhaps more than any other invention has proved indispensable in all recent tunnel work.\\" = Patents = *1738 of 1874 J.

The term can also mean the nesting boxes of pigeons. The term comes from the Latin \\"columba\\" (dove) and, originally, solely referred to compartmentalized housing for doves and pigeons called a dovecote. Background Roman columbaria were often built partly or completely underground. The Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas is an ancient Roman example, rich in frescoes, decorations and precious mosaics.Ancient Roman underground columbariums included: Columbarium of Statilii, Columbarium of Volusii, Columbarium of Livia, Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas, Columbarium of Lucius Arruntius, Columbarium of Iunius Silanus, Columbarium of Nero Claudius Druscus, Columbarium of Marcella, Columbarium of Carvilii, Columbarium of C.

Rome: Gangemi, 2000. Today's columbaria can be either free standing units, or part of a mausoleum or another building. Some manufacturers produce columbaria that are built entirely off-site and brought to the cemetery by a large truck. Many modern crematoria have columbaria. Examples of these are the columbaria in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and Golders Green Crematorium in London. In other cases, columbaria are built into church structures. One example is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (Los Angeles, California), which houses a number of columbarium niches in the mausoleum built into the lower levels of the Cathedral. The construction of columbaria within churches is particularly widespread in the Czechoslovak Hussite Church. An example can be seen at the Church of St Nicolas in Old Town Square (Prague). In the Roman Catholic Church, although traditional burial is still preferred, cremation is permitted provided that the cremated remains are buried or entombed. As a result, columbaria can be found within some Catholic cemeteries. Columbaria are often closely similar in form to traditional Buddhist temples, which from ancient times have housed cremated ashes. In Buddhism, ashes of the deceased may be placed in a columbarium (in Chinese, a naguta (\\"bone-receiving pagoda\\"); in Japanese, a nokotsudo (\\"bone-receiving hall\\"), which can be either attached to or a part of a Buddhist temple or cemetery. This practice allows for the family of the deceased to visit the temple for the conduct of traditional memorials and ancestor rites.

One such cave had been covered by an earthquake close to the time of its original usage and had no signs of secondary usage; neither ashes nor pigeon droppings were found in it.

In 2016, it had a population of 1,938. In the heart of the country of Libournais (the area around Libourne), in a region of wine hills, Saint-Emilion is a medieval city located at the crossroads of Bordeaux, Saintonge and P√©rigord. History Saint-√âmilion's history goes back to prehistoric times. The town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with fascinating Romanesque churches and ruins stretching all along steep and narrow streets. The Romans planted vineyards in what was to become Saint-√âmilion as early as the 2nd century. In the 4th century, the Latin poet Ausonius lauded the fruit of the bountiful vine. Saint-√âmilion, previously called Ascumbas, was renamed after the monk √âmilion (d.767), a travelling confessor, who settled in a hermitage carved into the rock there in the 8th century. The monks who followed him started up the commercial wine production in the area. Geography Saint-√âmilion is located northeast of Bordeaux, between Libourne and Castillon-la-Bataille. Population Sights * Romanesque church * Monolithic church, carved from a limestone cliff Wine Saint-√âmilion is one of the principal red wine areas of Bordeaux along with the M√©doc, Graves and Pomerol. The region is much smaller than the M√©doc and adjoins Pomerol. As in Pomerol and the other appellations on the right bank of the Gironde, the primary grape varieties used are the Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with relatively small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon also being used by some ch√¢teaux.

In 1869 a circular tunnel was dug through the London clay using a cast iron shield, an idea that had been patented in 1864 by Peter W. Barlow but never built. A narrow gauge railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a cable-hauled wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one end to the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year. The tunnel was converted to pedestrian use and one million people a year crossed under the river, paying a toll of a ha'penny. The opening of the toll-free Tower Bridge nearby in 1894 caused a drop in income and the tunnel closed in 1898, after being sold to the London Hydraulic Power Company. Today the tunnel is used for water mains. The same shield method of construction was used in 1890 to dig the tunnels of the City and South London Railway, the first of London's electrified \\"Tube\\" railways and the first underground electrified railway in the world.  History  = Construction = In 1864 Peter Barlow patented a method of tunnelling using a circular cast iron shield and to fill the gap between the tunnel lining and wall with lime or cement to prevent settling of the surrounding ground. Unfortunately, Barlow failed to explain how he intended to fill such gaps between shield and tunnel wall with grout. He published a pamphlet in 1867 suggesting a network of tunnels with cars carrying up to twelve people. In 1868 authority was obtained for a tunnel under the Thames between Great Tower Hill and Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane), but there was a delay finding a contractor due to recent experiences with the Thames Tunnel until his former pupil James Henry Greathead tendered for ¬£9,400. Whilst Barlow patented his idea in 1864 for a tunnelling shield, he never constructed it: Greathead was accredited with the first shield construction for what is now known as the Tower Gateway complex in 1869. According to William Copperthwaite, who once worked under Greathead, both Greathead in England and Alfred Ely Beach in New York invented and constructed their own versions of tunnelling shields simultaneously and independently of each other. Work began in February 1869 with the boring of entrance shafts, deep on the north bank and deep on the south bank. The tunnelling itself started in April using the circular Greathead shield. Whilst many argue that the shield used was a \\"Barlow‚ÄìGreathead\\" shield, William Copperthwaite says \\"... in 1868 [Barlow] provisionally patented a shield having near the cutting edge a transverse partition or diaphragm. Neither of these designs took practical form, and in 1869 Greathead in England and Beach in New York actually built and used shields having many features in common with Barlow's patents but differing from each other in details... Beach's shield resembled Barlow's patent of 1864, and Greathead's the provisional patent of 1868.\\" Copperthwaite puts to bed all arguments over origins of tunnelling shields as being the patented but unimplemented idea of Barlow's in 1864 but the actual construction of a different patented device by Greathead was built and first used on the Tower Subway and simultaneously in New York, Beach created and made his own shield independently of Barlow's and Greathead's designs. Barlow lost out on credit because he never actually constructed one, only patenting the idea. Copperthwaite also reveals that Greathead was unaware of the 1868 provisional patent of Barlow's until 1895, a fact discussed in an 1895 Institution of Civil Engineers paper on the City and South London Railway acknowledged by Barlow. A tunnel long was dug with a diameter of , a maximum of below the high-water level. This was bored through a stable layer of the London clay that lay below the river bed, below the soft alluvial deposits that had plagued the construction by Brunel of the earlier Thames Tunnel. This, combined with the simpler nature of the project ‚Äì the excavation face was only one twentieth that of the Thames Tunnel ‚Äì enabled faster progress. Screw jacks drove the shield forward at a rate of each week. The under-river section was dug in fourteen weeks and the tunnel completed in December. = Cable railway = Interior of the Tower Subway cable car, 1870 The entrance shafts were fitted with steam-powered lifts for passengers. The tunnel was laid with gauge railway track and a single car, carrying a maximum of 12 passengers, cable-hauled by two stationary steam engines, one on each side of the river. The underground railway opened on 2 August 1870 charging 2d for first class and 1d for second class, first class ticket holders merely having priority when boarding. However, the system was unreliable and uneconomic, and closed that December after the company went bankrupt. The City and South London Railway (C&SL;) was originally designed for cable haulage, like the Tower Subway, but the unexpected dissolution of the cable contractor (the Patent Cable Tramway Corporation) precipitated a change to electricity. Its generating power station was built at Stockwell, and the system employed third-rail electrification. So that the C&SL; became, in addition, the first major railway in the world to use electric traction. = Foot tunnel = The railcar and steam engines were removed, gaslights installed and the passenger lifts replaced with spiral staircases. The tunnel opened to pedestrians at a toll of d and became a popular way to cross the river, averaging 20,000 people a week (one million a year). Its main users were described as \\"the working classes who were formerly entirely dependent on the ferries\\". In September 1888 the subway briefly achieved notoriety after a man with a knife was seen in the tunnel at the time when Jack the Ripper was committing murders in nearby Whitechapel.Patricia Cornwell, Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper ‚Äì Case Closed, p. 198. Berkeley Books, 2003. In his Dictionary of London, Charles Dickens Jr commented on the smallness of the tunnel: \\"there is not much head-room left, and it is not advisable for any but the very briefest of Her Majesty's lieges to attempt the passage in high-heeled boots, or with a hat to which he attaches any particular value.\\" The Tower Subway in 1870 The Italian writer Edmondo De Amicis (1846‚Äì1908) gave a description of a passage through the subway in his Jottings about London: Tower Subway northern entrance kiosk at Tower Hill. (January 2006). The lettering on the visible side reads \\"\\". In 1894 the toll-free Tower Bridge opened a few hundred yards downriver, causing a drop in the subway's income. In 1897, Parliament passed an act authorising the sale of the tunnel to the London Hydraulic Power Company (LHPC) for ¬£3,000 (worth over ¬£ in ), and the subway closed to pedestrian traffic in 1898. = Utility tunnel = After its closure, the tunnel gained a new purpose as a route for hydraulic power mains operated by the LHPC and for water mains. It was damaged during the Second World War when a German bomb fell in the river near Tower Pier in December 1940, and exploded on the river bed very close to the tunnel's roof. The shock of the blast compressed the tunnel radially, reducing its diameter to at the point of impact, but the tunnel's lining was not penetrated. During the course of repair work, it was found that ‚Äì apart from the bomb damage ‚Äì the tunnel had survived seventy years of use in excellent condition.  The subway today  While it is no longer used for hydraulic tubes, the tunnel still carries water mains. The hydraulic tubes, once a major source of power in the centre of London, have since been replaced by telecommunication cables. A small round entrance building survives at Tower Hill near the Tower of London's ticket office, a short distance to the west of the main entrance to the Tower. This is not the original entrance, but was built in 1926 by the London Hydraulic Power Company, with a ring of lettering giving the original date of construction and naming the LHPC. The entrance on the south bank of the Thames was demolished in the 1990s, and a new one has been built in its place. It is located just behind the Unicorn Theatre on Tooley Street, but there is no plaque to mark the site.

Originally a vineyard, the estate was owned by the Arnaud family since the end of the 18th century, and the name first appears in records from 1837. In the 1868 edition of Cocks & F√©ret, under listing Crus bourgeois et 1ers artisans P√©trus was ranked behind Vieux Ch√¢teau Certan and alongside Ch√¢teau Trotanoy. Some vintages of this period were labelled Petrus-Arnaud. At the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878, P√©trus won a gold medal, at a time when such an event had very significant results, establishing a selling price at the level of a M√©doc second growth, the first wine of Pomerol to do so. In 1917, the Arnaud family had to sell and La Soci√©t√© Civile du Ch√¢teau P√©trus, a share-holding company was set up. Around 1925, the owner of the H√¥tel Loubat in Libourne, the widow Mme. Edmond Loubat, began to buy shares in the estate and continued the acquisition progressively until 1945, when she became the sole owner of the domaine.Pitcher, Steve (April/May 1998). \\"Ch√¢teau Petrus-A Legendary Vertical Tasting\\" . The Wine News. According to David Peppercorn, \\"the great age of P√©trus\\" began with the end of World War II and the successful 1945 vintage. Jean-Pierre Moueix of the Libourne n√©gociant house √âtablissements Jean-Pierre Moueix acquired exclusive selling rights of P√©trus in that year and the international reputation of P√©trus began to grow. Mme. Loubat, who also owned Ch√¢teau Latour √† Pomerol, remained an active vigneronne throughout her life, known for her meticulous dedication to detail and quality, and strong determination that her wine deserved to be priced equal to the great crus. In the following years the efficient partnership with Moueix became prosperous.Lyons, William (April 29, 2003). \\"Obituary: Jean-Pierre Moueix\\". The Scotsman. P√©trus was introduced to the United States, In 1947 Mme. Loubat presented two magnums of 1938 P√©trus to the Lord Mayor of London, who had come to Pomerol for a visit, for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth. After the 1956 winter frost that devastated the grapevines of the Bordeaux region and killed two-thirds of the P√©trus vineyard, Mme. Loubat decided not to replant but to coppice (cut back severely) the vines on surviving rootstocks; this process of rec√©page had been previously untried in the region; her success ensured that the vines' average age remained high and established a tradition that has since been followed. P√©trus' fame in the U.S. grew in the 1960s, with the promotion by Henri Soul√©, owner of the restaurant Le Pavillon in New York. According to Alexis Lichine, \\"[P√©trus] was served at Le Pavillon in the days when Onassis sat at a corner table. After that, P√©trus became a status symbol, the sort of name dropped by people who wish to imply not only that they know wine but that they are in wine\\".Henry, Gordon M.; Sachs, Andrea; Zagorin, Adam (March 10, 1986). \\"Divine Wine\\".

Located on top of a island mound, the P√©trus boutonni√®re or buttonhole, P√©trus' original vineyard possesses topsoil and subsoil high in iron-rich clay that differs from neighbouring vineyards, where the soil is a mixture of gravel-sand or clay-sand. The estate was among the first in Bordeaux to implement green-harvesting or √©claircissage as a way to lower crop yields and raise the quality of the remaining grapes.  Grape Varieties  The grape variety distribution is 100% Merlot since the end of 2010. The average age of the vines exceeds 45 years. This grape variety is made up of black, medium and round berries. The administration of the estate takes particular care to maximize the quality of the harvest.  Production  Petrus produces an average of 30,000 bottles per year. The grapes are hand harvested over two to three days. The wine is aged between 12 and 16 months in oak barrels, half of which are new, before bottling. A stringent pre- assemblage vat selection is carried out and certain parcels are rejected from the Grand Vin.  Description  The wine is characterized by great elegance, a complex and powerful nose and a particularly opulent fruit. The guide to Bettana and Desseauve wines (2016) describes Petrus as follows: \\"With its refined and deep tension and the right density, its taffeta texture and floral returns, Petrus is a wine that shines and gradually imposes itself on you.  Vintages  The best vintages are generally recognized as 1929, 1945, 1947, 1961, 1964, 1982, 1989, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2010. In 1956, 1965 and 1991, the harvests did not produce a wine of sufficient quality and these vintages do not exist. The years 1963, 1968, 1977 or 1984 exist in very small quantities for the same reason. The vintages 1921, 1929, 1947, 1961, 1989, 1990, 2000, 2009 and 2010 all received a score of 100/100 from critic Robert Parker.  Economy  The price of a bottle varies from 1,000 euros for a \\"small\\" vintage to more than 2,500 euros for a great vintage, or even 6,000 euros for an exceptional vintage such as 1947 or 1961. According to the Wine- searcher site, Petrus is the sixth most expensive wine in the world, after five Burgundy wines, and an average price of US$625,000 (about ‚Ç¨600,000) for all vintages and countries combined.

In English, it is sometimes referred to colloquially as Gew√ºrz (; although this is never the case in German, because \\"Gew√ºrz\\" means \\"herb\\" or \\"spice\\"), and in French it is written ' (without the umlaut). Gew√ºrztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour, which makes it a \\"white wine grape\\" as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly referred to as \\"red wine grapes\\". The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and usually off- dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gew√ºrztraminer and lychees share the same aroma compounds. Dry Gew√ºrztraminers may also have aromas of roses, passion fruit and floral notes. It is not uncommon to notice some spritz (fine bubbles on the inside of the glass). Gew√ºrztraminer's sweetness may offset the spice in Southeast Asian cuisine. Etymology The German name Gew√ºrztraminer literally means \\"Spice Traminer\\" or \\"Perfumed Traminer\\", and originally comes from the Alsace region in France. This grape variety is a mutation of the Savagnin blanc, also named Traminer in South Tyrol (northern Italy). History Gew√ºrztraminer vine at budbreak The history of the Traminer family is complicated, and not helped by its rather unstable genome. The story starts with the ancient Traminer variety, a green-skinned grape that takes its name from the village of Tramin, located in South Tyrol, the German- speaking province in northern Italy. The famous ampelographer Pierre Galet thought that Traminer was identical to the green-skinned Savagnin blanc (not Sauvignon blanc) that makes vin jaune in the Jura. More recently it has been suggested that Savagnin blanc acquired slight differences in its leaf shape and geraniol content as it travelled to the other end of the Alps. Frankisch in Austria, Gringet in Savoie, Heida in Switzerland, Formentin in Hungary and Grumin from Bohemia are all very similar to Savagnin blanc and probably represent clones of the Traminer family, if not Traminer itself. The Viognier of the Rhone Valley may be a more distant relative of Savagnin blanc. At some point, either Traminer or Savagnin blanc mutated into a form with pink-skinned berries, called Red Traminer or Savagnin rose. Galet believed that a musqu√© ('muscat-like') mutation in the Red Traminer/Savagnin rose then led to the extra-aromatic Gew√ºrztraminer, although in Germany these names are all regarded as synonymous. With these convoluted genetics happening in the area that has been the front line for a millennium of wars in Europe, it is maybe not surprising that vines have been misnamed. Given that the wine made from 'Gew√ºrztraminer' in Germany can be much less aromatic than that in Alsace, some of the German vines may well be misidentified Savagnin Rose. The Baden vineyard of Durbach claims its own type of Red Traminer called Durbacher Clevner (not to be confused with \\"Klevner\\", an Austrian synonym for Pinot blanc). The story goes that in 1780 Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden brought vines from Chiavenna in Italy, halfway between Tramin and the Jura, which was known to the Germans as Cleven. The Klevener de Heiligenstein or Heiligensteiner Klevener found around Heiligenstein in Alsace may represent an outpost of the Durbach vines. They are often described as a less aromatic form of Gew√ºrztraminer. Traminer is recorded in Tramin from ca. 1000 until the 16th century. It was spread down the Rhine to Alsace, by way of the Palatinate, where Gew√ºrz (spice) was added to its name ‚Äì presumably this was when one of the mutations happened. The longer name was first used in Alsace in 1870 ‚Äì without the umlaut. It is not clear what this name change represents, as it seems too great a coincidence that the musqu√© mutation happened just after the arrival of the great phylloxera epidemic. More likely, an existing mutant was selected for grafting onto phylloxera-resistant rootstocks when the vineyards were replanted. In 1973 the name Traminer was discontinued in Alsace except for in the Heiligenstein area.  Crosses  A Gew√ºrztraminer made in Oregon from grapes grown in Washington State The Germans have tried hard to breed the flavours of Gew√ºrztraminer into vines that are easier to grow. In 1932, Georg Scheu crossed Gew√ºrztraminer with M√ºller-Thurgau to produce W√ºrzer, a little of which is grown in Rheinhessen and in England. Similar crosses at Alzey and W√ºrzburg respectively have produced Septimer and the reasonably successful Perle.

Brown Bros blend it with Orange Muscat in Australia. In 1965, Gew√ºrztraminer was crossed with Joannes Seyve 23.416 at the University of Illinois to produce a hybrid variety called Traminette. Traminette is more cold-tolerant than the original, while maintaining most of the desirable taste and aroma characteristics.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes ‚Äì A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 469‚Äì471, 594‚Äì595 Allen Lane 2012 In 1970s, Czech winemaker and grape breeder Ing. Jan Veverka crossed in former Czechoslovakia Gew√ºrztraminer with M√ºller-Thurgau to create the wine grape variety P√°lava (the name refers to the P√°lava hills located in the south Moravia). The grape variety is pink-skinned, earlier, more productive and of a finer traminer-like aroma. P√°lava is grown in Moravia (Czech Republic) and Slovakia. Regions Bottles of Gew√ºrztraminer (Traminac) made in Croatia In Europe, the grape is grown in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and in Turkey. In the New World, the grape is grown in Northern Michigan, though it is perhaps most successful in New Zealand, in Mendoza, the most important wine region of Argentina and in the far south of Chile. In the Middle East, the grape is grown in the Golan Heights. =Australia= Australian Gew√ºrztraminer is more notable for its occasional use of old names like Traminer Musqu√© and Gentil Rose Aromatique than the actual quality of the wines. However recently those from the country's coolest regions can be fine examples. These include Gew√ºrztraminers from the Adelaide Hills, Eden Valley, the island of Tasmania, Clare Valley, Yarra Valley and the vineyards scattered in the Australian Alps. The Macedon Ranges, just north of Melbourne, has a cold climate and volcanic soils, much suited to production of Gew√ºrztraminer. (Macedon Ranges Vignerons Association.) =Canada= Canadian wine regions where it is grown include Vancouver Island and the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, the Niagara Peninsula, and the north shore of Lake Erie and Prince Edward County wine regions of Ontario. German Gew√ºrztraminer ‚Äì may be Red Traminer =France= Gew√ºrztraminer reaches its finest expression in Alsace,According to French regulations as of 2011, this variety may only be planted in Moselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin. where it is the second most planted grape variety and the one most characteristic of the region. It grows better in the south of the region. Styles of range from the very dry Trimbach house style to the very sweet. The variety's high natural sugar means that it is popular for making dessert wine, both vendange tardive and the noble rot-affected S√©lection de Grains Nobles. As mentioned above, around Heiligenstein there is a grape known as Klevener de Heiligenstein, which is a Red Traminer (Savagnin Rose) and not a true Gew√ºrz; the Heiligenstein wines are certainly more restrained than other Gewurztraminers d'Alsace. =Germany= Germany has about 10 square kilometres of the variety, but it is very different from that of their neighbours across the Rhine. As suggested above much of their \\"Gew√ºrztraminer\\" is probably Red Traminer. The Germans go for a relatively dry style, that tries to subdue the natural flamboyance of the grape. =Italy= The Traminer is native to the cool Alpine slopes of the Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol in northeastern Italy. Whether the Gew√ºrz- mutant originated there or not is an open question, but it is certainly grown there today. What is certain is that the name \\"Traminer\\" derives from the town of Tramin. Confusingly, both pink and green grapes may be called simply Traminer. =Luxembourg= Luxembourg has also been prominent in the production of wines with Gew√ºrtztraminer grapes. =United States= In the United States, Gew√ºrtztraminer grapes are concentrated in Monterey, Mendocino and Sonoma in California, the Columbia Valley of Washington and Oregon, and the Snake River Region of Idaho. It is also grown in Michigan, Rhode Island, Caddo County, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Indiana, Hawaii, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Grand Valley, Colorado and the Finger Lakes and Long Island Regions of New York. Vine and viticulture Gew√ºrztraminer is particularly fussy about soil and climate. The vine is vigorous, even unruly, but it hates chalky soils and is very susceptible to disease. It buds early, so is very susceptible to frost, needs dry and warm summers, and ripens erratically and late. Its natural sweetness means that in hot climates it becomes blowsy, with not enough acidity to balance the huge amounts of sugar. On the other hand, picking early to retain the acidity, means that the varietal aromas do not develop, and these aromas may be further diluted by overcropping in an attempt to overcome the low yields. Synonyms Genetic instability means that the Traminers should be regarded as a family of related clones, rather than distinct varieties. Thus DNA analysis will probably reveal that the following names are not synonymous. It gets even worse when it comes to Gew√ºrztraminer, as Geilweilerhof, being Germans, see no difference between it and Red Traminer ‚Äì and some of the names look like they belong to the original green-skinned Traminer/Savagnin blanc.

Many actors of the 1950s and 1960s received their training and first exposure with the company, many of its productions were transferred to theatres in the West End, and some, such as Oh, What a Lovely War! and A Taste of Honey, were made into films. Formation Joan Littlewood and Ewan MacColl met and married in 1934, while both were working with the Theatre of Action. They started their own collaboration developing radio plays for the BBC, taking scripts and cast from local workers. However, both MI5 and the Special Branch maintained a watch on the couple because of their support for the Communist Party of Great Britain. Littlewood was precluded from working for the BBC as a children's programme presenter and some of MacColl's work was banned from broadcast. In the late 1930s Littlewood and MacColl formed an acting troupe called the Theatre Union. This was dissolved in 1940, but in 1945 many of its former members joined Joan Littlewood's new venture, the Theatre Workshop. In 1948 the company toured Czechoslovakia and Sweden.On tour with Theatre Workshop. Theatre Royal, Stratford East =Joan Littlewood (1953‚Äì79)= Touring was not successful for the company, and in 1953 Joan Littlewood took the gamble of taking a lease on a permanent base at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, London. The theatre was derelict, no funds were available for renovation, and the actors cleaned and painted the auditorium between rehearsals. To save money the cast and crew slept in the dressing rooms (while Littlewood went back to her home in Blackheath). The theatre opened on 2 February 1953 with Twelfth Night.\\"History of Theatre Royal Stratford East: 1953‚Äì1979\\" StratfordEast.com (Retrieved: 16 August 2009) MacColl had not supported the move to London, and left the company to concentrate on folk music. With Littlewood, as director, Gerry Raffles (1928‚Äì75) as manager and John Bury as designer, the Theatre Workshop continued to present a mixed programme of classics and modern plays with contemporary themes. The cast and crew (again excluding Littlewood, who was then living with Raffles) lived and worked as a commune, sharing the many tasks associated with running and maintaining a theatre, and with a duty roster for \\"chef of the week\\". In April 1953, a request for funds was met with > The Finance Committee at their last meeting was unable to recommend any > grant for the purposes you have in mind. However, the Committee indicated > that they would be prepared to assist, where possible in the matter of > publicity, providing this could be done without cost to the Committee Success came following an invitation from Claude Planson, the director of the Paris International Festival of Theatre, to represent England at the festival in 1955. The company travelled to Paris with costumes in their suitcases and scenery under their arms. In May 1955 Theatre Workshop presented acclaimed productions of Volpone and Arden of Faversham at the Th√©√¢tre H√©bertot, though the company had to beg their fares home. The Arts Council and critics became aware of the company, and they returned to Paris with six more productions. In 1963 they won the Award of the Grande Prix du Festival for Oh, What a Lovely War!. In 1955 Littlewood directed, and took the leading role in, the London premiere of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children. Finances continued to be tight, but the company was kept afloat with transfers of many successful plays to the West End stage and later, film productions. This workload put a severe strain on resources, as these transfers meant that experienced cast members were tied up for long periods and had to be replaced in the repertory. Until 1968, the Theatres Act 1843 required scripts to be submitted for approval by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. This caused conflicts because of the improvisational theatre techniques used by Littlewood to develop plays for performance. She was twice prosecuted and fined for allowing the company to improvise in performance. The Fun Palace was an ambitious multi-arts project conceived by Littlewood and the company in conjunction with the architect Cedric Price. The project was never built, but the concept may have influenced later projects such the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Another project conceived in the 1960s was the formation of an acting school associated with Theatre Workshop to inspire a new generation of actors with the ideas and techniques of Littlewood. Although Littlewood herself strongly disapproved, believing that acting was an unteachable skill,Testimony of former member Philip Hedley to the Theatre Archive Project the East 15 Acting School became successful. It is now based in its own premises in Loughton. In 2000 the school became part of the University of Essex. By the end of the 1960s both the company and the theatre were under threat. The Theatre Workshop presented revivals of its own productions and a campaign was begun to save the theatre from redevelopment as part of a new shopping centre planned to transform the centre of Stratford. Audiences mounted a campaign to save the theatre and for many years it remained open in the centre of a building site. In 1975 Gerry Raffles died of diabetes and in 1979 Littlewood moved to France, and ceased to direct. Many well-regarded television and stage actors began their professional careers at Theatre Workshop under Littlewood's tutelage. They included Yootha Joyce, Glynn Edwards, Harry H. Corbett, George A. Cooper, Richard Harris, Stephen Lewis, Howard Goorney, Brian Murphy, Murray Melvin, Nigel Hawthorne and Barbara Windsor. The last three were cast by the director Ken Russell to appear in the film version of The Boy Friend (1971) with Twiggy. =Philip Hedley (1979‚Äì2004)= Philip Hedley had worked as an assistant to Joan Littlewood for some years, and took over the artistic directorship on her departure from the theatre. He continued her educational work, and engaged with new Asian and Black audiences as the local demographic changed. The theatre continued Littlewood's agenda of portraying and expressing the experience of local people in East London. In 1999 Hedley began the Musical Theatre Initiatives scheme to encourage new writing in musical theatre. In 2004, after 25 years as artistic director, he retired. =Kerry Michael (2004‚Äì2017)= Kerry Michael is a second-generation Greek Cypriot who was born and brought up in North London. He joined Stratford East in 1997, as an associate director. He became director in September 2004. His manifesto is to bring London's new communities to the stage, and portray their experiences as second- and third-generation emigrants.Sierz, Aleks; \\"Theatre: The Ones to Watch\\" TimesOnline.co.uk, 9 January 2005 (Retrieved: 16 August 2009) Michael has upheld the theatre‚Äôs commitment to develop new work and to provide a platform for those voices underrepresented in the ever-changing communities of East London. In 2007 the theatre was nominated for an Olivier Award for \\"presenting a powerful season of provocative work that reaches new audiences\\". Its hip-hop dance production of Boy Blue‚Äôs Pied Piper won an Oliver in the same year. In the following year Kerry‚Äôs production of Cinderella was also nominated for an Olivier. Michael has numerous directing credits. Highlights include new plays by Cosh Omar, The Battle of Green Lanes and The Great Extension; Jamaica House by Paul Sirett, which had a site-specific performance on the top floor of a tower block in Stepney; new musicals such as Make Some Noise and One Dance Will Do; Ray Davies‚Äôs Come Dancing, winner of the What‚Äôs On Stage Best Musical; and John Adam's song play I Was Looking At The Ceiling And Then I Saw The Sky.

While there are differences in walking speed between repetitions, the spatial paths of limbs remain highly similar. In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation. DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data ‚Äî indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analyzed with DTW. A well known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. Other applications include speaker recognition and online signature recognition. It can also be used in partial shape matching application. In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules: * Every index from the first sequence must be matched with one or more indices from the other sequence, and vice versa * The first index from the first sequence must be matched with the first index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match) * The last index from the first sequence must be matched with the last index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match) * The mapping of the indices from the first sequence to indices from the other sequence must be monotonically increasing, and vice versa, i.e. if j > i are indices from the first sequence, then there must not be two indices l > k in the other sequence, such that index i is matched with index l and index j is matched with index k, and vice versa The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values. The sequences are \\"warped\\" non-linearly in the time dimension to determine a measure of their similarity independent of certain non-linear variations in the time dimension. This sequence alignment method is often used in time series classification. Although DTW measures a distance- like quantity between two given sequences, it doesn't guarantee the triangle inequality to hold. In addition to a similarity measure between the two sequences, a so called \\"warping path\\" is produced, by warping according to this path the two signals may be aligned in time. The signal with an original set of points X(original), Y(original) is transformed to X(warped), Y(warped). This finds applications in genetic sequence and audio synchronisation. In a related technique sequences of varying speed may be averaged using this technique see the average sequence section. This is conceptually very similar to the Needleman‚ÄìWunsch algorithm.  Implementation  This example illustrates the implementation of the dynamic time warping algorithm when the two sequences s and t are strings of discrete symbols. For two symbols x and y, \`d(x, y)\` is a distance between the symbols, e.g. \`d(x, y)\` =  x - y . int DTWDistance(s: array [1..n], t: array [1..m]) { DTW := array [0..n, 0..m] for i := 0 to n for j := 0 to m DTW[i, j] := infinity DTW[0, 0] := 0 for i := 1 to n for j := 1 to m cost := d(s[i], t[j]) DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ], // insertion DTW[i , j-1], // deletion DTW[i-1, j-1]) // match return DTW[n, m] } where \`DTW[i, j]\` is the distance between \`s[1:i]\` and \`t[1:j]\` with the best alignment. We sometimes want to add a locality constraint. That is, we require that if \`s[i]\` is matched with \`t[j]\`, then  i - j  is no larger than w, a window parameter. We can easily modify the above algorithm to add a locality constraint (differences marked). However, the above given modification works only if  n - m  is no larger than w, i.e. the end point is within the window length from diagonal. In order to make the algorithm work, the window parameter w must be adapted so that  n - m  \\\\le w (see the line marked with (*) in the code). int DTWDistance(s: array [1..n], t: array [1..m], w: int) { DTW := array [0..n, 0..m] w := max(w, abs(n-m)) // adapt window size (*) for i := 0 to n for j:= 0 to m DTW[i, j] := infinity DTW[0, 0] := 0 for i := 1 to n for j := max(1, i-w) to min(m, i+w) DTW[i, j] := 0 for i := 1 to n for j := max(1, i-w) to min(m, i+w) cost := d(s[i], t[j]) DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ], // insertion DTW[i , j-1], // deletion DTW[i-1, j-1]) // match return DTW[n, m] } Warping properties The DTW algorithm produces a discrete matching between existing elements of one series to another. In other words, it does not allow time-scaling of segments within the sequence. Other methods allow continuous warping. For example, Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) divides the sequence into uniform segments that are scaled in time using linear interpolation, to produce the best matching warping. The segment scaling causes potential creation of new elements, by time-scaling segments either down or up, and thus produces a more sensitive warping than DTW's discrete matching of raw elements. Complexity The time complexity of the DTW algorithm is O(NM), where N and M are the lengths of the two input sequences. Assuming that N \\\\geq M, the time complexity can be said to be O(N^2). The 50 years old quadratic time bound was recently broken, an implementation due to Gold and Sharir enables computing DTW in O({n^2}/{loglog(n)}) time and space. The natural implementation of DTW also has O(NM) space complexity. This bound was recently broken using a divide-and-conquer algorithm by Tralie and Dempsey, yielding a linear space complexity of O(N + M). This algorithm has an added advantage of being amenable to parallel computation. Fast computation Fast techniques for computing DTW include PrunedDTW,Silva, D. F., Batista, G. E. A. P. A. (2015).

Memory-Restricted Multiscale Dynamic Time Warping. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 569‚Äî573. A common task, retrieval of similar time series, can be accelerated by using lower bounds such as LB_Keogh or LB_Improved. In a survey, Wang et al. reported slightly better results with the LB_Improved lower bound than the LB_Keogh bound, and found that other techniques were inefficient.  Average sequence  Averaging for dynamic time warping is the problem of finding an average sequence for a set of sequences. NLAAF is an exact method to average two sequences using DTW. For more than two sequences, the problem is related to the one of the multiple alignment and requires heuristics. DBA is currently a reference method to average a set of sequences consistently with DTW. COMASA efficiently randomizes the search for the average sequence, using DBA as a local optimization process.  Supervised learning  A nearest-neighbour classifier can achieve state-of-the-art performance when using dynamic time warping as a distance measure.  Alternative approaches  In functional data analysis, time series are regarded as discretizations of smooth (differentiable) functions of time. By viewing the observed samples at smooth functions, one can utilize continuous mathematics for analyzing data. Smoothness and monotonicity of time warp functions may be obtained for instance by integrating a time-varying radial basis function, thus being a one-dimensional diffeomorphism. Optimal nonlinear time warping functions are computed by minimizing a measure of distance of the set of functions to their warped average. Roughness penalty terms for the warping functions may be added, e.g., by constraining the size of their curvature. The resultant warping functions are smooth, which facilitates further processing. This approach has been successfully applied to analyze patterns and variability of speech movements. Another related approach are hidden Markov models (HMM) and it has been shown that the Viterbi algorithm used to search for the most likely path through the HMM is equivalent to stochastic DTW. DTW and related warping methods are typically used as pre- or post-processing steps in data analyses. If the observed sequences contain both random variation in both their values (shape of observed sequences) and (random) temporal misalignment, the warping may overfit to noise leading to biased results. A simultaneous model formulation with random variation in both values (vertical) and time-parametrization (horizontal) is an example of a nonlinear mixed-effects model. In human movement analysis, simultaneous nonlinear mixed-effects modeling has been shown to produce superior results compared to DTW.

Applications =Spoken-word recognition= Due to different speaking rates, a non-linear fluctuation occurs in speech pattern versus time axis, which needs to be eliminated. DP matching is a pattern-matching algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP), which uses a time-normalization effect, where the fluctuations in the time axis are modeled using a non-linear time-warping function. Considering any two speech patterns, we can get rid of their timing differences by warping the time axis of one so that the maximal coincidence is attained with the other. Moreover, if the warping function is allowed to take any possible value, distinction can be made between words belonging to different categories. So, to enhance the distinction between words belonging to different categories, restrictions were imposed on the warping function slope. =Correlation power analysis= Unstable clocks are used to defeat naive power analysis. Several techniques are used to counter this defense, one of which is dynamic time warping.

Early life and career  Tim Buckley was born in Washington, D.C. on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1947, to Elaine (n√©e Scalia), an Italian American, and Timothy Charles Buckley Jr., a decorated World War II veteran and son of Irish immigrants from Cork. He spent his early childhood in Amsterdam, New York, an industrial city about northwest of Albany. At five years old, Buckley began listening to his mother's progressive jazz recordings, particularly Miles Davis. Buckley's musical life began after his family moved to Bell Gardens in southern California in 1956. His grandmother introduced him to the work of Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday, his mother to Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland and his father to the country music of Hank Williams and Johnny Cash. When the folk music revolution came around in the early 1960s, Buckley taught himself the banjo at age 13, and with several friends formed a folk group inspired by the Kingston Trio that played local high school events. During high school, Buckley was elected to class offices, played on the baseball team and quarterbacked the football team. During a football game, he broke two fingers on his left hand, permanently damaging them. He said that the injury prevented him from playing barre chords. This disability may have led to his use of extended chords, many of which don't require barres. However, this disability claim seems to be invalidated because Buckley's performance on the final episode of the television show, The Monkees, broadcast on March 25, 1968, clearly shows Buckley using barre chords while performing \\"Song to the Siren\\" on an out-of-tune 12-string guitar. Buckley attended Loara High School in Anaheim, California. He cut classes regularly and quit football, focusing most of his attention on music. He befriended Larry Beckett, his future lyricist, and Jim Fielder, a bass player with whom he formed two musical groups, the Bohemians, who initially played popular music, and the Harlequin 3, a folk group which regularly incorporated spoken word and beat poetry into their gigs. Buckley and lyricist/friend Beckett wrote dozens of songs, some that appeared on Tim's debut album, Tim Buckley. \\"Buzzin' Fly\\" was written during this period and was featured on Happy Sad, his 1969 LP. Buckley's college career at Fullerton College lasted two weeks in 1965. After dropping out of college, Buckley dedicated himself fully to music and playing L.A. folk clubs. During the summer of 1965, he played regularly at a club co-founded by Dan Gordon. He played Orange County coffeehouses such as the White Room in Buena Park and the Monday-night hootenannies at the Los Angeles Troubadour.Musician magazine article by Scott Isler, The Tim Buckley Archives. That year, Cheetah magazine deemed Buckley one of \\"The Orange County Three\\", along with Steve Noonan and Jackson Browne. In February 1966, following a gig at It's Boss, the Mothers of Invention's drummer Jimmy Carl Black recommended Buckley to the Mothers' manager, Herb Cohen who saw potential in Tim and landed him an extended gig at the Nite Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village. Buckley's girlfriend, Jainie Goldstein, drove him to New York. While living in the Bowery with Jainie, Buckley ran into Lee Underwood and asked him to play guitar for him. The two became lifelong friends and collaborators. Under Cohen's management, Buckley recorded a six- song demo acetate disc which he sent to Elektra records owner Jac Holzman, who offered him a recording contract.  Folk rock  In August 1966, Buckley recorded his self-titled debut album in three days in Los Angeles. He was often unhappy with his albums after they were recorded and described his debut album as \\"like Disneyland\\". The record featured Buckley and a band of Underwood and Orange County friends. Underwood's mix of jazz and country improvisation on a Telecaster guitar became a distinctive part of Buckley's early sound. Jac Holzman and Paul Rothchild's production and Jack Nitzsche's string arrangements cemented the record's mid-'60s sound. The album's folk- rock style was typical of the time, although many people, including Underwood, felt the strings by Nitzsche \\"did not enhance its musical quality.\\" Critics took note of Buckley's distinctive voice and tuneful compositions. Underwood considered the record to be \\"a first effort, naive, stiff, quaky and innocent [but] a ticket into the marketplace\\". Holzman expressed similar sentiments and thought Buckley wasn't comfortable in his own musical skin. Larry Beckett suggested the band's desire to please audiences held it back. Elektra released two singles promoting the debut album, \\"Wings\\" with \\"Grief in My Soul\\" as the B-side, and \\"Aren't You the Girl\\"/\\"Strange Street Affair Under Blue.\\" Buckley followed with \\"Once Upon a Time\\" and \\"Lady Give Me Your Key\\", which were not well regarded but showed potential. Elektra decided not to release the songs as singles, and the songs remained in Elektra's record vaults. Rhino Records was unable to find \\"Lady Give Me Your Key\\" to include on its Morning Glory: The Tim Buckley Anthology, but the song was the title track on Light in the Attic Records' 2017 collection of the previously unissued 1967 acoustic sessions. \\"Once Upon A Time\\" surfaced on Rhino's Where The Action Is 1965‚Äì68 Los Angeles anthology in 2009. Goodbye and Hello, released in 1967, featured late 1960s-style poetry and songs in different timings, and was an ambitious release for the 20-year-old Buckley. Reflecting the confidence Elektra had in Buckley and group, they were given free rein on the content of the album. Beckett continued as lyricist and the album consisted of Buckley originals and Beckett‚ÄìBuckley collaborations. Critics noted the improved lyrical and melodic qualities of Buckley's music. Buckley's voice had developed since his last release and the press appreciated both his lower register and falsetto in equal measure. The subject of the album distinguished it from its predecessor. Beckett addressed the psychological nature of war in \\"No Man Can Find the War\\", and Underwood welcomed Buckley's entry into darker territory with \\"Pleasant Street\\". \\"I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain\\" represented a confessional lyric to his estranged wife and child, while the mix of introspective folk songs and political-themed content attracted folk fans and anti-war audiences. Holzman had faith in Buckley and rented advertising space for the musician on the Sunset Strip, an unusual step for a solo act. Buckley distanced himself from comparisons to Bob Dylan, expressing an apathy toward Dylan and his work. While Goodbye and Hello did not make Buckley a star, it performed better in the charts than his previous effort, peaking at No. 171. Buckley's higher profile led to his album The Best of Tim Buckley being used as a soundtrack to the 1969 film Changes. Buckley performed \\"Song to the Siren\\" on the final episode of The Monkees television show. Buckley was wary of the press and often avoided interviews. After a slot on The Tonight Show, Buckley was standoffish and insulting toward Carson, and on another television appearance refused to lip sync to \\"Pleasant Street\\". After Beckett was drafted into the Army, Buckley developed his own style, and described the jazz/blues- rock with which he was associated as \\"white thievery and an emotional sham.\\" Drawing inspiration from jazz greats such as Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Roland Kirk, and vocalist Leon Thomas, Buckley's sound became different from previous recordings. In 1968, Buckley toured Europe twice, first including Denmark, the Netherlands, and England, appearing e.g. on John Peel's Top Gear radio show on the BBC and then appearing at the in Germany, as well as touring England and Denmark again. Later that year, he recorded Happy Sad, which reflected folk and jazz influences and would be his best-charting album, peaking at No. 81.  Middle period  During 1969, Buckley began to write and record material for three albums, Blue Afternoon, Lorca, and Starsailor. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician Cathy Berberian, he integrated the ideas of composers such as Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis in an avant- garde rock genre. Buckley selected eight songs for Blue Afternoon, an album similar to Happy Sad in style. In a 1977 article for DownBeat magazine, Lee Underwood wrote that Buckley's heart was not in Blue Afternoon and that the album was a perfunctory response to please his business partners. While Buckley's music never sold well, his following releases did indeed chart. Lorca alienated his folk base while Blue Afternoon was criticized as boring and tepid, and \\"[not] even good sulking music.\\" Blue Afternoon was Buckley's last album to chart on Billboard, reaching No. 192. Following the albums, Buckley began to focus on what he felt to be his masterpiece, Starsailor. Starsailor contained free jazz textures under Buckley's most extreme vocal performance, ranging from high shrieks to deep, soulful baritone. This personal album included the more accessible \\"Song to the Siren\\", a song which has since been covered by This Mortal Coil, Robert Plant, John Frusciante, Bryan Ferry and Brendan Perry. The album was a critical and commercial failure. Unable to produce his music and almost broke, Buckley turned to alcohol and drug binges. He considered acting and completed an unreleased low- budget film entitled Why? (1971). The film was an experimental use of the new medium videotape and was commissioned by Technicolor.  \\"Sex funk\\" period  In 1970, Buckley disbanded his Starsailor ensemble and assembled a new funk band. He cut three albums, Greetings from L.A., Sefronia and Look at the Fool. Buckley alienated much of his hippie fan base with his previous two albums, and his sexually frank lyrics (\\"whip me, spank me\\") prevented the songs from receiving airplay, although he retained a cult following. In 1975, Buckley engaged the press regarding a live album comeback. He began performing revamped versions of material drawn from his career, except Starsailor and Lorca, as a response to his audience, which he had spurned in the past.  Death  On June 28, 1975, Buckley completed a tour with a last show in Dallas, playing to a sold-out crowd of 1,800 people. He celebrated with a weekend of drinking with his band and friends. The following night, Buckley accompanied longtime friend, Richard Keeling, to his house. At some point, Keeling produced a bag of heroin, some of which Buckley ingested. Buckley's friends took him home and‚Äîseeing his inebriated state‚Äîhis wife Judy laid him on the living-room floor and questioned his friends as to what had happened. She moved Buckley into bed. When she checked him later, Buckley's wife found he was not breathing and blue. Attempts by friends and paramedics to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead. The coroner's report stated Buckley died at 9:42 p.m. on June 29, 1975, from \\"acute heroin/morphine and ethanol intoxication due to inhalation and ingestion of overdose\\".  Aftermath  Buckley's sound recorder was surprised by the musician's death, recalling that at Buckley's last show that \\"someone offered him a drag off a joint and he refused. He didn't appear strung out in any way. He was very together both physically and psychologically.\\" Buckley's tour manager, Bob Duffy, said Buckley's death was not expected, but \\"was like watching a movie, and that was its natural ending.\\" Other friends saw his fate as predictable, if not inevitable. Beckett recalled how Buckley took chances with his life, including dangerous driving, drinking alcohol, taking pills and heroin. Given the circumstances of his death, police charged Keeling with murder and distribution of heroin. At his hearing on August 14, 1975, Keeling pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and, after failing to complete community service, was sentenced to 120 days in jail and four years' probation. Buckley died in debt, owning only a guitar and an amplifier. About 200 friends and family attended his funeral at the Wilshire Funeral Home in Santa Monica, including manager Herb Cohen and Lee Underwood. His 8-year-old son, Jeff, had met his father only once, and was not invited to the funeral. Jeff Buckley said not being invited to his father's funeral \\"gnawed\\" at him, and prompted him to pay his respects by performing \\"I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain\\" in 1991 at a memorial tribute to Buckley in Brooklyn, six years before his own accidental death.Rogers R. New Again: Jeff Buckley. Interview Magazine archive. Retrieved February 10, 2015. Personal life During French class in 1964, Buckley met Mary Guibert. Their relationship inspired some of Buckley's music, and provided him time away from his turbulent home life. His father suffered a head injury during the war which, along with a severe work-related injury, was said to have affected his mental balance.Blue Melody, Lee Underwood, Tim Buckley Biography Falsely believing Guibert to be pregnant, the couple married on October 25, 1965. The marriage was tumultuous and Buckley moved out, but Guibert soon became pregnant. Buckley found himself neither willing nor able to cope with marriage and fatherhood, and the couple saw each other sporadically. They divorced in October 1966, about a month before their son, Jeff, was born.Chronology by Robert Niemi, The Tim Buckley Archives In April 1970, Buckley married Judy Brejot Sutcliffe in Santa Monica, and adopted her son, Taylor Keith Sutcliffe.

Soho House is a museum run by Birmingham Museums Trust, celebrating Matthew Boulton's life, his partnership with James Watt, his membership of the Lunar Society of Birmingham and his contribution to the Midlands Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. It is a Grade II* listed 18th-century house in Handsworth, part of Birmingham since 1911, but historically in the county of Staffordshire. It was the home of entrepreneur Matthew Boulton from 1766 until his death in 1809, and a regular meeting-place of the Lunar Society. History Matthew Boulton, one of the 18th century's most significant entrepreneurs, acquired the lease of the five-year-old Soho Mill in 1761 and developed it into Soho Manufactory. He expanded the cottage next to it into Soho House, changing it several times. It is faced with sheets of painted slate to give the appearance of large stone blocks. Boulton moved into Soho House when the Manufactory was completed. The Soho Manufactory was demolished in 1863. In 1766, Boulton became one of the founders of the Lunar Society. In 1789, Boulton commissioned Samuel Wyatt to extend the buildings and fully revamp it and the gardens. Work on extending the building was completed in 1796 following the submission of designs by James Wyatt, Samuel's brother, for the additions of a main entrance front. Wyatt was also responsible for the large dining room, the regular venue for meetings of the Lunar Society. It is a Grade II* listed building. After Boulton's death, in the house, it passed to his son Matthew Robinson Boulton and later his grandson, Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who eventually sold it in 1850. It then had a number of owners, and was at one time used as a residential hostel for police officers, before being acquired by Birmingham City Council in 1990 and being opened by them as a museum in 1995. Features The Blue Plaque Soho House has been restored, retaining its 18th-century appearance, with \\"fine collections of ormolu, silver, furniture and paintings\\". Of particular note are the displays of silver and ormolu which were made in the manufactory, and the ormolu Sidereal clock made by Boulton and Fothergill, in 1771-72. There is a Blue Plaque commemorating Matthew Boulton on the house. The garden, once over 100 acres in size but now less than half an acre, contains a walk with sphinxes, dated to around 1795. Part of the garden has been recreated using Boulton‚Äôs original planting notes. Museum Soho House is a Heritage Site and branch museum of the Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery, owned by Birmingham City Council. Since April 2012 the Heritage Sites and all other museums formerly run by the council have been run by Birmingham Museums Trust. It hosts exhibitions of local and community interest. Previously free, since April 2011 admission charges apply for entry to the house. It remains free to under 16s. Gardens, grounds and visitor facilities are free to all visitors. Artists-in-residence at the house have included Vanley Burke and Pauline Bailey.

Goguryeo had overrun the previous capital of Hanseong (modern-day Seoul), which forced Baekje to find a new center of strength. In 538, King Seong moved the capital to Sabi (in modern-day Buyeo County). However, Gongju remained an important center until the kingdom's fall in 660. = New capital = On August 11, 2004, the South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hae-chan announced that the country's capital will be moved from Seoul to Gongju (approximately south of Seoul) and Yeongi commencing in 2007. A site was chosen for the project, which was scheduled to be completed by 2030. It was envisaged that government and administrative functions will move to the new capital, along with (possibly) the National Assembly and supreme court, although no sizable relocation was expected until the first phase of the project has been completed by 2012. The move was intended to reduce Seoul's overcrowding and economic dominance over the rest of South Korea; perhaps not coincidentally, it would have also moved the government and administration out of range of North Korean artillery fire. The projected cost of the project ranged from $45bn to as much as $94bn. The plan has aroused controversy, with opposition parties calling for a referendum to see whether it is endorsed by the population. Some civic groups have also launched a constitutional appeal, and on October 21, 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that the special law for the relocation of the capital is unconstitutional since the relocation is a serious national matter requiring national referendum or revision of the constitution, thus effectively ending the dispute. Opinion polls showed that a slight majority of South Koreans are opposed to the move, both before and after the ruling. However, late in 2004, the government announced yet another plan that will allow Seoul to be a capital in name only by retaining the Executive Branch, all Legislature Branch, and Judiciary Branch in Seoul, while moving all other branches of government to Gongju. The question remains unresolved to date.

It has associations with the Lunar Society and is a Grade II* listed building. It is, however, in a very poor state of repair and is on the Buildings at Risk Register. History =The Scotts= In the mid-17th century, Richard Scott acquired the house then standing on the site and known as Nether House. In about 1777, Joseph Scott (later Sir Joseph Scott, 1st Baronet Scott of Great Barr) replaced the old house with a two-storey, nine-bay mansion in the Strawberry Hill Gothic Revival style. The house was much altered and extended about 1840 and in 1863, an adjacent chapel (which was never consecrated) was erected to a design probably of architect George Gilbert Scott, a friend ‚Äì but not a relation ‚Äì of Sir Francis Scott. Two of the extant lodge houses are believed to be by George Gilbert Scott. Outside the chapel are the burial plots of several of Lady Bateman Scott's pets, inscribed with poems she wrote for them. Financial problems led the Scott Family (who gave their name to the nearby Scott Arms pub and shopping centre), to lease out the hall from about 1788 to Samuel Galton, and for some years the Hall became a venue for meetings of the Lunar Society. It is said to be the 'favourite place of meeting' of this illustrious body. In 1999, stone memorials to the Lunar Society, the \\"Moonstones\\", were erected at the nearby Asda supermarket. In 1791, Sir Francis Scott, 3rd Baronet, inherited the manor of Great Barr from his maternal uncle Thomas Hoo and was able to return to live in the house on the expiry of the lease. He died in 1863. His widow Mildred lived on in the Hall until her death in 1909. =After the Scotts= In 1911, the estate was purchased by a local hospital board and, in 1918, became St Margaret's Mental Hospital. Many detached hospital buildings were erected near the hall, and in the 1980s the grounds became a nature reserve, managed by the Staffordshire Nature Conservation Trust but the hall itself was abandoned in 1978 and, despite its 1971 Grade II* listing, was left to decay. The hospital began to close in phases from the late 1980s. The male department closed during 1992 but the female department closed in March 1997. The final residents, those with high dependency, left a newer part of the site in 2004. This also included a special school, The Queslett School, which closed in December 1988. Many years passed during which discussions and negotiations for the protection of the hall came to nothing. In 2006, Bovis Homes purchased the 40 hectare estate and obtained planning permission for the redevelopment of the site. As of 2011, Nether Hall Park a new residential housing development, occupying a substantial part of the estate, is in course of completion. In May 2011 the hall, still in ruins, was put up for sale for ¬£2.2 million, by the Manor Building Preservation Trust, who had been allowed to purchase it nine years earlier for ¬£900,000. The trust had failed to bring it back into a safe state. It failed to sell, and so was offered for sale by auction on 6 February 2012, by Van Weenan Estate Agents of London, with a guide price of ¬£1,250,000. The highest bid was ¬£1,140,000, and so it again remained unsold. In May 2012, it was sold to a consortium of ten local residents. They have commissioned Lapworth Architects to consult with the public and investigate potential new uses for the hall. The hall is on English Heritage's \\"Buildings at Risk Register\\".

Her pioneering activities were crucial to the growth of professional nursing in the United States. Early years Maxwell was born in Bristol, New York on March 14, 1851. Her father was a Scottish emigrant, clergyman John Eglinton Maxwell, and her mother was an American-born woman of English descent, Diantha Caroline Maxwell. The family moved to Canada for some of Maxwell's childhood, returning in 1874. That year, she began nursing without formal training, as an assistant matron at New England Hospital. She left in 1876 and spent two years in England before enrolling at Boston City Hospital Training School for Nurses. She was attracted there by the renown of Linda Richards, one of America's first nurses, who taught at the school.  Career  In 1880 Maxwell was hired to start a training school at Montreal General Hospital, however she found it a frustratingly slow experience. She left after six months and travelled to Europe, where she visited a number of hospitals. She returned to America and in November 1881 she was offered the superintendency of the Training School for Nurses at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 1889, she moved to New York to be director of nursing at St. Luke's Hospital, and from there became superintendent of nursing at the Presbyterian Hospital of New York from 1892 to 1921. Maxwell was also the first director of the Presbyterian Hospital's nursing school, founded in 1892, which later became the Columbia University School of Nursing. =Wartime activities= During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Maxwell requested permission to take trained nurses to military hospitals to care for casualties. She was sent to a field hospital in Chicamauga, Georgia, where she and her nurses encountered poor sanitation, widespread disease, and a high death rate. Maxwell and her nurses were able to improve the conditions significantly. There was also an outbreak of typhoid fever at a military training camp in the area, and Maxwell led 150 nurses in caring for over 600 cases, as well as cases of malaria and measles. The military was impressed with the nurses' achievements and in 1901, with Maxwell's involvement, the United States Army Nurse Corps was established. In World War I, she also worked to prepare nurses for active military service, and in 1916 travelled to Europe to visit hospitals at the fronts. France awarded her the Medaille de l'Hygiene Publique (Medal of Honor for Public Health) in recognition of her work. Following the war, Maxwell worked for nurses to be given a rank in the armed forces, which was achieved in 1920. = Other activities = In addition to her work in education and with the military, Maxwell co-wrote a textbook with Amy E. Pope entitled Practical Nursing. She was also a member of the American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses (1893), which later developed into the National League for Nursing, and the Nurses' Associated Alumnae of the United States and Canada (1897), which later became the American Nurses Association. She was also a member of the International Council of Nurses (1899) and the American Red Cross Nursing Service (1899), and was involved in establishing the American Journal of Nursing and the Isabel Hampton Robb Scholarship Fund. = Recognition = The first building to open at the new Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in 1928 was the home for the university's nursing school. It was named the \\"Anna C. Maxwell Hall\\" in her honor. The hall was razed in 1984 to make room for a new hospital building, and the university established an endowed professorship at the nursing school in Maxwell's name. Maxwell was one of the first women buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Columbia University awarded her an honorary Master of Arts degree. Due to her military service, establishing the Army Nurse Corps, she was one of the first women buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/acmaxwell.htm References External links * Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:American nursing administrators Category:People of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Category:1851 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Columbia University faculty Category:Columbia University School of Nursing faculty Category:Female wartime nurses Category:Nursing educators Category:Female nurses in World War I Category:American medical writers Category:Women medical writers ","title":"Anna Maxwell"},{"id":"342878","text":"Standard Delay Format (SDF) is an IEEE standard for the representation and interpretation of timing data for use at any stage of an electronic design process.

It is located along the middle-lower course of the Krka River in central Dalmatia, in ≈†ibenik-Knin county, downstream Miljevci area, and just a few kilometers northeast of the city of ≈†ibenik.Carter, Francis W. and David Turnock (2002). Environmental problems of East Central Europe, Routledge 2nd ed. p. 345. It was formed to protect the Krka River and is intended primarily for scientific, cultural, educational, recreational, and tourism activities. It is the seventh national park in Croatia and was proclaimed a national park in 1985. Geography The Krka National Park is located entirely within the territory of ≈†ibenik-Knin County and encompasses an area of 109 square kilometers along the Krka River: two kilometers downriver from Knin to Skradin and the lower part of the river ƒåikola. The Krka National Park is a spacious, largely unchanged region of exceptional and multifaceted natural value, and includes one or more preserved or insignificantly altered ecosystems. The Krka Waterfalls area has the second highest density of lavender in Europe, hence the high frequency of wasps and bees in the area. Environment =Flora= The Krka National Park belongs to the Southern European (Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean) region. Due to its special position and the mosaic distribution of various types of habitats, it is characterized by exceptionally rich and varied flora and fauna. Eight hundred and sixty species and subspecies of plants have been identified within the territory of the Krka National Park, including several endemic Illyrian- Adriatic species. Standing out are the stone bellflower, the chimney bellflower, the mullein inula, Dalmatian pellitory and the Illirian iris, which is found growing on the rocks. Other endemic plants growing in this hot and dry environment include the wolfen spurge, Adriatic violet, musk thistle, thorny centaurium, strawberry spurge and Bertolon's sage. In the wet areas along the Krka and Cikola rivers and in the Krka river valley grow meadow squill, knotweed, European hornbeam, wood melick and lady orchid. =Fauna= Eighteen species of fish inhabit the Krka River, among which ten are endemic, making the Krka a natural landmark of the highest category. Brown trout and Dalmatian barbelgudgeon are a couple of fish that can be found in the ecosystem. Patches of reeds, lakes formed along part of the river and swamped meadows abound in amphibians and birds, while thickets and stone quarries are home to reptiles. National Park Krka. Krka National Park. Krka National Park. The abundance of species of birds (222), the structure of the bird communities and the great significance of the Krka for spring and autumn migrations make it among the ornithologically most valuable regions of Europe. There are numerous birds of prey in the area, notable ones are: osprey, short-toed eagle, golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle, lanner falcon and the peregrine falcon. Other birds of interest are Eurasian eagle-owl, European bee-eater and griffon vulture. Among mammals, there are 18 species of bats, which are generally endangered or near extinction in the rest of Europe, long-fingered bat, the Daubenton's bat, and the threatened European otter. =Ria= A ria is the mouth of a river that flows into the sea, created by the submergence of the riverbed after the rise of the Adriatic sea level for 135 metres after the last quaternary glaciation. In the ria of the Krka River, seawater extends to the base of Skradinski buk. The ria of the Krka River is 23.5 kilometers in length. This ria is considered an exceptional phenomenon, due to its lack of pollution and biological vitality. It is an area rich in shellfish, freshwater fish and saltwater fish. Tourism When you are at the Krka National Park there are several places of interest. The attractions and facilities available are various footpaths, sightseeing tours and presentations, boat trips, souvenir shops, a museum, and restaurants. There are also several archeological remains of unpreserved fortresses in the park's vicinity dating back to as far as the Roman times. They are ƒåuƒçevo, Neƒçven, Bogoƒçin, Kljuƒçica and Burnum. =Skradinski buk= Skradinski buk Skradinski buk is one of the most attractive parts of the park. It is a massive, clear, natural pool with high waterfalls at one end and cascades at the other. It is the lowest of the three sets of waterfalls formed along the Krka river. In an area 400 m in length and 100 m in width there are 17 waterfalls and the total difference in height between the first and the last falls is 47.7 m. Due to the wealth and variety of geomorphological forms, vegetation, and the various effects caused by the play of light on the whirlpools, Skradinski buk is considered to be one of the most beautiful calcium carbonate waterfalls in Europe.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, p. 103, Zagreb (1999), Krka NP Croatia - waterfall The rate of flow is 43 m3 a second in winter, 18 m3 in summer, with an average of 55 cubic metres a second flowing down Skradinski buk annually. It is the largest travertine cascade system in Europe.Buvina, The Natural Heritage of Croatia, p. 313, Buvina Ltd (1995), =Ro≈°ki Slap= Hiking trail on Ro≈°ki slap Ro≈°ki Slap, located near Miljevci, is the second most popular attraction of the Krka National Park in terms of numbers of visitors. It is the sixth waterfall of the river Krka. Around the whole location there is a walking trail with wonderful views. There is also a hiking trail. The location can be visited throughout the year. The easiest way to reach Ro≈°ki Slap is to take one of the excursion boats operated by the Krka National Park, although the falls can also be reached with a public road. =Visovac= Visovac Island. Inside the park is the island of Visovac which was founded during the reign of Louis I of Hungary, home to the Roman Catholic Visovac Monastery founded by the Franciscans in 1445 near Miljevci village.Oliver, Jeanne Croatia, Lonely Planet 4th ed. p. 187. The park also includes the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Monastery Krka founded in 1345. The island can be visited by a boat tour from Skradinski buk. The Krka monastery is a spiritual center of the Orthodox Dalmatian Eparchy (Diocese), which has its see in ≈†ibenik. It was first mentioned in written documents in the year 1402 as the pious endowment of Jelena ≈†ubiƒá, the sister of Serbian Emperor Du≈°an. The monastery was built and rebuilt until the late 18th century.

In many concrete categories such as groups, abelian groups and (left- or right) modules, the image of a morphism is the image of the correspondent morphism in the category of sets. In any normal category with a zero object and kernels and cokernels for every morphism, the image of a morphism f can be expressed as follows: :im f = ker coker f In an abelian category (which is in particular binormal), if f is a monomorphism then f = ker coker f, and so f = im f.

Anthropology is the study of aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology, cultural anthropology and philosophical anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life, while economic anthropology studies human economic behavior. Biological (physical), forensic and medical anthropology study the biological development of humans, the application of biological anthropology in a legal setting and the study of diseases and their impacts on humans over time, respectively.  Education  Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their undergraduate education and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the graduate level. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation. Anthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master's degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than anthropology and graduate degrees in anthropology.  Career  Research topics of anthropologists include the discovery of human remains and artifacts as well as the exploration of social and cultural issues such as population growth, structural inequality and globalization by making use of a variety of technologies including statistical software and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor.

Anthropologists without doctorates tend to work more in other fields than academia, while the majority of those with doctorates are primarily employed in academia. Many of those without doctorates in academia tend to work exclusively as researchers and do not teach. Those in research-only positions are often not considered faculty. The median salary for anthropologists in 2015 was $62,220. Many anthropologists report an above average level of job satisfaction. Although closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and archaeologists perform differing roles, though archeology is considered a sub- discipline of anthropology. While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains. Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of forensic anthropology, digital anthropology and cyber anthropology. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a historian. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective. Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies. A far greater percentage of historians are employed in academic settings than anthropologists, who have more diverse places of employment. Anthropologists are experiencing a shift in the twenty-first century United States with the rise of forensic anthropology. In the United States, as opposed to many other countries forensic anthropology falls under the domain of the anthropologist and not the Forensic pathologist. In this role, forensic anthropologists help in the identification of skeletal remains by deducing biological characteristics such as sex, age, stature and ancestry from the skeleton. However, forensic anthropologists tend to gravitate more toward working in academic and laboratory settings, while forensic pathologists perform more applied field work. Forensic anthropologists typically hold academic doctorates, while forensic pathologists are medical doctors. The field of forensic anthropology is rapidly evolving with increasingly capable technology and more extensive databases. Forensic anthrology is one of the most specialized and competitive job areas within the field of anthropology and currently has more qualified graduates than positions. The profession of Anthropology has also received an additional sub-field with the rise of Digital anthropology. This new branch of the profession has an increased usage of computers as well as interdisciplinary work with medicine, computer visualization, industrial design, biology and journalism. Anthropologists in this field primarily study the evolution of human reciprocal relations with the computer-generated world. Cyber anthropologists also study digital and cyber ethics along with the global implications of increasing connectivity. With cyber ethical issues such as net neutrality increasingly coming to light, this sub-field is rapidly gaining more recognition. One rapidly emerging branch of interest for cyber anthropologists is artificial intelligence. Cyber anthropologists study the co-evolutionary relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. This includes the examination of computer-generated (CG) environments and how people interact with them through media such as movies, television, and video.  Cultural Anthropologist  Culture anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology. A cultural anthropologist studies different cultures. They study primitive societies, villages, as well as modern communities and cities. They look at different behaviors and patterns within a culture. In order to study these cultures, many anthropologists will live among the culture they are studying. Cultural anthropologists can work as professors, work for corporations, nonprofit organizations, as well government agencies. The field is very large and people can do a lot as a cultural anthropologist.

Meditations on First Philosophy, in which the existence of God and the immortality of the soul are demonstrated () is a philosophical treatise by Ren√© Descartes first published in Latin in 1641. The French translation (by the Duke of Luynes with Descartes' supervision) was published in 1647 as M√©ditations M√©taphysiques. The title may contain a misreading by the printer, mistaking animae immortalitas for animae immaterialitas, as suspected by A. Baillet.Adrien Baillet: La Vie de Mr. Descartes Paris 1692 p. 176. Cf. Theodor Ebert, Immortalitas oder Immaterialitas? Zum Untertitel von Descartes' Meditationen in: Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Philosophie 74 (1992) 180-202, The book is made up of six meditations, in which Descartes first discards all belief in things that are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. He wrote the meditations as if he had meditated for six days: each meditation refers to the last one as \\"yesterday\\". (In fact, Descartes began work on the Meditations in 1639.) One of the most influential philosophical texts ever written, it is widely read to this day. The book consists of the presentation of Descartes' metaphysical system at its most detailed level and in the expanding of his philosophical system, first introduced in the fourth part of his Discourse on Method (1637). Descartes' metaphysical thought is also found in the Principles of Philosophy (1644), which the author intended to be a philosophical guidebook. Letter of Dedication and Preface = Letter of dedication = To the most wise and illustrious the Dean and Doctors of the Sacred Faculty of Theology in Paris Descartes says that he is asking the protection of the Faculty for his work, and to this end he writes the present dedication. His first consideration is that the existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non- believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when saying that we must believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God. His aim is to apply a method to demonstrate these two truths, in a so clear and evident manner that result to be evident. This method he has developed for the Sciences.Ren√© Descartes: Meditations on First Philosophy in Focus. Edited by Stanley Tweyman. Routledge. 34‚Äì40. London and New York. 1993. = Preface to the reader = Descartes explains how he made a mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, and two of them he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self. The second is that from the idea I have of something that is more perfect than myself, it cannot be concluded that it exists. In the treatise we will see that in fact from the idea that there is something more perfect than myself, it follows that this exists. It goes on to comment that on a general level the reasoning used by the atheists for denying the existence of God is based in the fact that \\"we ascribe to God affections that are human, or we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds\\" that we presume to understand that which God can and ought to do. He says that we have to consider God as incomprehensible and infinite, and our minds as limited and finite. Finally says that the treatise was submitted to some men of learning to know their difficulties and objections, and are answered at the end of it. Summary and analysis =I. What Can Be Called into Doubt= The First Meditation, subtitled \\"What can be called into doubt\\", opens with the Meditator reflecting on the number of falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he thinks he knows and to start again from the foundations, building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds. He has seated himself alone, by the fire, free of all worries so that he can demolish his former opinions with care. The Meditator reasons that he need only find some reason to doubt his present opinions in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for knowledge. Rather than doubt every one of his opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into doubt if he can doubt the foundations and basic principles on which the opinions are founded. Everything that the Meditator has accepted as most true he has come to learn from or through his senses. He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that. However, the Meditator realizes that he is often convinced when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things‚Äîwomen and fish, in the case of a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry. On further reflection, the Meditator realizes that even simple things can be doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our conception of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses would not have been created by a perfect being. The Meditator finds it almost impossible to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon. Before retiring for the night, the Meditator indulges in his old beliefs, afraid to awake to a life of confusion. As a result he allows for the tempting falsehoods to continue unabridged. Analysis Descartes saw his Meditations as providing the metaphysical underpinning of his new physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn what he saw as two- thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the Meditations. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay lip service to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded. Reading the First Meditation as an effort to coax Aristotelians away from their customary opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous \\"Dream Argument\\" to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming‚Äîthat though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking‚Äîor the possibility of a universal dream‚Äîthat my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later \\"Evil Demon\\" argument. The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The Painter's Analogy, which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism. Read on its own, the First Meditation can be seen as presenting skeptical doubts as a subject of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much-discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight to the heart of the Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality. It is difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism. Western philosophy since Descartes has been largely marked and motivated by an effort to overcome this problem. Descartes' doubt is a methodological and rational doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the possibility that he might be mad since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed. He goes on to suggest more powerful reasons to doubt that his beliefs are true. In general, his method is that of forming skeptical hypotheses‚Äîmethodic doubt. In the first meditation, he considers whether he is mad, dreaming, or deceived by an evil demon. The general form of these arguments is: # If I am dreaming/deceived, then my beliefs are unreliable. Descartes' goal, as stated at the beginning of the meditation, is to suspend judgment about any belief that is even slightly doubtful. The skeptical scenarios show that all of the beliefs he considers in the first meditation‚Äîincluding, at the very least, all his beliefs about the physical world, are doubtful. So he decides to suspend judgment. He will henceforth give up all of his beliefs about the physical world. He also decides to continually remind himself to avoid habitually falling into accepting beliefs without support, a habit to which he is susceptible. =II. The Nature of the Human Mind= In Meditation II: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That the mind is more known than the body, Descartes lays out a pattern of thought, sometimes called representationalism, in response to the doubts forwarded in Meditation I. He identifies five steps in this theory: # We have access to only the world of our ideas; things in the world are accessed only indirectly. # These ideas are understood to include all of the contents of the mind, including perceptions, images, memories, concepts, beliefs, intentions, decisions, etc. # Ideas and the things they represent are separate from each other. # These represented things are many times \\"external\\" to the mind. # It is possible for these ideas to constitute either accurate or false representations. Descartes argues that this representational theory disconnects the world from the mind, leading to the need for some sort of bridge to span the separation and provide good reasons to believe that the ideas accurately represent the outside world. The first plank he uses in constructing this bridge can be found in the following excerpt: > I have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world ‚Äî no sky, no > earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely > I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something. But there is a > deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to see that I am > always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me > all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think > that I am something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must > finally conclude that the statement \\"I am, I exist\\" must be true whenever I > state it or mentally consider it. In other words, one's consciousness implies one's existence. In one of Descartes' replies to objections to the book, he summed this up in the phrase cogito, ergo sum, 'Ithink therefore I am.' Once he secures his existence, however, Descartes seeks to find out what \\"I\\" is. He rejects the typical method, which looks for a definition (e.g., Rational Animal), because the words used in the definition would then need to be defined. He seeks simple terms that do not need to be defined in this way, but whose meaning can just be \\"seen.\\" From these self-evident truths, complex terms can be built up. The first of these self-evident truths is Descartes' proof of existence turned on its head: > But what then am I? A thinking thing. And what is that? Something that > doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and also senses and > has mental images. To define himself further, Descartes turns to the example of wax. He determines that wax isn't wax because of its color, texture or shape, as all of these things can change and the substance still be wax. He believes that wax is perceived \\"by the intellect alone.\\" Therefore, he distinguishes between ordinary perception and judgment. When one understands the mathematical principles of the substance, such as its expansion under heat, figure and motion, the knowledge of the wax can be clear and distinct. If a substance such as wax can be known in this fashion, then the same must be of ourselves. The self, then, is not determined by what we sense of ourselves‚Äîthese hands, this head, these eyes‚Äîbut by simply the things one thinks. Thus, one \\"can't grasp anything more easily or plainly than [his] mind.\\"Descartes original meditation 2 translation Descartes concludes that he exists because he is a \\"thinking thing.\\" If he is the thing that can be deceived and can think and have thoughts, then he must exist. =III. Concerning God, That He Exists= Descartes proposed that there are three types of ideas: # Innate: ideas that are, and have always been, within us; # Fictitious (or Invented): ideas that come from our imagination; and # Adventitious: ideas that come from experiences of the world. Descartes argues that the idea of God is innate and placed in us by God, and rejects the possibility of such being invented or adventitious. Argument 1 # Something cannot come from nothing. # The cause of an idea must have at least as much formal reality as the idea has objective reality. # I have in me an idea of God. This idea has infinite objective reality. # I cannot be the cause of this idea, since I am not an infinite and perfect being. I don't have enough formal reality. Only an infinite and perfect being could cause such an idea. # So God‚Äîa being with infinite formal reality‚Äîmust exist (and be the source of my idea of God). # An absolutely perfect being is a good, benevolent being. # So God is benevolent... # So God would not deceive me, and would not permit me to err without giving me a way to correct my errors. Argument 2 # I exist. # My existence must have a cause. # The only possible ultimate causes are: #Not a.: If I had created myself, I would have made myself perfect. #Not b.: This does not solve the problem. If I am a dependent being, I need to be continually sustained by another. #Not c.: This leads to an infinite regress. #Not d.: The idea of perfection that exists in me cannot have originated from a non-perfect being. #Therefore, e. God exists. Descartes argued that he had a clear and distinct idea of God. In the same way that the cogito was self-evident, so too is the existence of God, as his perfect idea of a perfect being could not have been caused by anything less than a perfect being.http://www.wright.edu/cola/descartes/meditation3.html Descartes original meditation 3 translation =IV. Concerning the True and the False= The conclusions of the previous Meditations that \\"I\\" and \\"God\\" both exist lead to another problem: If God is perfectly good and the source of all that is, how is there room for error or falsehood? Descartes attempts to answer this question in Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity: > If I've got everything in me from God and He hasn't given me the ability to > make errors, it doesn't seem possible for me ever to be in error. The framework of his arguments center on the great chain of being, in which God's perfect goodness is relative to His perfect being. On the extreme opposite end of the scale is complete nothingness, which is also the most evil state possible. Thus, humans are an intermediary between these two extremes, being less \\"real\\" or \\"good\\" than God, but more \\"real\\" and \\"good\\" than nothingness. Thus, error (as a part of evil) is not a positive reality, it is only the absence of what is correct. In this way, its existence is allowed within the context of a perfectly inerrant God. > I find that I am \\"intermediate\\" between God and nothingness, between the > supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the creation of the supreme > entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into > error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity ‚Äî that > is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many > things ‚Äî it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in > itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I > understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to > do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the > truth is not infinite. Descartes also concedes two points that might allow for the possibility of his ability to make errors. First, he notes that it is very possible that his limited knowledge prevents him from understanding why God chose to create him so he could make mistakes. If he could see the things that God could see, with a complete and infinite scope, perhaps he would judge his ability to err as the best option. He uses this point to attack the Aristotelian structure of causes. The final cause described by Aristotle are the \\"what for\\" of an object, but Descartes claims that because he is unable to comprehend completely the mind of God, it is impossible to understand completely the \\"why\\" through science‚Äîonly the \\"how.\\" > I realize that I shouldn't be surprised at God's doing things that I can't > explain. I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I > sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. I know that my > nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, > and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things > whose reasons are unknown to me. On this ground alone, I regard the common > practice of explaining things in terms of their purposes to be useless in > physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's > purposes. Secondly, he considers the possibility that an apparent error at the individual level could be understood within the totality of creation as error free. > When asking whether God's works are perfect, I ought to look at all of them > together, not at one isolation. For something that seems imperfect when > viewed alone might seem completely perfect when regarded as having a place > in the world. Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven't > established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider > God's immense power, I can't deny that He has made ‚Äî or, in any case, that > He could have made ‚Äî many other things, and I must therefore view myself as > having a place in a universe. Lastly, Meditation IV attributes the source of error to a discrepancy between two divine gifts: understanding and free will. Understanding is given in an incomplete form, while will (by nature) can only be either completely given or not given at all. When he is presented with a certain amount of understanding and then chooses to act outside of that, he is in error. Thus, the gifts of God (understanding and will) both remain good and only the incorrect usage by him remains as error. > If I suspend judgement when I don't clearly and distinctly grasp what is > true, I obviously do right and am not deceived. But, if I either affirm or > deny in a case of this sort, I misuse my freedom of choice. If I affirm what > is false, I clearly err, and, if I stumble onto the truth, I'm still > blameworthy since the light of nature reveals that a perception of the > understanding should always precede a decision of the will. In these misuses > of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error. And this > deprivation, I maintain, lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes > from me ‚Äî not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will's > operation insofar as it derives from Him. =V. The Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists= Meditation V: Concerning the Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists begins with the stated purpose of expanding the \\"known items\\" of God and self to include outside material objects; but Descartes saves that for Meditation VI in lieu of something he deems more fundamental but in the same direction: a discussion concerning the ideas of those external items. Along the way, he advances another logical proof of God's existence. as translated by John Veitch in 1901 > Before asking whether any such objects exist outside me, I ought to consider > the ideas of these objects as they exist in my thoughts and see which are > clear and which confused. Descartes separates external objects into those that are clear and distinct and those that are confused and obscure. The former group consists of the ideas of extension, duration and movement. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined in a way that makes them false. For example, if the idea of a creature with the head of a giraffe, the body of a lion and tail of a beaver was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, the answer would have to be invented. But, no mathematical re- arrangement of a triangle could allow its three internal angles to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. In Descartes' formulation, this is a mathematical truth only pragmatically related to nature; the properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry remain mathematically certain. > I find in myself innumerable ideas of things which, though they may not > exist outside me, can't be said to be nothing. While I have some control > over my thoughts of these things, I do not make the things up: they have > their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a > mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does > exist or ever has existed outside my thought, the figure has a fixed nature > (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn't been produced by me > and isn't dependent of my mind. While thinking about the independence of these ideas of external objects, Descartes realizes that he is just as certain about God as he is about these mathematical ideas. He asserts that this is natural as the ideas of God are the only ideas that imply God's existence. He uses the example of a mountain and a valley. While one cannot picture a mountain without a valley, it's possible that these do not exist. However, the fact that one cannot conceive of God without existence inherently rules out the possibility of God's non- existence. Simply put, the argument is framed as follows: #God is defined as an infinitely perfect being. #Perfection includes existence. #So God exists. This ontological argument originated in the work of St. Anselm, the medieval Scholastic philosopher and theologian. While Descartes had already claimed to have confirmed God's existence through previous arguments, this one allows him to put to rest any discontent he might have had with his \\"distinct and clear\\" criteria for truth. With a confirmed existence of God, all doubt that what one previously thought was real and not a dream can be removed. Having made this realization, Descartes asserts that without this sure knowledge in the existence of a supreme and perfect being, assurance of any truth is impossible: > Thus I plainly see that the certainty and truth of all my knowledge derives > from one thing: my thought of the true God. Before I knew Him, I couldn't > know anything else perfectly. But now I can plainly and certainly know > innumerable things, not only about God and other mental beings, but also > about the nature of physical objects, insofar as it is the subject-matter of > pure mathematics. =VI. The Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body= In Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body, Descartes addresses the potential existence of material outside of the self and God. First, he asserts that such objects can exist simply because God is able to make them. Therefore, our assumption of the physical world outside of ourselves in non theoretical sense. > Insofar as they are the subject of pure mathematics, I now know at least > that they can exist, because I grasp them clearly and distinctly. For God > can undoubtedly make whatever I can grasp in this way, and I never judge > that something is impossible for Him to make unless there would be a > contradiction in my grasping the thing distinctly. Knowing that the existence of such objects is possible, Descartes then turns to the prevalence of mental images as proof. To do this, he draws a distinction between imagination and understanding‚Äîimagination being a non- linguistic \\"faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present to it‚Ä¶without intellection or conception,\\" which therefore exists like a mental photograph; and understanding (or apprehending) being something that is not necessarily pictured. He uses an example of this to clarify: as translated by John Veitch in 1901 > When I have a mental image of a triangle, for example, I don't just > understand that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also \\"look at\\" the > lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. And this is what I call > having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I understand > that it is a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a > triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or \\"look\\" at > them as though they were present.‚Ä¶ Thus I observe that a special effort of > mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to > conceiving or understanding (); and this special exertion of mind clearly > shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection ('). Descartes has still not given proof that such external objects exist. At this point, he has only shown that their existence could conveniently explain this mental process. To obtain this proof, he first reviews his premises for the Meditations‚Äîthat the senses cannot be trusted and what he is taught \\"by nature\\" does not have much credence. However, he views these arguments within a new context; after writing Meditation I, he has proved the existence of himself and of a perfect God. Thus, Descartes jumps quickly to proofs of the division between the body and mind and that material things exist: Proof of the body being distinct from the mind (mind‚Äìbody dualism) # It is possible for God to create anything I can clearly and distinctly perceive. # If God creates something to be independent of another, they are distinct from each other. # I clearly and distinctly understand my existence as a thinking thing (which does not require the existence of a body). # So God can create a thinking thing independently of a body. # I clearly and distinctly understand my body as an extended thing (which does not require a mind). # So God can create a body independently of a mind. # So my mind is a reality distinct from my body. # So I (a thinking thing) can exist without a body. Proof of the reality of external material things # I have a \\"strong inclination\\" to believe in the reality of external material things due to my senses. # God must have created me with this nature. # If independent material things do not exist, God is a deceiver. # But God is not a deceiver. # So material things exist and contain the properties essential to them. After using these two arguments to dispel solipsism and skepticism, Descartes seems to have succeeded in defining reality as being in three parts: God (infinite), minds, and material things (both finite). He closes by addressing natural phenomena that might appear to challenge his philosophy, such as phantom limbs, dreams, and dropsy. Objections and replies Descartes submitted his manuscript to many philosophers, theologians and a logician before publishing the Meditations. Their objections and his replies (many of which are quite extensive) were included in the first publication of the Meditations. In the Preface to the Meditations, Descartes asks the reader \\"not to pass judgment on the Meditations until they have been kind enough to read through all these objections and my replies to them.‚Äù Thus, this dialogue could be seen as an integral part of Descartes' views expressed in the Meditations. The seven objectors were, in order (of the sets as they were published): # The Dutch theologian Johannes Caterus (Johan de Kater). # Various \\"theologians and philosophers\\" gathered by Descartes' friend and principal correspondent, Friar Marin Mersenne. # The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. # The theologian and logician Antoine Arnauld. # The philosopher Pierre Gassendi ‚Äî Descartes wrote that this set of objections could be easily dismissed. # Another miscellany gathered by Mersenne. # The Jesuit Pierre Bourdin. They make many objections to Descartes‚Äô arguments and method. Some of the objections show that the objector has misunderstood the text, or willfully misquoted it, as in the last set of objections by the Jesuit. Descartes‚Äô response to these is often dismissive and curt. Other objections are more powerful, and in some cases it is controversial whether Descartes responds to them successfully (refer to Hobbes' objections). At times Descartes' demeanor suggests that he expected no criticisms would be forthcoming.Hobbes objections to Descartes' Meditations with Descartes' replies Some of the most powerful objections include the following: Objections to proof(s) of God‚Äôs existence: Objections to the epistemology: Objections to philosophy of mind: Elisabeth of Bohemia also corresponded with Descartes on the Meditations. She objected both to his description of the union between mind and body, and that virtue and moral truths seem to need to be grasped by something other than the intellect (despite Descartes' assertion that all truths must be grasped intellectually). Influence and legacy The historical impact of the six meditations has been divided. The first two meditations, which employed the skeptical methodic doubt and concluded that only the ego and its thoughts are indubitable, have had a huge impact in the history of philosophy. They are often considered as epoch-making for modernity, and an unavoidable first step for any modern philosophical thinking.Husserl (1929) Cartesian Meditations p.4 quotation: Arthur David Smith, author of the Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Husserl, claims that since Edmund Husserl usually refers only to \\"the first two\\" of the Meditations, therefore Husserl must have thought that they are the only part of Descartes' work with any philosophical importance at all.Smith, Arthur David (2003) Routledge philosophy guidebook to Husserl and the Cartesian meditations. pp. 12‚Äì3:  Republications  = Collected works in French and Latin = *Oeuvres de Descartes, edited by Charles Adam and Paul Tannery, Paris: L√©opold Cerf, 1897‚Äì1913, 13 volumes; new revised edition, Paris: Vrin- CNRS, 1964‚Äì1974, 11 volumes (the first 5 volumes contains the correspondence). =English translations= *The Philosophical Writings Of Descartes, 3 vols., translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988). *The Philosophical Works of Descartes, 2 vols, translated by Elizabeth S.

Now owned by Avery Weigh-Tronix, it is used for the manufacture of weighing machines. The early history of the Soho Foundry is of pivotal importance both to the history of the industrial revolution and to the study of the development of management theory. The Soho Foundry stood out from other factories of the day in the sophistication of its planning, its production processes and its management techniques; practising concepts that wouldn't become commonplace until a century later. Comparing its workings to the techniques of mass production and scientific management made famous by Henry Ford and Frederick Winslow Taylor in the United States in the early 20th century, the economist Eric Roll wrote \\"Neither Taylor, Ford nor any other modern experts devised anything in the way of plan that cannot be discovered at Soho before 1805\\". History The factory was built on the edge of the Birmingham Canal on land bought in 1795. The following year the foundry was open. =Organisation= The Soho Foundry was planned with a degree of sophistication unprecedented for a factory of its time. Its products were produced out of standardised interchangeable parts, reducing the need to supervise work as it was executed, simplifying stock control and enabling more efficient repair of faults for customers. Production processes were broken down into small tasks, enabling an extremely high degree of specialisation among workers ‚Äì one document from 1801, for example, describes how a team of four specific workers was \\"to be constantly employed in fitting nozzles\\". These tasks took place in a series of workshops spatially located along the flow of production, minimising the expense and time-wastage of the movement of materials through the works. The accounting procedures of the foundry bore a striking similarity to modern processes, with each of the three main operating departments - the Foundry Department which made cast iron parts, the Smithy Department which made wrought iron parts, and the Fitting Department which machined the parts and assembled them together - being operated as separate profit centres. The Soho Foundry was also innovative in the field of personnel management, setting up executive development programmes, sickness benefit schemes and welfare programmes. =Later development= Trade advertisement from the 'James Watt & Co.' era By 1840 James Watt Jr. owned the factory after the death of the founding Boulton and Watt. He died in 1848 and his place was taken by H. W. Blake and the name changed from Soho Foundry to James Watt & Co.. In 1857 the screw engines for the steamship SS Great Eastern were built at the foundry. In 1860 a new mint was started at the Foundry, the Manufactory having closed in April 1850 by Matthew's grandson, Matthew Piers Watt Boulton. In 1861 tests were performed at the Soho Foundry for the London Pneumatic Despatch Company. In 1895 W & T Avery Ltd. acquired the Foundry as a going concern. In 1912, the manager of the company William Edward Hipkins, died at the sinking of Titanic while he was travelling as a first class passenger. He was 55 and his body was not recovered. Today It is now the home of Avery Weigh-Tronix and Avery Berkel, who make weighing scales. The site includes William Murdoch's cottage and overlooks Black Patch Park. There was a small museum there, open only by appointment, but is now closed. The grade II listed Pooley gates, of cast iron, are marked with \\"a Liver bird above ropework draped with cloth, flanked by nautical symbols including oars, flags and bugles, ships' wheels and intersecting dolphins\\". A plaque reads: \\"These gates were cast by Henry Pooley and Son about 1840 for the Sailors' Home, Liverpool. The Avery and Pooley Foundries were amalgamated in 1931\\". There was an active campaign to return these gates to Liverpool, resulting in the approval by Sandwell Council in March 2011 of an application to return them. After restoration the gates were returned to Liverpool on 8 August 2011 and were re- erected under the name \\"The Sailors Home Gateway\\" in the pedestrian section of Paradise Street in Liverpool One, close to the original site of the Sailors' Home.BBC News - return of gatesLiverpoolConfidential.com - return of gates The building is a Grade II* listed building. The gates and adjacent canal bridge are Grade II listed. The oldest working steam engine, built here, is the Smethwick Engine built to recover water used in the nearby canal locks at Smethwick Summit, and now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum.

The company is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. Its sub-brands include Vy Buss coach services, CargoNet freight trains through and the Swedish train transport company T√•gkompaniet. In 2009 NSB carried 52 million train passengers and 104 million bus passengers. On 24 April 2019, passenger train and bus services were rebranded by as Vy. The company was established on 1 December 1996, when the former Norwegian State Railways (1883‚Äì1996) was split into the new NSB, the infrastructure company the Norwegian National Rail Administration and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. In 2002 the freight operations were split to the subsidiary CargoNet, and the maintenance department became Mantena. History Former NSB logo (2005‚Äì2019) On 1 December 1996 the largest structural change in Norwegian railway history in the 20th century occurred. The old Norwegian State Railways was split into three separate governmental agencies. The ownership, maintenance and construction of the track was transformed to the newly created government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration while a new Norwegian Railway Inspectorate was created to supervise all railway operations in the country. NSB was renamed NSB BA and created as a limited company, wholly owned by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Also, NSB was made a concern, with NSB Biltrafikk (now Vy Buss) and NSB Eiendom (later ROM Eiendom, in 2017 succeeded by Bane NOR Eiendom) made subsidiaries of NSB. In 1998 the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened, replacing the old Oslo Airport, Fornebu that had been too small since the 1980s. Part of the political compromise to build the new airport was a twofold consequence for NSB. First of all it was decided that the new airport was to have an as environmentally friendly ground infrastructure as possible, resulting in the decision to build a high speed railway on the stretch from Oslo Central Station to the airport, which would only take 19 minutes. But at the same time it was a political demand that the new airport not cost the taxpayers any money, and it was decided that the entire construction was to be financed with loans. The result was that the airport was to be financed, built and operated by the Civil Aviation Administration subsidiary Oslo Lufthavn AS while the rail connection was to be financed, built and operated by the NSB subsidiary NSB Gardermobanen. But problems arose during the construction of the Gardermoen Line because of a leak in the tunnel Romerike Tunnel, resulting in major budget overruns and a delay in the opening of the tunnel. Still, Norway's first high speed railway line opened on time on 8 October 1998 at the same time as the new airport, though the Romerike Tunnel was not opened until 22 October 1999, more than a year after its scheduled opening. The service is operated using 16 custom built Class 71 electric multiple units, with a capacity for 168 passengers and maximum speed of . NSB tried to modernize itself in the late 1990s through the acquisition of new rolling stock and a new brand image. The first stock to be delivered were 22 El 18 electric locomotives. These were to take over the passenger train traffic in Southern Norway while the El 16s and El 14s were moved to the freight division and the El 17s were scrapped, relegated to shunting or sold to the Fl√•m Line. The new locomotives were capable of speeds up to . For the diesel lines NSB attempted to buy 12 Di 6 from Siemens, but had to return them after they failed to operate sufficiently in the Northern Norwegian cold. NSB also decided to re- brand itself with three district brands: NSB Signatur (express trains), NSB Agenda (regional trains) and NSB Puls (local trains). At the same time NSB ordered new electric multiple units, first of all for the new Airport Express Train service, Class 71. This was followed up with 16 new Signatur trains of Class 73 that were to be used on the express services on the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the S√∏rlandet Line and equipped with tilting technology. This was an attempt to create a high speed railway service using existing rail track, though the operating times between Oslo and the termini were only reduced by about 10 minutes. These trains were painted blue and grey, and were the first non-red trains to be operated by NSB in decades. At the same time NSB announced the introduction of the Agenda concept, that was to replace the NSB InterCity Express services and the diesel services. While the Class 70s were simply repainted, the diesel services on the Nordland Line, the Rauma Line and the R√∏ros Line were upgrades with 15 new Class 93 units in 2001, though criticized for lack of comfort, have increased the speed on the railways. NSB also discontinued night train services on the Rauma Line and R√∏ros Line. NSB also received, starting in 2002 36 new electrical local trains, Class 72. These were painted grey/green (for the use of the brand name Puls) and were put in the Oslo Commuter Rail and J√¶ren Commuter Rail. NSB has now discontinued the use of brand names on its rail products. By 2002 the Bondevik's Second Cabinet wanted to further deregulate the Norwegian railway sector, and made NSB a limited company NSB AS on 1 July. NSB had been through a process of making the company more of a corporation, with the IT section made the subsidiary Arrive and the maintenance transformed to Mantena. NSB also purchased part of the Swedish T√•gkompaniet while the old freight train section NSB Gods was transformed to CargoNet. 45% of the subsidiary was then sold to the Statens J√§rnv√§gar successor Green Cargo. In 2004 the government also split NSB Gardermobanen in two, deleting the companies debt, transferring the track it owned to Jernbaneverket and the train operations to a new, government-owned enterprise, the Airport Express Train. On 24 April 2019 NSB was renamed Vygruppen and rebranded as Vy.NSB and Nettbuss merge to become Vy International Railway Journal 13 March 2019NSB Group rebrands as Vy Railway Gazette International 25 April 2019 According to a survey by the Language Council of Norway, the name change was only supported by 7% of Norwegians.\\"Folk flest misliker navnene Vy, Equinor og Oslo Met,\\" Aftenposten, 2 July 2019 Services Vy operates with three main types of passenger rail transport: intercity trains, regional trains and commuter trains. =Inter- city services= Long-haul electric passenger trains services are offered on the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line, and the S√∏rland Line. The four day trains are operated with Class 73 electric multiple units (formerly branded as Signatur) or with traditional locomotive hauled trains (electric locomotives El18 and coaches Class 7). A night train service with WLAB2 sleeping coaches is also offered on these lines. On the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Bod√∏ Vy operates using diesel locomotives Di4, making it the only line still serviced by such for regular passenger service. =Regional services= Vy has two regional rail services. All regional trains are to receive the new livery of red and grey. NSB has previously used the brand name Agenda on its regional services. Regional services use Class 70 (Skien‚ÄìLillehammer) and Class 73b (Oslo S ‚Äì Halden ‚Äì (Gothenburg)). The service is provided hourly along the Trunk Line, the Vestfold Line and the √òstfold Line. The trains running between Lillehammer and Skien serve Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, providing an alternative to the Airport Express Train. On the non-electrified Mer√•ker Line, Nordland Line, Rauma Line and R√∏ros Line. Vy operates regional services using Class 92 and Class 93 diesel multiple units. Vy operates the following routes: * Bergen-Oslo (Bergen Line) *Trondheim‚ÄìBod√∏ (Norway-North-Line) * Fauske- Narvik (NSB-Bus)- Stockholm (Train) (Sweden) * Narvik-Troms√∏ (NSB-Bus) * Trondheim‚Äì√ñstersund (Sweden) (Mer√•ker Line) * Trondheim‚ÄìR√∏ros (R√∏ros Line) * Trondheim‚ÄìOslo (Dovre Line) * R√∏ros‚ÄìHamar (R√∏ros Line) * Domb√•s‚Äì√Öndalsnes (Rauma Line) =Commuter services= Around the cities of Arendal, Bergen, Oslo, Skien, Stavanger and Trondheim Vy operates commuter train services using Class 69 and Class 72 electric multiple units and Class 92 diesel multiple units. The services usually have hourly or semi-hourly frequency. NSB tried using the brand name Puls for the commuter trains, and have painted some of the trains green. The Puls brand has been discontinued. The Oslo Commuter Rail provides the following services, with Class 69 and Class 72: * (Spikkestad)‚ÄìAsker‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìLillestr√∏m (Trunk Line ) * Drammen‚ÄìSk√∏yen‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìJessheim‚ÄìDal (Trunk Line and Drammen Line) * Eidsvoll‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìDrammen‚ÄìKongsberg (Trunk Line and S√∏rland Line) * Asker‚ÄìLillestr√∏m‚Äì√Örnes‚ÄìKongsvinger (Kongsvinger Line) * Stabekk‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìSki (√òstfold Line) * Stabekk‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìMoss (√òstfold Line) * Sk√∏yen‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìMysen‚Äì(Rakkestad) (√òstfold Line) Other commuter train services: * The J√¶ren Commuter Rail: Stavanger‚ÄìEgersund (S√∏rland Line) with Class 72 * The Bergen Commuter Rail: Bergen‚ÄìVoss‚ÄìMyrdal (Bergen Line) with Class 69 * The Tr√∏ndelag Commuter Rail: Lerkendal‚ÄìTrondheim‚ÄìSteinkjer (Nordland Line) with diesel Class 92. * Porsgrunn‚ÄìNotodden (Bratsberg Line) with Y1 class railcar * Arendal‚ÄìNelaug (Arendal Line) with Class 69 Services on Gj√∏vik Line were in 2005 transferred to NSB Gj√∏vikbanen (now Vy Gj√∏vikbanen) after the NSB subsidiary had won a public tender bid for a ten-year public service obligation contract with the Norwegian Ministry of Transportation and Communication. The Norwegian Minister of Transportation and Communications, Liv Signe Navarsete (Centre Party), has announced that the present government (as of 2006) will discontinue the previous government's announcements to put more rail line operations on public tender. Rolling stock Class 75 local train in its current \\"Vy\\" livery NSB Class 73 long-distance train NSB Class 70 long-distance train NSB Class 93 local train The Norwegian passenger train division has a fleet of 36 Class 72 and 82 Class 69 electric multiple units (EMU) and 14 Class 92 diesel multiple units (DMU) for commuter services. The company has a further 22 Class 73 and 16 Class 70 EMUs and Class 93 DMUs for regional and intercity trains, which are also provided by 22 El 18 and 5 Di 4 locomotives which haul Class 5 and Class 7 passenger cars. Vy receives subsidies to operate unprofitable route from its owner, while services on the Gj√∏vik Line have been made subject to public service obligations, which is operated by Vy's subsidiary Vy Gj√∏vikbanen. During the 1990s NSB modernised their rolling stock, expanding their fleet of multiple units and retiring many of the traditional locomotive-hauled trains. Most of the locomotives were sold to the freight company CargoNet AS, but the models El18 and Di4 remain to haul passenger trains. Some of the new trains were plagued with troubles, in particular a brand new Class 73 derailed at low speed at Nelaug in 2000 because of an axle breaking due to metal fatigue. As of 2005 however, these trains have been performing satisfactorily. In August 2008, NSB announced it had ordered 50 new five-car electric multiple units of the Class 74 and 75. These will be used for local service in the Greater Oslo area (24 sets) and also regional service in southern Norway (26 sets). The delivery is scheduled for 2012 but delayed because of accident during testing, by that time much of the rail network is expected to be upgraded to double track, enabling an increase in frequency. The contract which is worth approximately 840 mill. Swiss francs gives NSB an option to buy an additional 100 sets. These trains have been specifically modified to operate in Norwegian climate and have a maximum speed of . =Locomotives= *2 Di 2 class diesel shunters *5 Di 4 class diesel locomotives, used mostly on the Nordland Line. *9 El 17 class electric locomotives, three used for shunting and six run on the Fl√•m Line. *22 El 18 class electric locomotives, used on all main electrified lines. =Electric multiple units= *80 Class 69 class 2-car or 3-car commuter trains, used around Oslo, Bergen and Arendal. *16 Class 70 class 4-car intercity (medium distance) trains, used around Oslo. *36 Class 72 class 4-car commuter trains, used around Oslo and Stavanger. *16 Class 73 class 4-car long-distance trains, used on the Dovre Line and S√∏rlandet Line. *6 Class 73b class 4-car intercity version of the Class 73 used on √òstfold Line. *50 Class 74 intercity trains and Class 75 commuter trains, based on the Stadler FLIRT has been introduced.

For a time the largest non-national library in Europe,; it closed on 29 June 2013 and was replaced by the Library of Birmingham. The building was demolished in 2016, after 41 years, as part of the redevelopment of Paradise Circus by Argent Group. Designed by architect John Madin in the brutalist style, the library was part of an ambitious development project by Birmingham City Council to create a civic centre on its new Inner Ring Road system; however, for economic reasons significant parts of the master plan were not completed, and quality was reduced on materials as an economic measure. Two previous libraries occupied the adjacent site before Madin's library opened in 1974. The previous library, designed by John Henry Chamberlain, opened in 1883 and featured a tall clerestoried reading room. It was demolished in 1974 after the new library had opened. Despite the original vision not being fully implemented, the library gained architectural praise as an icon of British brutalism with its stark use of concrete, bold geometry, inverted ziggurat sculptural form and monumental scale. Its style was seen at the time as a symbol of social progressivism. Based on this, English Heritage applied but failed twice for the building to gain listed status. However, due to strong opposition from Birmingham City Council the building gained immunity from listing until 2016. In 2010‚Äì11, Central Library was the second-most visited library in the country, with 1,197,350 visitors. Earlier libraries Central Library after the 1879 fire J. H. Chamberlain's rebuilt Central Library of 1882, demolished in 1974. The tall clerestoried reading room of the 1882 library. The first Central Library occupied a site to the south of Edmund Street and west of the Town Hall. The site had been acquired from the Birmingham and Midland Institute (BMI) in 1860 after the construction of their own building in 1857 on the corner of Paradise Street and Ratcliff Place. The BMI building was to include a library, but under the Public Libraries Act 1850 a referendum took place on the creation of a municipal library. After the first vote failed, a second one passed in 1860 causing the BMI and the Corporation to cooperate on the joint site. E. M. Barry was the architect for the BMI building and it was hoped he could be retained as the architect for the adjoining library, but his plans were deemed too expensive for the Corporation. Martin & Chamberlain's plans were approved in October 1862 for a tender price of ¬£8,600 with E. M. Barry's classical facade retained in the design. The Lending Library was opened on 6 September 1865 and the Reference Library was opened just over a year later on 26 October 1866. The chief librarian at the time of opening was John Davies Mullins. Initial use of the library was so heavy that the need for an extension was agreed in 1872 but deferred until 1878. On 11 January 1879 a fire broke out behind a wooden partition serving as a temporary wall during building operations. The fire caused extensive damage, with only 1,000 volumes saved from a stock of 50,000. Plans to rebuild the library after the fire had been approved as early as May 1879. The library was rebuilt on the same site by J. H. Chamberlain in a Lombardic Renaissance style with a tall clerestoried Reading Room. At a cost of ¬£54,975 the second Central Library opened on 1 June 1882. As the number of books increased, the Council resolved in 1938 that a new library was an \\"urgent necessity\\", but the outbreak of World War II meant that it was not until 1960, and the development of a new Inner Ring Road through the site of the old library, that a general specification was agreed. The library and the BMI building were demolished (the BMI moving to premises a block to the east), and the site is now part of the Birmingham Conservatoire and its gardens. The 1970s Central Library was constructed on a site originally occupied by Mason Science College and Liberal Club. Architecture The library under construction in 1973. The new Central Library opened on 12 January 1974. It was designed by John Madin, a Birmingham-based architect.Merlin Fulcher \\"Obituary: John Madin (1924-2012)\\" , AJ Mobile (Architect's Journal), 11 January 2012 Its inverted ziggurat form was a powerful example of the Brutalist style. With the Rotunda and the Alpha Tower, it became one of Birmingham's key Modernist buildings. Madin designed the Central Library as part of a large civic centre scheme on the newly created Paradise Circus site. Originally planned to be built alongside the library was a School of Music, Drama Centre, Athletic Institute, offices, shops, public house, a car park with 500 spaces and a bus interchange. The collection of civic buildings were all to be connected by high level walkways and the network of galleries which bridge the roads. The School of Music and a public house (The Yardbird) were the only other buildings in the original plans to be built and the high level walkways were never completed. One of the reading rooms in the Reference Library The Central Library consisted of two elements: the extrovert lending library and the introvert reference library. The lending library was designed for heavy use and short visits. It formed a wing to the reference library and was of three storeys with a curved fa√ßade facing the Town Hall. The reference library was an eight-storey square block designed around an open atrium above a public square that was designed to be entered from four sides. Above the square floated the cantilevered floors of the library in a distinctive inverted ziggurat formation. The designers drew inspiration for the design from Antonio Sant'Elia's drawings of Casa a gradinata, and Marcel Breuer's 1928 scheme for a hospital at Elberfeld, Indiana; while another source of inspiration was Leslie Martin's Bodleian Law Library in Oxford. It has also been suggested that they were influenced by the similar design for Boston City Hall, but a member of Madin's design team said they had only seen this design after the library was complete. The central atrium was completely glazed behind deep concrete balconies; this arrangement was to make it conducive to study. Although there was good natural light, the design was an early recognition of solar gain and the damage it can cause to books. The large windows of the reference library face inwards to reduce traffic noise from the Inner Ring road. On the outside the windows were high level narrow strips with black anodised window frames. The space below the central atrium of the library was designed to define a civic square with gardens, pools, waterfalls and fountains, and potentially to form an open-air exhibition space. Six pools were to be placed in and around this square. Madin also designed the semi- circular amphitheatre around the Chamberlain Memorial in Chamberlain Square to frame the entrance to the library and the new civic square. The library from Chamberlain Square in 1983 The structure was supported on a square set of twelve reinforced concrete columns, built over the Inner Ring road and the uncompleted bus interchange. The bus bays imposed a 36 ft pier spacing on the main block, and led to the standardization of a 1 ft 6in module for the design. Concrete was strongly expressed within the building, the external finishes to structural elements being unclad reinforced concrete. The walls were ribbed, and the locally graded round aggregate was exposed by abrasive blasting. The floors were made of precast concrete coffered units over which a reinforced concrete floor was cast. For the cladding Madin offered the council a choice of Portland Stone or Travertine Marble to align with the adjacent civic buildings. A third, cheaper option was pre-cast concrete with Hoptonwood limestone and Derbyshire spar aggregate with white cement: this was offered by Alan Maudsley, the City Architect, and accepted by the council as an economy measure. The central atrium showing one of the six pools; this area later became Paradise Forum The entrance hall, which was double height between the lending and reference libraries, was entirely glazed on the side facing the atrium ‚Äì an early example of a freestanding wall made of toughened glass. Before later developments the wall allowed the entrance to be flooded with light and provided views of the Town Hall from the escalators. The library aimed to provide open access to all its 900,000 volumes. No basement was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library and a tall book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep the height of the building low, so it did not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low ceiling height of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces. The furniture for the library was specified by the architects, with a preference for oak veneer book stacks and black linoleum floor covering. When built, the Central Library provided approximately 250,000 ft¬≤ of floor space, making it the largest non-national municipal library in Europe. It was specifically designed for a long life and to stand hard wear with low maintenance costs. =Later developments= The curved facade of the Lending Library, circa 1975 The council failed to implement the original plan for Paradise Circus. Spending cuts led to the council's decision to sell off the land surrounding the library, ending the vision of a publicly financed and owned civic centre occupying the entire site. The 200 seat Library Theatre was built between the School of Music and the reference library block in 1983-86\\\\. The theatre was a design and build scheme by Henry Boot Projects. Although the design was in Madin's original plans, Madin did not approve of the design and build method and subsequently had no involvement in the building. Chamberlain House and the Copthorne Hotel were built to the west of the library in 1985-87 by Leonard J. Multon & Partners with wedge shaped ends. To the north of the library, where an Athletic Institute was originally to stand, a six-storey office block was built in 1988-89 by Leonard J. Multon & Partners. A footbridge connecting the library with Centenary Square was added as part of improvements to the square in 1988-89\\\\. The atrium was enclosed with a glass roof and screens by the City Architect's Department in 1989-91. The space below was named Paradise Forum, originally proposed as an alfresco eating and entertainment area, but eventually leased to property companies who sublet the units to shops and fast food outlet tenants. The uncompleted bus interchange became service areas for the tenants of Paradise Forum. In 1999 the whole of Paradise Forum was sold off to Argent Group. In 1999, a member of the public was almost hit by a small piece of concrete that fell from a cladding panel. Concerns over the condition of the pre-cast cladding panels required the installation of netting to retain any further erosion. The entrance from Chamberlain Square was altered by the city's Urban Design team in 2001, creating a lobby and eliminating the effect of the original tall entrance hall. In July 2010, the east side of the lending library was decorated with painted birds, the work of Lucy McLauchlan. The appearance of the library building was criticised, mostly on account of the staining of the cladding panels which were originally white and were never cleaned. Prince Charles, in his 1988 television documentary and book A Vision Of Britain, described the building as resembling \\"a place where books are incinerated, not kept\\".Alastair Jamieson \\"The Prince of Wales on architecture: his 10 'monstrous carbuncles'\\", telegraph.co.uk, 13 May 2009 In October 2011 the World Monuments Fund included the Central Library on its watch list of significant buildings at risk.2012 World Monuments Watch: British Brutalism, World Monuments Fund, Spring 2012. Closure and demolition Under demolition in March 2016 Demolished, July 2016 Birmingham City Council had long planned to move library services away from the Central Library to leave the building free for redevelopment of Paradise Circus. The Paradise Circus site was sold by the Council in 1998 to Argent Group, this spelt an end to the Central Library.Argent website In 2004 an initial plan to move to a building designed by Richard Rogers in Eastside did not materialise. Instead, a site in Centenary Square, 150m to the west of the existing building, was chosen in 2007; and subsequently the new Library of Birmingham was built and opened on 3 September 2013. In the intervening years Argent Group produced plans for the Paradise Circus site which did not include retention of the library building. In response to potential demolition English Heritage applied on two occasions for the building to be listed. On both occasions the library was refused status as a listed building after lobbying from Birmingham City Council. In February 2011 the library received a 5-year Certificate of Immunity from Listing after an application from Birmingham City Council, which meant it could not be protected from demolition until 2016. The library closed on 29 June 2013 and books and archives were moved across to the Library of Birmingham. Planning Application 2012/05116/PA was approved by the City Council on 8 February 2013. The commercial outlets of Paradise Forum closed in January 2015, and the library site was fenced off except for the pedestrian route linking Chamberlain and Centenary Squares. Internal demolition of the library took place in the Summer and Autumn of 2015. On 1 November 2015, Paradise Forum was closed to pedestrians and Chamberlain Square was fenced off in preparation for external demolition. The first visible external demolition to the main library building began on 6 November 2015. On 15 November 2015 the road tunnel beneath the library permanently closed to traffic for demolition to progress. On 14 December 2015 the first exterior concrete panels to the reference library were removed to mark the start of significant exterior demolition. On 28 January 2016 the curved facade of the lending library began to be demolished and completed on 25 April 2016. The glass roof of the internal atrium was removed on 26 February 2016. At the beginning of August 2016 the link bridge to the museum was removed and the majority of the library building was demolished. Campaigns to save the building Several campaign groups were set up to save the library building from demolition. Groups such as Friends of Central Library, the Twentieth Century Society, English Heritage and World Monuments Fund supported the retention of the library. English Heritage applied twice in 2002 and 2007 for the Central Library to be listed. On both occasions the Minister for Culture refused the application. On the second occasion, Margaret Hodge, the Minister for Culture, stated that \\"the building did not have sufficient historical or architectural importance to merit listing\\". In 2009, following an application from Birmingham City Council for a Certificate of Immunity from Listing, Margaret Hodge signed the certificate which would be in place until 2016. In 2011 the World Monuments Fund included the library on its watch list along with Preston bus station stating that the buildings were dramatically sited and uncompromising in their stark use of concrete and powerfully structural forms. They brought a sense of the monumental to the British urban landscape at the time of their construction and remain architectural icons. It was hoped that placing these buildings on the watch list would open dialogue into their protection and alternatives for adaptive reuse. Preston bus station was saved from demolition and listed at Grade II in September 2013; however dialogue on the demolition of the Central Library did not progress. A fresh appreciation of the library began to emerge as the Council declared their intention to demolish it. The movement was led by artists and writers mainly of the 1960s generation who had grown up with it. Jonathan Meades appreciated the \\"guts and attack\\" of the library, and spoke negatively of the Council's policies, stating \\"you don‚Äôt get a car and never get it serviced\\". Brutalist architecture was becoming more appreciated in the 21st Century with the listing of Preston bus station, Trellick Tower and the rejuvenation of Park Hill in Sheffield. Books celebrating brutalism were published and television shows featuring brutalist buildings began to feature with greater regularity. The Central Library was chosen to represent the location of MI5 HQ in BBC series The Game. Friends of Central Library presented an alternative plan to the Council and its developers which retained the library at the centre of the Paradise Circus scheme. It argued that the library could be used for a range of alternative uses and demolition after 40 years went against all principles of sustainability. However Birmingham City Council, Birmingham Civic Society, CABE and Argent Group strongly opposed any plans to retain the library and consequently the battle was lost.

Climate The climate of Positano thanks to its position is very mild, of the Mediterranean type; the winters are very warm with minimum temperatures that almost never fall below 6 degrees, while the summers are long, warm and sunny but often refreshed by the sea breeze. Thanks to the mild temperature and the beauty of the landscape, Positano has been a holiday resort since the time of the Roman Empire, as evidenced by the discovery of a villa in the bay. Typical are the many staircases that from the top of the village connect the upper districts with the valley area. The main beaches are Spiaggia Grande, Fornillo, La Porta, Fiumicello, Arienzo, San Pietro, Laurito and Remmese, some of which can also be reached by sea. History The first evidence of a settlement in Positano dates back to Prehistory, more precisely to the Upper Paleolithic in which the \\"Grotto La Porta\\" was frequented by peoples of gatherers and hunters. This small cave, located at 120 m. o.s.l. and at 10 m. on the highway, it was a very wide time of which it is still possible to distinguish the terminal part and two niches. In 1955, Antonio M. Radmilli (University of Pisa) organizes several surveys to identify prehistoric visits, both on the surface and in some caves. During the excavations, several fossils emerged, some of which are malacological like shells of molluscs, while the fauna is represented by the remains of mammals (wild boar, ibex, deer and roe deer), birds, amphibians and fish. The findings made it to be assumed that the people who frequented the caves had an economy based mainly on the collection of molluscs, while hunting for birds and mammals was rather marginal [1]. Despite the tradition linked to the myth of the Sirens, there is no news regarding a Greek presence on the coast of Positano. The first archaeological evidence dates back to the first century. BC, when luxurious Roman villas were built on the coast of the Sorrento Peninsula. In Positano, one occupied the bay and the other extended on the island of the Long Rooster, \\"a typical example of how even more hidden spaces of a wild coast were used in the Claudian age without even respecting the rocks that, according to legend , would have served as the home of the sirens [2] \\". These villas belong to the \\"dispersed type\\", that is, formed by different structures not grouped together, delimited by gardens [3]. The names of the owners are not yet known, but they are certainly elitist contexts. The Villa di Positano is described for the first time by Karl Weber in 1758, who then oversaw the excavations in Herculaneum and Pompeii. At the beginning of the 1900s, Mingazzini and Pfister [4] carried out some essays to better understand the structure of both the bay of Positano and the Gallo Lungo. Maiuri [5] describes some remains, still visible in the 1960s, as a peristilium of stuccoed brick columns. The complex has been the subject of systematic excavations since 2003, which have affected the area below the Oratory of the Santa Maria Assunta Church and, the site was inaugurated on 18 July 2018, with the name of MAR (Roman Archaeological Museum) Santa Maria Assunta Positano. Positano became a wealthy market port from the 15th to 17th century and has only continued to grow in popularity over time. Back then they traded food such as fish and other resources. Positano was a port of the Amalfi Republic in medieval times, and prospered during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the town had fallen on hard times. More than half the population emigrated, mostly to America. Positano was a relatively poor fishing village during the first half of the twentieth century. It began to attract large numbers of tourists in the 1950s, especially after John Steinbeck published his essay about Positano in Harper's Bazaar in May, 1953: \\"Positano bites deep\\", Steinbeck wrote. \\"It is a dream place that isn‚Äôt quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone.\\" Main sights The beach of Positano. Church of Santa Maria Assunta The church of Santa Maria Assunta features a dome made of majolica tiles as well as a thirteenth-century Byzantine icon of a black Madonna. According to local legend, the icon had been stolen from Byzantium and was being transported by pirates across the Mediterranean. A storm had blown up in the waters opposite Positano and the frightened sailors heard a voice on board saying \\"Posa, posa!\\" (\\"Put down! Put down!\\"). The icon was unloaded and carried to the fishing village and the storm abated. The Marina Grande beach is at the base of the cliff side town of Positano and is the most recognized beach in the town. Other popular beaches include Fornillo beach and Arienzo beach.  Culture  Positano has been featured in several films, including Only You (1994), and Under the Tuscan Sun (2003), as well as more recently in Kath & Kimderella (2012) and being mentioned in the 2009 musical film Nine in the song \\"Cinema Italiano\\". It has also hosted the annual Cartoons on the Bay Festival, at which Pulcinella Awards for excellence in animation are presented. From July 1967 and through most of the 1970s, Positano was home to singer-songwriter Shawn Phillips and where most of his best-known work was composed. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards from The Rolling Stones wrote the song \\"Midnight Rambler\\" in the cafes of Positano while on vacation. Renowned director and producer Franco Zeffirelli owned the Villa Treville in Positano, where he took residence over a 35-year period and hosted a coterie of literati and stars of the stage and screen. He hired his friend, Renzo Mongiardino, who collaborated on many of his theater and opera projects, to design the exquisite interiors which reflect the local design sensibilities and craftsmanship. The Villa Treville has since been converted into a five- star boutique hotel. German pianist Wilhelm Kempff made Positano his summer retreat and there he taught a summer course on the Beethoven piano sonatas and concerti. Since his death in 1991, the Beethoven Kurse has continued under the organization of the Wilhelm Kempff Kulturstiftungng, having had as teachers Gerhard Oppitz and John O'Conor. Today tourism is by far the major industry. Positano is also very popular for Limoncello and \\"L'Albertissimo\\", an alcoholic tipple that can only be found at a small stall at the main harbor. The town's rapid growth from a small fishing village to an international destination is credited to the rise of the tourism industry. In addition to the beaches, cliffs, and historic sites, clothing stores and restaurants are scattered throughout Positano, attracting tourists from around the world. To complete the picture, natural lemon, orange, and olive groves grow prominently across the cliffside town. The produce is often sold in fresh markets around the city. Transportation Positano can be reached by the SS163 Amalfitana national road, or by the SP425 provincial road. The nearest airports are the Napoli-Capodichino (NAP) and the Salerno-Pontecagnano Airport (QSR) and they have shuttle buses to destinations across the Amalfi Coast, including Positano. Ferries link Positano to other towns including Capri, Naples, Salerno, and Sorrento for transportation. The Sita bus links Positano to Amalfi and Sorrento. Positano seen from seaside.

It was established in 1940 in Yan'an, Shaanxi. It is a major research university under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. BIT is a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University. As a member of Project 985 and Project 211, it is a leading multi discipline university given priority sponsorship from the Chinese government, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, the Ministry of Education (MOST) and the Beijing metropolitan Government. History =Yan'an period (1940‚Äì1946)= Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences Xu Teli, educationist and second president of BIT (1941-1943) Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) has its origins in the Yan'an Research Academy of Natural Sciences (Âª∂ÂÆâËá™ÁÑ∂ÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂Èô¢), which was established in May 1939 in Yan'an, Shaanxi, in northwest China by the Chinese Communist Party, with the aim of training science and engineering professionals. In January 1940 when China was undergoing the most difficult phase of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reformed Yan'an Research Academy of Natural Sciences into Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences (Âª∂ÂÆâËá™ÁÑ∂ÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢). The major mission of the Academy was to assist the industrial development in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. As the first science and engineering university founded by Chinese Communist Party, Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences opened on 1 September 1940. Li Fuchun, the secretary of the CPC Committee for Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region was appointed as the first president, and was succeeded by educationist Xu Teli. During the founding period, Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences received great support from international organizations and individuals, including Rewi Alley. In March 1943, Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences was merged into the newly founded University of Yan'an (Âª∂ÂÆâÂ§ßÂ≠¶), and was named as School of Natural Sciences, University of Yan'an (Âª∂ÂÆâÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ëá™ÁÑ∂ÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢). According to the situation of the war, University of Yan'an prepared to move the north and northeast of China by the end of 1945. =Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region period (1946‚Äì1949)= In January 1946, the School of Natural Sciences moved to Zhangjiakou, but failed to continue its journey to the northeast of China due to the urgent situation of the war. The Central Bureau of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region decided to settle the School at Zhangjiakou, and merged it with Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region College of Technology (ÊôãÂØüÂÜÄËæπÂå∫Â∑•Áßë‰∏ìÈó®Â≠¶Ê†°) to form Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region College (ÊôãÂØüÂÜÄËæπÂå∫Â∑•‰∏ö‰∏ìÈó®Â≠¶Ê†°). At the end of the same year, Shanxi- Chahar-Hebei Border Region Institute moved to Bailing Village, Jianping County, Hebei, and merged with Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Academy of Railway (ÊôãÂØüÂÜÄËæπÂå∫ÈìÅË∑ØÂ≠¶Èô¢) to form Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region College of Industry and Transportation (ÊôãÂØüÂÜÄÂ∑•‰∏ö‰∫§ÈÄöÂ≠¶Èô¢), but remained respective identity. One year later, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Institute moved to Jingxing County, renamed as Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bureau of Industry College of Technology (ÊôãÂØüÂÜÄËæπÂå∫Â∑•‰∏öÂ±ÄÂ∑•‰∏öÂ≠¶Ê†°). In August 1948, it was then merged with Institute of Technology, Northern University (ÂåóÊñπÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â∑•Â≠¶Èô¢) to form Institute of Technology, North China University (ÂçéÂåóÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â∑•Â≠¶Èô¢). = Institute of Technology, North China University period (1949‚Äì1952) = Just before the established of People's Republic of China, Institute of Technology, North China University made its final move to Beijing, and confirmed its academic focus to industrial development for the newly founded People's Republic of China. It was administrated by Ministry of Industry, and became the first university specialized in heavy industry related subjects since the foundation of the new China. The home campus of Sino-French University (‰∏≠Ê≥ïÂ§ßÂ≠¶) and its Department of Mathematics, Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry were merged into Institute of Technology, North China University in October 1950, which effectively provided enough accommodations, laboratories, libraries, as well as many outstanding academics. = Beijing Institute of Technology period (1952‚Äì1988) = On 1 January 1952, Institute of Technology, North China University was officially renamed as Beijing Institute of Technology (Âåó‰∫¨Â∑•‰∏öÂ≠¶Èô¢). On 8 March 1952, it was decided by Ministry of Heavy Industry that Beijing Institute of Technology would be developed as a higher educational institute specialized in national defense industry, and would be a major institute for training technical professionals in national defense. Ever since then, Beijing Institute of Technology started to establish a number of weaponry science and technology subjects, including China's first rocket and missile subject, with the help of many scientists such as Qian Xuesen. In the meantime, several departments were terminated and others, including biology, mining, and aeronautics, were transferred to other universities, namely China Agricultural University (1947), Beijing Steel and Iron Institute (1952) and Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1952), respectively. In 1959, Beijing Institute of Technology was singled out as one of 16 ‚Äúnational key universities‚Äù that were authorized to offer graduate degrees. During the Cultural Revolution, most research at Beijing Institute of Technology came to a halt but quickly revived after 1976. = Post-economic reform period (1988‚Äìpresent) = In 1988, the institution changed its Chinese name from \\"Institute\\" to \\"University\\" (Âåó‰∫¨ÁêÜÂ∑•Â§ßÂ≠¶), while the English name remained unchanged. In 1991, BIT was chosen as one of the 14 national key universities to receive special supports from the Chinese government during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. In December 1995, BIT was ratified by the Chinese government as one of the 15 first-tier \\"Project 211\\" universities. In 1996, BIT became one of the first 32 Chinese universities to officially run graduate schools. In the same year, BIT was designated as one of the 27 national key universities during the Ninth Five-Year Plan. In 1999, BIT's undergraduate education was evaluated as \\"Excellent\\" in the assessment organized by the Chinese Ministry of Education. In 2000, BIT was the 10th university to be admitted into \\"Project 985\\", which aimed to promote the development and reputation of the Chinese higher education system by founding world-class universities in the 21st century through prioritized supports from both national and local government funding. In the same year, BIT was also designated as one of the top 22 universities in the \\"21st Century Education Promotion\\" plan during the Tenth Five-Year Plan. BIT used to be administered by the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. Since 2008, it is administered by the newly founded Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. In November 2010, along with 8 other Project 985 universities, BIT officially formed Excellence League, an alliance of 10 Chinese universities with strong background in engineering. BIT is traditionally strong in national defense and military technologies research, especially radars, missiles, and armored combat vehicles, but it also maintained outstanding research strength in electrical engineering, automation, photonics, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, industrial design and many other science and engineering subjects. As of 2015, BIT has established cooperation with more than 200 universities from 58 countries, and implemented student exchange programs with more than 40 universities in the world, including Technical University of Munich, Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, University of California and The Australian National University.

The Caecilii Metelli, part of the gens Caecilia, remained a political power within the state from the 3rd century BC to the end of the Republic in the 1st century BC, holding every office in the cursus honorum as well as several important military commands. Members Important members of the Caecilius Metellus clan include: *Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter, consul 284 BC, died in battle against the Senones at Arretium in 284 BC *Lucius Caecilius Metellus, consul 251 BC and 247 BC, died 221 BC, pontifex maximus *Quintus Caecilius Metellus, consul 206 BC *Quintus Caecilius Metellus, tribune of the plebeians *Quintus Caecilius Metellus *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus - eldest son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus, consul in 206 BC. A brilliant general, he fought in the Fourth Macedonic War, securing in 146 BC the annexation of Macedonia as a Roman province, hence the agnomen \\"Macedonicus\\". He was elected consul in 143 BC and censor in 131 BC. During his censorship, Macedonicus legislated to make marriage compulsory for Romans, a law that was never put into practice. He died in 115 BC. *Lucius Caecilius Metellus Calvus, consul 142 BC *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus, consul 123 BC, censor 120 BC *Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus, consul 119 BC, pontifex maximus in 115 BC, father of Caecilia Metella Dalmatica *Lucius Caecilius Metellus Diadematus, consul 117 BC, censor 115 BC *Marcus Caecilius Metellus, consul 115 BC *Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius, consul 113 BC, censor 102 BC *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, consul 109 BC, censor 102 BC, second son of Metellus Calvus, political opponent of Gaius Marius *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos - son of Balearicus, consul in 98 BC. Some of the few known aspects of his life involve the circumstances that surrounded his marriage to Licinia Crassa, the mother of his sons. Licinia was already married to another man, Quintus Mucius Scaevola, when they started an affair. Being discovered, Licinia was outcast and branded as an adulteress - but Metellus Nepos, rather than lose her, divorced his wife and married her less than a week after. This caused such a scandal that the several references to the wedding occur in ancient sources. *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius - only son of Metellus Numidicus, started his military career as a legate to Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the Social War. After the outlawing of Sulla he remained faithful to his commander and fled to Africa. In 83 BC he returned to Sulla and helped him win the civil war that eventually made Sulla dictator. To reward him for his services, Sulla nominated him as Pontifex Maximus. He was elected consul 80 BC, and afterwards sent as a proconsul to the Hispania provinces. For the next eight years he remained in Iberia, fighting against the rebellious Quintus Sertorius, the last five with the help of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. He eventually returned to Rome, where he celebrated a triumph for his victories in Hispania. He died around 63 BC. For his campaign against Sertorius, Metellus Pius earned the respect of Roman military historians, particularly Frontinus who often refers his deeds in the book Stratagemata. *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus, consul 69 BC *Lucius Caecilius Metellus, consul 68 BC *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, consul 60 BC, died 59 BC, perhaps poisoned by his wife Clodia *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer (people's tribune) *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos Iunior, consul 57 BC *Lucius Caecilius Metellus, tribune of the plebs 49 BC, resisted Julius Caesar when he wanted to plunder the treasury (Caesar Civil War 1.33) *Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica - also known as Metellus Scipio, consul 52 BC, adopted son of Metellus Pius, with whom he campaigned against Sertorius.

Women of the Caecilii Metelli family were always named Caecilia Metella, according to the Roman naming convention. To distinguish them, the Caecilias often carried their fathers' cognomina, declined in a female form.

Shorts was founded in 1908 in London, and was the first company in the world to make production aeroplanes.Barnes 1966 p. 8 It was particularly notable for its flying boat designs manufactured into the 1950s. In 1943 Shorts was nationalised and later denationalised, and in 1948 moved from its main base at Rochester, Kent to Belfast. In the 1960s, Shorts mainly produced turboprop airliners, major components for aerospace primary manufacturers, and missiles for the British Armed Forces. Shorts was primarily government-owned until being bought by Bombardier in 1989, and is today the largest manufacturing concern in Northern Ireland.Shorts as a \\"Centre of Excellence\\" within Bombardier, 2007 In 2019, Bombardier announced that it would sell its Belfast operations to Spirit AeroSystems. The company's products include aircraft components, engine nacelles and aircraft flight control systems for its parent company Bombardier Aerospace, and for Boeing, Rolls-Royce Deutschland, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.Manufacturing profiles History =The early years= left-to- right: Oswald (1883-1969), Horace (1872-1917), and Eustace Short (1875-1932) at Mussell Manor 1909. Mussell Manor, the Royal Aero Club clubhouse The Short Brothers business started in 1897 when Eustace Short (1875 ‚Äì 1932) bought a second-hand coal gas filled balloon, and, with his brother Oswald, started a company to develop and manufacture balloons.Barnes 1967, p. 3 In 1900 the two brothers visited the 1900 Paris Exposition ('World's Fair'), where they saw the balloons of √âdouard Surcouf (of Soci√©t√© Astra), who had developed a method of constructing truly spherical balloons. In 1902, the brothers started offering balloons for sale. They manufactured the balloons at Hove, Sussex, in premises above the acoustic laboratory run by a third brother, Horace (2 July 1872 ‚Äì 6 April 1917). In 1903, when Horace left to work on steam turbine development with Charles Parsons, Eustace and Oswald moved their workshop to rented accommodation in London, then again to railway arches in Battersea, conveniently situated next to Battersea gas-works. In 1905, they won a contract for three balloons for the British Indian Army. The quality of their work impressed Colonel James Templer, superintendent of the Royal Balloon Factory, who introduced the brothers to Charles Rolls. Rolls commissioned them to build him a large balloon to compete in the 1906 Gordon Bennett Cup balloon race. More orders soon followed from other members of the Aero Club of Great Britain (later Royal Aero Club).Barnes 1967, pp. 1‚Äì6 In 1908, on hearing reports from Aero Club members who had seen the Wright brothers' demonstrations of their aircraft at Le Mans in France, Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace, \\"This is the finish of ballooning: we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can't do that without Horace!\\"Barnes 1967, p. 6 Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to leave his job with Parsons, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. Two orders for aircraft were soon received, one from Charles Rolls, who ordered a glider, and the other from Francis McClean, a member of the Aero Club who later bought several more aircraft from Short Brothers, and also acted as an unpaid test-pilot. At the end of 1908 Horace started work on the two designs, and in early 1909 construction was started of McClean's aircraft, the Short No.1 biplane. In March 1909 it was exhibited, without its fabric covering, at the first British Aero Show held at Olympia. Meanwhile, the brothers had obtained the British rights to build copies of the Wright design.Barnes, pp. 6‚Äì8 C. R. Samson making the first take-off from a moving ship, May 1912 In February 1909, Shorts started construction of a new workshop on unobstructed marshland at Leysdown, near Shellbeach on the Isle of Sheppey. This had been acquired by the Aero Club for use as a flying ground, together with Mussell Manor (now known as \\"Muswell Manor\\"), which became its clubhouse. Construction of an initial batch of six aircraft was started immediately. Short Brothers thus became the first aircraft manufacturing company in the world to undertake volume production of an aircraft design. Here the Dunne D.5, the first tailless aircraft, was also built under contract. In 1910 the Royal Aero Club and Short Brothers moved to a larger and less marshy ground at Eastchurch, about 2.5 miles (4 km) away. At this time the Royal Aero Club had offered the Admiralty the use of the flying field and Frank McClean had agreed to act as an instructor, so beginning a close association between Short Brothers and the Naval Air Service, whose first pilots were trained using Short S.27 pusher biplanes. In 1911, Shorts built one of the world's first successful twin-engine aircraft, the Triple Twin. Construction started on a long series of naval aircraft floatplanes, starting with the Short S.26. In 1913, Gordon Bell became Shorts' first professional test pilot: he was succeeded by Ronald Kemp in 1914. Kemp could not handle the volume of flight testing and development alone and, by 1916, other pilots were employed on a freelance basis. One of these was John Lankester Parker. In 1918 Parker succeeded Kemp as Shorts' Chief Test Pilot, a post he was to occupy for the next 27 years.Barnes 1967, pp. 8‚Äì12, 120 In 2013 a statue of the brothers was unveiled in memory of their contribution to early aviation, by local artist Barbara Street to stand on the site of the Aero Club clubhouse at Muswell manor. Short Brothers Statue at the site of their aero club (Musswell Manor, Isle of Sheppey) = First World War = Short 184 floatplane By the outbreak of World War I Shorts were already building a variety of aircraft. Production really started to expand during the war, for example for the Short Admiralty Type 184 (or simply \\"Short S.184\\"). On 15 August 1915, during the Battle of Gallipoli, a Short S.184 was the first aircraft to attack a ship with a live torpedo. Flying from HMS Ben-my-Chree, piloted by Flight Commander Charles Edmonds, it hit a Turkish supply ship in the Dardanelles.The supply ship had already been hit by a torpedo from the submarine HMS E14 4 days earlier, and had run aground. See Short Type 184 for further details In terms of number built, the S.184 was Shorts' most successful pre-Second World War aircraft: over 900 were produced, many under licence by other manufacturers. A landplane version of the S.184 was also sold to the Royal Flying Corps as the Short Bomber.Barnes 1967, p. 113 During the First World War, Shorts were among the manufacturers of two flying boats, the F.3 and F.5, designed by John Porte at the Seaplane Experimental Station, Felixstowe. When the war ended, some 50 of these were being built at Rochester.Barnes and James 1989, p. 16  Expansion at Rochester  Due to the company's success, and the increasing number of seaplanes being produced, larger premises with ready access to the sea were needed. At that time, seaplanes were taken by road to Queenborough, then loaded onto lighters to be taken to the RNAS seaplane station on Isle of Grain to be launched and tested.Hanson, Richard. Borstal: Short Brothers. Access date: 15 January 2007. In 1913, an 8.4 acre (3.4 hectare) plot of land by the river Medway about 20 miles (32 km) away at Borstal, near Rochester, Kent, was purchased from Charles Willis (a local councillor), and the planning and construction work started.Cassidy, Brian. Flying Empires: Short \\"C\\" class Empire flying boats. Queens Parade Press, 2004. Access date: 15 January 2007. By early 1915, the first facility of what was to become known as the Seaplane Works was completed: No.1 Erecting Shop. As this and the No.2 and No.3 shops became available, the workforce moved from the Eastchurch factory. No.3 shop was completed in 1917. A long concrete slipway was constructed from the centre-line of No.3 Erecting Shop to enable aircraft of up to 20 tons weight to be launched even at low tide. Airships at Cardington In 1916, Short Brothers was awarded a contract to build two large dirigible airships for the Admiralty. As part of the contract, a loan was provided to enable the company to purchase a site near Cardington, Bedfordshire, on which to build airship construction facilities. As a result, the company concentrated on the construction of heavier-than-air aeroplanes in the Isle of Sheppey/Rochester area, and balloons and dirigibles at Cardington. A housing estate built by the company near Cardington to house its employees still bears the name Shortstown.Barnes & James 1989, p. 15 In 1919, the name of the company was changed to Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd., but nationalisation the same year ended the Short brothers' involvement with the company, which became the Royal Airship Works. =The 1920s and 1930s= During the immediate post-war years the economic climate was difficult for the aircraft industry in the United Kingdom. Shorts survived without reducing the company's workforce by diversifying into areas such as building lightweight bus and tram bodies.Barnes and James 1989, p. 19. During the 1920s and 1930s, flying boats were favoured for long-range civil aviation, because their operation did not rely on the existence of suitable airfields, which were not widespread at the time. Shorts took to the flying boat market, and in 1924 constructed a testing tank for testing hull and float designs. Shorts designed the floats used for the Supermarine S.4 and Gloster III seaplanes entered by the United Kingdom for the 1925 Schneider Trophy race. Alan Cobham's de Havilland DH.50 (G-EBFO) was also fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester. On 30 June 1926, Cobham then started a flight to Australia from the Medway. Two de Havilland Giant Moths were fitted with Shorts floats at Rochester, and the first was flown in June 1928; both were delivered to Western Canada Airlines Ltd. In 1924, Shorts produced the first of a series of three designs known as the Singapore. In 1927, the Singapore I was made famous by Sir Alan Cobham, when he, his wife, and crew made a survey of Africa, and covered about 23,000 miles. This in itself was a trip that both proved the worth of flying boats, but also highlighted the difficulties. The Short Sunderland, widely operated by the Allied powers during World War II Shorts then started design work on one of its most famous designs, the Short Calcutta, based on the Singapore layout but larger and more powerful, which began service with Imperial Airways in August 1928. By April 1929 two more had been added to the fleet, and they operated passenger-preferred coastal routes from Genoa to Alexandria by way of Athens, Corfu, Naples, and Rome. Several Calcuttas were used on shorter routes, and were instrumental in permitting long-range airline services between outposts of the British Empire. Shorts followed the production of four Calcuttas with the larger Kent, following with a series of still larger aircraft designs such as the Short Empire, the first of which was launched on 2 July 1936. The Empire was commissioned off the drawing board by Imperial Airways (later BOAC), to operate the UK's Empire Airmail scheme. A year later Shorts won a British government defence contract for a military flying boat, the Sunderland. Sharing the same basic design, but a modified upper structure, the Sunderland was one of the most effective long-range seaplanes in use. Dreaded by U-Boats, it was nicknamed \\"The Flying Porcupine\\" (Fliegendes Stachelschwein in German), perhaps due to its extensive armament and the several prominent dorsal antennae. In 1933, Shorts opened a new factory at Rochester Airport, which was becoming increasingly important for the landplanes the company was producing. The Eastchurch premises was closed in 1934, and in the same year Shorts purchased the engine manufacturer Pobjoy, which had moved to Rochester Airport to be near Shorts and had collaborated on its latest designs. On 5 July 1937, a Short Empire was used by Imperial Airways for the first westbound transatlantic service from Foynes, Ireland to Newfoundland. Service from Foynes, Republic of Ireland =First moves to Belfast= In 1936, the Air Ministry established a new aircraft factory at Belfast, and created a new company Short & Harland Ltd, owned 50% each by Harland and Wolff and Shorts. The first products of the new factory were 50 Bristol Bombays followed by 150 Handley-Page Hereford bombers.Barnes and James 1989, p. 28. Shorts work on seaplanes eventually culminated in the Short Sandringham and Short Seaford, both based on the Empire/Sunderland boats. These flying boats had enough range to operate as a transatlantic airliner, but largely served the post-war Empire (Commonwealth) market, in competition with 4-engined land planes such as modified Avro Lancasters, Avro Lancastrian and Avro York. Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) operated the Coral Route from New Zealand to Fiji, the Cook Islands and Tahiti in the South Pacific, with Short Solent flying boats up to 1960. =Second World War= Short Brothers HQ in Belfast, constructed in 1941 During the Second World War, the Short Sunderland became famous as an effective anti-submarine patrol bomber, because its long range and long flying time allowed it to close the Mid-Atlantic air gap between Iceland and Greenland, helping end the Battle of the Atlantic. It also rescued sea and air crews from the waters surrounding its spheres of operation especially those of Coastal Command. A squadron was ordered by the Royal Australian Air Force, but never made it to Australia; instead Australians flew for the Royal Air Force Coastal Command. Australia impressed Qantas-Imperial Empire boats into military service, and used these successfully especially on reconnaissance missions in the Timor Sea area. It was Short's work on the Sunderland that also won it the contract for the Short Stirling, the RAF's first four-engine bomber. If based on the original submission, essentially a land-based Sunderland with various cleanups, there seems to be no reason to suspect that the Stirling would not have been an excellent heavy bomber. However, the Air Ministry specification stipulated a number of other requirements of the aircraft, that it should be able to function as a troop transport for instance, and an upper limit on wingspan, that meant it was relegated as newer designs outperformed it. In 1944, the Short Shetland, a high-speed, long- range, four-engined flying-boat, was built (with Saunders-Roe providing the wings and a lot of the detail design work), but the war ended before the second prototype was completed. The project continued postwar but was eventually abandoned. During the Battle of Britain, the Rochester factory was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, and several of the early-run Stirlings and other aircraft were destroyed. From then, the Belfast factory became increasingly important, because it was thought to be well beyond the range of German bombers. However, during Easter week of 1941, Belfast and the aircraft factory were subjected to the worst single air-raid the UK had seen outside London, when the defenceless city became victim of German aircraft bombing. To meet the increased requirement for its aircraft during the war, satellite factories near Belfast were operated at Aldergrove and Maghaberry, producing 232 Stirlings between them.Barnes and James 1989, p. 388 A temporary Short's factory was established at White Cross Bay, Windermere,Barnes and James 1989, p. 368 that produced 35 Sunderland Mark IIIs. Also during the war, Austin Motors at Longbridge, Birmingham, produced over 600 Stirlings, and Blackburn Aircraft produced 240 Sunderlands at its shadow factory in Dumbarton, Scotland.Barnes and James 1989, p. 541 In 1943, the Government nationalised Short's under Defence Regulation 78. Oswald Short, who had resigned as Chairman in January of that year, remained as Honorary Life President.Barnes and James 1989, p. 30 =Postwar= Gyron test bed (lower port engine) at Farnborough SBAC Airshow, September 1955 US military version of the Shorts 330, the company's most successful modern aircraft after the Shorts 360. A Short 360, Short Skyvan and Short 330 at the 1982 Farnborough Airshow. The cancelled Short FJX regional jet By 1947, all of Shorts other wartime factories had been closed, and operations concentrated in Belfast. In 1948, the company offices followed, and Shorts became a Belfast company in its entirety. In the meantime, in 1947, Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. had merged with Short and Harland Limited to become Short Brothers and Harland Limited, with Oswald Short remaining as Life President.Barnes and James 1989, p. 32 In the 1950s, Shorts was involved in much pioneering research, including designing and building the VTOL Short SC1, the Short SB5 and the Short SB.4 Sherpa. Shorts built the Short Sperrin, a backup jet engine bomber design in case the V bomber projects failed, and the Short Seamew, a cheap to produce anti-submarine reconnaissance and attack aircraft intended for the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve squadrons, but the Sperrin was not needed and the RNVR squadrons disbanded. In the 1950s, Shorts also received sub- contracts to build 150 English Electric Canberras, and on 30 October 1952, the first of those made its maiden flight. Of these types, Shorts delivered 60 Canberra B.2s, 49 Canberra B.6s and 23 Canberra P.R.9s, the remaining 18 being cancelled by the Government in 1957.Barnes and James 1989, p. 508 Further work was involved in the conversion of time-expired Canberra B.2s into unmanned radio-controlled missile target aircraft. Two prototypes and 10 production Canberra U.10s were produced, followed by six improved Canberra U.14s. These aircraft were controlled from the ground by VHF radio, and were equipped to provide feedback on their own performance, as well as that of the missiles aimed at them.Barnes and James 1989, p. 509 As early as 1953, Shorts became involved with pioneering the development of electronic analogue computers, to assist with the design of increasingly complex aircraft.Shorts Quarterly Review, Vol. 2 No. 3, Autumn 1953, p.1. In 1954, the Bristol Aeroplane Company became a 15.25% shareholder in Shorts, and the company used the injection of funds to set up a production line for the Bristol Britannia turbo-prop airliner, known in the press as The Whispering Giant. Although it was originally intended that 35 Britannias should be built by Shorts, a shortage of work at Bristol led to this number being reduced. Eventually, 15 Britannias were completed by Shorts; five sets of Britannia components were sent to Filton and used on the continued production there of Britannias.Barnes and James 1989, p. 510 In the 1960s, Shorts found a niche for a new short-haul freighter aircraft and responded with the Short SC.7 Skyvan. The Skyvan is most remembered for its box-like, slab-sided appearance and rectangular twin tail units, but the aircraft was well loved for its performance and loading. It served almost the same performance niche as the famous de Havilland Twin Otter, and the Skyvan proved more popular in the freighter market due to the large rear cargo door that allowed it to handle bulky loads with ease. Skyvans can still be found around the world today, notably in the Canadian Arctic. The heavy lift freighter Short SC.5 Belfast flew for the first time in 1964. Only 10 were built for the Royal Air Force. In the 1970s, Shorts entered the feederliner market with the Shorts 330, a stretched modification of the Skyvan, called the C-23 Sherpa in USAF service, and another stretch resulted in the more streamlined Shorts 360, in which a more conventional central fin superseded the older H-profiled twin fins. In 1988, the proposed development was announced of a regional jet seating 44 passengers and to be called the FJX. The aircraft would have been a competitor to the Bombardier CRJ100 that was also in development at the time, but the FJX was cancelled after Short Brothers' sale to Bombardier. = Loyalist paramilitaries = In 1987 loyalists working at Shorts erected loyalists flags and bunting to intimidate the Catholic workers. The loyalists workers went on strike after management removed the loyalist flags from the shop floor.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- northern-ireland-33992639 In April 1989, three Northern Irish men, Noel Little, Samuel Quinn and James King, were arrested in Paris and later convicted of \\"arms trafficking and associating with criminals involved in terrorist activities.\\" They were accused of having stolen missile parts and documents related to Shorts' products. Also arrested were arms dealer Douglas Bernhardt and a South African diplomat. In 1993 a Catholic sub-contractor at Shorts was shot dead and five others injured in a loyalist attack on a mini- bus full of Catholic workmen in an attack to discourage Catholics from taking jobs at Shorts.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/catholic-shot-dead-in- ambush-attack-on-workmen-in-mini-bus-seen-as-loyalist-warning-to-workers- at-1510516.html =Belfast City Airport= In 1937, Shorts established an airfield in central Belfast, beside the factory. This became Sydenham Airport and, from 1938 to 1939, was Belfast's main civilian airport. During the Second World War, the airfield was requisitioned by the Royal Navy. Shorts continued to use the airfield until production of complete aircraft ceased, despite Nutts Corner, a former RAF base, becoming Belfast's main airport (Nutts Corner was itself superseded in 1963 by Aldergrove). In 1983, following interest from airlines and customers, the airfield was opened for commercial flights as Belfast Harbour Airport (later Belfast City Airport (BCA), now George Best Belfast City Airport). Following major capital investment, Bombardier sold BCA for ¬£35 million in 2003. =Bombardier= In 1977, the company changed its name back to Short Brothers, and in 1984 it became a public limited company in preparation for privatisation. The government announced the sale of Shorts to Bombardier on 7 June 1989 for ¬£30 million. As part of the sale, the government agreed (at the insistence of then-Chancellor John Major) to write off ¬£390 million of the company's \\"accumulated losses and inject another ¬£390 million to recapitalise the group and cover current and future losses, capital investment and training.\\" Bombardier beat a bid from The General Electric Company plc and Fokker. Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm had withdrawn before final offers were submitted. The sale was finalised on 4 October 1989. In 1993, with the company under the chairmanship of Sir Roy McNulty, Bombardier Shorts and Thomson-CSF formed a joint venture, Shorts Missile Systems, for the design and development of very short-range, air defence missiles for the UK Ministry of Defence and armed forces worldwide using expertise dating back to the 1950s. In 2000, Thomson-CSF bought Bombardier's 50% share to become the sole owner of Shorts Missile Systems, renaming it Thales Air Defence Limited in 2001. =Spirit AeroSystems= On 31 October 2019, Bombardier announced the sale of its aerostructures activities to Spirit AeroSystems. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2020 subject to regulatory approval. Aircraft Year of first flight in parentheses. Some of the early aircraft are designated using the Short sequence or constructors number which should not be confused with the similar type designations started at S.1 in 1924.

Among other maritime surveillance resources, such as satellites, ships, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and helicopters, the MPA is an important asset. \\"Fifth Report of Session 2012-13, Vol. 1\\", Google Books. To perform ASW operations, MPAs typically carry air- deployable sonar buoys as well as torpedoes and are usually capable of extended flight at low altitudes. , Google Books. History SS class airship = First World War = The first aircraft that would now be identified as maritime patrol aircraft were flown by the Royal Naval Air Service and the French A√©ronautique Maritime during the First World War, primarily on anti- submarine patrols. France, Italy and Austria-Hungary used large numbers of smaller patrol aircraft for the Mediterranean, Adriatic and other coastal areas while the Germans and British fought over the North Sea. At first, blimps and zeppelins were the only aircraft capable of staying aloft for the longer ten hour patrols whilst carrying a useful payload while shorter-range patrols were mounted with landplanes such as the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter.Jarrett 2009, p. 59. A number of specialized patrol balloons were built, particularly by the British, including the SS class airship of which 158 were built including subtypes.SS class airship. Airship Heritage Trust. Retrieved on 18 March 2009. British Airship Design. Charles Vivian, E., A History of Aeronautics pt.3, ch.V. Retrieved on 28 March 2009. As the conflict continued, numerous aircraft were developed specifically for the role, including small flying boats such as the FBA Type C, as well as large floatplanes such as the Short 184, or flying boats such as the Felixstowe F.3.Thetford 1978, p. 198. Developments of the Felixstowe served with the Royal Air Force until the mid 20s, and with the US Navy as the Curtiss F5L and Naval Aircraft Factory PN whose developments saw service until 1938.Bruce, J.M. \\"The Felixstowe Flying- Boats: Historic Military Aircraft No. 11 Part 1\\". Flight, 2 December 1955, pp. 842‚Äì846. During the war, Dornier did considerable pioneering work in all aluminium aircraft structures while working for Luftschiffbau Zeppelin and built four large patrol flying boats, the last of which, the Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IV, influenced development elsewhere resulting in the replacement of wooden hulls with metal ones, such as on the Short Singapore. The success of long range patrol aircraft led to the development of fighters specifically designed to intercept them, such as the Hansa-Brandenburg W.29. = Second World War = British Short Sunderland maritime reconnaissance flying boat German Focke- Wulf Fw 200 Condor on patrol Many of the Second World War patrol airplanes were converted from either bombers or airliners, such as the Lockheed Hudson which started out as the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra, as well as older biplane designs such as the Supermarine Stranraer, which had begun to be replaced by monoplanes just before the outbreak of war.Septer 2001, pp. 60‚Äì61. The British in particular used obsolete bombers to supplement purpose-built aircraft for maritime patrol, such as the Vickers Wellington and Armstrong- Whitworth Whitley,Andrews 1967, p. 14.Moyes 1967, p. 13. while the US relegated the Douglas B-18 Bolo to the same role until better aircraft became available.Conaway, William. \\"Confirmed Sinkings of German U-Boats by VI Bomber Command Bombardment Aircraft.\\" Planes and Pilots of World War 2, 2000.

In the Pacific theatre, the Catalina was gradually superseded by the longer- ranged Martin PBM Mariner flying boat.Dorr 1987, p. 116. For the Axis Powers, there were the long-range Japanese Kawanishi H6K and Kawanishi H8K flying boats, and the German Blohm & Voss BV 138 diesel-engined trimotor flying boat, as well as the converted Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor airliner landplane.Seifert, Karl-Dieter. \\"Der Deutsche Luftverkehr 1926 - 1945.\\" Bernard & Graefe Verlag, Bonn, 1996. .

To finally close the Mid-Atlantic gap, or \\"Black Gap\\", a space in which Axis submarines could prey of Allied shipping historically out of reach of MPAs, the British Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the US Army Air Forces introduced the American Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber, which had a very long range for the era.Green 1975, p. 85.Winchester 2004, p. 57. The B-24 was also used at the basis for the PB4Y-2 Privateer, a dedicated MPA variant adopted in large numbers by the US Navy, which saw service late on in the Pacific theatre.Bridgeman 1946, pp. 217‚Äì218.Swanborough and Bowers 1990, p. 106. During the conflict, there were several developments in Air-to-Surface Vessel radar and sonobuoys, which enhanced the ability of aircraft to find and destroy submarines, especially at night and in poor weather.celebrating200years.noaa.gov Top Tens: Breakthroughs: Hydrographic Survey Techniques: Acoustic Survey Methods: Radio Acoustic RangingAnonymous, \\"Ocean's Depth Measured By Radio Robot,\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1938, pp. 828-830. Another area of advancement was the adoption of increasingly effective camouflage schemes, which led to the widespread adoption of white paint schemes in the Atlantic to reduce the warning available to surfaced U-boats, while US Navy aircraft transitioned from an upper light blue-gray and lower white to an all-over dark blue due to the increasing threat of Japanese forces at night-time. = Cold War era = Interior of a French Navy Breguet Atlantic In the decades following the Second World War, the MPA missions were partially taken over by aircraft derived from civilian airliners. These had range and performance factors better than most of the wartime bombers. The latest jet-powered bombers of the 1950s did not have the endurance needed for long, overwater patrolling, and they did not have the low loitering speeds necessary for antisubmarine operations. The main threat to NATO maritime supremacy throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s was Soviet Navy and Warsaw Pact submarines. These were countered by the NATO fleets, the NATO patrol planes mentioned above, and by sophisticated underwater listening systems. These span the so-called \\"GIUK Gap\\" of the North Atlantic that extends from Greenland to Iceland, to the Faroe Islands, to Scotland in the United Kingdom. Air bases for NATO patrol planes have also been located in these areas: U.S. Navy and Canadian aircraft based in Greenland, Iceland, and Newfoundland; British aircraft based in Scotland and Northern Ireland; and Norwegian, Dutch, and German aircraft based in their home countries. During the late 1940s, the RAF introduced the Avro Shackleton a specialised MPA derivative of the Avro Lancaster bomber in anticipation of a rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy's submarine force.Jones 2002, p. 43.Billings, Bill. \\"The Shackleton Story.\\" The Shackleton Association.

During the late 1960s, a jet-powered replacement in the form of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, a derivation of the De Havilland Comet airliner, begun to be introduced. During the 2000s, an improved model, the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4, was in development, but was cancelled and eventually substituted for by the Boeing P-8 Poseidon..

Both the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy met their early postwar MPA needs via a stretched-fuselage modification of the Avro Lincoln bomber. However, the type was soon supplemented and eventually replaced by new aircraft, such as the P2V and later the P-3C, which later became the sole ASW type operated by the service. The Soviet Union developed the Ilyushin Il-38 from a civilian airliner. Similarly, the Royal Canadian Air Force derived the Canadair CP-107 Argus from a British airliner. The Argus was superseded by the CP-140 Aurora, derived from the Lockheed Electra. Since the end of the Cold War, the threat of a large-scale submarine attack is a remote one, and many of the air forces and navies have been downsizing their fleets of patrol planes. Those still in service are still used for search-and-rescue, counter-smuggling, antipiracy, antipoaching of marine life, the enforcement of the exclusive economic zones, and enforcement of the laws of the seas. Armament and countermeasures Pre- World War II Consolidated PBY Catalina dropping a depth charge The earliest patrol aircraft carried bombs and machine guns. Between the wars the British experimented with equipping their patrol aircraft with the COW 37 mm gun. During World War II, depth charges that could be set to detonate at specific depths, and later when in proximity with large metal objects replaced \\"anti- submarine\\" bombs that detonated on contact. Patrol aircraft also carried defensive armament which was necessary when patrolling areas close to enemy territory such as Allied operations in the Bay of Biscay targeting U-boats starting out from their base. As a result of Allied successes with patrol aircraft against U-boats, the Germans introduced U-flak (submarines equipped with more antiaircraft weaponry) to escort U-boats out of base and encouraged commanders to remain on the surface and fire back at attacking craft rather than trying to escape by diving. However, U-flak was short lived as opposing pilots adapted their tactics. Equipping submarines with radar-warning devices and the snorkel made them harder to find. To counter the German long-range patrol aircraft that targeted merchant convoys, the Royal Navy introduced the \\"CAM ship\\", which was a merchant vessel equipped with a lone fighter plane which could be launched once to engage the enemy planes. Later, the small escort carriers of WW II became available to cover the deep oceans, and the land air bases in the Azores became available in mid-1943 from Portugal. Sensors MAD (tail boom) and sonobuoy chutes (array of dark spots under rear fuselage) while the IR sensor is retracted and not visible. Maritime patrol aircraft are typically fitted with a wide range of sensors:Global Security.com - ASW Sensors accessdate:March 2014 * Radar to detect surface shipping movements. Radar can also detect a submarine snorkel or periscope, and the wake it creates. * Magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) to detect the iron in a submarine's hull. The MAD sensor is typically mounted on an extension from the tail or is trailed behind the aircraft on a cable to minimize interference from the metal in the rest of the aircraft; * Sonobuoys - self- contained sonar transmitter/receivers dropped into the water to transmit data back to the aircraft for analysis; * ELINT sensors to monitor communications and radar emissions; * Infrared cameras (sometimes referred to as FLIR for forward looking infrared) for detecting exhaust streams and other sources of heat and are useful in monitoring shipping movements and fishing activity. * Visual inspection using the aircrew's eyes, in some cases aided by searchlights or flares. A modern military maritime patrol aircraft typically carries a dozen or so crew members, including relief flight crews, to effectively operate the equipment for 12 hours or more at a time.

The Mulready illustration, engraved by John Thompson, was printed such that it appeared on the face of the sheets when folded. The Mulready letter sheets followed the traditional letter sheet design and could be folded as normal while the envelopes were a diamond-shaped sheet which, when the sides were folded to the center, became an envelope and the overlapping edges were then sealed. The Mulready illustration was effectively a very elaborate frank indicating that postage had been pre-paid. In the same way that the first postage stamps were issued in two values (Penny Black and Two Penny Blue) both the letter sheets and envelopes were issued in sheets of twelve, called Formes. The one penny and two penny values were in the same black and blue colours as the same value postage stamps. Demise The 2 pence Mulready stationery issued in 1840 Rowland Hill expected the Mulready stationery to be more popular than the postage stamps but the postage stamp prevailed. The design was so elaborate and misunderstood that it generated widespread ridicule and lampooning, and in addition was perceived in some areas as a covert government attempt to control the supply of envelopes, and hence control the flow of information carried by the postal service (which had become a government monopoly under the reforms). Many caricatures (or lampoons) were produced by stationers whose livelihood was threatened by the new letter sheet. Only six days after their introduction, on 12 May, Hill wrote in his journal: \\"I fear we shall have to substitute some other stamp for that design by Mulready ... the public have shown their disregard and even distaste for beauty.\\" Within two months a decision had been made to replace the Mulready designed stationery and essentially they were a folly. As a result of the uproar the Mulreadys were replaced with a simple design which is commonly known as the Penny Pink. The Penny Pinks were issued on 10 February 1841. Contrary to often published accounts, the Mulreadys were not withdrawn at that time. Supplies in post offices were eventually exhausted. Large supplies remained in the hands of Stamp Distributors and Sub Distributors. In November 1842, the Inland Revenue decided that those stocks should be withdrawn. The withdrawal notice was sent gradually over a period of time so that the store keepers at Inland Revenue would not be overwhelmed with the volume of returned Mulreadys. The withdrawal period lasted several years. The returned Mulreadys were stored at a warehouse until it was decided to destroy them. The first attempt was to burn them. That failed. Eventually a machine was designed and built to destroy them by punching out the center of the design. The Mulready stationery suffered an inglorious demise. The design was to write on the inside or to enclose a letter written on ordinary paper. The Mulready letter sheet was fundamentally akin to the present-day aerogram. Pre-gummed envelopes as we know them today did not exist. The diamond-shaped sheet and the geometrically more complex short-arm cross-shaped sheet remain essentially the staple designs to this day. (All mechanical printing devices from the Gutenberg press on are primarily designed to process flat rectangular sheets. Hence the illustration would have been printed using a press and then cut to a diamond shape. The number produced from any one sheet naturally depended on the size of the printing bed and to this day envelope printing and envelope manufacture have maintained a symbiotic relationship.)

This \\"east colonization\\" referred to the expansion of German culture, language, states, and settlement into eastern and Northern European regions inhabited by Slavs and Balts. Population growth during the High Middle Ages stimulated movement of peoples from the Rhenish, Flemish, and Saxon territories of the Holy Roman Empire eastwards into the less-populated Baltic region and Poland. These movements were supported by the German nobility, the Slavic kings and dukes, and the medieval Church. The majority of this settlement took place at the expense of Polabian Slavs and pagan Balts (see Northern Crusades). The future state of Prussia, named for the conquered Old Prussians, had its roots largely in these movements. As the Middle Ages came to a close, the Teutonic Knights, who had been invited to northern Poland by Konrad of Masovia, had assimilated and forcibly converted much of the southern Baltic coastlands. After the Partitions of Poland by the Kingdom of Prussia, Austria, and the Russian Empire in the late 18th century, Prussia gained much of western Poland. The Prussians, and later the Germans, engaged in a policy of Germanization in Polish territories. Russia and Sweden eventually conquered the lands taken by the Teutonic Knights in Estonia and Livonia.  in German discourse The term became a centerpiece of the program of the German nationalist movement in 1891, with the founding of the , in the words: (\\"The old must be revived\\").Wippermann, 1981, p. 87 Nazi Germany employed the slogan in calling the Czechs a \\"Slav bulwark against the \\" in the 1938 . Despite policies, population movement took place in the opposite direction also, as people from rural low-developed areas in the East were attracted by the prospering industrial areas of Western Germany. This phenomenon became known by the German term , literally the flight from the East.  A new was called for by German nationalists to oppose a Polish (\\"thrust toward the West\\"). World War I had ended with the Treaty of Versailles, by which most or parts of the Imperial German provinces of Posen, West Prussia, and Upper Silesia were given to reconstituted Poland; the West Prussian city of Danzig became the Free City of Danzig.

He also studied stone-carving and letter cutting under Eric Gill around 1921. Blue plaque at Golden Hillock Road. In 1925 Bloye became a member of the Birmingham Civic Society, having, at about that time, a studio at 111, Golden Hillock Road, Small Heath, Birmingham. As Birmingham's unofficial civic sculptor he worked on virtually all public commissions including libraries, hospitals and the University. He often carved bas-relief plaques, typically for public houses in Birmingham, and decorated a number of buildings by the architect Holland W. Hobbiss. During the 1920s, he served on the Technical Committee of the Birmingham Civic Society. Bloye became a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors: associate (with the honorific suffix ARBS) in 1934, and fellow (FRBS) in 1938. He also won the latter's Otto Beit Medal.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1728 ‚Äì October 19, 1814) was a poet, playwright and pamphleteer during the American Revolution. During the years before the American Revolution, Warren published poems and plays that attacked royal authority in Massachusetts and urged colonists to resist British infringements on colonial rights and liberties. She was married to James Warren, who was likewise heavily active in the independence movement. During the debate over the United States Constitution in 1788, she issued a pamphlet, Observations on the new Constitution, and on the Federal and State Conventions written under the pseudonym \\"A Columbian Patriot\\", that opposed ratification of the document and advocated the inclusion of a Bill of Rights. Observations was long thought to be the work of other writers, most notably Elbridge Gerry. It was not until her descendant, Charles Warren, found a reference to it in a 1787 letter to British historian, Catharine Macaulay, that Warren was accredited authorship.Whipp, Koren (2014). \\"Mercy Otis Warren\\". Project Continua. In 1790, she published a collection of poems and plays under her own name, a highly unusual occurrence for a woman at the time. In 1805, she published one of the earliest histories of the American Revolution, a three- volume History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution, the first history of the American Revolution authored by a woman. Early life Mercy Otis Warren was born on September 14, 1728 (old style), the third of thirteen children and first daughter of Colonel James Otis (1702‚Äì1778) and Mary Allyne Otis (1702‚Äì1774). Only six of her siblings survived to adulthood. The family lived in West Barnstable, Massachusetts. Mary Allyne was a descendant of Mayflower passenger Edward Doty. James Otis, Sr., was a farmer, and attorney, who served as a judge for the Barnstable County Court of Common Pleas. He won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1745. He was an outspoken opponent and leader against British rule and against the appointed colonial governor, Thomas Hutchinson. The Otis children were \\"raised in the midst of revolutionary ideals\\". Although Mercy had no formal education, she studied with the Reverend Jonathan Russell while he tutored her brothers Joseph and James in preparation for College. Unlike most girls of the time who were simply literate, Warren wanted to learn as much as she possibly could. She devoured book after book, learning about history and language. This set her apart from other girls and most likely paved the way for her to break the traditional gender roles of her time. Her father also had unconventional views of his daughter's education, as he fully supported her endeavors, which was extremely unusual for the 18th century.Zagarri, Rosemarie. A Women's Dilemma: Mercy Otis Warren and the American Revolution. James Otis attended Harvard College and became a noted patriot and lawyer. What little of his correspondence with Mercy survives suggests that James encouraged Mercy's academic and literary efforts, treating her as an intellectual equal and confidante. She married James Warren on November 14, 1754. After settling in Plymouth, James inherited his father's position as sheriff. His previous occupations included farming and merchanting. Throughout their lives, they wrote letters of respect and admiration to each other. These exchanges of adoration showed both a mutual respect and an enduring bond between the two. James would write from Boston, \\"I have read one Excellent Sermon this day & heard two others. What next can I do better than write to a Saint,\\" and Mercy would then respond, \\"Your spirit I admire- were a few thousands on the Continent of a similar disposition we might defy the power of Britain.\\" They had five sons, James (1757‚Äì1821), Winslow (1759‚Äì1791), Charles (1762‚Äì1784), Henry (1764‚Äì1828), and George (1766‚Äì1800). Her husband James had a distinguished political career. In 1765 he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He became speaker of the House and President of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. He also served as paymaster to George Washington's army for a time during the American Revolutionary War. Mercy Warren actively participated in the political life of her husband. The Warrens became increasingly involved in the conflict between the American colonies and the British Government. Their Plymouth home was often a meeting place for local politics and revolutionaries including the Sons of Liberty. Warren became increasingly drawn to political activism and she hosted protest meetings in her home. With the assistance of her friend Samuel Adams, these meetings laid the foundation for the Committees of Correspondence. Warren wrote, \\"no single step contributed so much to cement the union of the colonies.\\" Like Mercy's father and brothers, the first patriots disliked the colonial governor. Mercy accordingly became a strong political voice with views on liberty, republican government and independence for the American colonies. She wrote: \\"Every domestic enjoyment depends on the unimpaired possession of civil and religious liberty.\\" Mercy's husband James encouraged her to write, fondly referring to her as the \\"scribbler\\" and she became his chief correspondent and sounding board. She wrote poems and stories about people fighting for freedom. Later, she wrote a history of the American Revolution, the first by a woman. Revolutionary writings and politics Warren formed a strong circle of friends with whom she regularly corresponded, including Abigail Adams, John Adams, Martha Washington and Hannah Winthrop, wife to John Winthrop. In a letter to Catharine Macaulay she wrote: \\"America stands armed with resolution and virtue; but she still recoils at the idea of drawing the sword against the nation from whom she derived her origin. Yet Britain, like an unnatural parent, is ready to plunge her dagger into the bosom of her affectionate offspring.\\" Through their correspondence they increased the awareness of women's issues, were supportive, and influenced the course of events to further America's cause. She became a correspondent and advisor to many political leaders, including Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and especially John Adams, who became her literary mentor in the years leading to the Revolution. In a letter to James Warren, Adams wrote, \\"Tell your wife that God Almighty has entrusted her with the Powers for the good of the World, which, in the cause of his Providence, he bestows on few of the human race. That instead of being a fault to use them, it would be criminal to neglect them.\\" Since Warren knew most of the leaders of the Revolution personally, she was continually at or near the center of events from 1765 to 1789. All of Warren's work was published anonymously until 1790 when she published Poems, Dramatic and Miscellaneous, the first work bearing her name. The book contains eighteen political poems and two plays. The two dramas, The Sack of Rome and The Ladies of Castille, deal with liberty, social and moral values that were necessary to the success of the new republic. She wrote several plays, including the satiric The Adulateur (1772). Directed against Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts, The Adulateur foretold the War of Revolution. It was published as a part of a longer play by an unknown author without Warren's consent in 1773. One of the main characters in Warren's part of the play is Rapatio, who represented Thomas Hutchinson, the governor of Massachusetts at the time. Because Warren was a Whig and Hutchinson was a Tory, Warren disagreed with Hutchinson's views. Therefore, Rapatio is the antagonist in The Adulateur. The protagonist is Brutus, a character that Warren created to represent her brother, James Otis. In the play, the characters that are Whigs are brave, independent people. The characters that are Tories are selfish and rude. The play includes a happy ending for the Whigs. After the play was published, Hutchinson actually become known as Rapatio to citizens of Massachusetts who identified with the Whigs. Because her first play was so successful and she thoroughly enjoyed writing about politics, Warren did not stop there. In 1773, she wrote The Defeat, also featuring the character based on Hutchinson. Hutchinson had no idea the accuracy of her plot nor completely comprehended the impact she made on his political fate. Warren's assistance in the movement to remove Governor Hutchinson from his position through The Defeat was one of her greatest accomplishments, and she allowed the piece a rare happy ending. Warren began to doubt as she wrote the third installment in her trilogy, feeling the power of her satire compromised her divine purpose to be a \\"member of the gentler sex,\\" but found encouragement from Abigail Adams, who told her, \\"God Almighty has entrusted [you] with Powers for the good of the World\\". With this affirmation, Warren then provided her sharpest political commentary yet: In 1775 Warren published The Group, a satire conjecturing what would happen if the British king abrogated the Massachusetts charter of rights. The anonymously published The Blockheads (1776) and The Motley Assembly (1779) are also attributed to her. In 1788 she published Observations on the New Constitution, whose ratification she opposed as an Anti-Federalist. Warren was one of the most convincing Patriots in the Revolution and her works inspired others to become Patriots. Her work earned the congratulations of numerous prominent men of the age, including George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, who remarked, \\"In the career of dramatic composition at least, female genius in the United States has outstripped the male\\". Post-Revolutionary writings History of the Rise, Progress and Termination of the American Revolution (1805) In 1790 she published Poems, Dramatic and Miscellaneous, the first work bearing her name. The book contains eighteen political poems and two plays. The two plays are called, The Sack of Rome and The Ladies of Castille, deal with liberty, social and moral values that were necessary to the success of the new republic. In 1805, she completed her literary career with a three-volume History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution. President Thomas Jefferson ordered subscriptions for himself and his cabinet and noted his \\"anticipation of her truthful account of the last thirty years that will furnish a more instructive lesson to mankind than any equal period known in history.\\" The book's sharp comments on John Adams led to a heated correspondence and a breach in her friendship with Adams, which lasted until 1812. Death Mercy Otis Warren's gravestone located directly behind James Warren's plaque. She is buried alongside her husband at Burial Hill. Mercy Otis Warren died on October 19, 1814, at the age of 86, six years after her husband died in 1808. She is buried at Burial Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts. Legacy According to historian Mary Benson, Mercy Otis Warren was able, vigorous, and much better read than her contemporaries. Her family connections gave her access to the leadership of the American Revolution, including her brother James Otis and her husband James Warren. New England's patriot leadership welcomed her revolutionary fervor and deployed her plays as valuable propaganda for the cause. Although at first dubious about the proper role of women as propagandists, she succumbed to the urgings of her friends and accepted her duty to use her talents for the patriot cause. Her interest in current events blossomed into the skills of a self-taught historian, with a romanticized style of the sort readers of contemporary literature expected. Like the fiction of the day, her historiography pointed toward moral lessons, and a plays and histories reflected her partisanship against the faction around Governor Hutchinson, or around the Hamiltonian Federalists in the national capital. Historians no longer read her for factual details, but they do find her a valuable source on the mood among intellectuals in the Revolutionary era and the early nation. Feminists debate whether she could be considered one of them, for her expressed approach was traditional, with some impatience shown at the restraints. She did strongly encourage women writers while stressing the cheerful performance of household duties.Mary S. Benson, \\"Warren, Mercy Otis,\\" in John A. Garraty, ed. Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 1152-53. Warren proved her ability to resonate to her colonial audience, men and women alike. Furthermore, she proved courageous in being willing to put forth work calling out the authoritative power while raising a family, yet she was humble and practical in how she presented the commentary through quieter presentations. Her success was never above her personal dignity. She said to her son, \\"The thorns, the thistles, and the briers, in the field of politics seldom permit the soil to produce anything‚Ä¶ but ruin to the adventurer,\\" yet the public would not let her retire from commentating on the political conflicts of her later days. She concentrated her writing on strict political matters wrote many more short dramas, poems, and essays throughout wartime and post- Revolution with a commentating and critical voice. The SS Mercy Warren, a World War II Liberty ship launched in 1943, was named in her honor. In 2002, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. She is remembered on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Her great-great- grandson, Charles Warren, became a distinguished lawyer and historian. References Further reading * Blundell, John.

Early life Dixon was born Lydia Emma Pinckert, one of 10 children born to German Catholic immigrants, Gerhart and Emma Pinckert, in Medford, Wisconsin, but raised in Missouri and California. Dixon's birth date was often reported as 1918, and Dixon would offer this date to reporters,Greene, David St. Albin, \\"The Untold Story...of Jeane Dixon\\", National Observer, October 27, 1972Clauson-Wicker, Su, \\"Offbeat Attractions\\", Roanoke Times & World News (Roanoke, Virginia), April 17, 2005, \\"Displays lead you from Dixon's birth in Wisconsin in 1904 (she liked to say it was 1918)\\" at one point even producing a passport to this effect, but she once testified in a deposition that she was born in 1910. An investigation by a reporter for the National Observer, who interviewed family members and examined official records, concluded she was born in 1904.Denis Brian, Jeane Dixon: The Witnesses, Doubleday & Company, 1976, p147‚Äì148 In southern California, her future husband, James \\"Jimmy\\" Dixon,[family records in contributors possession] owned an automobile dealership with Hal Roach, an American film and television producer and director. Dixon claimed that while growing up in California, a \\"Gypsy\\" gave her a crystal ball and read her palm, predicting she would become a famous seer and advise powerful people. She was married to James Dixon, who had been previously divorced, from 1939 until his death. The couple had no children. James Dixon was a car dealer in California, who later ran a successful real estate company in Washington, D.C. Dixon worked with her husband in the business for many years and served as the company's president.\\"Astrologer, psychic Dixon dies in Washington\\", The Oregonian, January 26, 1997. Dixon was the sister of football player Erny Pinckert. Career as a psychic Dixon reportedly predicted the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In the May 13, 1956, issue of Parade Magazine she wrote that the 1960 presidential election would be \\"dominated by labor and won by a Democrat\\" who would then go on to\\"(b)e assassinated or die in office though not necessarily in his first term\\".The Straight Dope Mailbag: The Straight Dope Mailbag: Did psychic Jeane Dixon predict JFK's assassination? However, this premonition was reversed in 1960 when, as the election date neared, she incorrectly predicted that Nixon would instead win the election. She later admitted; \\"during the 1960 election, I saw Richard Nixon as the winner\\", and at the time made unequivocal predictions that JFK would fail to win the election. Dixon was the author of seven books, including her autobiography, a horoscope book for dogs, and an astrological cookbook. She gained public awareness through the biographical volume, A Gift of Prophecy: The Phenomenal Jeane Dixon,Jeane Dixon, biography, IMDb.com written by syndicated columnist Ruth Montgomery. Published in 1965, the book sold more than 3 million copies. She professed to be a devout Roman Catholic and she attributed her prophetic ability to God. Another million seller, My Life and Prophecies, was credited \\"as told to Rene Noorbergen\\", but Dixon was sued by Adele Fletcher, who claimed that her rejected manuscript was rewritten and published as that book. Fletcher was awarded 5% of the royalties by a jury. In 1969 she was asked to find Dennis Lloyd Martin, a six year old boy who had gone missing in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee - she failed to do so. President Richard Nixon followed her predictions through his secretary Rose Mary Woods, and met with her in the Oval Office in 1971. The following year, her prediction of terrorist attacks in the United States in the wake of the Munich massacre spurred Nixon to set up a cabinet committee on counterterrorism.Terror Watch: President Nixon's Secret Psychic Adviser, MSNBC.com (Alternative link: Newsweek Terror Watch: Nixon and Dixon) She was one of several astrologers who gave advice to Nancy Reagan.Regan, Donald. For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington, (San Diego: Harcourt Trade Publishers, 1988); Jeane Dixon predicted that one pope would suffer bodily harm, and another be assassinated, in the twentieth century. This would correspond with the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II, and allegations of assassination of Pope John Paul I. She also stated that a pope would be replaced in office, by cardinals who dislike him.Dixon & Noorbergen, Sphere edition 1973 p.131-2 In her 1971 book The Call to Glory, Dixon predicted that an apocalyptic 'war of armageddon' would occur in 2020. Despite this, in her book My Life and Prophecies, she apparently predicted a war between China and Russia would occur between 2025 and 2037, initiated and won by China.Dixon & Noorbergen, Sphere edition 1973 p.132 The Jeane Dixon effect John Allen Paulos, a mathematician at Temple University, coined the term 'the Jeane Dixon effect', which references a tendency to promote a few correct predictions while ignoring a larger number of incorrect predictions. Many of Dixon's predictions proved erroneous, such as her claims that a dispute over the islands of Quemoy and Matsu would trigger the start of World War III in 1958, that American labor leader Walter Reuther would run for president of the United States in the 1964 presidential election, that the second child of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his young wife Margaret would be a girl (it was a boy), and that the Soviets would be the first to put men on the moon. Death Dixon suffered cardiac arrest and died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on January 25, 1997. Before her death, she uttered the words \\"I knew this would happen.\\"\\"Jean Dixon Psychic and Astrologer Whose Predictions Were Read by Millions\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 27, 1997. Many of her possessions ended up with Leo M. Bernstein, an investor and banker in Washington, D.C., whose clients included Dixon. In 2002, he opened the Jeane Dixon Museum and Library in Strasburg, Virginia. Bernstein died in 2008. In July 2009, the possessions of the museum, 500 boxes in all, were scheduled to be auctioned.

The colonnade, now in St. Thomas' Peace Garden During the Birmingham Blitz, on the night of 11 December 1940, all but the fine tower and classical west portico of St. Thomas' Church, Bath Row, was destroyed by German bombs. The church was never rebuilt. The First World War Memorial colonnade, which had been built alongside the Hall of Memory in 1925, was relocated there when Centenary Square was laid out 1989. The gardens were re-designed as the St. Thomas' Peace Garden in 1995 in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of World War II, as a monument to peace, and as a memorial to all those killed in armed conflict.

Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process. The benefits of using business processes include improved customer satisfaction and improved agility for reacting to rapid market change. Process-oriented organizations break down the barriers of structural departments and try to avoid functional silos.  Overview  A business process begins with a mission objective (an external event) and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses (process decomposition), the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for ensuring the process runs smoothly from start to finish. Broadly speaking, business processes can be organized into three types, according to von Rosing et al.: # Operational processes, which constitute the core business and create the primary value stream, e.g., taking orders from customers, opening an account, and manufacturing a component # Management processes, the processes that oversee operational processes, including corporate governance, budgetary oversight, and employee oversight # Supporting processes, which support the core operational processes, e.g., accounting, recruitment, call center, technical support, and safety training A slightly different approach to these three types is offered by Kirchmer: # Operational processes, which focus on properly executing the operational tasks of an entity; this is where personnel \\"get the things done\\" # Management processes, which ensure that the operational processes are conducted appropriately; this is where managers \\"ensure efficient and effective work processes\\" # Governance processes, which ensure the entity is operating in full compliance with necessary legal regulations, guidelines, and shareholder expectations; this is where executives ensure the \\"rules and guidelines for business success\\" are followed A complex business process may be decomposed into several subprocesses, which have their own attributes but also contribute to achieving the overall goal of the business. The analysis of business processes typically includes the mapping or modeling of processes and sub-processes down to activity/task level. Processes can be modeled through a large number of methods and techniques. For instance, the Business Process Modeling Notation is a business process modeling technique that can be used for drawing business processes in a visualized workflow. While decomposing processes into process types and categories can be useful, care must be taken in doing so as there may be crossover. In the end, all processes are part of a largely unified outcome, one of \\"customer value creation.\\" This goal is expedited with business process management, which aims to analyze, improve, and enact business processes. History = Adam Smith = An important early (1776) description of processes was that of economist Adam Smith in his famous example of a pin factory. Inspired by an article in Diderot's Encyclop√©die, Smith described the production of a pin in the following way: > ‚ÄùOne man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth > points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the > head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar > business; to whiten the pins is another ... and the important business of > making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct > operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct > hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of > them.‚Äù Smith also first recognized how the output could be increased through the use of labor division. Previously, in a society where production was dominated by handcrafted goods, one man would perform all the activities required during the production process, while Smith described how the work was divided into a set of simple tasks, which would be performed by specialized workers. The result of labor division in Smith‚Äôs example resulted in productivity increasing by 24,000 percent (sic), i.e. that the same number of workers made 240 times as many pins as they had been producing before the introduction of labor division. It is worth noting that Smith did not advocate labor division at any price and per se. The appropriate level of task division was defined through experimental design of the production process. In contrast to Smith's view which was limited to the same functional domain and comprised activities that are in direct sequence in the manufacturing process, today's process concept includes cross-functionality as an important characteristic. Following his ideas, the division of labor was adopted widely, while the integration of tasks into a functional, or cross-functional, process was not considered as an alternative option until much later. = Frederick Winslow Taylor = American engineer, Frederick Winslow Taylor greatly influenced and improved the quality of industrial processes in the early twentieth century. His Principles of Scientific Management focused on standardization of processes, systematic training and clearly defining the roles of management and employees. His methods were widely adopted in the United States, Russia and parts of Europe and led to further developments such as ‚Äútime and motion study‚Äù and visual task optimization techniques, such as Gantt charts. = Peter Drucker = In the latter part of the twentieth century, management guru Peter Drucker focused much of his work on simplification and decentralization of processes, which led to the concept of outsourcing. He also coined the concept of the \\"knowledge worker ‚Äî as differentiated from manual workers ‚Äî and how knowledge management would become part of an entity's processes. = Other definitions = Davenport (1993)Thomas Davenport (1993). Process Innovation: Reengineering work through information technology. Harvard Business School Press, Boston defines a (business) process as: > ‚Äùa structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific > output for a particular customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on > how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focus‚Äôs > emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific ordering of work activities > across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly defined > inputs and outputs: a structure for action. ... Taking a process approach > implies adopting the customer‚Äôs point of view. Processes are the structure > by which an organization does what is necessary to produce value for its > customers.‚Äù This definition contains certain characteristics a process must possess. These characteristics are achieved by a focus on the business logic of the process (how work is done), instead of taking a product perspective (what is done). Following Davenport's definition of a process we can conclude that a process must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output, that it consists of smaller parts, activities, which are ordered in time and space, that there must be a receiver of the process outcome- a customer - and that the transformation taking place within the process must add customer value. Hammer & Champy‚Äôs (1993)Michael Hammer and James Champy (1993). Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution, Harper Business definition can be considered as a subset of Davenport‚Äôs. They define a process as: > ‚Äùa collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and > creates an output that is of value to the customer.‚Äù As we can note, Hammer & Champy have a more transformation oriented perception, and put less emphasis on the structural component ‚Äì process boundaries and the order of activities in time and space. Rummler & Brache (1995)Rummler & Brache (1995). Improving Performance: How to manage the white space on the organizational chart. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco use a definition that clearly encompasses a focus on the organization‚Äôs external customers, when stating that > ‚Äùa business process is a series of steps designed to produce a product or > service. Most processes (...) are cross-functional, spanning the ‚Äòwhite > space‚Äô between the boxes on the organization chart. Some processes result in > a product or service that is received by an organization's external > customer. We call these primary processes. Other processes produce products > that are invisible to the external customer but essential to the effective > management of the business. We call these support processes.‚Äù The above definition distinguishes two types of processes, primary and support processes, depending on whether a process is directly involved in the creation of customer value, or concerned with the organization‚Äôs internal activities. In this sense, Rummler and Brache's definition follows Porter's value chain model, which also builds on a division of primary and secondary activities. According to Rummler and Brache, a typical characteristic of a successful process-based organization is the absence of secondary activities in the primary value flow that is created in the customer oriented primary processes. The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organization chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions. Johansson et al. (1993).Henry J. Johansson et al. (1993). Business Process Reengineering: BreakPoint Strategies for Market Dominance. John Wiley & Sons define a process as: > ‚Äùa set of linked activities that take an input and transform it to create an > output. Ideally, the transformation that occurs in the process should add > value to the input and create an output that is more useful and effective to > the recipient either upstream or downstream.‚Äù This definition also emphasizes the constitution of links between activities and the transformation that takes place within the process. Johansson et al. also include the upstream part of the value chain as a possible recipient of the process output. Summarizing the four definitions above, we can compile the following list of characteristics for a business process: # Definability : It must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output. # Order : It must consist of activities that are ordered according to their position in time and space (a sequence). # Customer : There must be a recipient of the process' outcome, a customer. # Value-adding : The transformation taking place within the process must add value to the recipient, either upstream or downstream. # Embeddedness : A process cannot exist in itself, it must be embedded in an organizational structure. # Cross-functionality : A process regularly can, but not necessarily must, span several functions. Frequently, identifying a process owner, (i.e., the person responsible for the continuous improvement of the process) is considered as a prerequisite. Sometimes the process owner is the same person who is performing the process. Related concepts =Workflow= Workflow is the procedural movement of information, material, and tasks from one participant to another. Workflow includes the procedures, people and tools involved in each step of a business process. A single workflow may either be sequential, with each step contingent upon completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously. Multiple combinations of single workflows may be connected to achieve a resulting overall process. A =Business process re-engineering= Business process re-engineering (BPR) was originally conceptualized by Hammer and Davenport as a means to improve organizational effectiveness and productivity. It consisted of starting from a blank slate and completely recreating major business processes as well as the use of information technology for significant performance improvement. The term unfortunately became associated with corporate \\"downsizing\\" in the mid-1990s. =Business process management (BPM)= Though the term has been used contextually to mixed effect, \\"business process management\\" (BPM) can generally be defined as a discipline involving a combination of a wide variety of business activity flows (e.g., business process automation, modeling, and optimization) that strives to support the goals of an enterprise within and beyond multiple boundaries, involving many people, from employees to customers and external partners. A major part of BPM's enterprise support involves the continuous evaluation of existing processes and the identification of ways to improve upon it, resulting in a cycle of overall organizational improvement. =Knowledge management= Knowledge management is the definition of the knowledge that employees and systems use to perform their functions and maintaining it in a format that can be accessed by others. The Duhon and the Gartner Group have defined it as \\"a discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprise's information assets. These assets may include databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and experience in individual workers.\\" =Total quality management= Total quality management (TQM) emerged in the early 1980s as organizations sought to improve the quality of their products and services. It was followed by the Six Sigma methodology in the mid-1980s, first introduced by Motorola. Six Sigma consists of statistical methods to improve business processes and thus reduce defects in outputs. The \\"lean approach\\" to quality management was introduced by the Toyota Motor Company in the 1990s and focused on customer needs and reduction of wastage. =Information technology as an enabler for business process management= Advances in information technology over the years, have changed business processes within and between business enterprises. In the 1960s, operating systems had limited functionality, and any workflow management systems that were in use were tailor-made for the specific organization. The 1970s-1980s saw the development of data-driven approaches, as data storage and retrieval technologies improved. Data modeling rather than process modeling was the starting point for building an information system. Business processes had to adapt to information technology because process modeling was neglected. The shift towards process-oriented management occurred in the 1990s. Enterprise resource planning software with workflow management components such as SAP, Baan, PeopleSoft, Oracle and JD Edwards emerged, as did business process management systems (BPMS) later. The world of e-business created a need to automate business processes across organizations, which in turn raised the need for standardized protocols and web services composition languages that can be understood across the industry. The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Business Motivation Model (BMM) are widely used standards for business modeling. The Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force (BMI DTF) is a consortium of vendors and user companies that continues to work together to develop standards and specifications to promote collaboration and integration of people, systems, processes and information within and across enterprises. The most recent trends in BPM are influenced by the emergence of cloud technology, the prevalence of social media, mobile technology, and the development of analytical techniques. Cloud-based technologies allow companies to purchase resources quickly and as required independent of their location. Social media, websites and smart phones are the newest channels through which organizations reach and support their customers. The abundance of customer data collected through these channels as well as through call center interactions, emails, voice calls, and customer surveys has led to a huge growth in data analytics which in turn is utilized for performance management and improving the ways in which the company services its customers. Importance of the process chain Business processes comprise a set of sequential sub-processes or tasks with alternative paths, depending on certain conditions as applicable, performed to achieve a given objective or produce given outputs. Each process has one or more needed inputs. The inputs and outputs may be received from, or sent to other business processes, other organizational units, or internal or external stakeholders. Business processes are designed to be operated by one or more business functional units, and emphasize the importance of the ‚Äúprocess chain‚Äù rather than the individual units. In general, the various tasks of a business process can be performed in one of two ways: # manually # by means of business data processing systems such as ERP systems Typically, some process tasks will be manual, while some will be computer-based, and these tasks may be sequenced in many ways. In other words, the data and information that are being handled through the process may pass through manual or computer tasks in any given order. Policies, processes and procedures The above improvement areas are equally applicable to policies, processes, detailed procedures (sub-processes/tasks) and work instructions. There is a cascading effect of improvements made at a higher level on those made at a lower level. For example, if a recommendation to replace a given policy with a better one is made with proper justification and accepted in principle by business process owners, then corresponding changes in the consequent processes and procedures will follow naturally in order to enable implementation of the policies. Reporting as an essential base for execution Business processes must include up-to-date and accurate reports to ensure effective action. An example of this is the availability of purchase order status reports for supplier delivery follow-up as described in the section on effectiveness above. There are numerous examples of this in every possible business process. Another example from production is the process of analysis of line rejections occurring on the shop floor. This process should include systematic periodical analysis of rejections by reason, and present the results in a suitable information report that pinpoints the major reasons, and trends in these reasons, for management to take corrective actions to control rejections and keep them within acceptable limits. Such a process of analysis and summarisation of line rejection events is clearly superior to a process which merely inquires into each individual rejection as it occurs. Business process owners and operatives should realise that process improvement often occurs with introduction of appropriate transaction, operational, highlight, exception or M.I.S. reports, provided these are consciously used for day-to-day or periodical decision-making. With this understanding would hopefully come the willingness to invest time and other resources in business process improvement by introduction of useful and relevant reporting systems.  Supporting theories and concepts  = Span of control = The span of control is the number of subordinates a supervisor manages within a structural organization.

The state entered into formal diplomatic relations with the Eastern Han dynasty by the mid-1st century AD as an important ally of that empire to check the Xianbei and Goguryeo threats. After an incapacitating Xianbei invasion in 285, Buyeo was restored with help from the Jin dynasty. This, however, marked the beginning of a period of decline. A second Xianbei invasion in 346 finally destroyed the state, except some remnants in its core region which survived as vassals of Goguryeo until their final annexation in 494. Both Goguryeo and Baekje (South Buyeo), two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, considered themselves Buyeo's successors. Mythical Origins Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms, c. 001 AD. The mythical founder of the Buyeo kingdom was Hae Mo-su, the Dongmyeong of Buyeo which literally means Holy King of Buyeo. After its foundation, (the son of heaven, ) brought the royal court to his new palace, and they proclaimed him King. Jumong is described as the son of Hae Mo-su and Lady Yuhwa (), who was the daughter of Habaek (), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (). History =Archaeological Predecessors= The Buyeo state emerged from the Bronze Age polities of the Seodansan and Liangquan archaeological cultures in the context of trade with various Chinese polities. In particular was the state of Yan which introduced iron technology to Manchuria and the Korean peninsula after its conquest of Liaodong in the early third century BC. =Relations with China= Buyeo became a vassal of Eastern Han in 49 AD. This was advantageous to the Chinese as an ally in the northeast would curb the threats of the Xianbei in western Manchuria and eastern Mongolia and Goguryeo in the Liaodong region and the northern Korean peninsula. The Buyeo elites also sought this arrangement as it legitimized their rule and gave them better access to Chinese prestige trade goods. During a period of turmoil in China's northeast, Buyeo attacked the some of Eastern Han's holdings in 111, but relations were mended in 120 and a military alliance was arranged. Two years later Buyeo saved the Xuantu commandery from total destruction by Goguryeo when it sent reinforcement to break the siege of the commandery seat. In 167 Buyeo attacked the Xuantu commandery but was defeated. Relations were again restored in 174. In the early 3rd century, Gongsun Du, a Chinese warlord in Liaodong, supported Buyeo to counter Xianbei in the north and Goguryeo in the east. After destroying the Gongsun family, the northern Chinese state of Cao Wei sent Guanqiu Jian to attack Goguryeo. Part of the expeditionary force led by Wang Qi (), the Grand Administrator of the Xuantu Commandery, pursued the Guguryeo court eastward through Okjeo and into the lands of the Yilou. On their return journey they were welcomed as they passed through the land of Buyeo. It brought detailed information of the kingdom to China.Ikeuchi, Hiroshi. \\"The Chinese Expeditions to Manchuria under the Wei dynasty,\\" Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 4 (1929): 71-119. p. 109 In 285 the Murong tribe of the Xianbei, led by Murong Hui, invaded Buyeo,Patricia Ebrey, Anne Walthall, „ÄäEast Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History„Äã, Cengage Learning, 2013, pp.101-102 pushing King Uiryeo (‰æùÊÖÆ) to suicide, and forcing the relocation of the court to Okjeo.Hy≈èn-h≈≠i Yi, S≈èng-su Pak, Nae-hy≈èn Yun, „ÄäNew history of Korea:Korean studies series„Äã, vol.30, Jimoondang, 2005. p.116 Considering its friendly relationship with the Jin Dynasty, Emperor Wu helped King Uira (‰æùÁæÖ) revive Buyeo. Goguryeo's attack sometime before 347 caused further decline. Having lost its stronghold on the Ashi River (within modern Harbin), Buyeo moved southwestward to Nong'an. Around 347, Buyeo was attacked by Murong Huang of the Former Yan, and King Hyeon (ÁéÑ) was captured. =Fall= According to Samguk Sagi, in 504, the tribute emissary Yesilbu mentions that the gold of Buyeo could no longer be obtainable for tribute as Buyeo had been driven out by the Malgal and the Somna and absorbed into Baekje. It is also shown that the Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei wished that Buyeo would regain its former glory. A remnant of Buyeo seems to have lingered around modern Harbin area under the influence of Goguryeo. Buyeo paid tribute once to Northern Wei in 457‚Äì8,Northeast Asian History Foundation, „ÄäJournal of Northeast Asian History„Äã, Vol.4-1-2, 2007. p.100 but otherwise seems to have been controlled by Goguryeo. In 494, Buyeo were under attack by the rising Wuji (also known as the Mohe, ), and the Buyeo court moved and surrendered to Goguryeo.La Universidad de Se√∫l, „ÄäSeoul Journal of Korean Studies,„Äã, Vol.17, 2004. p.16 =Jolbon Buyeo= Many ancient historical records indicate the \\"Jolbon Buyeo\\" (), apparently referring to the incipient Goguryeo or its capital city. In 37 BC, Jumong became the first king of Goguryeo. Jumong went on to conquer Okjeo, Dongye, and Haengin, regaining some of Buyeo and former territory of Gojoseon. Culture According to the Sanguo Zhi the Buyeo were agricultural people who occupied the northeastern lands in Manchuria beyond the great walls. The aristocratic rulers subject to the king bore the title ka (Âä†) and were distinguished from each other by animal names, such as the dog ka and horse ka. =Language= Chinese dynastic records state that the languages of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Okjeo were similar while being very different from the language of the Yilou to the east.‰∫∫ÂΩ¢‰ººÂ§´È§ò, Ë®ÄË™û‰∏çËàáÂ§´È§òÂè•È∫óÂêå. <‰∏âÂõΩÂøó> ÊåπÂ©Å, Âè§ËÇÖÊÑº‰πãÂúã‰πü.

Old Chinese and Old Sino-Korean Legacy Buyeo location In the 1930s, Chinese historian Jin Yufu (ÈáëÊØìÈªª) developed a linear model of descent for the people of Manchuria and northern Korea, from the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje, to the modern Korean nationality. Later historians of Northeast China built upon this influential model. Goguryeo and Baekje, two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, considered themselves successors of Buyeo. King Onjo, the founder of Baekje, is said to have been a son of King Dongmyeongseong, founder of Goguryeo.

Located immediately to the north-east of Central Birmingham, Aston constitutes a ward within the metropolitan authority. History Church of SS Peter & Paul, Aston. Aston was first mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as \\"Estone\\", having a mill, a priest and therefore probably a church, woodland and ploughland. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul was built in medieval times to replace an earlier church. The body of the church was rebuilt by J. A. Chatwin during the period 1879 to 1890; the 15th century tower and spire, which was partly rebuilt in 1776, being the only survivors of the medieval building. The ancient parish of Aston (known as Aston juxta Birmingham) was large. It was separated from the parish of Birmingham by AB Row, which currently exists in the Eastside of the city at just 50 yards in length. Aston, as Aston Manor, was governed by a Local Board from 1869 and was created as an Urban District Council in 1903 before being absorbed in the expansion of the County Borough of Birmingham in 1911,Overview  Aston local history  Birmingham City Council and a further part, Saltley was added in 1911. Aston Hall. Old buildings which became popular within Aston included the Aston Hippodrome and the Bartons Arms public house. Gospel Hall on Park Lane was opened in 1892 and demolished in the 1970s to be rebuilt at the top of Park Lane in 1979. The original hall had a seating capacity of 73. Another meeting place was the Ellen Knox Memorial Hall which was next door to the Midland Vinegar Brewery. The brewery was owned by the Midland Brewery Company was built around 1877. It was located on Upper Thomas Street. The brewery was a three-storey brick building with rounded corners and semi-circular windows. The roof was slated. Other industry that was located in Aston include the Premier Motor Works which produced cars during the early 20th century. The works were situated at the junction of Aston Road and Dartmouth Street. On Miller Street was a tramcar depot which had a storage capacity of 104 tramcars. It opened in 1904 latterly being operated by the City of Birmingham Tramways Company Ltd on behalf of the Urban District Council before formally passing to Birmingham Corporation Tramways on 1 January 1912.Astonbrook through Astonmanor: Aston Development Aston University. Its campus is about 1.3m south of Aston in Birmingham city centre. Aston underwent large scale redevelopment following the Second World War. South Aston was designated a renewal area involving comprehensive redevelopment of the traditional area known as \\"Aston New Town\\".BGFL: Redevelopment and Renewal The area, was more commonly called simply \\"Newtown\\" and is a large estate consisting of sixteen tower blocks, five of which have since been demolished. The project was approved in 1968. Three 20-storey tower blocks on the complex contained 354 flats alone.Emporis: Newtown, Birmingham Villa Park, home of Aston Villa F.C. Today, Aston gives its name to Aston Villa F.C. and Aston University (the campus of which is not in Aston but about 1.3 to the south in Birmingham city centre). Aston University is one of four universities in Birmingham. Aston Villa have played at Villa Park since 1897, and it has traditionally been one of the largest football grounds in England that has staged many notable matches at club and international level. The park has also hosted other sports and events including international level rugby league and rugby union. This is one of the main attractions in this town. Much of Aston consists of terraced houses that were built around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Some of these houses were demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the Aston Expressway, which links Birmingham city centre to the M6 motorway. In the late 1950s, Aston was the location of the famous 'Venus Baby' case of Cynthia Appleton (87 Fentham Road). By the early 1980s, Aston was suffering from severe deprivation with many of the terraced houses being outdated for the requirements of the time. Many of them lacked bathrooms and indoor toilets, whilst the vast majority were suffering from decay as a result of a lack of maintenance. There was speculation that the homes would be demolished, but Birmingham City Council made money available to the homeowners for them to be brought up to modern standards. From 2001 to 2011, Aston underwent a ¬£54 million Birmingham regeneration project named \\"Aston Pride\\", as part of the New Deal for Communities scheme in 2001. Many improvements were made, including reducing burglary, robbery and vehicle crime; spending ¬£4 million on a health centre; and helping more than 1300 people find work (more than the target of 400). Crime Crime levels in Aston have remained stagnant in recent years. In December 2010, there were 369 reported crimes, the majority being for antisocial behaviour, while in December 2019, there were 328, mostly for violent offences. The crime rate in the ward is 10.35, which is higher than in other areas like Handsworth Wood (6.59) but lower than Nechells (16.6). The majority of the crime is due to violence, antisocial behaviour, vehicle crime, and robbery. On 2 January 2003, gunmen shot at three innocent teenage girls who were celebrating the New Year in the Birchfield area near Aston. Two of the girls were killed and another was seriously injured. More than 18 bullets were fired from at least two weapons. Four men were later tried and found guilty of murder in March 2005. Marcus Ellis (the half-brother of one of the two dead girls), Nathan Martin and Michael Gregory were sentenced to life imprisonment with recommended minimum terms of 35 years on two charges of murder and three of attempted murder. A fourth man, Rodrigo Simms, received life with a recommended minimum of 27 years for the same crimes.Life sentences for New Year killers  The Independent A fifth defendant, Jermaine Carty, had walked free from court after being cleared of possessing a firearm. The four men convicted were members of a notorious local gang known as the Burger Bar Boys, who had been trying to gain revenge on members of their rival gang the Johnson Crew: a notorious local gang originating in the mid-1980s. Politics The Aston ward is represented by two Labour councillors: Muhammad Afzal and Nagina Kauser. In 2004, the ward saw a voter fraud scandal in which Labour councillors were accused of a systematic attempt to rig elections.

It is a very ethnically diverse community, with 44% of the population born outside the United Kingdom. The largest ethnic group was Asian at 69.1%. More specifically, the Pakistani ethnic group was the largest at 30.9% of all Asians. Black British was the second largest ethnic group at 16.4%. White British was the third largest ethnic group at 7.8%. The ethnic makeup of the area drastically changed in the 1950s and 1960s with immigration from the Commonwealth. Most of the immigrants were from the Indian subcontinent, though a significant number were from the Caribbean. A38 motorway Aston is a young ward, with 33.5% of the population under 18, compared to the Birmingham average of 25.5%. 31.7% of residents in Aston have no qualifications, higher than the Birmingham average of 20.8%.

Education King Edward VI Aston School Aston Library There are three secondary schools in Aston: Broadway Academy, refurbished and opened by the Duke of Kent in 2011, King Edward VI Aston, the only grammar school in the constituency, Aston Manor School and Eden Boys' Leadership Academy. There are seven primary schools: Aston Tower Community Primary School, Birchfield Community School, Manor Park Primary Academy, Mansfield Green E-ACT Academy, Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School, Prince Albert Primary School, and Yew Tree Community School. There are two libraries in the ward: Aston Library and Birchfield Library. Aston Library was due to be shut down by Birmingham City Council in 2017 to save money; however, this decision was reversed after public consultation. It is now run by community organisations. = Aston Cross = Aston Cross was once the home of Ansells Brewery and HP Sauce. The six- acre Aston site was purchased by developer Chancerygate in 2007 at ¬£800,000 per acre, but they subsequently sold it for half that price and it now houses a distribution warehouse for East End Foods. Aston Manor Brewery was started in Thimble Mill Lane in 1982 by former employees of Ansell's after Ansell's Aston Brewery closed. From 1956 to 1969, Aston Cross was the Midlands base of television broadcaster ATV which had its Alpha Studios on Aston Road North. The ATV office building later became the studios of radio stations BRMB and XTRA-AM. Although both stations moved to Birmingham's Broad Street in the early 1990s, the building is still called Radio House. Launching in February 1974, BRMB was the UK's fourth commercial radio station and, while in Aston, was the most listened to station in the West Midlands.

There are two further statues of Winged Victory found in the Samothrace temple complex: a Roman copy found by a team of Austrian archaeologists, now at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and a third Winged Victory found by Dr. Phyllis Williams Lehmann in 1949, now in a museum at the Samothrace site. ( ') is a marble Hellenistic sculpture of Nike (the Greek goddess of victory), that was created in about the 2nd century BC. Since 1884, it has been prominently displayed at the Louvre and is one of the most celebrated sculptures in the world. H. W. Janson described it as \\"the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture\\". The sculpture is one of a small number of major Hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than Roman copies. Only Winged Victory right wing isn't original, and was added by mirroring the left wing. Date and context The context of the Winged Victory of Samothrace, discovered in 1863, is controversial, with proposals ranging from the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC to the Battle of Actium in 31 BC as the event being celebrated. Datings based on stylistic evaluation have been equally variable, ranging across the same three centuries, but perhaps tending to an earlier date.Smith, 78 For much of the 20th century, the prevailing theory, based on the works of Hermann Thiersch and Karl Lehmann, considered it a Rhodian monument dedicated following the victories at Side and Myonessos in 190 BC, and suggested that it might have been carved by the Rhodian sculptor Pythocritus. However, by the mid-2010s, the reconstructions of the monument proposed by Lehmann have been shown to be false (the remains of the surrounding space that housed the Victory belong to the Roman period), and the question of why the statue was dedicated on Samothrace, which at the time was dominated by the Greek Kingdom of Macedonia, remains unanswered. Description The statue is high.Honour, H. and J. Fleming, (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 174. It was created not only to honour the goddess, Nike, but probably also to commemorate a naval action. It conveys a sense of action and triumph as well as portraying artful flowing drapery, as though the goddess were descending to alight upon the prow of a ship. Modern excavations suggest that the Victory occupied a niche above a theater and also suggest it accompanied an altar that was within view of the ship monument of Demetrius I Poliorcetes (337‚Äì283 BC). Rendered in grey and white Thasian and Parian marble, the figure originally formed part of the Samothrace temple complex dedicated to the Great gods, Megaloi Theoi. It stood on a rostral pedestal of gray marble from Lartos representing the prow of a ship (most likely a trihemiolia), and represents the goddess as she descends from the skies to the triumphant fleet. Before she lost her arms, which have never been recovered, Nike's right arm is believed to have been raised,The flex of her torso reveals the movement of her missing arm. cupped round her mouth to deliver the shout of Victory.Louvre Website: the discovery of her right hand, identified by Phyllis Williams Lehmann, now also at the Louvre, settled questions of her gesture, whether to bring a trumpet to her lips as she is depicted on earlier coins or bearing a wreath to crown the naval victor. The work is notable for its convincing rendering of a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet, for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, compellingly depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze. Similar traits can be seen in the Laoco√∂n group which is a reworked copy of a lost original that was likely close both in time and place of origin to Nike, but while Laoco√∂n, vastly admired by Renaissance and classicist artists, has come to be seen as a more self- conscious and contrived work, Nike of Samothrace is seen as an iconic depiction of triumphant spirit and of the divine momentarily coming face to face with man. The statue's outstretched right wing is a symmetric plaster version of the original left one. The stylistic portrayal of the wings is a source of scholarly discussion, as the feather pattern resembles neither the wings of birds in nature nor wings in Greek art. As with the arms, the figure's head has never been found, but various other fragments have since been found: in 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's Winged Victory. The fingerless hand had slid out of sight under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood; on the return trip home, Dr Phyllis Williams Lehmann identified the tip of the Goddess's ring finger and her thumb in a storage drawer at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, where the second Winged Victory is displayed; the fragments have been reunited with the hand,New York Times, Obituary of Phyllis Williams Lehmann, 16 October 2004. which is now in a glass case in the Louvre next to the podium on which the statue stands. The different degree of finishing of the sides has led scholars to think that it was intended to be seen from three-quarters on the left. A partial inscription on the base of the statue includes the word \\"Rhodios\\" (Rhodian), indicating that the statue was commissioned to celebrate a naval victory by Rhodes, at that time the most powerful maritime state in the Aegean which in itself would date the statue to 288 BC at the earliest. History The statue was carefully lowered down a ramp in 1939 when it was removed from the Louvre and Paris for safekeeping. The sculptor is unknown,Waxman, Sharon, Lost: The Battle over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World. Time Books, 2008, p. 82. although Paul MacKendrick suggests that Pythokritos of Lindos is responsible.MacKendrick, Paul, The Greek Stones Speak, Norton & Company 1962 When first discovered on the island of Samothrace (then part of the Ottoman Empire and called Semadirek) and published in 1863, it was suggested that the Victory was erected by the Macedonian general Demetrius Poliorcetes after his naval victory at Cyprus, between 295 and 289 BC. The Archaeological Museum of Samothrace continues to follow these originally established provenance and dates.Hatzfeld pointed out in 1910 that Samothrace was in the possession of Demetrios' bitter personal enemy Lysimachus, who would not have permitted the erection of such a monument. Ceramic evidence discovered in recent excavations has revealed that the pedestal was set up about 200 BC, though some scholars still date it as early as 250 BC or as late as 180.Haskell, Francis and Nicholas Penny. (1981) Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500‚Äì1900. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 333. Certainly, the parallels with figures and drapery from the Pergamon Altar (dated about 170 BC) seem strong. The evidence for a Rhodian commission of the statue has been questioned, however, and the closest artistic parallel to the Nike of Samothrace are figures depicted on Macedonian coins.Smith, 1991. Hellenistic Sculpture (World of Art). Samothrace was an important sanctuary for the Hellenistic Macedonian kings. The most likely battle commemorated by this monument is, perhaps, the Battle of Cos in 255 BC, in which Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedonia won over the fleet of Ptolemy II of Egypt.Burn, 2005. Hellenistic Art: From Alexander the Great to Augustus. In April 1863, the Victory was discovered by the then French consul in Adrianopolis and amateur archaeologist Charles Champoiseau (1830‚Äì1909), who sent it to Paris in the same year. The statue has been reassembled in stages since its discovery. The prow was reconstructed from marble debris at the site by Champoiseau in 1879 and assembled in situ before being shipped to Paris. After 1884, the statue was positioned where it would visually dominate the Daru staircase.The monumental Escalier Daru designed by Hector Lefuel to replace the former staircase of the Mus√©e Napol√©on was constructed from 1855 to 1857 in the Pavillon Daru, named for a minister of Napoleon III. At the fall of the Second Empire it remained incomplete; it was finished in 1883 as a setting for the Victory of Samothrace (Louvre website). Since 1883, the marble figure has been displayed in the Louvre, while a plaster replica stands at the original location of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace. In the autumn of 1939, the Winged Victory was removed from her perch in anticipation of the outbreak of World War II. All the museums of Paris were closed on August 25. Artwork and objects were packed for removal to locations deemed safer outside Paris for safekeeping. On the night of September 3, the statue descended the staircase on a wooden ramp which was constructed across the steps.Nicholas, Lynn H. (1994) The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, pp. 54‚Äì55. ; OCLC 246524635 During the years of World War II, the statue was sheltered in safety in the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay along with the Venus de Milo and Michelangelo's Slaves.Nicholas, p. 87. The discovery in the 1950s of the palm of the right hand and two fingers established that this hand was meant to show a simple gesture of statue and was not holding an object; the partial hand is stored next to the statue. Canvassing the Masterpieces ‚Ä¢ The Winged Victory of Samothrace August 29, 2019. 2013‚Äì14 restoration The Winged Victory of Samothrace, side view In 2013 a restoration effort was launched to improve the appearance of the sculpture. This was the first detailed examination of the individual pieces of the sculpture to date. The restoration aimed to restore the marble to its original hue which had been tarnished by time. The sculpture was removed from its base and carried into an adjoining room which was transformed for the occasion into a restoration workshop. The base was dismantled block by block and placed in the workshop. Scientific reviews were performed on the base (UV, Infrared, X-ray spectroscopy) prior to cleaning the surface of the marble. This effort aimed to respect the goals of the original restoration performed in 1883. The surface of the base was cleaned and then reassembled, and some gaps in the marble were repaired. Upon completion of the restoration, the statue was reunited with its base and returned to its prior position at the head of the Daru staircase in the Louvre. Assessment, reception and influence The Winged Victory of Samothrace, before restoration Despite its significant damage and incompleteness, the Victory is held to be one of the great surviving masterpieces of sculpture from the Hellenistic Period, and from the entire Greco-Roman era. The statue shows a mastery of form and movement which has impressed critics and artists since its discovery. It is considered one of the Louvre's greatest treasures, and since the late 19th century it has been displayed in the most dramatic fashion, at the head of the sweeping Daru staircase. The art historian H. W. Janson has pointed out that unlike earlier Greek or Near Eastern sculptures, Nike creates a deliberate relationship to the imaginary space around the goddess. The wind that has carried her and which she is fighting off, straining to keep steady ‚Äì as mentioned the original mounting had her standing on a ship's prow, just having landed ‚Äì is the invisible complement of the figure and the viewer is made to imagine it. At the same time, this expanded space heightens the symbolic force of the work; the wind and the sea are suggested as metaphors of struggle, destiny and divine help or grace. This kind of interplay between a statue and the space conjured up would become a common device in baroque and romantic art, about two thousand years later. It is present in Michelangelo's sculpture of David: David's gaze and pose shows where he is seeing his adversary Goliath and his awareness of the moment ‚Äì but it is rare in ancient art. The Victory soon became a cultural icon to which artists responded in many different ways. For example, Abbott Handerson Thayer's A Virgin (1892‚Äì93) is a well-known painted allusion. When Filippo Tommaso Marinetti issued his Futurist Manifesto in 1909, he chose to contrast his movement with the supposedly defunct artistic sentiments of the Winged Victory: \\"a race-automobile which seems to rush over exploding powder is more beautiful than the 'Victory of Samothrace. The 1913 sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space by the Futuristic sculptor Umberto Boccioni, currently located at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, was influenced by the statue, and is said to bear an underlying resemblance to it.Museum of Modern Art, New York: Unique Forms of Continuity in Space. Campaign for repatriation On February 3, 1999, according to the Macedonian Press Agency: News in English, \\"residents of the Aegean island of Samothrace, the birthplace of the renowned Greek sculpture Nike of Samothrace, aka the Winged Victory, embarked on a letter-writing campaign to have this finest extant of Hellenistic sculpture returned to their homeland. In a letter signed by the island's mayor, the locals urged Greek politicians to intervene and request that the Louvre museum, where the statue is kept, acknowledge that the sculpture belongs in its natural environment.\\" The Greek Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs asked again for its return in 2013.

The first FIFA World Cup Trophy, commissioned in 1930 and designed by Abel Lafleur, was based on the model. This statue was a favorite of architect Frank Lloyd Wright and he used reproductions of it in a number of his buildings, including Ward Willits House, Darwin D. Martin House and Storer House. The largest public sculpture based on Nike appears in a prominent position atop the massive Pennsylvania State Memorial at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia sculptor Samuel Murray, a student and intimate of painter Thomas Eakins, produced the 28-foot figure in 1911 with possible influence from Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Nike interpretation on the Sherman Memorial in New York City (1903). Saint-Gaudens depicts Nike with her right arm raised while it is thought the original Nike was not making such gesture. Saint-Gaudens' Nike also wears a laurel wreath on her head and bears a large olive branch in her left hand. Murray adapted the laurel wreath and olive branch innovations but also placed a sword in Nike's raised right hand. Starting in 1962, Yves Klein produced a series of plaster replicas of the Nike coated in dry pigment of his signature International Klein Blue affixed by resin entitled Victoire de Samatrace. Swedish author Gunnar Ekel√∂f made Nike a central image in his poem Samothrace, written in 1941,In Ekel√∂f, Non Serviam, Bonniers, Stockholm 1945, and in later collected editions of his poems. where the faceless deity, arms outstretched like sails, is made into a symbol of the fight and the coming victory against Nazism and the struggle for freedom throughout history. It also features in the Matthew Reilly novel Seven Ancient Wonders, where it is fictionally made part of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. A full-size replica of the statue sits in The Ohio State University's Thompson Library in Columbus, Ohio. Another full size replica stands in the lobby of Crouse College, home to the Setnor School of Music, at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. A replica of the sculpture stands at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut. The second-largest replica of this statue in the United States stands at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is high. Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas has a replica which was purchased from the Louvre and shipped from Paris in 1982. This replica is actually a replacement of the original 1929 replica given to commemorate Armistice Day and the defeat of autocracy. A replica of the statue sits overlooking the Veterans area of the Skylawn Memorial Park in San Mateo, California. The Estrugamou Building in Buenos Aires, Argentina was built in four sections, arranged around a patio adorned with a bronze copy of the iconic Winged Victory of Samothrace. The Cape Town Cenotaph is topped by a replica of the Winged Victory of Samothrace by British sculptor Vernon March. Another plaster replica adorns the atrium of Technische Universit√§t Berlin. The replica was a gift by French universities to the TU Berlin in 1956. Augustus Saint-Gaudens' 1903 William Tecumseh Sherman statue of General William Tecumseh Sherman in Grand Army Plaza, New York City, depicts a robed, winged Nike leading Sherman while holding a palm branch, as a symbol of his victory in the Civil War and the peace to follow. The Golden Nica Award presented by the Prix Ars Electronica is a replica of Winged Victory of Samothrace. Graffiti artist Banksy created CCTV Angel in 2006 depicting a robed, winged figure with a CCTV camera for a head, as a statement on the overreach with security surveillance in society. Hip Hop artist Killer Mike of the group Run the Jewels has a gold replica of Winged Victory of Samothrace as his signature chain. Several scenes in The Carters' (Beyonc√© and Jay-Z) music video APES**T are filmed in the Louvre in front of The Winged Victory of Samothrace.

Noticeable for its original architecture, the church is dedicated to Joan of Arc. The style of this church is controversial among the inhabitants of Nice, judged ugly by some. The church is sometime nicknamed \\"the Meringue\\" for its white color. History In 1914, Father Quillery was appointed parish priest of the new parish of Saint J√©rome. The first projects for a new church are proposed. French architect Louis Castel initiated in 1914 its construction and built a crypt. After World War I, another French architect Jacques Droz constructed in 1924 a second crypt. Both crypts are the support of the new building. In 1931 a concrete basement is laid over the two crypts. Between 1932 and 1934, the church was built using reinforced concrete. Droz employed the technique of the thin shell concrete for the domes that have a thickness of at the base but only at the top. Architecture The use of reinforced concrete, a new material at that time, allowed an original construction in a style influenced by Art Deco. Eight ellipsoidal domes support three larger ovoid domes. In the interior, these three large domes are only supported by four pillars, which allows an astonishing interior volume with high vaults. The angular form of the steeple is in opposition with the strong curves of the domes. The fresco paintings of the stations of the Cross were executed by Eug√®ne Klementieff in 1934. The paintings are influenced by Russian Cubism, Italian Quattrocento and Byzantine Orthodox icons.

It is adjacent to, and shares its main lake with, Sandwell Valley Country Park and near the settlement of Hamstead. In March 2010 the visitor centre was destroyed in an arson attack. A new centre has replaced it. Location The reserve is located around the eastern and northern edges of the Forge Mill Lake, a storm water retention basin within a meander of the River Tame. The reserve is surrounded by the West Midlands conurbation and is close to the edges of Birmingham and Walsall, as well as West Bromwich. It is close to the M5 motorway, M6 motorway and the A34 road. There is a vehicle access to the study centre from Tanhouse Avenue. It can also be accessed via the network of paths crossing Sandwell Valley - with particular ease from the car park serving Forge Mill Farm, on Park Lane. Features The reserve is of particular importance for its educational work with visiting school parties. A bird hide, on stilts in the lake and reached by a drawbridge, allows close views of birds on the lake, its shores, and its islands - one of which has been situated directly in front of the hide. There are also a number of substantial screens, which are available at all times and afford good views of birds on the wetland areas surrounding the lake. The site, formerly a landfill, has been carefully planted with a wide range of native trees and shrubs, to provide a rich and diverse habitat. The reserve has a pair of entrance gates by the artist Tim Tolkien. The former visitor centre had a carpet designed for the reserve by the artist Greg Poole, but this was lost in the 2010 fire. Species A Lane at Hamstead, Staffordshire by William Ellis (1747-1810), now in the Garman Ryan Collection at The New Art Gallery Walsall shows the area in more rural times The lake and smaller pools are home to a wide range of water fowl and also play host to migrating birds. Among the species that attract birdwatchers to the hide are the goosander, lapwings, common snipe, little ringed plover and whitethroat. The growing bio- diversity of the slopes attracts a very large range of wildlife, and therefore a number of raptors, including buzzards. Other birds that have been seen on the reserve include Cetti's warbler, and a female smew. Common and Mediterranean gulls are seen annually on the reserve. Black-tailed godwits are seen every few years on the reserve. The main summer breeding birds seen on the reserve include common tern, little ringed plover, oystercatcher and many more. Summer warblers seen on the reserve include sedge warbler, reed warbler, whitethroat, chiffchaff, willow warbler and grasshopper warbler. Coot are a common breeder on the reserve but are often less successful. Winter bird species seen include wigeon, teal, common snipe, jack snipe, goosander, and goldeneye. Water rail are seen more regularly in the winter with numbers going up to four individuals in 2013. Some of the reserves star species are the lapwings that breed there annually, but again like the coot, they are less successful mainly due to predation. Ringed-necked parakeets are regularly seen on the reserve.

The Gospel of Nicodemus, also known as the Acts of Pilate (; ), is an apocryphal gospel claimed to have been derived from an original Hebrew work written by Nicodemus, who appears in the Gospel of John as an associate of Jesus. The title \\"Gospel of Nicodemus\\" is medieval in origin. The dates of its accreted sections are uncertain, but according to the 1907 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia scholars agree in assigning the resulting work to the middle of the fourth century AD. The section about Pilate is an older text found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul and, according to the surviving version\\"The Apocryphal New Testament\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20150705090754/http://folk.uio.no/lukeb/books/apocrypha/Gospel_of_Nicodemus.pdf, is an official document from Pontius Pilate (or composed from reports at the praetorium at Jerusalem) reporting events in Judea to Emperor Tiberius, and referring to the crucifixion of Jesus, as well as his miracles.  History and authenticity  The oldest sections of the book appear first in Greek. The text contains multiple parts, which are uneven in style and would seem to be by different hands. According to the Acts of Pilate, the original version was preserved in the praetorium at Jerusalem.\\"The Apocryphal New Testament\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20150705090754/http://folk.uio.no/lukeb/books/apocrypha/Gospel_of_Nicodemus.pdf The question of the original language is debated. Beyond Greek, the versions in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Slavonic, and other languages have survived. The prevailing view is that the Christian Acts of Pilate were first devised and published as a counter blast to the pagan Acts.. It can be shown, that the work behind the Christian Acts of Pilate must have originated very early. \\"The first part of the book, containing the story of the Passion and Resurrection, is not earlier than the fourth century. Its object in the main is to furnish irrefragable testimony to the resurrection. Attempts have been made to show that it is of early date-that it is, for instance, the writing which Justin Martyr meant when in his Apology he referred his heathen readers to the ‚ÄôActs‚Äô of Christ‚Äôs trial preserved among the archives of Rome. The truth of that matter is that he simply assumed that such records must exist. False ‚Äôacts‚Äô of the trial were written in the Pagan interest under Maximin, and introduced into schools early in the fourth century. It is imagined by some that our book was a counterblast to these. The account of the Descent into Hell (Part II) is an addition to the Acta. It does not appear in any Oriental version, and the Greek copies are rare. It is in Latin that it has chiefly flourished, and has been the parent of versions in every European language.\\"  Core texts  The main body of the Gospel of Nicodemus is in two parts, with an appendix, Descensus ad Infernos (the Harrowing of Hell). The first part (chapters i-xi) contains the trial of Jesus based upon Luke 23. In addition to the Greek and Latin witnesses of the first part, there are three other notable ancient versions including Syriac or Aramaic (also known as Hebrew in the 1st century), Armenian, and Coptic. The second part (xii-xvi) concerns the Resurrection. In it, Leucius and Charinus, the two souls raised from the dead after the Crucifixion, relate to the Sanhedrin the circumstances of the descent of Christ to Limbo. A literature of miracle-tale romance developed around a conflated \\"Leucius Charinus\\" as an author of further texts. The Harrowing of Hell episode depicts St Dismas accompanying Christ in Hell, and the deliverance of the righteous Old Testament patriarchs. An appended text is a written report made by Pontius Pilate to Claudius, containing a description of the crucifixion, as well as an account of the resurrection of Jesus; both are presented as an official report. One series of Latin manuscripts includes as an appendix or continuation, the episode Cura Sanitatis Tiberii (\\"The Cure of Tiberius\\"), the oldest form of the Veronica legend, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, in which Emperor Tiberius is cured of his malady. (Compare the legend of the Image of Edessa.)  Dating and readership  As the Church historian Eusebius of Caesarea (writing c. 325) shows no acquaintance with this Gospel, historians assume that it postdates this time. Eusebius was aware of related texts: the \\"Letters of Pilate\\" referred to by Justin and Tertullian as well as an anti-Christian text called Acts of Pilate, which was prescribed for reading in schools under the emperor Maximinus during the Diocletianic Persecution. \\"We are forced to admit that [the Christian Acts of Pilate] is of later origin, and scholars agree in assigning it to the middle of the fourth century.\\" Epiphanius refers to an Acta Pilati (c. 376), but the extant Greek texts show evidence of later editing. Justin Martyr wrote, \\"And that these things did happen, you can ascertain from the Acts of Pontius Pilate.\\" The Apology letters were written and addressed by name to the Roman Emperor Pius and the Roman Governor Urbicus. All three of these men lived between AD 138 - 161\\\\. The Acta Pilati have had a long history inspiring devotional works. A Meditatione sopra la Passione del nostro signore Iesu Christo, drawing in part on Acta Pilati for its expanded anecdotal elements in the Passion, was printed twenty-eight times in Italy between about 1476 and 1500, and inspired the depiction of Christ before Pilate by Pontormo.  Naming of New Testament figures  The Gospel of Nicodemus names several minor New Testament figures who were not named in the canonical texts; for example, the soldier who speared Jesus on the cross is named as Longinus and the two criminals crucified beside Jesus are named as Dismas and Gestas. See also *List of Gospels  References   External links  *The Report of Pilate to the Emperor Claudius e-text, M.R.

The general form of the metric follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy; Einstein's field equations are only needed to derive the scale factor of the universe as a function of time. Depending on geographical or historical preferences, the set of the four scientists ‚Äì Alexander Friedmann, Georges Lema√Ætre, Howard P. Robertson and Arthur Geoffrey Walker ‚Äì are customarily grouped as Friedmann or Friedmann‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker (FRW) or Robertson‚ÄìWalker (RW) or Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre (FL). This model is sometimes called the Standard Model of modern cosmology, although such a description is also associated with the further developed Lambda-CDM model. The FLRW model was developed independently by the named authors in the 1920s and 1930s.  General metric  The FLRW metric starts with the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of space. It also assumes that the spatial component of the metric can be time-dependent. The generic metric which meets these conditions is :\\\\- c^2 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau^2 = - c^2 \\\\mathrm{d}t^2 + {a(t)}^2 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^2 where \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} ranges over a 3-dimensional space of uniform curvature, that is, elliptical space, Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space. It is normally written as a function of three spatial coordinates, but there are several conventions for doing so, detailed below. \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} does not depend on t ‚Äî all of the time dependence is in the function a(t), known as the \\"scale factor\\". =Reduced-circumference polar coordinates= In reduced- circumference polar coordinates the spatial metric has the form :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^2, \\\\quad \\\\text{where } \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^2 = \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\phi^2. k is a constant representing the curvature of the space. There are two common unit conventions: *k may be taken to have units of length‚àí2, in which case r has units of length and a(t) is unitless. k is then the Gaussian curvature of the space at the time when a(t) = 1. r is sometimes called the reduced circumference because it is equal to the measured circumference of a circle (at that value of r), centered at the origin, divided by 2 (like the r of Schwarzschild coordinates). Where appropriate, a(t) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} measures comoving distance. *Alternatively, k may be taken to belong to the set {‚àí1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then r is unitless and a(t) has units of length. When k = ¬±1, a(t) is the radius of curvature of the space, and may also be written R(t). A disadvantage of reduced circumference coordinates is that they cover only half of the 3-sphere in the case of positive curvature‚Äîcircumferences beyond that point begin to decrease, leading to degeneracy. (This is not a problem if space is elliptical, i.e. a 3-sphere with opposite points identified.) =Hyperspherical coordinates= In hyperspherical or curvature-normalized coordinates the coordinate r is proportional to radial distance; this gives :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^2 = \\\\mathrm{d}r^2 + S_k(r)^2 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^2 where \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} is as before and :S_k(r) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\sqrt{k}^{\\\\,-1} \\\\sin (r \\\\sqrt{k}), &k; > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ r, &k; = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{k}^{\\\\,-1} \\\\sinh (r \\\\sqrt{k}), &k; < 0\\\\. \\\\end{cases} As before, there are two common unit conventions: *k may be taken to have units of length‚àí2, in which case r has units of length and a(t ) is unitless. k is then the Gaussian curvature of the space at the time when a(t ) = 1. Where appropriate, a(t ) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} measures comoving distance. *Alternatively, as before, k may be taken to belong to the set {‚àí1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then r is unitless and a(t ) has units of length. When k = ¬±1, a(t) is the radius of curvature of the space, and may also be written R(t ). Note that, when k = +1, r is essentially a third angle along with Œ∏ and œÜ. The letter œá may be used instead of r. Though it is usually defined piecewise as above, S is an analytic function of both k and r. It can also be written as a power series :S_k(r) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^n k^n r^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = r - \\\\frac{k r^3}{6} + \\\\frac{k^2 r^5}{120} - \\\\cdots or as :S_k(r) = r \\\\; \\\\mathrm{sinc} \\\\, (r \\\\sqrt{k}) where sinc is the unnormalized sinc function and \\\\sqrt{k} is one of the imaginary, zero or real square roots of k. These definitions are valid for all k. =Cartesian coordinates= When k = 0 one may write simply :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^2 = \\\\mathrm{d}x^2 + \\\\mathrm{d}y^2 + \\\\mathrm{d}z^2. This can be extended to k ‚â† 0 by defining : x = r \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\,, : y = r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\phi \\\\,, and : z = r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\phi \\\\,, where r is one of the radial coordinates defined above, but this is rare. Curvature = Cartesian coordinates = In flat (k=0) FLRW space using Cartesian coordinates, the surviving components of the Ricci tensor are : R_{tt} = - 3 \\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}}{a}, \\\\quad R_{xx}= R_{yy} = R_{zz} = c^{-2} (a \\\\ddot{a} + 2 \\\\dot{a}^2) and the Ricci scalar is : R = 6 c^{-2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)} + \\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}^2(t)}{a^2(t)}\\\\right). = Spherical coordinates = In more general FLRW space using spherical coordinates (called \\"reduced-circumference polar coordinates\\" above), the surviving components of the Ricci tensor are : R_{tt} = - 3 \\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}}{a}, :R_{rr}=\\\\frac{c^{-2}(a(t)\\\\ddot{a}(t) + 2\\\\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k}{1 - kr^2} : R_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} = r^2(c^{-2}(a(t)\\\\ddot{a}(t) + 2\\\\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k) :R_{\\\\phi\\\\phi} =r^2(c^{-2}(a(t)\\\\ddot{a}(t) + 2\\\\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k)\\\\sin^2(\\\\theta) and the Ricci scalar is : R = 6 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}(t)}{c^2 a(t)} + \\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}^2(t)}{c^2 a^2(t)} + \\\\frac{k}{a^2(t)}\\\\right). Solutions Einstein's field equations are not used in deriving the general form for the metric: it follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy. However, determining the time evolution of a(t) does require Einstein's field equations together with a way of calculating the density, \\\\rho (t), such as a cosmological equation of state. This metric has an analytic solution to Einstein's field equations G_{\\\\mu u} + \\\\Lambda g_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\\\\mu u} giving the Friedmann equations when the energy‚Äìmomentum tensor is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The resulting equations are: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\dot a}{a}\\\\right)^{2} + \\\\frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^{2}}{3} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{3}\\\\rho :2\\\\frac{\\\\ddot a}{a} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\dot a}{a}\\\\right)^{2} + \\\\frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \\\\Lambda c^{2} = -\\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^{2}} p. These equations are the basis of the standard Big Bang cosmological model including the current ŒõCDM model.Their solutions can be found in Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the Big Bang model cannot account for the observed lumpiness of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies, stars or people, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models which calculate the lumpiness in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the observable universe is well approximated by an almost FLRW model, i.e., a model which follows the FLRW metric apart from primordial density fluctuations. , the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from COBE and WMAP. If the spacetime is multiply connected, then each event will be represented by more than one tuple of coordinates. =Interpretation= The pair of equations given above is equivalent to the following pair of equations :{\\\\dot \\\\rho} = - 3 \\\\frac{\\\\dot a}{a}\\\\left(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\\\right) :\\\\frac{\\\\ddot a}{a} = - \\\\frac{4\\\\pi G}{3}\\\\left(\\\\rho + \\\\frac{3p}{c^{2}}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^{2}}{3} with k, the spatial curvature index, serving as a constant of integration for the first equation. The first equation can be derived also from thermodynamical considerations and is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, assuming the expansion of the universe is an adiabatic process (which is implicitly assumed in the derivation of the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric). The second equation states that both the energy density and the pressure cause the expansion rate of the universe {\\\\dot a} to decrease, i.e., both cause a deceleration in the expansion of the universe. This is a consequence of gravitation, with pressure playing a similar role to that of energy (or mass) density, according to the principles of general relativity. The cosmological constant, on the other hand, causes an acceleration in the expansion of the universe. =Cosmological constant= The cosmological constant term can be omitted if we make the following replacements :\\\\rho \\\\rightarrow \\\\rho + \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^{2}}{8 \\\\pi G} :p \\\\rightarrow p - \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^{4}}{8 \\\\pi G}. Therefore, the cosmological constant can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy which has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density: :p = - \\\\rho c^2. \\\\, Such form of energy‚Äîa generalization of the notion of a cosmological constant‚Äîis known as dark energy. In fact, in order to get a term which causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a scalar field which satisfies :p < \\\\- \\\\frac {\\\\rho c^2} {3}. \\\\, Such a field is sometimes called quintessence. =Newtonian interpretation= This is due to McCrea and Milne, although sometimes incorrectly ascribed to Friedmann. The Friedmann equations are equivalent to this pair of equations: : \\\\- a^3 {\\\\dot \\\\rho} = 3 a^2 {\\\\dot a} \\\\rho + \\\\frac{3 a^2 p {\\\\dot a}}{c^2} \\\\, :\\\\frac{{\\\\dot a}^2}{2} - \\\\frac{G \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi a^3}{3} \\\\rho}{a} = - \\\\frac{k c^2}{2} \\\\,. The first equation says that the decrease in the mass contained in a fixed cube (whose side is momentarily a) is the amount which leaves through the sides due to the expansion of the universe plus the mass equivalent of the work done by pressure against the material being expelled. This is the conservation of mass‚Äìenergy (first law of thermodynamics) contained within a part of the universe. The second equation says that the kinetic energy (seen from the origin) of a particle of unit mass moving with the expansion plus its (negative) gravitational potential energy (relative to the mass contained in the sphere of matter closer to the origin) is equal to a constant related to the curvature of the universe. In other words, the energy (relative to the origin) of a co-moving particle in free- fall is conserved. General relativity merely adds a connection between the spatial curvature of the universe and the energy of such a particle: positive total energy implies negative curvature and negative total energy implies positive curvature. The cosmological constant term is assumed to be treated as dark energy and thus merged into the density and pressure terms. During the Planck epoch, one cannot neglect quantum effects. So they may cause a deviation from the Friedmann equations.  Name and history  The Soviet mathematician Alexander Friedmann first derived the main results of the FLRW model in 1922 and 1924. English trans. in 'General Relativity and Gravitation' 1999 vol.31, 31‚Äì Although the prestigious physics journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik published his work, it remained relatively unnoticed by his contemporaries. Friedmann was in direct communication with Albert Einstein, who, on behalf of Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik, acted as the scientific referee of Friedmann's work. Eventually Einstein acknowledged the correctness of Friedmann's calculations, but failed to appreciate the physical significance of Friedmann's predictions. Friedmann died in 1925. In 1927, Georges Lema√Ætre, a Belgian priest, astronomer and periodic professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven, arrived independently at results similar to those of Friedmann and published them in the Annales de la Soci√©t√© Scientifique de Bruxelles (Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels). translated from In the face of the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe obtained by Edwin Hubble in the late 1920s, Lema√Ætre's results were noticed in particular by Arthur Eddington, and in 1930‚Äì31 Lema√Ætre's paper was translated into English and published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Howard P. Robertson from the US and Arthur Geoffrey Walker from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lema√Ætre). This solution, often called the Robertson‚ÄìWalker metric since they proved its generic properties, is different from the dynamical \\"Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre\\" models, which are specific solutions for a(t) which assume that the only contributions to stress‚Äìenergy are cold matter (\\"dust\\"), radiation, and a cosmological constant.  Einstein's radius of the universe  Einstein's radius of the universe is the radius of curvature of space of Einstein's universe, a long- abandoned static model that was supposed to represent our universe in idealized form. Putting :\\\\dot{a} = \\\\ddot{a} = 0 in the Friedmann equation, the radius of curvature of space of this universe (Einstein's radius) is :R_E=c/\\\\sqrt {4\\\\pi G\\\\rho}, where c is the speed of light, G is the Newtonian gravitational constant, and \\\\rho is the density of space of this universe. The numerical value of Einstein's radius is of the order of 1010 light years.  Evidence  By combining the observation data from some experiments such as WMAP and Planck with theoretical results of Ehlers‚ÄìGeren‚ÄìSachs theorem and its generalization,See pp. 351ff. in . The original work is Ehlers, J., Geren, P., Sachs, R.K.: Isotropic solutions of Einstein-Liouville equations. J. Math. Phys. 9, 1344 (1968). For the generalization, see . astrophysicists now agree that the universe is almost homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged over a very large scale) and thus nearly a FLRW spacetime.

It is the oldest well-preserved, surviving, illustrated biblical codex.  Description  The text is a fragment of the Book of Genesis in the Greek Septuagint translation. The text is frequently abbreviated. There are twenty-four surviving folios each with miniatures at the bottom of both sides. It is thought that there were originally about ninety-six folios and 192 illustrations. It is written in uncials with silver ink on calfskin vellum dyed a rich purple. This shade of purple dye was also used to dye imperial cloth. The initial iota and upsilon have the diaeresis.Bruce M. Metzger, Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Palaeography, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1981, Plate 8, p. 92. The illustrations are done in a naturalistic style common to Roman painting of the period. The manuscript's illustrations are, in format, transitional between those found in scrolls and later images found in codices. Each illustration is painted at the bottom of a single page. However, within a single illustration, two or more episodes from a story may be included, so that the same person may be represented multiple times within a single illustration. There are both framed and unframed illustrations. The illustrations contain incidents and people not mentioned in the text of Genesis. These incidents are thought to have been derived from popular elaborations of the story or from Jewish commentaries on the text. The Vienna Genesis may have been produced in the same period and place as the Rossano Gospels and the Sinope Gospels.Robert Milburn, Robert Leslie Pollington Milburn, Early Christian art and architecture, University of California Press, 1988, s. 301.

The COO is usually the second-in-command at the firm, especially if the highest-ranking executive is the chairman and CEO. The COO is responsible for the daily operation of the company and its office buildingand routinely reports to the highest-ranking executive‚Äîusually the chief executive officer (CEO). Responsibilities and similar titles Unlike other C-suite positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, a COO's job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals. The selection of a COO is similar in many ways to the selection of a vice president or chief of staff of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the president or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust. The COO position is common in firms that are operationally intensive, such as airline and automotive industries. =President= In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate president as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a \\"C-suite\\" designation, such as \\"president and CEO\\" or \\"president and COO\\") is also loosely defined. The president is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various vice presidents (including senior vice president and executive vice president), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. Lloyd E. Reuss was president of General Motors from 1990 to 1992, as the right-hand man of chairman and CEO Robert C. Stempel.

Cg.org.cn. Retrieved on 2013-09-05. Richard D. Parsons was number two in the company hierarchy during his tenure as president of Time Warner from 1995 to 2001, but he had no authority over the operating divisions, and instead took on assignments at the behest of chairman and CEO Gerald Levin. Michael Capellas was appointed president of Hewlett-Packard in order to ease its acquisition and integration of Compaq, where Capellas was previously chairman and CEO. Capellas ended up serving just six months as HP president before departing. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO. In 2007, the investment banking firms of Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm's business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when James Cayne was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman). Tom Anselmi of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment was chief operating officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of Richard Peddie and the hiring of Tim Leiweke for the posts of president and CEO, Anselmi added the title of president from September 4, 2012, to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO. Richard Fuld, the chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers, had a succession of \\"number twos\\" under him, usually titled as president and chief operating officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as president and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the office of the chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80 million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the \\"face\\" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line. Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008, and replaced as president and COO by Bart McDade, who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy. Thomas W. LaSorda served as president and CEO of Chrysler from January 1, 2006, to August 5, 2007, while Chrysler was owned by Daimler-Benz. When Cerberus Capital bought majority control of Chrysler, Bob Nardelli was appointed chairman and CEO of Chrysler, while LaSorda became vice chairman and president. Despite the appointment of a second vice chairman and president, Jim Press, LaSorda stayed on. LaSorda's titles as vice chairman and president officially stated that he was in charge of manufacturing, procurement and supply, employee relations, global business development and alliances. However, LaSorda's actual role was to find a new partner or buyer for Chrysler, leading to speculation that Cerberus Capital was less interested in rebuilding the auto manufacturer than it was to turning profit though a leveraged buyout. Research in Motion's corporate structure had more than one COO, including Jim Rowan as chief operating officer for global operations, and Thorsten Heins as COO of products and sales. The Walt Disney Company has used the president and COO titles in varied ways for their number two executive. Ron W. Miller was president from 1978 to 1984, while serving additionally as CEO for 18 months from 1983 to 1984. Frank Wells was president from 1984 to 1994, where he reported to the board of directors and not chairman and CEO Michael Eisner. When Wells died in a helicopter crash, no replacement president was named as his duties were resumed by Eisner. Michael Ovitz was president from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. Bob Iger was president and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. Thomas O. Staggs was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO. Manulife has used the president and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco \\"Roy\\" Gori served as president where he oversaw Manulife's global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the chief investment officer. Gori reported to chief executive officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017, upon Guloien's retirement. Linda Mantia, the chief operating officer, reported to the president on corporate strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including corporate development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, human resources, regulatory and public affairs, global resourcing and procurement, and the global program office. At the World Bank, the president outranks the other executives including the CEO and chief economist. =Current situation= Most modern companies operate without a COO. For example, in 2007 almost 58% of Fortune 500 companies did not have a COO. In these instances the CEO either takes on more roles and responsibilities, or the roles traditionally assigned to the COO are carried out by sub C-suite executives. Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including: * Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization. * Companies are finding a strong relationship between firm performance and the presence of a COO. * Companies are becoming more deliberate about CEO succession planning and will use the role to on-board and train successors. * The increase in talent mobility means that the role will likely be used more often as a retention mechanism for key executives who are at risk of moving to a competitor. Roles and functions The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as Lehman Brothers from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs. A COO could also be brought in from other organizations as a \\"fixer\\", such as Daniel J. O'Neill who in 1999 joined Molson in that capacity. In the manufacturing sector, the primary role of the COO is routinely one of operations management, meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm's products. The COO is responsible for ensuring that business operations are efficient and effective and that the proper management of resources, distribution of goods and services to customers and analysis of queue systems is conducted. Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform: * At the direction of the CEO and board of directors, marshaling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company's stakeholders * Developing and cascading the organization's strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching or corrective practices to align personnel with company goals * Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements * Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, knowledge-skills-attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements * Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators =COO as successor= Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the heir apparent to the CEO. Individuals may have worked their way (internally) up the company ladder before being named COO, or may have been recruited from an outside company. Either way, the position is used as a training and testing ground for the next CEO. A 2003 Crist Associates study revealed that only 17% of companies that promote a COO to a CEO replace the COO within the next year. An Accenture study found that approximately one in nine COOs moved into the CEO's shoes within a year of their departure and that half of COOs see themselves as the \\"heir apparent.\\" COOs transitioning into the CEO role often face similar challenges including: * Not being automatically granted the luxury of a diagnostic period. Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective. * Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board. Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the board of directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule. * Being in the spotlight. COOs are used to having the luxury of working \\"behind the scenes.\\" As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a \\"public\\" figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation. * Recalibrating their image. Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an \\"execution\\" executive versus a \\"strategy\\" executive. According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO \\"heir\\" better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat. Relationship with a CEO Because the COO is often responsible for serving as an information conduit to the CEO, it is essential that the relationship between COO and CEO be a positive one. Trust is the most important ingredient necessary for a CEO-COO relationship to thrive. The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO's strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened. Seven strategies that are key to building trust in the CEO- COO relationship include: * Communication‚ÄîThe CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up. * Clear decision rights‚ÄîThe COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope. * Lock on the backdoor‚ÄîThe CEO must not undermine the COO's credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent. * Sharing the spotlight‚ÄîIn effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much \\"credit\\" they receive for their work internally, externally, from the board of directors, and from each other. * Fit between CEO and COO‚ÄîThe two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced. * Fit Between the COO and the position‚ÄîThe selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO). * Transparency of succession expectations and timeline‚ÄîBoth parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition. Relationship with board of directors In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board. A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director. Researchers also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO. Failure in the COO role Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO. For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEOs, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an \\"operations\\" person or a \\"number two\\" as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the board of directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position. Harry Levinson effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: \\"The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power.\\". Experts and research Nathan Bennett and Stephen A. Miles have published extensively on the subject of the COO. In addition to writing a book dedicated to analyzing this hard-to-understand position, their research has been published in the Harvard Business Review, MIT Management Review and Chief Executive.net. Their work focuses on identifying different types of COOs, when the role works to deliver additional value, and when the role fails to produce the desired results. Their research includes interviews with more than a hundred CEOs and COOs on the topic. Cameron Herold, former COO for 1-800-GOT- JUNK?, has become another known expert in the COO space, with an organization he founded in 2017 called the COO Alliance. As well Herold started a podcast in 2018 called the Second In Command podcast which only interviews COOs to glean from their expertise.

Connie formed on August 3 from a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It moved quickly west- northwestward, strengthening into a hurricane by August 4\\\\. Connie first posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, ultimately passing about 105 mi (165 km) north of the island group. In the United States Virgin Islands, three people died due to the hurricane, and a few homes were destroyed. The outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation, reaching in Puerto Rico. On the island, Connie destroyed 60 homes and caused crop damage. After affecting Puerto Rico, Connie reached maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), and a barometric pressure of , as observed by the Hurricane Hunters on August 7\\\\. The hurricane later weakened, slowed its forward motion, and turned to the north, striking North Carolina on August 12 as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Connie was the first of three damaging tropical cyclones in the 1955 hurricane season to hit the state, along with Diane and Ione. The storm progressed inland after moving through the Chesapeake Bay region, and was later absorbed by a cold front over Lake Huron on August 15\\\\. Ahead of the storm, the United States Weather Bureau issued widespread hurricane warnings, spurring evacuations, flight cancelations, and beach closures. Connie produced strong winds, high tides, and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore, causing heavy crop damage and 27 deaths in North Carolina. Four people were killed in Washington, D.C. due to a traffic accident caused by slick roads. In Chesapeake Bay, Connie capsized a boat, killing 14 people and prompting a change in Coast Guard regulations. There were six deaths each in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and 14 deaths in New York, where record rainfall flooded houses and subways. At least 295,000 people nationwide lost electric power during the storm. Damage in the United States totaled around $86 million (1955 USD). The rains from Connie contributed to flooding from Hurricane Diane that caused $700 million in damage. The remnants of Connie killed three people in Ontario, and also destroyed a few houses and boats in the province. As a result of its impacts, including a death toll of 77, the name Connie was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list. Meteorological history A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression to the west of the Cape Verde islands on August 3, 1955, based on reports from two nearby ships. The depression moved quickly west-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Connie. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August 4 reported a developing eye feature. Observations from the flight, as well as a nearby ship, suggested that Connie attained hurricane status on August 4\\\\. The hurricane continued to intensify as it approached the northern Lesser Antilles, passing about 105 mi (165 km) north of the island group on August 6\\\\. Later that day, the storm strengthened to major hurricane status, or a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. After passing the Lesser Antilles, Connie turned more to the northwest as it rounded a large ridge. A Hurricane Hunters flight on August 7 observed an eye shaped like an inverted cone ‚Äì larger at flight-level, and a diameter of 9 mi (15 km) at the surface. The plane also observed a minimum barometric pressure of 944 mbar (27.88 inHg), the lowest in association with the hurricane. Based on the observations, the Hurricane Research Division estimated maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), making Connie a Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane progressed northwestward, passing northeast of The Bahamas. The eye grew in size, and the combination of upwelling and cooler air resulted in weakening. Connie fell below major hurricane status on August 9\\\\. A building ridge to its northeast, as well as some interaction with developing Hurricane Diane to its southeast, caused Connie to move slower toward the west-northwest. On August 10, the hurricane turned to the north as it moved toward the southeast United States coast. On August 12, Connie restrengthened slightly, reaching a secondary peak intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h). The hurricane made landfall near Fort Macon State Park in North Carolina at that intensity around 15:00 UTC. Hurricane Connie weakened as it moved through eastern North Carolina. The storm approached the Atlantic coast near the North Carolina/Virginia border. After passing through the Hampton Roads area, Connie turned back to the north-northwest, steered by a strengthening upper-level trough and low, located over Illinois. On August 13, Connie fell below hurricane intensity as it moved through the Chesapeake Bay region. The track shifted to the northwest, and Connie moved across western Pennsylvania, into Lake Erie. While still a tropical storm, Connie moved across portions of Southwestern Ontario, Lake Huron, and Michigan. On August 15, an approaching cold front absorbed the dissipating storm. Preparations Connie rainfall in Puerto Rico On August 5, Hurricane Connie began to become an apparent threat to the northeastern Caribbean Islands, with maximum winds in the storm reaching 125 mph (205 km/h). The National Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for Barbuda, Saba and Antigua. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were placed on hurricane alert as warnings were possible later that day. Along the northern coast of Puerto Rico, the threat of Connie forced 40,000 people to evacuate their homes. After Connie affected Puerto Rico, a storm warning was issued for the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, and a hurricane warning was issued for the eastern Bahamas. While Connie was meandering in the western Atlantic Ocean, its potential track posed problems for forecasters, due to its slow movement near the southeast United States coastline. On August 7, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert issued farther north to New York City. The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to Delaware Breakwater, with storm warnings farther northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for about three days until Connie moved inland. Ahead of the storm, the United States military flew its planes away from the coast to safer shelters further inland. Two people were killed when they crashed the Navy plane they were evacuating. Large Naval ships rode out the storm at sea, while smaller vessels anchored in Tangier. More than 100 merchant vessels from a dozen counties anchored in the waters of Hampton Roads, or while small boats were secured at port. The American Red Cross opened at least 79 shelters, and mobilized 41 officials with hurricane experience. The Coast Guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate, and overall about 14,000 people evacuated the coastline. About 2,000 people evacuated from flood-prone areas in New Bern, North Carolina. In Philadelphia, the Boy Scouts evacuated 800 scouts from Camp Delmont due to the threat of the hurricane. The threat of Connie also canceled a flight by President Dwight Eisenhower from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., prompting him to travel instead by car. More than 300 residents evacuated in North Jersey. Beaches were closed in New Jersey and New York. An annual parade in Ocean City, New Jersey was postponed due to the storm. Dozens of flights in and out of the New York area were canceled due to weather conditions. The storm also prompted the Canadian Army to halt military exercises. Impact Radar image of Hurricane Connie in the Northeastern United States =Caribbean= As the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles, the outer rainbands of Connie produced wind gusts as high as 104 mph (166 km/h) on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. On Anguilla, sustained winds reached 51 mph (83 km/h). Wind gusts reached 46 mph (74 km/h) in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, although there were estimates of 80 mph (130 km/h) wind gusts on Saint Thomas. The outer rainbands of Connie also produced heavy rainfall in the northeastern Caribbean. The highest precipitation total in Puerto Rico was along the lower R√≠o Blanco, of which fell in one day. Rainfall reached in Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas. Two people drowned on the island, and one person was electrocuted due to Connie's passage. The hurricane also destroyed a few shacks and boats on Saint Thomas. In Puerto Rico, high winds and waves destroyed 60 poorly-built houses. Connie also damaged crops and utilities in Puerto Rico. Later, San Salvador Island in the Bahamas reported winds of 24 mph (39 km/h). =United States and Canada= Rainfall map from Connie in the United States Hurricane Connie produced hurricane-force winds in North Carolina and Virginia. Across the Northeastern United States, many areas were in drought conditions before the storm struck. Unusually moist air caused above normal air and water temperatures, resulting in heavy rainfall across the eastern United States. Storm-related rainfall spread from the South Carolina, northeast to Maine, and as far west as Michigan. Record rainfall occurred in Philadelphia and New York City, and the highest precipitation related to Connie was at Fort Schuyler in New York.Connie's rains preceded additional rainfall from Hurricane Diane just four days later, which together caused widespread flooding. Along Connie's western periphery, the rainbands spawned at least six tornadoes, of which five in South Carolina and one in North Carolina. Damage from Connie in the United States was estimated at $86,065,000, mostly in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. When Connie struck North Carolina, it produced sustained winds of in Morehead City, with gusts to . Wind gusts near where the hurricane moved ashore reached 100 mph (160 km/h), although it was uncertain whether the gust was estimated or measured. Frying Pan Shoals, located offshore, reported a gust of . The hurricane produced tides up to above normal while moving slowly ashore, which resulted in significant beach erosion. Tides were higher at Swansboro, North Carolina than during Hurricane Hazel the previous October, and many piers that were rebuilt after Hazel were damaged or again destroyed by Connie. The storm surge flooded low-lying portions of Wilmington. High waves in advance of the storm flooded coastal roads along the Outer Banks. Rainfall amounts of over in the area west of where Connie made landfall. Stream flooding occurred as far inland as Raleigh, but was most significant near the coast. Along the Pamlico River in Washington, National Guardsmen were ordered to help about 1,000 people evacuate during the storm. Outer rainbands knocked out power lines in coastal North Carolina. Flooding-induced rainfall closed U.S. Route 17 near New Bern. Throughout North Carolina, the hurricane caused about $40 million in damage, of which about 75% was from crop damage. There were 27 deaths in the state related to Connie, including traffic deaths, drownings, people in damaged buildings, and electrocutions. In South Carolina to the south of the center, the hurricane destroyed 40 buildings in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Connie also damaged fishing piers, breakwaters, and housing shingles. Newspapers considered the damage \\"mild\\" compared to that from Hazel the previous year. As Connie progressed northward, it continued to drop significant amounts of precipitation. Totals of over were reported on both sides of Chesapeake Bay, in Pennsylvania, and in southeastern New York. Rainfall in Richmond, Virginia totaled on August 12, breaking the day's precipitation record. Severe river flooding occurred in Virginia, from the coast inland to Richmond. Floods washed out a portion of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad near Lankford, and covered portions of five area highways, including U.S. 1 and U.S. 301. The storm downed trees and caused scattered power outages for at least 5,000 people in the state. Ten river gauges in Virginia, as well as sixteen in neighboring Maryland, reached the highest stage on record. More than 100 traffic accidents occurred in Washington D.C. due to slick roads; one accident killed four people, after a car was sideswiped and knocked into a swollen creek where the occupants drowned. The combination of strong winds and high waves wrecked a schooner in the Chesapeake Bay named the Levin J. Marvel. The 64-year old boat was described as \\"unseaworthy\\" when it left from Annapolis, Maryland, and capsized near Fairhaven. Of the 23 passengers and four crew members, 14 people drowned, making it \\"one of the worst maritime calamities in the history of Tidewater Maryland\\", as described by The Baltimore Sun. The other passengers were later rescued after holding onto wreckage. Farther from the storm's immediate landfall, Connie's precipitation was beneficial Delaware due to prior drought conditions. Wind gusts in the state reached on a control tower at the New Castle County Airport. The storm spawned a waterspout in Bethany Beach, which knocked off the roofs of a dozen homes, caused a six-hour power outage, and caused a minor injury when a teenager was flown . The rains caused flooding that was described as \\"inconsequential\\" by the United States Geological Survey, due to preceding drought conditions. There were six storm deaths in New Jersey ‚Äì one by drowning, one by electrocution, and four in traffic accidents. The winds and rains knocked down trees and power lines, leaving about 180,000 people without power, and about 20,000 people without phone service. Nearly every police and fire department in Bergen County, along with over 500 electricians, responded to the outages. Manville declared a state of emergency that lasted for 19.5 hours, after three nearby rivers exceeded their banks. A nun in Tenafly required rescue from a trapped elevator during a power outage. Flooding closed portions of the White Horse Pike and other roads near Camden, causing traffic jams. There were also six deaths in neighboring Pennsylvania ‚Äì four due to traffic accidents, and two people in their cars swept away by floods. Rainfall reached in southeastern Pennsylvania, with recorded in Philadelphia over a 24-hour period; it was the city's highest daily rainfall in 57 years. The deluge exceeded the capacity of sewers and creeks, closed roads, and entered the basements of homes, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate. Three days' of rainfall caused creeks to rise in the Lehigh Valley. About 10,000 people lost power in Pennsylvania, but service was quickly restored. U.S. Marines evacuated a group of 63 Girl Scouts from Camp Helena near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after floods from a nearby creek threatened the group. A boy required rescue from the flooded Darby Creek. Heavy rainfall, totaling over affected southeastern New York, causing heavy damage, and killing 11 people in the New York metropolitan area, and three people upstate. Hurricane Connie brought the heaviest rain seen in New York City in over 50 years, totaling within a 20-hour span. Large areas of the city were flooded, inundating subways and thousands of houses. About 100,000 people lost power in the city. High winds and tides from the storm cancelled ferry service, and forced LaGuardia Airport to temporarily shut down after flooding reached deep. Flooding washed out a portion of the Delaware and Hudson Railway in the Helderberg Mountains, causing two trains to derail; there were no injuries. In Monroe and Wayne counties, the storm damaged the peach and apple crops. The Chenango County Fair closed early due to the storms' rains. In coastal Connecticut, the rainfall from Connie increased levels along streams, but there was little damage. When the remnants of Connie entered Ontario on August 14, it continued to produce winds of up to 46 mph (75 km/h), and the storm dropped 2.56 in (65 mm) of rainfall near the Great Lakes. In Burlington, 27 boats were destroyed, and one person drowned in Lake Erie after his boat sank. Two other people drowned in the province. Connie destroyed six houses and damaged several others due to high waves. The storm also caused power outages and damage to the tobacco crop. Late in the storm's path through the United States, Connie produced wind gusts of along Lake Huron in Michigan, causing high waves that damaged or sank many small boats. Damage in Michigan was estimated at $150,000. Aftermath Newsreel video clip of Hurricane Connie in North Carolina Flooding caused by Connie generally did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important in setting the conditions for later significant flooding across the Northeastern United States. Just five days after Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700 million, and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas. Immediately after the storm, the U.S. Small Business Administration authorized low-interest loans for homes and businesses affected by Connie. The loss of the Levin J. Marvel during the hurricane prompted the United States Congress to pass a law in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700 tons, much higher than the 183 tons that the Marvel displaced. The inexperienced captain was charged with negligence and manslaughter and stood trial before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore. Those charges carried a prison term of 11 years. Judge Robert Dorsey Watkins, however, acquitted him of the manslaughter charge, instead sentencing him to one-year probation for negligence. Due to its destructive impact, the name Connie was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list.

Harborne became part of the county borough of Birmingham and thus transferred from Staffordshire to Warwickshire in 1891, leaving Smethwick in the County of Staffordshire. The world's oldest working engine, made by Boulton & Watt, the Smethwick Engine, originally stood near Bridge Street, Smethwick. It is now at Thinktank, the new science museum in Birmingham. One notable company was The London Works, manufacturing base of the Fox Henderson Company which made the steel framework for the Crystal Palace. This was founded by Charles Fox, whose inventions included the first patented railway points. His notable employees included William Siemens, the notable mechanical and electrical engineer. The company was bankrupted in 1855 by the failure of an overseas railway to pay for work done. The site was later used by the GKN company. In 2015 the site was being cleared to build the new Midland Metropolitan Hospital which aims to combine the Sandwell General Hospital at West Bromwich and City Hospital, Dudley Road. Work at the site has come to a standstill because of the crisis in the building industry. Other former industry included railway rolling stock manufacture, at the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company factory; screws and other fastenings from Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds (GKN); engines from Tangye; tubing from Evered's; steel pen nibs from British Pens; and various products from Chance Brothers' glassworks, including lighthouse lenses and the glazing for the Crystal Palace (the London works, in North Smethwick, manufactured its metalwork). Phillips Cycles, once one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in the world, was based in Bridge Street, Smethwick. Nearby, in Downing Street, is the famous bicycle saddle maker, Brooks Saddles. The important metalworking factory of Henry Hope & Sons Ltd was based at Halford's Lane where the company manufactured steel window systems, roof glazing, gearings and metalwork. Council housing began in Smethwick after 1920 on land previously belonging to the Downing family, whose family home became Holly Lodge High School for Girls in 1922. The mass council house building of the 1920s and 1930s also involved Smethwick's boundaries being extended into part of neighbouring Oldbury in 1928. The Ruskin Pottery Studio, named in honour of the artist John Ruskin, was in Oldbury Road. Many English churches have stained glass windows made by Hardman Studios in Lightwoods House, or, before that, by the Camm family. During the Second World War, Smethwick was bombed on a number of occasions by the German Luftwaffe. A total of 80 people died as a result of these air raids. After the Second World War, Smethwick attracted a large number of immigrants from Commonwealth countries, the largest ethnic group being Sikhs from the Punjab in India. The ethnic minority communities were initially unpopular with the white British population of Smethwick, prompting the election of Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Peter Griffiths at the 1964 general election. In the election, the Labour Party MP was unseated following the use of the campaign slogan, \\"If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour\\" allegedly being used by supporters of the winning candidate. This came two years after race riots had hit the town in 1962; it was also set against a background of factory closures and a growing waiting list for local council accommodation. In 1961, the Sikh community purchased the Congregational Church on the High Street in Smethwick. Soon after, this was converted into a gurdwara. The Guru Nanak Gurdwara Smethwick is said to be the oldest and now the largest Gurdwara in Europe. Bearwood Primary School appointed Tony O'Connor as head teacher in 1967. He was the first black head teacher in the UK, having been born in Jamaica and moved to Britain with the RAF in 1943. This bought Smethwick more unwanted publicity when, the day after the announcement of his appointment, racist slogans and swastikas were daubed around the school. However, O'Connor was well liked by both parents and children; he retired in 1983. Local historian David Hallam is currently researching his life. In the mid- to late 1960s, a large council estate in the west of Smethwick was built. It was officially known as the West Smethwick Estate, but as all of the homes were constructed from concrete the estate was known locally as the \\"concrete jungle\\". The homes, mostly three or four storey townhouses, were prone to damp and other faults. By the 1980s, levels of crime and unemployment on the estate were high, and by the early 1990s, Sandwell Council had decided to demolish it. Between 1993 and 1997, the estate was redeveloped with modern low-rise housing and renamed Galton Village. Another housing estate called the Windmill Lane Estate, located near Cape Hill, met a similar fate. There is a collection of red brick turn-of-20th century terrace, 1930s semi-detached, newly built modern housing and a number of high rise blocks of flats. Other estates and areas include Black Patch, Cape Hill, Uplands, Albion Estate, Bearwood, Londonderry and Rood End. In July 2013, a major fire occurred at the Jayplas plastics and paper recycling plant on Dartmouth Road. =Architecture= The old Toll House The oldest surviving building in Smethwick is the Old Church which stands on the corner of Church Road and the Uplands. This was consecrated in 1732 as a Chapel of Ease in the parish of St Peter, Harborne. The building was originally known as \\"Parkes' Chapel\\" in honour of Mistress Dorothy Parkes who bequeathed the money for the church and also for a local school. The chapel was later known as the \\"Old Chapel\\", and the public house next to it is still called this. In the church there are several fine memorials, including one to Dorothy Parkes. The Grade I listed Galton Bridge spans the New Line canal and railway. When built in 1829 by Telford, it was the longest single-span bridge in the world. Its name commemorates Samuel Galton, a local landowner and industrialist. It is identical to Telford's bridge at Holt Fleet over the River Severn built in 1828 and opened in 1830. The public library by Yeoville Thomason The public library in the High Street was originally built as the Public Hall in 1866‚Äì67 and is designed by Yeoville Thomason.The Buildings of England: Worcestershire, Nikolaus Pevsner, 1968 Penguin. p81 Matthew Boulton and James Watt opened their Soho Foundry in the north of Smethwick (not to be confused with the Soho Manufactory in nearby Soho) in the late 18th century. In 1802, William Murdoch illuminated the foundry with gas lighting of his own invention. The foundry was later home to weighing scale makers W & T Avery Ltd.. Rolfe Street public baths were among the first public swimming baths in the country when opened north of the town centre in 1888. The baths remained open for nearly a century before closing. In the late 1980s, the Black Country Museum expressed interest in transferring the building to its site in Dudley and so the transfer of the building began in 1989. It was finally opened to visitors at the museum in 1999, housing the museum's exhibition gallery and archive resource centre. Thimblemill Library is a Grade II listed building built in brick in the Moderne style. =Political history= The town has often enjoyed a somewhat turbulent political history: Smethwick was created as a separate parliamentary constituency in 1918, having previously been part of the Handsworth constituency. At that year's general election, Christabel Pankhurst, standing as a Women's Party candidate, narrowly failed to become one of Britain's first woman Members of Parliament. She lost to the Labour candidate by 775 votes in a straight fight.Hallam, David J.A. Taking on the Men: the first women parliamentary candidates 1918, Studley, 2018 Chap 2 \\"Christabel Pankhurst in Smethwick\\" Labour held the seat until 1931: from 1926, the MP was Sir Oswald Mosley, future founder of the British Union of Fascists. Mosley resigned the Labour whip in March 1931, but continued to represent the constituency until it was taken by the Conservatives at that year's general election. Labour won in the UK general election of 1945, held on 26 July that year. However, the victorious MP, Alfred Dobbs, was killed in a car crash the very next day. He is thus the shortest-serving Member of Parliament (MP) in British history, if one discounts a few cases of people being elected posthumously. In the resulting by-election, Patrick Gordon Walker won for Labour. In the 1964 general election, Gordon Walker, who was Shadow Foreign Secretary, was defeated in controversial circumstances in the constituency by Conservative candidate Peter Griffiths. Labour's victory at the general election would inevitably have seen him appointed as Foreign Secretary in the government led by Harold Wilson; however, Smethwick had attracted immigration from the Commonwealth in the economic and industrial growth of the years following the Second World War and Griffiths ran a campaign critical of the government's policy. There were rumours that his supporters had circulated the slogan \\"If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour.\\"Peter H. S. Griffiths A Question of Colour? (1966); See pp. 154, 166, 171. Colin Jordan, a British Neo-Nazi and leader of the British Movement, claimed that members of his group had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the publicised poster and sticker campaign which contained it; Jordan's group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: \\"Don't vote - a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!\\". Jordan would also use similar campaign tactics against Gordon Walker in the 1965 Leyton by-election. Hardly had the heat of the election subsided when, on 12 February 1965, American black activist Malcolm X visited the region over his opposition to the history of racial segregation in the town, just nine days before his assassination. He fuelled further controversy when he told the press: Malcolm X's visit to Smethwick had been organised by a BBC News journalist with a view to X having a debate with Griffiths outside a Smethwick council house. Griffiths declined at late notice and so an interview with X was conducted on the streets of Smethwick. This was to be X's last TV interview before his assassination nine days later. It was never aired. Labour candidate and actor Andrew Faulds defeated Griffiths in the 1966 general election, remaining as an MP until his retirement at the 1997 general election, 23 years after Smethwick became part of the Warley East constituency. Griffiths subsequently moved away from the area and served as Conservative MP for Portsmouth North. =Civic history= The local government structure within North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire ‚Äì Prior to the West Midlands Order 1965 reorganisation Originally a hamlet within the parish of Harborne, Staffordshire, Smethwick was made into an urban district in 1894, and later incorporated as a municipal borough in 1899, and county borough in 1907. In 1966, Smethwick was merged with the boroughs of Oldbury and Rowley Regis to form the new County Borough of Warley, and was transferred into the county of Worcestershire. This in turn was merged with West Bromwich in 1974 to form the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough, which was incorporated into the new West Midlands county. In 1888, there had been plans for Smethwick to be incorporated into the city of Birmingham, but the urban district council voted against these plans by a single vote. The archives for the Borough of Smethwick are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service. = Transport history = Canals See also: BCN Main Line Smethwick has a long association with canals, which were the town's first major transport links from a time before decent roads and of course railways. The Birmingham Canal Navigation Old and New Main Line Canals run through the industrial areas and right past the High Street, running parallel to the Stour Valley Railway Line: all three end up in Wolverhampton. James Brindley was the engineer charged with building the canal, a man who gives his name to the busy district in the centre of Birmingham near the International Convention Centre, National Indoor Arena and Broad Street. Galton Bridge viewed from the Galton Tunnel The old main line was completed through Smethwick by 1769. It required 12 locks to climb over the hill through the town; Brindley had found the earth too soft to dig a cutting through at the time. Water was supplied by two steam engines. One of them was located on the Engine Arm which led to the Smethwick Engine on Rabone Lane and the other was near Spon Lane. New Smethwick Pumping Station next to Brasshouse Lane was added later in 1892. Because of the locks, the canal through Smethwick became a bottleneck and Thomas Telford was commissioned in 1824 to look at alternatives. The new main line through Smethwick was completed by 1829 and completely bypassed all 6 remaining locks of the summit with a deep cutting. The Engine Arm and Stewarts aqueducts were built to carry their respective canals over the new mainline. The cutting was built through the land of the local businessman Samuel Galton and thus this cutting created the Galton Valley and Galton Bridge was named in his honour. The bridge was the longest single-span iron bridge in the world at the time. The canals of the new and old main line diverged at one end at Smethwick Junction near Bridge Street and rejoined at Bromford Junction near Bromford Road in Oldbury. Today Galton Valley is a nature area and of more historical interest than commercial, and used mainly for leisure rather than transporting commercial goods. Railways The LNWR was the first to construct a railway through Smethwick in 1852 from New Street towards Wolverhampton and the North West, Rolfe Street and Spon Lane opened that year followed by Soho in 1853. In 1867 the Stourbridge Railway opened a link between the Great Western Birmingham, Wolverhampton & Dudley Railway (of 1852) near the current Hawthorns and Stourbridge with a station at Smethwick West and a link to the Stour Valley line towards New Street called Smethwick Junction, the Stourbridge Railway was merged into the Great Western in 1870. It was not until 1931 that a railway station was constructed at the Hawthorns, although it was a 'Halt' primarily for football ground, this station closed in 1967. British Rail Class 33 at Swanage, built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company From 1854 the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company was based in Smethwick until its closure in 1963. The company not only built trains, but also London Underground stock, buses and a military equipment. Soho railway station closed in 1949, followed by Spon Lane in 1968. beginning the first of several rail closures in the town. In 1972 the section of line between Smethwick West and Birmingham Moor Street, as well as the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Dudley railway, was closed with the exception of a single line between Smethwick West and Coopers Scrap Metal in Handsworth and all Stourbridge services were diverted into Birmingham New Street. In 1995 the line between Birmingham Snow Hill and Smethwick West was restored and a new station called Smethwick Galton Bridge was constructed over both the Snow Hill and Stour Valley lines to provide an interchange. Smethwick West was due to close when Galton Bridge opened, but due to a legal error British Railways had to maintain a parliamentary train service to the station. Most local trains from Stourbridge to Birmingham were diverted into Snow Hill although it was not until 2004 that the last regular service used the route into Birmingham New Street via Smethwick Junction. Soho TMD is located next to Soho rail junction, road access is just of Wellington Street. It is the principle train depot for West Midlands Trains' Class 323 train fleet, which are often seen providing local train services in the area. Buses and trams A Midland Red D9 in 2002 The town of Smethwick has a long association with buses. From 1914 the famous Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Company (BMMO or Midland Red) was based on Bearwood Road on the site of the current Bearwood Shopping Centre until 1974. The garage later saw use as an indoor market until it was demolished in 1979. Smethwick never had its own Corporation Transport Department, like West Bromwich or Birmingham. Most bus services until the earlier 1970s were provided by the Midland Red, West Bromwich and Birmingham. In the early 1970s, all local bus transport was taken over by the WMPTE until deregulation in the 1980s. Since then National Express West Midlands, has been the primary operator in the West Midlands. Steam trams started through Smethwick in 1885 operated by Birmingham and Midland Tramways. These were replaced by electric trams in 1904 and then merged into the Birmingham Corporation Tramways in 1906 and trams eventually ran from both the Dudley Road and Hagley Road direction. Dudley Road trams operated to Cape Hill and then diverged to either take the route towards Dudley (Route 87) via the High Street or towards Bearwood (Route 29) via Waterloo Road, terminating near the site of current Bearwood Bus Station and Kings Head public house. Route 34 from Birmingham to Bearwood along the Hagley Road and terminated at the top of Bearwood Road next to the route from Cape Hill, despite terminating so close to each other there was no physical link between route 29 and 34 in Bearwood. Route 34 was the first route to go in Smethwick in 1930 and the last tram route was closed in 1939 and replaced by motor buses. Both the current National Express West Midlands routes 82 and 87 are former tram routes and the 87 in fact uses the same number. The Hawthorns railway station and metro stop The Midland Metro, opened in 1999, is more of a light railway than a tramway. It follows the former Great Western Railway track bed from Birmingham Snow Hill station to the former Wolverhampton Low Level via West Bromwich until Priestfield in Wolverhampton. After that, it becomes a tramway proper and runs along the Bilston Road into Wolverhampton city centre. From late 2015 the service was extended from its former terminus at Snow Hill through the city centre to Grand Central. The metro can be caught at the Hawthorns railway station. Industry and commerce Until the end of the 18th century, Smethwick was largely rural, with farming as the main industry. A water mill named Briddismylne is recorded in 1499 as belonging to Halesowen Abbey, thought to be on the more recent Thimblemill site.Greenslade, Baggs, Baugh & Johnston, op. cit. In 1659, a mill in the Hockley Brook is recorded as belonging to a Mr. Lane. The mill which led to the street name \\"Windmill Lane\\" was built on land bought in 1803 by William Croxall, a miller. The last part of the windmill building was demolished in 1949. The route of the canal, passing through the valley of the Hockley Brook, the boundary with Handsworth on the north side of Smethwick, resulted in most of the heavy industry being located there.Greenslade, Baggs, Baugh & Johnston, A History of the County of Stafford, Volume 17 (Offlow Hundred), 1976 The railway was opened in 1852. Soho Foundry main gate The Soho Foundry, opened in 1796 by James Watt and Matthew Boulton, trading as Boulton, Watt & Sons, was built to produce complete steam engines to Watt's designs. Waste dumped from the foundry gave rise to the name Black Patch to the field to the east. The Soho Foundry is now the headquarters of the Avery Company. One of Smethwick's significant industrial enterprises of the 19th century was the Fox, Henderson Company, formerly Brannah, Fox and Co., which built the steel structure for the Crystal Palace in 1851. At its peak this employed about 2,000 people at the London Works. The bankruptcy and closure of the firm in 1856 had a devastating effect on the local economy. The site of the London Works was later acquired by Chamberlain and Nettlefold, and in 2014 was cleared to build the new Midland Metropolitan Hospital, amalgamating the Sandwell General Hospital at West Bromwich with the City Hospital, Dudley Road. Richard Tangye was a notable builder of steam engines in the late 19th century. His designs, in a characteristic green colour, have a distinctive elegance of form. He demolished Smethwick Hall, on the border with Handsworth, and built his factory, the Cornwall Works, on the site. Mitchells & Butlers opened a brewery on Cape Hill in 1879. It was a local landmark in Smethwick and provided employment in the town for 123 years. However, following a decline in sales and revenue, American owners Coors closed the brewery on 6 December 2002. It was demolished two years later and a 650-home private housing estate was developed on its site. Charles Carr opened a bell-foundry in the town in 1891, which cast bells for many churches including John's Lane (Dublin), Castle Bromwich Church, Stoke Bliss and Astley, Worcestershire. Teale & Yates Ltd (Inc. 29 November 1962) was a fish, game and poultry shop which also sold fruit and vegetables. It was on the High Street for many years during the 1960s-70s providing good quality fresh food for many local people. The shop was owned by Arthur Teale and his wife Joan, with their eldest son joining the family business in the early 70s. The courier company Interlink Express established its head office and national distribution hub in the town in the early 2000s, and is a major employer in the area. Smethwick Heritage Centre The Smethwick Heritage Centre museum was opened on 15 September 2004 by Professor Carl Chinn. It maintains a collection of material on Smethwick's industrial and social heritage.

M5 Junction 1 is accessible at West Bromwich using the A41 road Soho Road. M5 Junction 2 is accessible at Oldbury on the A4123 Wolverhampton Road (Harborne to Wolverhampton) at Birchley Island. Another major road passing through Smethwick is the A456 (Hagley Road) from Birmingham to Halesowen, Kidderminster and Ludlow, which passes through Bearwood, along Lightwoods Park. Public transport Local bus service is provided primarily by National Express West Midlands, as well as other operators. Smethwick is on both the Hagley Road (Birmingham, Dudley, Merry Hill, Halesowen and Stourbridge) and Dudley Road (Birmingham, Smethwick, Oldbury and Dudley) bus corridors and the famous Number 11 Birmingham Outer Circle bus routes. There are also direct regular bus services to West Bromwich, Wolverhampton, Oldbury, Blackheath, Harborne, Birmingham University and Dudley. Dudley Road corridor buses provide a bus link to the nearby City Hospital in Winson Green. Smethwick has three operational railway stations providing regular local and some long-distance services. All of the stations are currently managed by West Midlands Trains who provide most of the train services. The closest 'intercity' railway stations are either Birmingham New Street or Sandwell & Dudley. Rolfe Street railway station in Smethwick * Smethwick Rolfe Street railway station ‚Äì Rolfe Street & North Western Road (near the High Street). Located on the Stour Valley, it is mainly for local trains between Birmingham New Street, Wolverhampton and Walsall. * Smethwick Galton Bridge ‚Äì Oldbury Road. As a bi-level railway station it sits on both the Stour Valley (a section of the West Coast Main Line) and the Jewellery Line.

Chiltern Railways also provide a limited service direct to London Marylebone. Airports The closest airport to Smethwick is Birmingham, which is around 20 miles east at the other side of Birmingham city centre. National Express do provide some long-distance coach services to some London Airports from Bearwood. * By road the fastest routes are either via the M5, M6 and M42 Motorways, or via Birmingham city centre and the A45. * For travellers by rail there are direct train services from Galton Bridge or from Rolfe Street railway station changing at Birmingham New Street. * There are no direct bus services from Smethwick to the airport. Passengers would have to travel to Birmingham and change buses. The principal bus service to the airport is the National Express West Midlands 'Limited Stop' express service X1 (Birmingham to Coventry). Public services and government Government Smethwick is represented at Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council by 12 councillors, covering the four wards of Soho & Victoria, St Pauls (which covers up to the Hawthorns ground), Smethwick and Abbey. It is represented in the House of Commons as part of the Warley constituency. It also included Bristnall ward up until 2004, when it was transferred to Oldbury 'town'. Library services There are two public libraries in Smethwick; the larger main library is located on the High Street and a smaller one is located on Thimblemill Road. Smethwick Swimming Centre Smethwick Baths Formerly known as 'Thimblemill Baths', it is a public swimming pool which opened in 1933, located on Thimblemill Road between Gladys Road and Reginald Road in Bearwood. It is a Grade II listed building. There are two pools (a 1933 main pool and a 1968 small pool), gym, dance studio, sauna and steam facilities. During the Second World War the basement was used as an air raid shelter and a supply depot for the US Air Force who were stationed in Smethwick. The main pool was capable of being covered for the purpose of public events; concerts, galas and exhibitions once took place until the late 1960s. Famous acts including Tommy Cooper, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Small Faces and the Kinks played at the baths. Emergency services Policing in Smethwick is provided by the West Midlands Police, who have a police station on Piddock Road just off the High Street. West Midlands Fire Service is responsible for fire and rescue. A fire station is located on Stony Lane a short distance from the High Street. Emergency medical care is provided by the West Midlands Ambulance Service. Healthcare Smethwick is part of Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust. The closest hospital is City Hospital (previously known as Dudley Road Hospital) located in Winson Green. Other local hospitals include Sandwell General Hospital in West Bromwich and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Selly Oak. Sport The town has a semi-professional association football club, Smethwick Rangers. Nicknamed \\"SR1\\", the club compete in the 2020-21 season in the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division, the 9th tier of the English football league system. Despite representing the town, they play their home games in Tividale.

Origins Hugh Clopton was born in about 1440 at Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon, where the Clopton family had lived since the reign of King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272). He was a younger son of John Clopton by his wife, a certain Agnes whose surname is unknown. In 1450 his father received license to erect an oratory at the manor house. In 1474 Thomas Clopton, Hugh's elder brother, obtained permission from Pope Sixtus IV to add a chapel to the house for the celebration of divine service. Career As a younger son excluded from his patrimony by primogeniture, he was expected to make his own fortune and left Clopton for the City of London at an early age, where he was apprenticed in 1457 to the mercer John Roo, and was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1464. He served as Warden of the Company three times, in 1479, 1484 and 1488. On 15 October 1485 he was chosen as Alderman for Dowgate ward. In 1486 he was elected Sheriff of London during Sir Henry Colet's term as mayor, and was himself chosen Lord Mayor of London in 1491. By 1495 he was living in Bread Street. Although some biographers have stated that he was knighted, this does not appear to have been the case as he described himself in his will merely as \\"citizen, mercer and alderman\\". His vast fortune enabled him to become possessed of his ancestral estates at Clopton, the inheritance of his elder brother, and it is certain that the neighbouring town of Stratford-upon-Avon was his favourite place of residence. In about 1483 he erected there (in Chapel Street) \\"a pretty house of brick and timber\\", which was later purchased in 1597 and renovated by the playwright William Shakespeare, and under the name of New Place served as his residence until his death in 1616. Clopton rebuilt the nave of the Chapel of the Stratford Guild of the Holy Trinity, situated opposite his new house in Chapel Street, and he adorned the building with a tower, steeple, glass windows and paintings for the ceiling. He also built the Clopton Bridge, a remarkably fine stone bridge of fourteen arches over the River Avon, having removed at his own expense an old wooden bridge on the site. He also founded the Clopton chantry chapel in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon, still notable features of modern Stratford. Death and burial He died on 15 September 1497, holding the manor of Clopton as a tenant-in-chief of King Henry VII \\"as of the manor of the Castle of Beaudesert\\" by 1/8 of a knight's fee, and left as his heir William Clopton (died 1521), the son of his nephew John, then aged 15. In 1504 William had livery of his great-uncle Hugh's manors of Clopton and Little Wilmcote, and his lands in Stratford and Bridgetown.'The borough of Stratford-upon-Avon: Manors', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 258‚Äì266.

By his will, dated a week before his death, he provided for the completion of the Stratford improvements, and left a hundred marks to twenty-four maidens of the town and ¬£200 for rebuilding the cross aisle of the parish church. He also instituted exhibitions of ¬£4 a year each for five years for three poor scholars at each university of Oxford and Cambridge, and gave ¬£10 to the common box of the Mercers Company, and other sums to the Venturers fellowship resident in Zeland, Brabant, and Flanders, and to \\"the fellowship of the Staple of Calais\\". Clopton desired to be buried in the parish church of Stratford, if he died in that town, where he spent much time in his later years. But he died in his London house, in the parish of St Margaret Lothbury, and he finally bequeathed his body to the church of that parish. Succession Clopton never married and left no children. The Clopton estates ultimately passed to Joyce Clopton, of the sixth generation in descent from Thomas Clopton, Sir Hugh's elder brother. She married George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes, who thus inherited from his wife the manor of Clopton, and was buried in Stratford Church, where survives his magnificent monument containing the effigies of himself and his wife.

The clusters in the upper staff‚ÄîC D F G‚Äîare four successive black keys. The last two bars, played with overlapping hands, are a denser cluster. A tone cluster is a musical chord comprising at least three adjacent tones in a scale. Prototypical tone clusters are based on the chromatic scale and are separated by semitones. For instance, three adjacent piano keys (such as C, C, and D) struck simultaneously produce a tone cluster. Variants of the tone cluster include chords comprising adjacent tones separated diatonically, pentatonically, or microtonally. On the piano, such clusters often involve the simultaneous striking of neighboring white or black keys. The early years of the twentieth century saw tone clusters elevated to central roles in pioneering works by ragtime artists Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin. In the 1910s, two classical avant-gardists, composer-pianists Leo Ornstein and Henry Cowell, were recognized as making the first extensive explorations of the tone cluster. During the same period, Charles Ives employed them in several compositions that were not publicly performed until the late 1920s or 1930s. Composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k and, later, Lou Harrison and Karlheinz Stockhausen became proponents of the tone cluster, which feature in the work of many 20th- and 21st-century classical composers. Tone clusters play a significant role, as well, in the work of free jazz musicians such as Cecil Taylor and Matthew Shipp. In most Western music, tone clusters tend to be heard as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, as well as by most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them. Music theory and classification keyboard is designed for playing a diatonic scale on the white keys and a pentatonic scale on the black keys. Chromatic scales involve both. Three immediately adjacent keys produce a basic chromatic tone cluster. Prototypical tone clusters are chords of three or more adjacent notes on a chromatic scale, that is, three or more adjacent pitches each separated by only a semitone. Three-note stacks based on diatonic and pentatonic scales are also, strictly speaking, tone clusters. However, these stacks involve intervals between notes greater than the half-tone gaps of the chromatic kind. This can readily be seen on a keyboard, where the pitch of each key is separated from the next by one semitone (visualizing the black keys as extending to the edge of the keyboard): Diatonic scales‚Äîconventionally played on the white keys‚Äîcontain only two semitone intervals; the rest are full tones. In Western musical traditions, pentatonic scales‚Äîconventionally played on the black keys‚Äîare built entirely from intervals larger than a semitone. Commentators thus tend to identify diatonic and pentatonic stacks as \\"tone clusters\\" only when they consist of four or more successive notes in the scale.See Nicholls (1991), p. 155. In standard Western classical music practice, all tone clusters are classifiable as secundal chords‚Äîthat is, they are constructed from minor seconds (intervals of one semitone), major seconds (intervals of two semitones), or, in the case of certain pentatonic clusters, augmented seconds (intervals of three semitones). Stacks of adjacent microtonal pitches also constitute tone clusters.Jones (2008), p. 91; Wilkins (2006), p. 145; Norman (2004), p. 47. A thirteenth chord collapsed into one octave results in a dissonant tone cluster ().Cope (2001), p. 6, fig. 1.17. In tone clusters, the notes are sounded fully and in unison, distinguishing them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect also tends to be different: where ornamentation is used to draw attention to the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.Swift (1972), pp. 511‚Äì12. By the fourth octave of the harmonic series successive harmonics form increasingly small seconds the fifth octave of harmonics (16‚Äì32) Tone clusters have generally been thought of as dissonant musical textures, and even defined as such.See, e.g., Seachrist (2003), p. 215, n. 15: \\"A 'tone cluster' is a dissonant group of tones lying close together....\\" As noted by Alan Belkin, however, instrumental timbre can have a significant impact on their effect: \\"Clusters are quite aggressive on the organ, but soften enormously when played by strings (possibly because slight, continuous fluctuations of pitch in the latter provide some inner mobility).\\" In his first published work on the topic, Henry Cowell observed that a tone cluster is \\"more pleasing\\" and \\"acceptable to the ear if its outer limits form a consonant interval.\\"Cowell (1921), pp. 112, 113. Cowell explains, \\"the natural spacing of so-called dissonances is as seconds, as in the overtone series, rather than sevenths and ninths....Groups spaced in seconds may be made to sound euphonious, particularly if played in conjunction with fundamental chord notes taken from lower in the same overtone series. Blends them together and explains them to the ear.\\"Cowell, Henry (1969). New Musical Resources, p.111-139. New York: Something Else. . Tone clusters have also been considered noise. As Mauricio Kagel says, \\"clusters have generally been used as a kind of anti-harmony, as a transition between sound and noise.\\"Kagel, Mauricio. \\"Tone-clusters, Attacks, Transitions\\", p.46. Cited in Schneider, John (1985). The Contemporary Guitar, p.172. University of California. . Tone clusters thus also lend themselves to use in a percussive manner. Historically, they were sometimes discussed with a hint of disdain. One 1969 textbook defines the tone cluster as \\"an extra-harmonic clump of notes.\\"Ostransky (1969), p. 208. Notation and execution An example of Henry Cowell's notation of tone clusters for piano In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell introduced a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only the top and bottom notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented.The score of The Tides of Manaunaun is reprinted in American Piano Classics: 39 Works by Gottschalk, Griffes, Gershwin, Copland, and Others, ed. Joseph Smith (Mineola, N.Y.: Courier Dover, 2001; ), pp. 43 et seq. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord‚Äîstretching two octaves from D2 to D4‚Äîis a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster‚Äîblack and white keys together‚Äîis shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all.Hicks (2002), p. 103. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.Griffiths (1995), p. 137. The performance of keyboard tone clusters is widely considered an \\"extended technique\\"‚Äîlarge clusters require unusual playing methods often involving the fist, the flat of the hand, or the forearm. Thelonious Monk and Karlheinz Stockhausen each performed clusters with their elbows; Stockhausen developed a method for playing cluster glissandi with special gloves. Cooke (1998), p. 205. Don Pullen would play moving clusters by rolling the backs of his hands over the keyboard.Ratliff (2002), p. 205. Boards of various dimension are sometimes employed, as in the Concord Sonata ( 1904‚Äì19) of Charles Ives; they can be weighted down to execute clusters of long duration.Hinson and Roberts (2006), p. 624. Several of Lou Harrison's scores call for the use of an \\"octave bar\\", crafted to facilitate high-speed keyboard cluster performance.Miller and Lieberman (2004), p. 135. Designed by Harrison with his partner William Colvig, the octave bar is > a flat wooden device approximately two inches high with a grip on top and > sponge rubber on the bottom, with which the player strikes the keys. Its > length spans an octave on a grand piano. The sponge rubber bottom is > sculpted so that its ends are slightly lower than its center, making the > outer tones of the octave sound with greater force than the intermediary > pitches. The pianist can thus rush headlong through fearfully rapid > passages, precisely spanning an octave at each blow. Use in Western music =Before the 1900s= The earliest example of tone clusters in a Western music composition thus far identified is in the Allegro movement of Heinrich Biber's Battalia √† 10 (1673) for string ensemble, which calls for several diatonic clusters.\\"Earliest Usages: 1. Pitch\\" in An orchestral diatonic cluster, containing all the notes of the harmonic minor scale, occurs also in the representation of chaos in the opening of Jean-F√©ry Rebel's 1737‚Äì38 ballet Les √âl√©mens.Henck (2004), pp. 52‚Äì54. Rebel, Les √âlemens, openingRebel, Les √âlemens, openingFrom the next century-and-a-half, a few more examples have been identified, mostly no more than a fleeting instance of the form, for example in the concluding two bars of the ‚ÄúLoure‚Äù from J.S.Bach‚Äôs French Suite No.5, BWV816:Loure from Bach French Suite No 5, concluding barsLoure from Bach, French Suite No 5, concluding bars or the collisions that result from the interaction of multiple lines \\"locked together in suspensions\\"David, H.T. (1945, p.138) J.S.Bach's Musical Offering. New York, Schirmer in Bach's Musical Offering: Ricercar a 6 from the Musical Offering bars 29‚Äì31J.S.Bach, Ricercar a 6 from the Musical Offering bars 29‚Äì31 In the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (1685‚Äì1757), we find a more daring and idiosyncratic use of tone clusters. In the following passage from the late 1740s, Scarlatti builds the dissonances over several bars:Scarlatti Keyboard Sonata K119 bars 143‚Äì168Scarlatti Keyboard Sonata K119 bars 143‚Äì168 Ralph Kirkpatrick says that these chords \\"are not clusters in the sense that they are arbitrary blobs of dissonance, nor are they necessarily haphazard fillings up of diatonic intervals or simultaneous soundings of neighboring tones; they are logical expressions of Scarlatti‚Äôs harmonic language and organic manifestations of his tonal structure\\".Kirkpatrick (1953), p. 231. Frederick Neumann describes Sonata K175 (1750s) as \\"full of Scarlatti's famous tone clusters\\".Neumann (1983), pp. 353‚Äì54. During this era, as well, several French programmatic compositions for the harpsichord or piano represent cannon fire with clusters: works by Fran√ßois Dandrieu (Les Caract√®res de la guerre, 1724), Michel Corrette (La Victoire d'un combat naval, remport√©e par une fr√©gate contre plusieurs corsaires r√©unis, 1780), Claude-B√©nigne Balbastre (March des Marseillois, 1793), Pierre Antoine C√©sar (La Battaille de Gemmap, ou la prise de Mons, 1794), Bernard Viguerie (La Bataille de Maringo, pi√®ce militaire et hitorique, for piano trio, 1800), and Jacques-Marie Beauvarlet- Charpentier (Battaille d'Austerlitz, 1805).Henck (2004), pp. 32‚Äì40. A dramatic use of a \\"virtual\\" tone cluster can be found in Franz Schubert‚Äôs Song Der Erlk√∂nig (1815‚Äì21). Here, a terrified child calls out to his father when he sees an apparition of the sinister Erl King. The dissonant voicing of the dominant minor ninth chord used here (C79) is particularly effective in heightening the drama and sense of threat.From Schubert's 'Der Erlk√∂nig' Extract from Schubert's 'Der Erlk√∂nig.' Writing about this passage, remarks on the ‚Äúunprecedented‚Ä¶ level of dissonance at the boy‚Äôs outcries‚Ä¶The voice has the ninth, pitched above, and the left hand has the seventh, pitched below. The result is a virtual ‚Äòtone cluster‚Äô...the harmonic logic of these progressions, within the rules of composition Schubert was taught, can certainly be demonstrated. That logic, however, is not what appeals so strongly to the listener's imagination; rather it is the calculated impression (or illusion) of wild abandon.‚ÄùTaruskin, R. (2010) The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume 4, Music in the Nineteenth Century, Oxford University Press. The next known compositions after Charpentier's to feature tone clusters are Charles-Valentin Alkan's \\"Une fus√©e\\" (A Rocket) Op. 55, published in 1859, and his \\"Les Diablotins\\" (The Imps), a miniature from the set of 49 Esquisses (sketches) for solo piano, published in 1861. Extract from Alkan's Les diablotins, Op. 63 no. 45, featuring tone clusters There is also the solo piano piece Battle of Manassas, written in 1861 by \\"Blind Tom\\" Bethune and published in 1866. The score instructs the pianist to represent cannon fire at various points by striking \\"with the flat of the hand, as many notes as possible, and with as much force as possible, at the bass of the piano.\\"Quoted in Altman (2004), p. 47. In 1887, Giuseppe Verdi became the first notable composer in the Western tradition to write an unmistakable chromatic cluster: the storm music with which Otello opens includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that also has the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture known.Kimbell (1991), p. 606; \\"Earliest Usages: 1. Pitch\\" and \\"Duration and Rhythm: 2. Longest notated duration, including ties\\" in Extremes of Conventional Music Notation. The choral finale of Gustav Mahler‚Äôs Symphony No. 2 features a tone cluster of great poignancy arising naturally out of voice leading to the words ‚Äúwird, der dich rief, dir geben‚Äù: Mahler Symphony 2 finale Fig 32, bars 4‚Äì10 Mahler Symphony 2 finale Fig 32, bars 4‚Äì10 Still, it was not before the second decade of the twentieth century that tone clusters assumed a recognized place in Western classical music practice. =In classical music of the early 1900s= Leo Ornstein was the first composer to be widely known for using tone clusters‚Äîthough the term itself was not yet used to describe the radical aspect of his work. Final chord of Tintamarre \\"Around 1910,\\" Harold C. Schonberg writes, \\"Percy Grainger was causing a stir by the near‚Äìtone clusters in such works as his Gumsuckers March.\\"Schonberg (1987), p. 419. In 1911, what appears to be the first published classical composition to thoroughly integrate true tone clusters was issued: Tintamarre (The Clangor of Bells), by Canadian composer J. Humfrey Anger (1862‚Äì1913).For a discussion of the piece, see The score of Tintamarre and its publication record are also available online via Library and Archives Canada/Biblioth√®que et Archives Canada. See also Keillor (2000) and The early performance history of Tintamarre has not been established. Within a few years, the radical composer-pianist Leo Ornstein became one of the most famous figures in classical music on both sides of the Atlantic for his performances of cutting- edge work. In 1914, Ornstein debuted several of his own solo piano compositions: Wild Men's Dance (aka Danse Sauvage; 1913‚Äì14), Impressions of the Thames ( 1913‚Äì14), and Impressions of Notre Dame ( 1913‚Äì14) were the first works to explore the tone cluster in depth ever heard by a substantial audience. Wild Men's Dance, in particular, was constructed almost entirely out of clusters ().See Broyles (2004), p. 78, for premiere of these works. The piano music for Ornstein's Sonata for Violin and Piano, op. 31 (1915; not 1913 as is often erroneously given), also employs tone clusters, though not to the extent of Wild Men's Dance. Three Moods ( 1914) for solo piano has been said to contain clusters (Pollack [2000], p. 44); perusal online of the published score, however, does not reveal any. Ornstein's solo piano piece Suicide in an Airplane (n.d.), which makes incontrovertible use of tone clusters in one extended passage, is often erroneously dated \\"1913\\" or \\" 1913\\"; in fact, it is undated and there is no record of its existence before 1919 (Anderson [2002]). In 1918, critic Charles L. Buchanan described Ornstein's innovation: \\"[He] gives us masses of shrill, hard dissonances, chords consisting of anywhere from eight to a dozen notes made up of half tones heaped one upon another.\\"Quoted in Chase (1992), p. 450. Clusters were also beginning to appear in more pieces by European composers. Isaac Alb√©niz's use of them in Iberia (1905‚Äì8) may have influenced Gabriel Faur√©'s subsequent piano writing.Nectoux (2004), p. 171. Joseph Horowitz has suggested that the \\"dissonant star clusters\\" in its third and fourth books were particularly compelling to Olivier Messiaen, who called Iberia \\"the wonder of the piano.\\"Horowitz (2010), p. 18. The Thomas de Hartmann score for Wassily Kandinsky's stage show The Yellow Sound (1909) employs a chromatic cluster at two climactic points.Finney (1967), p. 74. Alban Berg's Four Pieces for clarinet and piano (1913) calls for clusters along with other avant-garde keyboard techniques.Pino (1998), p. 258. Claude Debussy's Piano Prelude \\"La Cath√©drale Engloutie\\" makes powerful use of clusters to evoke the sound of ‚Äúpealing bells ‚Äì with so many added major seconds one would call this pan- diatonic harmony.‚ÄùDeVoto, M.

Cambridge University Press.Debussy \\"La cath√©drale engloutie\\", bars 22‚Äì28Debussy \\"La cath√©drale engloutie\\", bars 22‚Äì28 In his 1913 piano prelude \\"General Lavine ‚Äì Excentric\\", one of the first pieces to be influenced by black American popular styles (the Cakewalk) Debussy features abrasive tone clusters at the conclusion of the following passage: Debussy, \\"General Lavine\\" ‚Äì excentric, bars 11‚Äì19Debussy, \\"General Lavine\\" ‚Äì excentric, bars 11‚Äì18 In his 1915 arrangement for solo piano of his Six Epigraphes Antiques (1914), originally a set of piano duets, Debussy includes tone clusters in the fifth piece, Pour l'Egyptienne.Hinson (1990), pp. 43‚Äì44.Debussy, Pour l'Egyptienne from 6 Epigraphes Antiques (solo piano version) Russian composer Vladimir Rebikov used them extensively in his Three Idylles, Op. 50, written in 1913. Richard Strauss's An Alpine Symphony (1915) \\"starts and ends with the setting sun‚Äîa B flat minor chord cluster slowly built down.\\"W.S.M. (1958), p. 63. Though much of his work was made public only years later, Charles Ives had been exploring the possibilities of the tone cluster‚Äîwhich he referred to as the \\"group chord\\"‚Äîfor some time. In 1906‚Äì7, Ives composed his first mature piece to extensively feature tone clusters, Scherzo: Over the Pavements.Thomas B. Holmes (1985; 2002: p. 35) notes that the song Majority (aka The Masses), written by Ives in 1888 at the age of fourteen, incorporates tone clusters in the piano accompaniment. He correctly describes this as \\"a rebellious act for a beginning composer.\\" He errs in calling it \\"probably the first documented use of a tone cluster in a score\\". Swafford (1998) observes that Ives chose to begin his 114 Songs (publ. 1922) with the work (pp. 227, 271, 325). And he too miscredits Ives with the \\"invention of the tone cluster\\" (p. 231). On the other hand, he valuably points to Ives's awareness that \\"tone clusters...had been there since time immemorial when large groups sang. The mistakes were part of the music\\" (p. 98). Orchestrated for a nine-piece ensemble, it includes both black- and white-note clusters for the piano.Nicholls (1991), p. 57. Revised in 1913, it would not be recorded and published until the 1950s and would have to wait until 1963 to receive its first public performance. During the same period that Ornstein was introducing tone clusters to the concert stage, Ives was developing a piece with what would become the most famous set of clusters: in the second movement, \\"Hawthorne,\\" of the Concord Sonata ( 1904‚Äì15, publ. 1920, prem. 1928, rev. 1947), mammoth piano chords require a wooden bar almost fifteen inches long to play.Reed (2005), p. 59; Swafford (1998), p. 262. The \\"Hawthorne\\" movement was based on the unfinished Hawthorne Concerto of 1910, from which it was recomposed largely in 1911‚Äì12. See Ives (1947), p. iii. The gentle clusters produced by the felt- or flannel-covered bar represent the sound of far-off church bells ().Shreffler (1991), p. 3; Hitchcock (2004), p. 2. Later in the movement, there are a series of five-note diatonic clusters for the right hand. In his notes to the score, Ives indicates that \\"these group-chords...may, if the player feels like it, be hit with the clenched fist.\\"Ives (1947), p. 73. Ives's orthography was not consistent. When the term \\"group chord\\" is introduced earlier in the notes, it appears without a hyphen. Between 1911 and 1913, Ives also wrote ensemble pieces with tone clusters such as his Second String Quartet and the orchestral Decoration Day and Fourth of July, though none of these would be publicly performed before the 1930s.Swafford (1998), pp. 251, 252, 472, for descriptions; Sinclair (1999), passim, for proper dating of Scherzo: Over the Pavements, Concord Sonata, and other named pieces: Second String Quartet (1911‚Äì13, prem. 1946, publ. 1954); Decoration Day ( 1912‚Äì13, rev. 1923‚Äì24, prem. 1931, publ. 1962); Fourth of July ( 1911‚Äì13, rev. 1931, publ./prem. 1932). =In the work of Henry Cowell= As a composer, performer, and theorist, Henry Cowell was largely responsible for establishing the tone cluster in the lexicon of modern classical music. In June 1913, a sixteen-year-old Californian with no formal musical training wrote a solo piano piece, Adventures in Harmony, employing \\"primitive tone clusters.\\"Nicholls (1991), p. 134. Henry Cowell would soon emerge as the seminal figure in promoting the cluster harmonic technique. Ornstein abandoned the concert stage in the early 1920s and, anyway, clusters had served him as practical harmonic devices, not as part of a larger theoretical mission. In the case of Ives, clusters comprised a relatively small part of his compositional output, much of which went unheard for years. For the intellectually ambitious Cowell‚Äîwho heard Ornstein perform in New York in 1916‚Äîclusters were crucial to the future of music. He set out to explore their \\"overall, cumulative, and often programmatic effects.\\"Broyles (2004), p. 342, n. 10. Dynamic Motion (1916) for solo piano, written when Cowell was nineteen, has been described as \\"probably the first piece anywhere using secundal chords independently for musical extension and variation.\\"Bart√≥k et al. (1963), p. 14 (unpaginated). Though that is not quite accurate, it does appear to be the first piece to employ chromatic clusters in such a manner. A solo piano piece Cowell wrote the following year, The Tides of Manaunaun (1917), would prove to be his most popular work and the composition most responsible for establishing the tone cluster as a significant element in Western classical music. (Cowell's early piano works are often erroneously dated; in the two cases above, as 1914 and 1912, respectively.Correct dating of Cowell's early works is per Hicks (2002), pp. 80, 85. Correct dating of Cowell's work in general is per the standard catalogue, Lichtenwanger (1986).) Assumed by some to involve an essentially random‚Äîor, more kindly, aleatoric‚Äîpianistic approach, Cowell would explain that precision is required in the writing and performance of tone clusters no less than with any other musical feature: > Tone clusters...on the piano [are] whole scales of tones used as chords, or > at least three contiguous tones along a scale being used as a chord. And, at > times, if these chords exceed the number of tones that you have fingers on > your hand, it may be necessary to play these either with the flat of the > hand or sometimes with the full forearm. This is not done from the > standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique, although it actually > amounts to that, but rather because this is the only practicable method of > playing such large chords. It should be obvious that these chords are exact > and that one practices diligently in order to play them with the desired > tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature.Cowell (1993), > 12:16‚Äì13:14. Historian and critic Kyle Gann describes the broad range of ways in which Cowell constructed (and thus performed) his clusters and used them as musical textures, \\"sometimes with a top note brought out melodically, sometimes accompanying a left-hand melody in parallel.\\" Beginning in 1921, with an article serialized in The Freeman, an Irish cultural journal, Cowell popularized the term tone cluster.Hicks (2002), pp. 106‚Äì8. While he did not coin the phrase, as is often claimed, he appears to have been the first to use it with its current meaning.See Seachrist (2003), p. 215, n. 15, for an example of a claim that the \\"term was invented by Henry Cowell.\\" Tone cluster had been used with a different meaning since at least 1910 by music theorist and educator Percy Goetschius (n.d., 111): referring to an example of three- part counterpoint, \\"there is some good chord-form at almost every accent, some harmonic tone-cluster towards which the parts unanimously lead.\\" See also his correspondence, \\"Schoenberg's 'Harmony,'\\" in The New Music Review and Church Music Review, vol. 14, no. 168 (November 1915), p. 404: \\"I have regretted that I did not, in revising my 'Material,' lay still greater stress upon the accidental tone-clusters such as you illustrate\\"; \\"in Ex. 318, No. 5, you will find the Mozart tone-cluster which you give in your Ex. 11.\\" During the 1920s and 1930s, Cowell toured widely through North America and Europe, playing his own experimental works, many built around tone clusters. In addition to The Tides of Manaunaun, Dynamic Motion, and its five \\"encores\\"‚ÄîWhat's This (1917), Amiable Conversation (1917), Advertisement (1917), Antinomy (1917, rev. 1959; frequently misspelled \\"Antimony\\"), and Time Table (1917)‚Äîthese include The Voice of Lir (1920), Exultation (1921), The Harp of Life (1924), Snows of Fujiyama (1924), Lilt of the Reel (1930), and Deep Color (1938). Tiger (1930) has a chord of 53 notes, probably the largest ever written for a single instrument until 1969.\\"Other: 1. Vertical extremes\\" in Extremes of Conventional Music Notation. Along with Ives, Cowell wrote some of the first large-ensemble pieces to make extensive use of clusters. The Birth of Motion ( 1920), his earliest such effort, combines orchestral clusters with glissando.Yunwha Rao (2004), p. 245. \\"Tone Cluster,\\" the second movement of Cowell's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928, prem. 1978), employs a wide variety of clusters for the piano and each instrumental group ().Zwenzner (2001), p. 13. From a quarter-century later, his Symphony No. 11 (1953) features a sliding chromatic cluster played by muted violins.Yunwha Rao (2004), p. 138. In his theoretical work New Musical Resources (1930), a major influence on the classical avant-garde for many decades, Cowell argued that clusters should not be employed simply for color: > In harmony it is often better for the sake of consistency to maintain a > whole succession of clusters, once they are begun; since one alone, or even > two, may be heard as a mere effect, rather than as an independent and > significant procedure, carried with musical logic to its inevitable > conclusion.Quoted in Gann (1997), p. 174. =In later classical music= B√©la Bart√≥k and Henry Cowell met in December 1923. Early the next year, the Hungarian composer wrote Cowell to ask whether he might adopt tone clusters without causing offense. In 1922, composer Dane Rudhyar, a friend of Cowell's, declared approvingly that the development of the tone cluster \\"imperilled [the] existence\\" of \\"the musical unit, the note.\\"Quoted in Hicks (2002), p. 108. While that threat was not to be realized, clusters began to appear in the works of a growing number of composers. Already, Aaron Copland had written his Three Moods (aka Trois Esquisses; 1920‚Äì21) for piano‚Äîits name an apparent homage to a piece of Leo Ornstein's‚Äîwhich includes a triple-forte cluster.Pollack (2000), p. 44. The most renowned composer to be directly inspired by Cowell's demonstrations of his tone cluster pieces was B√©la Bart√≥k, who requested Cowell's permission to employ the method.Stevens (1993), p. 67. Bart√≥k's First Piano Concerto, Piano Sonata, and the \\"Night Music\\" from the Out of Doors suite (all 1926), his first significant works after three years in which he produced little, extensively feature tone clusters.Steinberg (2000), p. 37; Satola (2005), pp. 85‚Äì86; Lampert and Somfai (1984), p. 60. In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison utilized keyboard clusters in several works such as his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937).Miller and Lieberman (2004), pp. 10, 135. At least as far back as 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters.Salzman (1996), p. 3 (unpaginated). Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant J√©sus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece of the first half of the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout.Meister (2006), p. 131‚Äì32. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierst√ºck X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi.Harvey (1975), p. 43; Henck (1980), p. 17; Maconie (2005), p. 217. Written two decades later, his Klavierst√ºck XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard.Rigoni (2001), p. 53. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections.Kramer (2000), p. 137. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.\\"Other: 1. Vertical extremes\\" in Extremes of Conventional Music Notation. While tone clusters are conventionally associated with the piano, and the solo piano repertoire in particular, they have also assumed important roles in compositions for chamber groups and larger ensembles. Robert Reigle identifies Croatian composer Josip Slavenski's organ-and-violin Sonata Religiosa (1925), with its sustained chromatic clusters, as \\"a missing link between Ives and [Gy√∂rgy] Ligeti.\\" Bart√≥k employs both diatonic and chromatic clusters in his Fourth String Quartet (1928). See also Robin Stowell, \\"Extending the Technical and Expressive Frontiers,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet, ed. Stowell (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003; ), pp. 149‚Äì73; p. 162. The sound mass technique in such works as Ruth Crawford Seeger's String Quartet (1931) and Iannis Xenakis's Metastaseis (1955) is an elaboration of the tone cluster. \\"Unlike most tonal and non-tonal linear dissonances, tone clusters are essentially static. The individual pitches are of secondary importance; it is the sound mass that is foremost.\\"Reisberg, Horace (1975). \\"The Vertical Dimension\\", Aspects of 20th Century Music, p.355. Wittlich, Gary; ed. Prentice-Hall. . In one of the most famous pieces associated with the sound mass aesthetic, containing, \\"one of the largest clustering of individual pitches that has been written\\",Reisberg (1975), p.358. Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1959), for fifty-two string instruments, the quarter-tone clusters \\"see[m] to have abstracted and intensified the features that define shrieks of terror and keening cries of sorrow.\\"Hogan (2003), p. 179. Clusters appear in two sections of the electronic music of Stockhausen's Kontakte (1958‚Äì60)‚Äîfirst as \\"hammering points...very difficult to synthesize\\", according to Robin Maconie, then as glissandi.Maconie (2005), p. 217. In 1961, Ligeti wrote perhaps the largest cluster chord ever‚Äîin the orchestral Atmosph√®res, every note in the chromatic scale over a range of five octaves is played at once (quietly).Steinitz (2003), p. 108. Ligeti's organ works make extensive use of clusters. Volumina (1961‚Äì62), graphically notated, consists of static and mobile cluster masses, and calls on many advanced cluster-playing techniques.Steinitz (2003), pp. 124‚Äì26; Herchenr√∂der (2002), p. 303. The eighth movement of Messiaen's oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur J√©sus-Christ (1965‚Äì69) features \\"a shimmering halo of tone-cluster glissandi\\" in the strings, evoking the \\"bright cloud\\" to which the narrative refers ().Smither (2000), p. 674. Orchestral clusters are employed throughout Stockhausen's Fresco (1969) and Trans (1971).Maconie (2005), p. 338. In Morton Feldman's Rothko Chapel (1971), \\"Wordless vocal tone clusters seep out through the skeletal arrangements of viola, celeste, and percussion.\\" Aldo Clementi's chamber ensemble piece Ceremonial (1973) evokes both Verdi and Ives, combining the original extended- duration and mass cluster concepts: a weighted wooden board placed on an electric harmonium maintains a tone cluster throughout the work. Judith Bingham's Prague (1995) gives a brass band the opportunity to create tone clusters. Keyboard clusters are set against orchestral forces in piano concertos such as Einojuhani Rautavaara's first (1969) and Esa-Pekka Salonen's (2007), the latter suggestive of Messiaen.Tommasini (2007). The choral compositions of Eric Whitacre often employ clusters. Three composers who made frequent use of tone clusters for a wide variety of ensembles are Giacinto Scelsi, Alfred Schnittke‚Äîboth of whom often worked with them in microtonal contexts‚Äîand Lou Harrison. Scelsi employed them for much of his career, including in his last large-scale work, Pfhat (1974), which premiered in 1986.Halbreich (1988), pp. 9, 11 (unpaginated). They are found in works of Schnittke's ranging from the Quintet for Piano and Strings (1972‚Äì76), where \\"microtonal strings fin[d] tone clusters between the cracks of the piano keys,\\" to the choral Psalms of Repentance (1988). Harrison's many pieces featuring clusters include Pacifika Rondo (1963), Concerto for Organ with Percussion (1973), Piano Concerto (1983‚Äì85), Three Songs for male chorus (1985), Grand Duo (1988), and Rhymes with Silver (1996).Miller and Lieberman (2004), pp. 10, 99, 135, 155. =In jazz= Scott Joplin wrote the first known published composition to include a musical sequence built around specifically notated tone clusters. Tone clusters have been employed by jazz artists in a variety of styles, since the very beginning of the form. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Storyville pianist Jelly Roll Morton began performing a ragtime adaptation of a French quadrille, introducing large chromatic tone clusters played by his left forearm. The growling effect led Morton to dub the piece his \\"Tiger Rag\\" ().Lomax (2001), pp. 66‚Äì69; Spaeth (1948), p. 420. In 1909, Scott Joplin's deliberately experimental \\"Wall Street Rag\\" included a section prominently featuring notated tone clusters.See Floyd (1995), p. 72; Berlin (1994), p. 187.Scott Joplin, from Wall Street Rag Scott Joplin, from Wall Street RagThe fourth of Artie Matthews's Pastime Rags (1913‚Äì20) features dissonant right-hand clusters.Magee (1998), p. 402. Thelonious Monk, in pieces such as \\"Bright Mississippi\\" (1962), \\"Introspection\\" (1946) and \\"Off Minor\\" (1947), uses clusters as dramatic figures within the central improvisation and to accent the tension at its conclusion.Meadows (2003), ch. 10. They are heard on Art Tatum's \\"Mr. Freddy Blues\\" (1950), undergirding the cross- rhythms.Harrison (1997), p. 315. By 1953, Dave Brubeck was employing piano tone clusters and dissonance in a manner anticipating the style free jazz pioneer Cecil Taylor would soon develop. The approach of hard bop pianist Horace Silver is an even clearer antecedent to Taylor's use of clusters.Hazell (1997); Litweiler (1990), p. 202. See also Watrous (1989). During the same era, clusters appear as punctuation marks in the lead lines of Herbie Nichols.Litweiler (1990), p. 23. In \\"The Gig\\" (1955), described by Francis Davis as Nichols's masterpiece, \\"clashing notes and tone clusters depic[t] a pickup band at odds with itself about what to play.\\"Davis (2004), p. 78. Recorded examples of Duke Ellington's piano cluster work include \\"Summertime\\" (1961) and ...And His Mother Called Him Bill (1967) and This One's for Blanton!, his tribute to a former bass player, recorded in 1972 with bassist Ray Brown. Bill Evans' interpretation of ‚ÄúCome Rain or Come Shine‚Äù from the album Portrait in Jazz (1960), opens with a striking 5-tone cluster. Lee, W.F. (2002, p.6) Bill Evans Piano interpretations. Hal Leonard. In jazz, as in classical music, tone clusters have not been restricted to the keyboard. In the 1930s, the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra's \\"Stratosphere\\" included ensemble clusters among an array of progressive elements.Determeyer (2006), p. 78. The Stan Kenton Orchestra's April 1947 recording of \\"If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight,\\" arranged by Pete Rugolo, features a dramatic four-note trombone cluster at the end of the second chorus. As described by critic Fred Kaplan, a 1950 performance by the Duke Ellington Orchestra features arrangements with the collective \\"blowing rich, dark, tone clusters that evoke Ravel.\\" Chord clusters also feature in the scores of arranger Gil Evans. In his characteristically imaginative arrangement of George Gershwin's \\"There's a boat that's leaving soon for New York\\" from the album Porgy and Bess, Evans contributes chord clusters orchestrated on flutes, alto saxophone and muted trumpets as a background to accompany Miles Davis' solo improvisation. In the early 1960s, arrangements by Bob Brookmeyer and Gerry Mulligan for Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band employed tone clusters in a dense style bringing to mind both Ellington and Ravel. Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet solos would often feature \\"microtonal clusters summoned by frantic overblowing.\\"Weinstein (1993), p. 84. Critic Robert Palmer called the \\"tart tone cluster\\" that \\"pierces a song's surfaces and penetrates to its heart\\" a specialty of guitarist Jim Hall's.Palmer (1986). Clusters are especially prevalent in the realm of free jazz. Cecil Taylor has used them extensively as part of his improvisational method since the mid-1950s.Litweiler (1990), p. 202. See also Anderson (2006), pp. 57‚Äì58. Like much of his musical vocabulary, his clusters operate \\"on a continuum somewhere between melody and percussion.\\"Pareles (1988). One of Taylor's primary purposes in adopting clusters was to avoid the dominance of any specific pitch.Anderson (2006), p. 111. Leading free jazz composer, bandleader, and pianist Sun Ra often used them to rearrange the musical furniture, as described by scholar John F. Szwed: > When he sensed that [a] piece needed an introduction or an ending, a new > direction or fresh material, he would call for a space chord, a collectively > improvised tone cluster at high volume which \\"would suggest a new melody, > maybe a rhythm.\\" It was a pianistically conceived device which created > another context for the music, a new mood, opening up fresh tonal > areas.Szwed (1998), p. 214. As free jazz spread in the 1960s, so did the use of tone clusters. In comparison with what John Litweiler describes as Taylor's \\"endless forms and contrasts,\\" the solos of Muhal Richard Abrams employ tone clusters in a similarly free, but more lyrical, flowing context.Litweiler (1990), p. 182. Guitarist Sonny Sharrock made them a central part of his improvisations; in Palmer's description, he executed \\"glass-shattering tone clusters that sounded like someone was ripping the pickups out of the guitar without having bothered to unplug it from its overdriven amplifier.\\"Palmer (1991). Pianist Marilyn Crispell has been another major free jazz proponent of the tone cluster, frequently in collaboration with Anthony Braxton, who played with Abrams early in his career.Enstice and Stockhouse (2004), p. 81. Since the 1990s, Matthew Shipp has built on Taylor's innovations with the form.Weinstein (1996). European free jazz pianists who have contributed to the development of the tone cluster palette include Gunter Hampel and Alexander von Schlippenbach. Don Pullen, who bridged free and mainstream jazz, \\"had a technique of rolling his wrists as he improvised‚Äîthe outside edges of his hands became scarred from it‚Äîto create moving tone clusters,\\" writes critic Ben Ratliff. \\"Building up from arpeggios, he could create eddies of noise on the keyboard...like concise Cecil Taylor outbursts.\\" In the description of Joachim Berendt, Pullen \\"uniquely melodized cluster playing and made it tonal. He phrases impulsively raw clusters with his right hand and yet embeds them in clear, harmonically functional tonal chords simultaneously played with the left hand.\\"Berendt (1992), p. 287. John Medeski employs tone clusters as keyboardist for Medeski, Martin, and Wood, which mixes free jazz elements into its soul jazz/jam band style.Pareles (2000). =In popular music= Like jazz, rock and roll has made use of tone clusters since its birth, if characteristically in a less deliberate manner‚Äîmost famously, Jerry Lee Lewis's live-performance piano technique of the 1950s, involving fists, feet, and derri√®re.Tyler (2008), p. 76; Morrison (1998), p. 95. Since the 1960s, much drone music, which crosses the lines between rock, electronic, and experimental music, has been based on tone clusters. On The Velvet Underground's \\"Sister Ray,\\" recorded in September 1967, organist John Cale uses tone clusters within the context of a drone; the song is apparently the closest approximation on record of the band's early live sound.Schwartz (1996), pp. 97, 94. Around the same time, Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek began introducing clusters into his solos during live performances of the band's hit \\"Light My Fire.\\"Hicks (1999), p. 88. Kraftwerk's self-titled 1970 debut album employs organ clusters to add variety to its repeated tape sequences.Bussy (2004), p. 31. In 1971, critic Ed Ward lauded the \\"tone-cluster vocal harmonies\\" created by Jefferson Airplane's three lead singers, Grace Slick, Marty Balin, and Paul Kantner.Quoted in Brackett (2002), p. 217. Tangerine Dream's 1972 double album Zeit is replete with clusters performed on synthesizer.Patterson (2001), p. 505. In later rock practice, the D add9 chord characteristic of jangle pop involves a three-note set separated by major seconds (D, E, F), the sort of guitar cluster that may be characterized as a harp effect.Rooksby (2003), pp 18‚Äì19, 96. The Band's 1968 song \\"The Weight\\" from their debut album Music from Big Pink features a dissonant vocal refrain with suspensions culminating in a 3-note cluster to the words \\"you put the load right on me.\\" The sound of tone clusters played on the organ became a convention in radio drama for dreams. Clusters are often used in the scoring of horror and science-fiction films.For a discussion of the use of tone clusters in film scoring, see Huckvale 1990, pp. 1‚Äì35. For descriptions of their role in three individual films, Hosokawa 2004,p. 60n21; for To the Devil a Daughter, Huckvale 2008, pp. 179‚Äì81 ; and, for Close Encounters, Neil Lerner, \\"Nostalgia, Masculinist Discourse, and Authoritarianism in John Williams' Scores for Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\\" in Off the Planet, pp. 96‚Äì107; 105‚Äì6. For a 2004 production of the play Tone Clusters by Joyce Carol Oates, composer Jay Clarke‚Äîa member of the indie rock bands Dolorean and The Standard‚Äîemployed clusters to \\"subtly build the tension\\", in contrast to what he perceived in the cluster pieces by Cowell and Ives suggested by Oates: ‚ÄúSome of it was like music to murder somebody to; it was like horror-movie music‚Äù.Chandler 2004 Use in other music In traditional Japanese gagaku, the imperial court music, a tone cluster performed on sh≈ç (a type of mouth organ) is generally employed as a harmonic matrix.Malm (2000), pp. 116‚Äì17. Yoritsune Matsudaira, active from the late 1920s to the early 2000s, merged gagakus harmonies and tonalities with avant-garde Western techniques. Much of his work is built on the sh≈çs ten traditional cluster formations.Herd (2008), pp. 373‚Äì74. Lou Harrison's Pacifika Rondo, which mixes Eastern and Western instrumentation and styles, mirrors the gagaku approach‚Äîsustained organ clusters emulate the sound and function of the sh≈ç.Miller and Lieberman (2004), p. 155. The sh≈ç also inspired Benjamin Britten in creating the instrumental texture of his 1964 dramatic church parable Curlew River. Its sound pervades the characteristically sustained cluster chords played on a chamber organ .Cooke, M. (1999, p.183) ‚ÄúDistant Horizons‚Äù, in The Cambridge Companion to Benjamin Britten. Cambridge University Press. Traditional Korean court and aristocratic music employs passages of simultaneous ornamentation on multiple instruments, creating dissonant clusters; this technique is reflected in the work of twentieth-century Korean German composer Isang Yun.Howard (2006), p. 152. Several East Asian free reed instruments, including the sh≈ç, were modeled on the sheng, an ancient Chinese folk instrument later incorporated into more formal musical contexts. Wubaduhesheng, one of the traditional chord formations played on the sheng, involves a three-pitch cluster.Wang (2005), p. 65. Malayan folk musicians employ an indigenous mouth organ that, like the sh≈ç and sheng, produces tone clusters.Musical Courier 164 (1962), p. 12. The characteristic musical form played on the bin-baja, a strummed harp of central India's Pardhan people, has been described as a \\"rhythmic ostinato on a tone cluster.\\"Knight (1985). Among the Asante, in the region that is today encompassed by Ghana, tone clusters are used in traditional trumpet music. A distinctive \\"tongue-rattling technique gives a greater vibrancy to...already dissonant tonal cluster[s].... [I]ntentional dissonance dispels evil spirits, and the greater the clangor, the greater the sound barrage.Kaminski (2012), p. 185. Wendy Carlos used essentially the exact reverse of this methodology to derive her Alpha scale, Beta scale and Gamma scale; they are the most consonant scales one can derive by treating tone clusters as the only type of triad that really exists, which is paradoxically an anti-harmonic monistic method.

The festival was one of the first arts festivals in Canada and continues to be one of its most prominent. It is recognized worldwide for its productions of Shakespearean plays. The festival's primary focus is to present productions of William Shakespeare's plays, but it also runs a wide variety of theatre from Greek tragedy to Broadway-style musicals and contemporary works. In the early years of the festival, Shakespeare's works typically represented about a third of the offerings in the largest venue, the Festival Theatre. By 2017, however, only three of the 14 productions were Shakespeare's works. The success of the festival changed Stratford into a city where arts and tourism play important roles in the economy. The festival attracts many tourists from outside Canada, most notably British and American visitors. History Avon River. The Festival was founded as the Stratford Shakespearean Festival of Canada, by Tom Patterson, a Stratford-native journalist who wanted to revitalize his town's economy by creating a theatre festival dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare, as the town shares the name of Shakespeare's birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Stratford was a railway junction and major locomotive shop, and was facing a disastrous loss of employment with the imminent elimination of steam power. Patterson achieved his goal after gaining encouragement from Mayor David Simpson and the local council, and the Stratford Shakespearean Festival became a legal entity on October 31, 1952. Already established in Canadian theatre, Dora Mavor Moore helped put Patterson in touch with British actor and director Tyrone Guthrie, first with a transatlantic telephone call. On July 13, 1953, actor Alec Guinness spoke the first lines of the first play produced by the festival, a production of Richard III: \\"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York.\\"J. Alan B. Somerset. 1991. The Stratford Festival Story, 1st edition. Greenwood Press. Tom Patterson. 1987. First Stage. McClelland and Stewart. Guinness and Irene Worth were among the cast of Stratford's inaugural performance of Richard III, working for expenses only. This first performances (like the entire first four seasons) took place in a concrete amphitheatre covered by giant canvas tent on the banks of the River Avon. The first of many years of Stratford Shakespeare Festival production history started with a six-week season opening on 13 July 1953 with Richard III and then All's Well That Ends Well, both starring Alec Guinness. The 1954 season ran for nine weeks and included Sophocles‚Äô Oedipus Rex and two Shakespeare plays, Measure for Measure and The Taming of the Shrew. Young actors during the first four seasons included several who went on to great success in subsequent years, Douglas Campbell, Timothy Findley, Don Harron, William Hutt and Douglas Rain. Fundraising to build a permanent theatre was slow but was helped significantly by donations from Governor General Vincent Massey and the Perth Mutual Insurance Company. The new Festival Theatre was dedicated on 30 June 1957, with seating for over 1,800 people; no seats are more than 65 feet from the stage. The design was deliberately intended to resemble a huge tent. That season's productions included Hamlet, Twelfth Night, the satirical My Fur Lady, The Turn of the Screw and Ibsen's Peer Gynt. The Festival Theatre's thrust stage was designed by British designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch to resemble both a classic Greek amphitheatre and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. It has since become a model for other stages in North America and Great Britain.Tyrone Guthrie. 1959. A Life in the Theatre. McGraw Hill. Martin Hunter. Romancing the Bard: Stratford at Fifty. Dundurn Press. 2001. Tony Award-nominee Scott Wentworth has performed in the festival's stage productions on numerous occasions since 1985, beginning with The Glass Menagerie; the festival has helped Sara Topham launch her career in acting, performing from 2000 to 2011; and a young, unknown Christopher Walken appeared in Stratford's 1968 stage productions of Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream, portraying Romeo and Lysander respectively. Long-serving Artistic Director Richard Monette retired in 2007 after holding the position for fourteen seasons. He was replaced with an artistic team consisting of General Director Antoni Cimolino and Artistic Directors Marti Maraden, Des McAnuff, and Don Shipley. On March 12, 2008, it was announced that Shipley and Maraden would be stepping down, leaving Des McAnuff as sole Artistic Director. In 2013 Des McAnuff was replaced by Antoni Cimolino as Artistic Director.Stratford Festival vet Antoni Cimolino to take over for Des McAnuff In 2012 the Festival had a deficit of $3.4 million, but by 2015 had a surplus of $3.1 million under the control of Cimolino and executive director Anita Gaffney. They had not yet reached the target of a half million ticket sales for the season (a previous record) but had achieved a significant increase in the number of new patrons to the theatres. On 17 February 2015, AP News reported that the Stratford Shakespeare Festival plans to film all of Shakespeare's plays.

It was partly nationalised in 1975, when the UK government created a holding company called British Leyland, later renamed BL in 1978. It incorporated much of the British-owned motor vehicle industry, which in 1968 had a 40 percent share of the UK car market, with roots going back to 1895. Despite containing profitable marques such as Jaguar, Rover and Land Rover, as well as the best- selling Mini, British Leyland had a troubled history,Austin Rover Online leading to its eventual collapse in 1975 and subsequent part-nationalisation. After much restructuring and divestment of subsidiary companies, BLMC was renamed as the Rover Group in 1986, becoming a subsidiary of British Aerospace from 1988 to 1994, then subsequently being bought by BMW. The final surviving incarnation of the company as the MG Rover Group went into administration in 2005, bringing mass car production by British-owned manufacturers to an end. MG and the Austin, Morris and Wolseley marques became part of China's SAIC, with whom MG Rover attempted to merge prior to administration. Today, Mini, Jaguar Land Rover and Leyland Trucks (now owned by BMW, Tata Motors and Paccar, respectively) are the three most prominent former parts of British Leyland which are still active in the automotive industry, with SAIC-owned MG Motor continuing a small presence at the Longbridge site. Certain other related ex-BL businesses, such as Unipart, continue to operate independently. History BLMC share =1968-74: Creation of BLMC, and the Stokes era= BLMC was created on 17 January 1968 by the merger of British Motor Holdings (BMH) and Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC), encouraged by Tony Benn as chairman of the Industrial Reorganisation Committee created by the first Wilson Government. At the time, LMC was a successful manufacturer, while BMH (which was the product of an earlier merger between the British Motor Corporation, Pressed Steel and Jaguar) was perilously close to collapse. The Government was hopeful LMC's expertise would revive the ailing BMH, and effectively create a \\"British General Motors\\". The merger combined most of the remaining independent British car manufacturing companies and included car, bus and truck manufacturers and more diverse enterprises including: construction equipment, refrigerators, metal casting companies, road surface manufacturers; in all, nearly one hundred different companies. The new corporation was arranged into seven divisions under its new chairman, Sir Donald Stokes (formerly the chairman of LMC). The seven divisions were: * Austin-Morris; the volume car division made up entirely of the former British Motor Corporation marques (Austin, Morris, MG, Riley and Wolseley), as well as Austin and BMC branded light commercial vehicles. * Specialist Division; the sports/luxury marques (Rover, Land Rover, Alvis, Triumph and Jaguar - the latter having moved across from the old BMC/BMH organisation). * Leyland Truck and Bus; the original Leyland commercial vehicles business. * Pressed Steel Fisher (PSF); the original Pressed Steel Company which had been a BMH subsidiary that made car body panels for both BLMC and other manufacturers. * Overseas; made up largely of BLMC's satellite car manufacturing operations around the world - many of these had been inherited from BMH. * Construction Equipment * General Engineering & Foundries 1962 Austin Cambridge While BMH was the UK's largest car manufacturer (producing over twice as many cars as LMC), it offered a range of dated vehicles, including the Morris Minor which was introduced in 1948 and the Austin Cambridge and Morris Oxford, which dated back to 1959. Although BMH had enjoyed great success in the 1960s with both the Mini and the 1100/1300, both cars were infamously underpriced and despite their pioneering but unproven front wheel drive engineering, warranty costs had been crippling and had badly eroded those models' profitability. After the merger, Lord Stokes was horrified to find that BMH had no plans to replace the elderly designs in its portfolio. Also, BMH's design efforts immediately prior to the merger had focused on unfortunate niche market models such as the Austin Maxi (which was underdeveloped and with an appearance hampered by using the doors from the larger Austin 1800) and the Austin 3 litre, a car with no discernible place in the market. Triumph GT6 Mk III The lack of attention to the development of new mass-market models meant that BMH had nothing in the way of new models in the pipeline to compete effectively with popular rivals such as Ford's Escort and Cortina. Immediately, Lord Stokes instigated plans to design and introduce new models quickly. The first result of this crash programme was the Morris Marina in early-1971. It used parts from various BL models with new bodywork to produce BL's mass-market competitor. It was one of the strongest- selling cars in the United Kingdom during the 1970s; being the second-most popular new car sold in Britain in 1973. Although by the end of production in 1980 it was widely regarded as a dismal product that had damaged the company's reputation. The Austin Allegro (replacement for the 1100/1300 ranges), launched in 1973, earned a similarly unwanted reputation over its ten-year production life. Austin 1800 The company became an infamous monument to the industrial turmoil that plagued the United Kingdom during the 1970s. Industrial action instigated by militant shop stewards frequently brought BL's manufacturing capability to its knees. Despite the duplication of production facilities as a result of the merger, there were multiple single points of failure in the company's production network which meant that a strike in a single plant could stop many of the others. Both Ford and General Motors had mitigated against this years before by merging their previously separate British and German subsidiaries and product lines (Ford had created Ford of Europe, whilst GM nurtured closer collaboration between Vauxhall and Opel), so that production could be sourced from either British or Continental European plants in the event of industrial unrest. The upshot was that both Ford and Vauxhall ultimately overtook BL to become Britain's two best-selling marques, a title they hold to the present day. At the same time, a tide of Japanese imports, spearheaded by Nissan (Datsun) and Toyota exploited both BL's inability to supply its customers and its declining reputation for quality. By the end of the 1970s, the UK Government had introduced protectionist measures in the form of import quotas on Japanese manufacturers in order to protect the ailing domestic producers (both BL and Chrysler Europe), which it was helping to sustain. At its peak, BLMC owned almost forty manufacturing plants across the country. Even before the merger, BMH had included theoretically competing marques that were in fact selling substantially similar badge engineered cars. The British Motor Corporation had never properly integrated either the dealer networks or the production facilities of Austin and Morris. This had been done partly to appease poor industrial relations ‚Äì workers at Cowley for example still perceived themselves as \\"Morris\\" employees and still, therefore they refused to assemble cars badged as Austins, and the converse was true at the former Austin plant at Longbridge. The upshot was that both plants were producing badge engineered models of otherwise identical cars so that each network would have a product to sell. This meant that Austin and Morris still, to an extent, competed with each other and meant that each product was saddled with effectively twice the logistics, marketing and distribution costs that it would have if sold under a single name or if production of a single model platform was concentrated in one factory. Although BL did eventually end the wasteful double sourcing ‚Äì for example production of the Mini and the 1100/1300 was concentrated at Longbridge, whilst the 1800 and Austin Maxi ranges moved to Cowley, the production of sub assemblies as well as component suppliers were scattered all over the Midlands which greatly increased the cost of keeping the factories running. BMH and Leyland Motors had expanded and acquired companies throughout the 1950s and 1960s in order to compete with one another, with the result that when the two conglomerates were brought together into BL there was even more internal competition. Rover competed with Jaguar at the expensive end of the market, and Triumph with its family cars and sports cars against Austin, Morris and MG. Internal politics became so bad that one marque's team would attempt to derail another marque's programs. Individual model lines that were similarly sized were therefore competing against each other, yet were never discontinued nor were model ranges rationalised quickly enough; in fact the policy of having multiple models competing in the same market segment continued long after the merger ‚Äì for instance BMH's MGB remained in production alongside LMC's Triumph TR6, the Rover P5 competed with the Jaguar XJ, whilst in the medium family sector, the Princess was in direct competition with upscale versions of the Morris Marina and cheaper versions of the Austin Maxi, meaning that economies of scale resulting from large production runs could never be realised. In addition, in consequent attempts to establish British Leyland as a brand in consumers' minds in and outside the UK, print ads and spots were produced, causing confusion rather than attraction for buyers. BL marketing and management attempted to draw more obvious distinctions between the marques ‚Äì most notable was the decision to pitch Morris as a maker of conventional mass-market cars to compete with Ford and Vauxhall and Austin to continue BMC's line of advanced family cars with front-wheel drive and fluid suspension. This resulted in the development of the Morris Marina and the Austin Allegro. The policy's success was mixed. Since the dealership network was still not sufficiently rationalised it meant that Austin and Morris dealers (which had, in BMC/BMH days, each offered a full range of cars both advanced and traditional) had their product range halved and found that they could no longer cater to many previously loyal customers' tastes. The policy was also carried out haphazardly: The advanced, Hydragas-sprung Princess began life in 1975 sold as an Austin, a Morris and a Wolseley before being rebadged altogether under the new Princess name. The Princess (and the Mini, which BL also turned into a marque in its own right) was sold across the Austin-Morris dealership network, making any distinction between the two even more vague to many customers. Critically, the new models that had been introduced by BLMC failed to sell in high enough quantities outside of the home market, despite the UK now being a part of the European Economic Community - with the Allegro and Princess in particular having been tailored for European tastes. However, both these vehicles were saloons when the trend in Europe was moving towards family sized hatchbacks, typified by the Volkswagen Golf in 1974 and the Simca 1307 (Chrysler Alpine) in 1975. The company also wasted many of its scant funds on concepts, like the Rover P8 or P9, that would never be produced to earn money for the company. These internal issues, which were never satisfactorily solved, combined with serious industrial relations problems (with trade unions), the 1973 oil crisis, the three-day week, high inflation and ineffectual management meant that BL became an unmanageable and financially crippled behemoth which went bankrupt in 1975. =1975-1982: Collapse, the Ryder Report and the Edwardes era= 1976 Leyland National British Leyland 270 tractor fitted with aftermarket loader in the United States. Sir Don Ryder was asked to undertake an enquiry into the position of the company, and his report was presented to the government in April 1975. Following Ryder's recommendations, the organisation was drastically restructured and the Labour Government created a new holding company, British Leyland Limited (BL), of which it was the major shareholder, effectively nationalising the company. Between 1975‚Äì80, these shares were vested in the National Enterprise Board which had responsibility for managing this investment.

The tractors were based on the Nuffield designs, but built in a plant in Bathgate, Scotland. *Leyland Special Products ‚Äì the miscellaneous collection of other acquired businesses, itself structured into five sub-divisions: **Construction equipment ‚Äì Aveling- Barford, Aveling-Marshall, Barfords of Belton, and Goodwin-Barsby **Refrigeration ‚Äì Prestcold **Materials handling ‚Äì Coventry Climax (incorporating Climax Trucks, Climax Conveyancer and Climax Shawloader) **Military vehicles ‚Äì Alvis and Self-Changing Gears **Print ‚Äì Nuffield Press (which printed the company's publications) and Lyne & Son *Leyland International ‚Äì responsible for the export of cars, trucks and buses, and responsible for manufacturing plants in Africa, India and Australia, employing 18,000 people. 1977 Rover SD1 There was positive news for BL at the end of 1976 when its new Rover SD1 executive car was voted European Car of the Year, having gained plaudits for its innovative design. The SD1 was actually the first step that British Leyland took towards rationalising its passenger car ranges, as it replaced two cars competing in the same sector, the Rover P6 and Triumph 2000. More positive news for the company came at the end of 1976 with the approval by Industry Minister Eric Varley of a ¬£140,000,000 investment of public money in refitting the Longbridge plant for production of the company's \\"ADO88\\" (Mini replacement), due for launch in 1979. However, poor results from customer clinics of the ADO88, coupled with the UK success of the Ford Fiesta, launched in 1976, forced a snap redesign of ADO88 which evolved into the \\"LC8\\" project ‚Äì eventually launched as the Austin Mini Metro in 1980. In 1977, Michael Edwardes was appointed chief executiveMichael Edwardes arrives by the NEB. Edwardes quickly reversed the Ryder Report's policy of giving prominence to the \\"Leyland\\" brand, and returned focus back to the individual brands. Leyland Cars was thus renamed BL Cars Ltd, consisting of two main divisions; Austin Morris (the volume car business) and Jaguar Rover Triumph (JRT) (the specialist or upmarket division). Austin Morris included MG. Land Rover and Range Rover were later separated from JRT to form the Land Rover Group. JRT later split up into Rover-Triumph and Jaguar Car Holdings (which included Daimler). At the same time the public use of the \\"British Leyland\\" name ceased, being abbreviated simply to \\"BL\\", whilst the company's \\"plughole\\" logo was redesigned with the central \\"L\\" removed. The Austin-Morris division was given its own unique brand identity with the introduction of the blue and green \\"chevron\\" logo, which was later expanded in use when the car manufacturing operations were further consolidated into the Austin Rover Group in the 1980s. BLCV Coventry Climax forklift truck In 1978, the company formed a new group for its commercial vehicle interests, BL Commercial Vehicles (BLCV) under managing director David Abell. The following companies moved under this new umbrella: *Leyland Vehicles Limited (trucks, tractors and buses) *Alvis Limited (military vehicles) *Coventry Climax (fork lift trucks and specialist engines) *Self-Changing Gears Limited (heavy-duty transmissions) BLCV and the Land Rover Group later merged to become Land Rover Leyland. BL Ltd In 1979, British Leyland Ltd was renamed BL Ltd (later BL plc) and its subsidiary, which acted as a holding company for all the other companies within the group The British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd, renamed BLMC Ltd.‚Äì Leyland Truck & Bus 1983 Austin Metro BL's fortunes took another much-awaited rise in October 1980 with the launch of the Austin Metro (initially named the Mini Metro), a three-door hatchback which gave buyers a more modern and practical alternative to the iconic but ageing Mini. This went on to be one of the most popular cars in Britain in the 1980s. Towards the final stages of the Metro's development, BL entered into an alliance with Honda to provide a new mid-range model which would replace the ageing Triumph Dolomite, but would more crucially act as a stop-gap until the Austin Maestro and Montego were ready for launch. This car would emerge as the Triumph Acclaim in 1981, and would be the first of a long line of collaborative models jointly developed between BL and Honda. A rationalisation of the model ranges also took place around this time. In 1980, British Leyland was still producing four cars in the large family car sector‚Äîthe Princess 2, Austin Maxi, Morris Marina, and Triumph Dolomite. The Marina was succeeded by the Morris Ital in August 1980 following a superficial facelift, and a year later the Princess 2 received a major upgrade to become the Austin Ambassador, meaning that the 1982 range had just two competitors in this sector. In April 1984, these cars were discontinued to make way for a single all-new model, the Austin Montego. The Acclaim was replaced in that same year by another Honda-based product, the Rover 200-series. =1982-86: Edwardes steps down, Jaguar divested, Austin Rover Group= Jaguar XJ-S By the end of Michael Edwardes tenure as chairman of BL plc in 1982, the company had been restructured into two distinct parts ‚Äì the Cars Division (which consisted of Austin-Morris, Rover and Jaguar, and was led by Ray Horrocks) and the Commercial Vehicle Division (which consisted of Land Rover, Leyland Trucks, Leyland Buses and Freight Rover) ‚Äì whose chief executive was David Andrews. The holding company BL plc was now chaired by Sir Austin Bide in a non executive capacity. Around this time, the BL Cars Ltd division renamed itself Austin Rover Group, shortly before the launch of the Austin Maestro and Ray Horrocks was replaced by Harold Musgrove as its chairman and chief executive. The emergence of the Austin Rover brand effectively put an end to the separate Austin-Morris and Jaguar-Rover-Triumph divisions, since by this time, Jaguar now resided in a separate company called Jaguar Car Holdings and was now led by Sir John Egan, and this was later de- merged from BL completely and privatised in 1984. That same year, with both the Morris Ital and the Triumph Acclaim being discontinued, their respective brands were effectively shelved, leaving only the Austin and Rover marques, whilst Land Rover moved into the Freight Rover Group alongside the light trucks division. After the divestment of Unipart and the van, truck and bus divisions in 1987 (see below), leaving just two subsidiaries ‚Äì Austin Rover (volume cars) and Land Rover (SUVs) this essentially remained the basic structure of BL and subsequently the Rover Group until the 2000 break-up. =1986-: BL becomes the Rover Group, sale to British Aerospace= For a full history of British Leyland's successor companies beyond 1986, see main articles: Rover Group and MG Rover Range Rover In 1986, Graham Day took the helm as chairman and CEO and the third joint Rover-Honda vehicle ‚Äì the Rover 800-series ‚Äì was launched which replaced the ten-year-old Rover SD1. Around the same time, BL changed its name to Rover Group and in 1987 the Trucks Division ‚Äì Leyland Vehicles merged with the Dutch DAF company to form DAF NV, trading as Leyland DAF in the UK and as DAF in the Netherlands. In 1987, the bus business was spun off into a new company called Leyland Bus. This was the result of a management buyout who decided to sell the company to the Bus & Truck division of Volvo in 1988.Volvo Leyland Invests Commercial Motor 27 October 1988 That same year, the UK Government controversially tried to privatise and sell-off Land Rover, however this plan was later abandoned. The Austin name was dropped from the Metro, Maestro and Montego in 1987, signalling the end for the historic Austin marque, in a push to focus on the more prestigious (and potentially more profitable) Rover badge. In 1988, the business was sold by the UK Government to British Aerospace (BAe), and shortly afterwards shortened its name to just Rover Group. It subsequently sold the business to BMW, which, after years of investment that ultimately resulted in huge losses, decided to break up the Rover Group, and only retain the Cowley operations and the rights to manufacture the new MINI family of vehicles. Land Rover was divested to Ford, who integrated it with its Premier Automotive Group (of which Jaguar was already a part, therefore reuniting the two former BL stablemates), whilst the remains of the volume car business, including the massive Longbridge complex, became the newly independent MG Rover, which collapsed in 2005. Meanwhile Ford, suffering severe financial problems and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy by the late 2000s decided to dissolve its Premier Automotive Group and sold off most of its brands, with Jaguar and Land Rover being sold to the Indian Tata Group in 2009. Ultimately only MINI, Jaguar Land Rover and Leyland Trucks would be the surviving automotive manufacturing operations of British Leyland to the present day. 1985 Leyland T45 Cruiser Many of the brands were divested over time and continue to exist on the books of several companies to this day. =Ashok Leyland= A 2010 Ashok Leyland truck in India Until the 1980s, the Leyland name and logo were seen as a recognised and respected marque across India, the wider subcontinent and parts of Africa in the form of Ashok Leyland, a company formed from the partnership of the Ashok group and British Leyland. However, now the Leyland logo is no longer used and the company has been largely Indian in its ownership for over three decades. Now a part of the giant Hinduja Group, Ashok Leyland manufactures buses, trucks, defence vehicles and engines. The company is a leader in the heavy transportation sector within India and has an aggressive expansionary policy. In 1987, the UK-based Hinduja Group bought the India-based Ashok Leyland company. Today, Ashok-Leyland is pursuing a joint venture with Nissan and through its acquisition of the Czech truck maker, Avia, is entering the European truck market directly. With its purchase, in 2010, of a 25% stake in UK-based bus manufacturer Optare, Ashok Leyland has taken a step closer to reconnecting with its British heritage, as Optare is a direct descendant of Leyland's UK bus-making division. During the time of British Leyland's transition into Austin Rover during the 1980s, a version of the Rover SD1 was licence built in India as the Standard 2000 from 1985‚Äì88, briefly reviving the Standard brand which had been axed in 1968. British Leyland also provided the technical know-how and the rights to their Leyland 28 BHP tractor for Auto Tractors Limited, a tractor plant in Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh. Established in 1981 with state support, ATL only managed to build 2,380 tractors by the time the project was ended in 1990 ‚Äì less than the planned production for the first two years. The project ended up being taken over by Sipani, who kept producing tractor engines and also a small number of tractors with some modest success.Bajaj, p. M-127. Timelines =Notes for the timeline table= *The car brands of BSA were divested, BSA was not merged into Jaguar. *Mini was not originally a marque in its own right. See Mini and Mini (marque) for more detail. *The BMC trademark is registered (1564704, E1118348) to MG Rover Group Ltd in the UK. BMC is also the name of a commercial vehicle manufacturer in Turkey, formerly the Turkish subsidiary of the British Motor Corporation. It is believed that Nanjing Automotive may have purchased this from MG Rover, however the brand has not been reassigned as of 17 July 2006. *The Wolseley trademark is registered (UK 1490228) to MG Rover Group Ltd for automobiles only. It is believed that Nanjing Automotive may have purchased this from MG Rover, however the brand has not been reassigned as of July 2006 to a different company. The UK building materials supplier Wolseley plc owns the rights to the Wolseley name for all other purposes. Wolseley plc is a descendant of the original Wolseley company. *The Vanden Plas trademark is owned by Ford (through Jaguar) for use within the US and Canada, and as (UK 1133528, E2654481) to MG Rover Group Ltd for use in the rest of the world. It is believed that Nanjing Automotive may have purchased this from MG Rover, however the trademark has not been recorded as reassigned as of 17 July 2006. This is why Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas models are branded as Daimlers in Britain. The last Rover to use the Vanden Plas name was the Rover 75 Vanden Plas, a long wheelbase limousine model. *The Rover trademark was owned by BMW and was only licensed to MG Rover Group Ltd. BMW sold the brand to Ford in September 2006. *Alvis was purchased from British Leyland by United Scientific Holdings in 1981, in 2002 Alvis merged with part of Vickers Defence Systems to form Alvis Vickers which was purchased by BAE Systems in 2004. BAE Systems did not acquire Alvis through their ownership of the Rover Group in the early 1990s. Production of Alvis branded cars ceased in 1967. The trademark is owned by Alvis Vehicles Ltd. *The use of the Triumph name as a trademark for vehicles is shared between BMW and Triumph Motorcycles. The former for automobiles and the latter for motorcycles. The motorcycle and car business separated in the 1930s. =Merged companies= The car firms (and car brands) which eventually merged to form the company are as follows. The dates given are those of the first car of each name, but these are often debatable as each car may be several years in development. * 1895 Wolseley Motors * 1896 Lanchester Motor Company * 1896 Leyland Motors (commercial vehicles) * 1896 Daimler * 1898 Riley * 1899 Albion * 1903 Standard Motor Company * 1904 Rover * 1905 Austin * 1912 Morris * 1913 Vanden Plas * 1919 Alvis * 1923 MG created by Morris * 1923 Triumph Motor Company * 1924 BSA used as a car brand * 1935 Jaguar * 1947 Land Rover created by Rover * 1952 Austin-Healey created by Austin division of BMC (see below) * 1959 Mini : the car initially launched as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor became popularly known just as the 'Mini' and BMC recognised this by re-badging the Austin as the Austin Mini. British Leyland deleted both marque names from the car and created Mini as a marque in its own right in 1969. =Other merger events= Several of these names (including Jaguar, Land Rover and Mini) are now in other hands. The history of the mergers and other key events is as follows: * 1910 Daimler merged with the BSA car armaments-and-motorbikes engineering company BSA (last BSA car, 1939). * 1931 Lanchester purchased by BSA/Daimler (last Lanchester 1956) * 1938 Morris Motors purchases Wolseley and Riley and from 1943 they are jointly referred to as the Nuffield Organisation. * 1944 Standard acquires Triumph, forming Standard Triumph * 1946 Austin acquires Vanden Plas * 1951 Leyland Motors purchase the share capital of Albion Motors * 1952 Morris and Austin merge to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC). * 1955 Leyland Motors acquires Scammell Lorries Limited of Watford * 1960 Jaguar buys Daimler for the latter's production facilities. * 1961 Leyland Motors acquires Standard Triumph * 1962 Leyland Motors acquires Associated Commercial Vehicles, the renamed AEC (Associated Equipment Company) company. * 1963 Jaguar acquires the engine and fork lift truck manufacturing company Coventry Climax. * 1965 Rover acquires Alvis * 1966 Jaguar merged into BMC * 1966 BMC changes its name to British Motor Holdings (BMH). * 1967 Leyland absorbs Rover * 1968 Leyland merges with British Motor Holdings to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). * 1969 Joint venture with the National Bus Company to build Leyland National buses, and also to continue the manufacture of Bristol buses and Eastern Coach Works bodies previously built by the NBC. * 1970s Majority stake in Danish partner DAB, to form Leyland-DAB, producer of the Leyland-DAB articulated bus * 1972 BLMC takes control of Innocenti * 1974 Cessation of production of cars by BLMC's Australian subsidiary * 1975 Publication of the Ryder Report: British Leyland effectively was nationalised due to financial difficulties, with formation of new holding company, British Leyland Ltd, later BL plc, with the government as the principal (but not the only) shareholder. * 1977 Michael Edwardes appointed as chairman by the third Wilson Government; begins massive cull of excess BL assets * 1982 BL buys out the National Bus Company from the bus plant joint venture. =Divestments= * 1969 The last Riley Elf, 1300, and 4/72 models were built, thus ending the Riley marque * 1975 Innocenti passed to Alejandro de Tomaso * 1975 The final Wolseley, a Saloon, is built, thus ending the Wolseley marque * 1978 A further reorganisation sees Land Rover being separated from Rover, and established as a standalone company within BL.

Bathgate narrowly avoided a shut down in 1981, but instead became responsible for engine production and export market trucks. Leyland's truck exports then proceeded to collapse as oil prices dropped, making the end inevitable. * 1986 BL plc renamed Rover Group plc, Austin badges disappear the following year * 1986 Leyland Bus floated off; bought by Volvo in 1988 * 1987 Leyland Trucks division (including Freight Rover vans) merged with DAF to form DAF NV/Leyland DAF.

However, any benefits from the broader number of models were far outweighed by higher development costs and greatly reduced economies of scale. Sadly, potential benefits associated with rationalising parts usage were lost, as for example, the company made two completely different 1.3-litre engines (BMC A series and the Triumph 1.3-litre), two different 1.5-litre engines (BMC E series and Triumph), four different 2-litre engines (4-cylinder O series, 4-cylinder Triumph Dolomite, 4-cylinder Rover and 6-cylinder Triumph) and two completely different V8 engines (Triumph OHC 3-litre V8 and Rover 3.5-litre V8). Examples of competing cars were: * Morris Minor and Austin A40/Austin 1100 * Austin 1300 and Triumph Herald/Triumph Toledo * Morris Marina, Austin Allegro, and Triumph Dolomite * Triumph 2000, Rover 2000, and Princess (car) * Triumph Spitfire, MG Midget and Austin-Healey Sprite * Triumph TR6/Triumph TR7 and MG MGC * Rover 3500 and Jaguar XJ6 =Badge-engineered models= In contrast to the continued development of competing models, British Leyland continued the practice of badge engineering of models which had started under BMC; selling essentially the same vehicle under two (or more) different marques. * Riley One-Point- Five/Wolseley 1500 * MG Magnette ZA/ZB/Wolseley 4/44 * MG Magnette ZB/Wolseley 15/50 * Morris Oxford MO/Wolseley 4/50 * Morris Six/Wolseley 6/80 * Austin A99 Westminster/Wolseley 6/99 * Austin A110 Westminster/Wolseley 6/110 * Austin 1800/Morris 1800/Wolseley 18/85 * Austin 2200/Morris 2200/Wolseley Six * Austin A55 Cambridge/MG Magnette Mk.

Closed in 1972, when van assembly transferred to nearby Common Lane. *Birmingham Acocks Green, Rover engine and transmissions plant. *Birmingham Castle Bromwich, Former Fisher and Ludlow body plant, acquired by BMC in 1953. Functioned as body plant for Mini and Jaguar models, employing c9,000 workers in the 1970s, Plant taken over completely by Jaguar in 1977, and became the main Jaguar assembly plant after the closure of the Browns Lane Coventry plant in 2005. The plant still employs 2,000 workers. *Birmingham Cofton Hackett, Engine plant built in 1968 adjacent to Longbridge to produce the E-Series engine for the Austin Maxi and later the Allegro. Became part of Rover Powertrain following the creation of MG Rover in 2000, but was closed and demolished following the 2005 collapse. *Birmingham Drews Lane / Common Lane. Also known as the Ward End works. The Plant dates from 1913 and was built by Electric & Ordnance Accessories, a subsidiary of Vickers. Was then a Wolseley assembly plant (until 1948), later a component plant, and in 1968 the Austin-Morris Division's transmission plant. In 1972 it became BLMC's main van assembly plant. Van production was suspended in 2008 and did not resume, due to the collapse of the LDV Group. The plant was subsequently demolished for redevelopment. *Birmingham Garrison Street, Bordesley Green, c800 workers making Triumph components. Closed *Birmingham Longbridge. Originally the Austin plant, and at one time the largest manufacturing plant in the world. The largest British car plant in the 1970s, employing c25,000 workers and famous as the home of the Mini. Closed upon the collapse of MG Rover in 2005. Two-thirds of the plant has now been demolished and cleared for new uses. Successor Nanjing restarted limited car assembly on a much smaller scale for the MG TF but stopped production in 2016 and is now the R&D; centre for Nanjing. *Birmingham SU Carburettors. Bought by Morris and established at Washwood Heath, making fuel pumps and carburettors (c1,300 workers). Closed early 1980s *Birmingham Tyseley, Rover engine and transmission plant, employing c4,000 workers in the 1970s. Closed mid-1980s *Cardiff. Opened by Rover in 1964 to manufacture transmissions and axles for Rover and Land Rover vehicles.

All facilities corresponding to Land Rover output were transferred to Solihull East Works on cessation of Rover SD1 production. *Cowley, Oxford. Formerly comprising the main Morris plant and the Pressed Steel Fisher body plant, and one of the largest British car production sites throughout the BLMC era. In 1993 the original Morris plant was sold to developers and demolished, with car production being concentrated on the former Pressed Steel site which is now owned by BMW and used for assembly of the modern Mini. *Coventry Courthouse Green engine plant. Formerly Morris Engines Ltd., closed late 1981. The original Gosford Street building is now the Coventry University Business School's William Morris Building. *Coventry Browns Lane. Originally a World War II Shadow factory, built for Daimler, which subsequently became the main Jaguar assembly plant. Closed by Ford in 2005. It was demolished and is now a housing development. *Coventry Canley. Originally owned by Standard, latterly the main Triumph car plant and the largest factory in the city. Closed in 1980.

Former Hall Engineering Group car body plant purchased by Standard-Triumph in 1959 (Speke No.1), plus new Triumph assembly plant opened in 1970 (Speke No.2). No.2 plant became the first major British BLMC car assembly plant to close, in 1978. No.1 plant continued to produce bodies for assembly at Canley until closure in 1981. The site was later demolished and is now a supermarket. *Llanelli. Radiator and pressings plant opened in the early 1960s, employing c 4,000 workers in the 1970s. Now owned by Calsonic Llanelli Radiators *Solihull, West Midlands. The former Rover plant. Became a Land Rover-only plant in 1981 when Rover SD1 production was moved to the Cowley plant. Survives as a Jaguar Land Rover plant, now owned by TATA Motors. *Swindon. Former Pressed Steel Company bodywork plant, now owned by BMW for manufacture of Mini body panels. =Truck and bus plants= *Alcester, Warwickshire. Former Maudslay plant, latterly making AEC dump trucks. Sold in the early 1970s. *Basingstoke, Hampshire. Former Thornycroft plant, latterly a specialist heavy truck plant. Closed in 1969. *Bathgate, West Lothian. A new plant opened by BMC in 1961 to manufacture light trucks and tractors. Tractor assembly ended in 1982, following the sale to Marshall Tractors who transferred production to Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. The truck assembly ceased in 1985, and the plant closed in 1986. *Brislington, Bristol. Former Bristol Commercial Vehicles bus plant, initially 25% owned, from 1969 50% owned, from 1982 100% owned.

Wilson is best known as a founding member and longest member of the Supremes, who during the 1960s became Motown's most successful act, and are the best-charting female group in US history, as well as one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. The group released a record- setting twelve number-one hit singles on the US Billboard Hot 100: \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\", \\"Baby Love\\", \\"Come See About Me\\", \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\", \\"Back in My Arms Again\\", \\"I Hear a Symphony\\", \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\", \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\", \\"Love is Here and Now You're Gone\\", \\"The Happening\\", \\"Love Child\\", and \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\". Wilson remained with the group following the departures of other original members, Florence Ballard in 1967 and Diana Ross in 1970. Following Wilson's own departure in 1977, the group disbanded. Wilson later became a New York Times Best Seller in 1986 with the release of her autobiography, Dreamgirl: My Life As a Supreme, a record setter for sales in its genre, and later Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together; both books later were released as an updated combination. Continuing a successful career as a concert performer, Wilson also became a musicians' rights activist as well as a musical theater performer and organizer of various museum displays of the Supremes' famed costumes. Wilson was inducted along with Ross and Ballard (as members of the Supremes) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Early life Mary Wilson was born to Sam and Johnnie Mae Wilson in Greenville, Mississippi. She was the eldest of three children including a brother, Roosevelt, and a sister, Katherine. Wilson lived with her parents and moved to St. Louis and later to Chicago before living with her aunt Ivory \\"I.V.\\" and uncle John L. Pippin in Detroit. Wilson reunited with her mother and siblings at the age of 9. To make ends meet, Wilson's mother worked as a domestic worker. Before reaching her teenage years, Wilson and her family had settled at Detroit's upstart housing project, the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects. Mary Wilson first met Florence Ballard at an elementary school in Detroit. The duo became friends while singing in the school's talent show. In 1959, Ballard asked Wilson to audition for Milton Jenkins, who was forming a sister group to his male vocal trio, the Primes. Wilson was soon accepted in the group known as The Primettes, with Diana Ross and Betty McGlown. Wilson graduated from Detroit's Northeastern High School in January 1962. Despite her mother's insistence she go to college, Wilson instead focused on her music career. Career Wilson at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2019 The Primettes signed to Motown Records in 1961, changing the group's name to The Supremes. In between that period, McGlown left to get married and was replaced by Barbara Martin. In 1962, the group was reduced to a trio after Martin's departure. The Supremes scored their first hit in 1963 with the song, \\"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\\", and reached No. 1 on the pop charts for the first time with the hit, \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\", becoming their first of 12 No. 1 singles. (Though Wilson sang background on all of their hits before 1967, it was later revealed that Motown used in-house background singers, The Andantes, for the hits \\"Love Child\\" and \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\"). By 1964, the group had become international superstars. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy changed the name of the group to Diana Ross & The Supremes and, after a period of tension, Florence Ballard was removed from the Supremes that July. Cindy Birdsong was chosen to take her place. The new lineup continued to record hit singles, although several stalled outside the top 20 chart range. Ross left the group in early 1970, and at her farewell performance Jean Terrell was introduced as the replacement for Ross. According to Wilson in her memoirs, Berry Gordy told Wilson that he thought of having Syreeta Wright join the group in a last- minute change, after Terrell had already been introduced as lead singer, to which Wilson refused. With Terrell, the Supremes recorded seven top-40 hit singles in a three-year period. One River Deep/Mountain High was a collaboration with the Four Tops. Others included \\"Up the Ladder to the Roof\\", \\"Stoned Love\\", \\"Nathan Jones\\" and \\"Floy Joy\\". Of these releases, only Stoned Love reached a No. 1 status (R&B; Chart). Unlike the latter years with Ross, however, all but one of the hits, \\"Automatically Sunshine\\", succeeded in reaching the top 20 charts, with two breaking into the top 10. During this period, Wilson contributed lead or co-lead vocals to several Supremes songs, including the hits \\"Floy Joy\\" and \\"Automatically Sunshine\\", and the title track of the 1971 album Touch. Wilson in 2019 In 1972, Cindy Birdsong left the group following marriage and pregnancy and was replaced by Lynda Lawrence. The group's popularity and place on record charts dropped significantly. For the first time in a decade, two singles in a row failed to break into the top 40, including the Stevie Wonder penned-and-produced \\"Bad Weather\\". Discouraged, Jean Terrell and Lynda Lawrence both departed in late 1973. Scherrie Payne was recruited from a group called The Glass House. They were signed to the Invictus label, owned by the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting-production team (who composed 10 of the Supremes No. 1 1960s singles). Cindy Birdsong also returned. Beginning with this lineup change, Wilson began doing almost half of the group's lead vocal duties, as she was considered the group's main attraction and reason for continuing. In 1975 Wilson sung lead on the Top 10 disco hit \\"Early Morning Love\\". In 1976, the group scored its final hit single with \\"I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking\\", written and produced by Holland- Dozier-Holland Group and included on the H-D-H produced album High Energy. Birdsong again departed, just before the album's release, and was replaced by the group's final official member, Susaye Greene, whose voice was dubbed over two songs. High Energy produced a flurry of positive reviews and sales, but a follow-up H-D-H effort in 1977 failed to ignite much interest. In late 1977, Wilson left The Supremes, following a performance at London's Drury Lane Theatre. After Payne and Greene unsuccessfully lobbied to get a replacement for Wilson, the Supremes officially disbanded. Wilson got involved in a protracted legal battle with Motown over management of the Supremes. After an out-of-court settlement, Wilson signed with Motown for solo work, releasing a disco-heavy self-titled album in 1979. A single from the album, \\"Red Hot\\", had a modest showing of No. 90 on the pop charts. Midway through production of a second solo album in 1980, Motown dropped her from its roster. Throughout the mid-1980s, Wilson focused on performances in musical theater productions, including Beehive, Dancing in the Streets and Supreme Soul. In 1994, The Supremes were recognized with a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7060 Hollywood Blvd. Wilson found major success once more with her memoir: Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme in 1986. The book remained on the national best-seller list for months and established a sales record for the genre. The book focused on the early career of the Supremes and its success during the 1960s. Four years later, in 1990, Wilson released her second memoir: Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together, also a best seller, which focused on the Supremes in the 1970s. In between this period, Wilson became a frequent guest on several TV shows and talk shows and began regularly performing in Las Vegas casinos and resorts. Wilson then recorded a cover version of \\"Ooh Child\\" for the Motorcity label in 1990. A year later, she signed with CEO Records and released the album, Walk the Line, in 1992. The label filed for bankruptcy the day after its national release. Wilson maintains she was deceived about the financial status of the label. The available copies of the album quickly sold out, however, and Wilson continued her success as a concert performer. Wilson fought two court cases with former employees over usage of the Supremes name; Supremes' replacement singers Lynda Lawrence and Scherrie Payne and a former backing vocalist from her 1980s concert work, Kaaren Ragland. In both cases the courts found for the employees. This prompted Wilson to take a high- profile role in lobbying for \\"Truth in Music\\" legislation, which prohibits usage of musical acts names, unless an original member of the group is in the act or the group is properly licensed by the last person to hold right of title to the name. So far, her efforts have succeeded in more than 28 U.S. states. In 1995, Wilson released a song, \\".U\\", for Contract Recording Company. A year later, Wilson released the song, \\"Turn Around\\" for Da Bridge Records. In late 1999, a proposal to unite all former living Supremes for a summer 2000 tour, was negotiated by Ross and SFX. After securing SFX's interest, Ross had the promoter contact the other former members, refusing to directly negotiate with the other members, in order to spare any hurt feelings among the women. Talks and plans for the tour were well underway before Wilson was contacted by Ross in December 1999. Wilson, upset she had been contacted so late, wanted to speak with Ross directly before beginning negotiations. Ross felt they should speak after negotiations took place. Following Ross' initial contact, she removed herself from the negotiations leaving them between the women, their representatives, and the promoters. Both Wilson and Ross knew that the real heart of The Supremes was the trio that included the very creator of the group, Florence Ballard. Despite the hard knowledge of show business realities, without Ballard negotiations could only be half-hearted in such a return to the groups past formulations. Still, pushing on, TNA/SFX initially offered Wilson $1 million. Birdsong was reported to have been offered less than $1 million. Tour performance fees are determined by an artist's most recent earnings. Wilson, reportedly, earned roughly $1 million in performance fees the previous year. Wilson and Birdsong were also informed they would not have any creative input into the show. Wilson rejected the initial offer feeling she, Ross, and Birdsong should be paid equally and have equal input into the show. Promoters increased Wilson's offer up to $2 million after the initial rejection. Ross agreed to offer Wilson an additional $2 million from her personal finances to the $2 million TNA/SFX proposed for a total of $4 million. Wilson and Birdsong's request for creative input into the show was again rejected. Ross stipulated that all of the other artists' fees were guaranteed, meaning that they'd receive the full amount of their contracts, regardless of how many performances actually took place. Wilson erroneously stated publicly that Ross was to receive between $15 to $20 million. Ross, as the tour's co-producer, was receiving $500,000 per night from TNA/SFX to cover the tour's expenses. When the expenses exceeded the allotment, Ross covered the overages. Wilson's final offer of $4 million and Birdsong's offer of $1 million came with a deadline of early 2000 (in order to begin production of the sets, costume fittings, hiring of staff, etc., and an on-schedule commencement of the tour). Wilson did accept the final offer, but her acceptance was rejected by TNA/SFX citing \\"the train has left the station.\\" The promoter ceased negotiations with Wilson and Birdsong. Without Wilson or Birdsong, Ross began to question whether to continue to stage the tour. Berry Gordy Jr. had called TNA/SFX during the negotiation process requesting that Wilson and Birdsong receive better pay and have creative input into the show. Ross contacted Gordy for advice about the tour and he reportedly told her to continue \\"if it's something she'd have fun doing;\\" however, he warned her about continuing without Wilson and Birdsong. Ross decided to continue. The tour, Return to Love, instead went forward with former 1970s Supremes Scherrie Payne and Lynda Lawrence (Susaye Green and Jean Terrell refused to participate because the promoter requested that they audition for the tour, as they had not heard the women sing in over 20 years), but, was canceled mid-tour due low ticket sales (despite selling out New York City's Madison Square Garden ), following complaints of high ticket prices in a down touring market, a spate of high scrutiny by some members of the public and press regarding the absence of some performers, Wilson and Birdsong, and the dispute between versions of events. That year, Wilson released an updated version of her autobiographies as a single combined book.Wilson, Mary (1999). Dreamgirl & Supreme Faith, Updated Edition: My Life as a Supreme. New York: Cooper Square Press. . That year, an album, I Am Changing, was released by Mary Wilson Enterprises, produced through her and her then-management, Duryea Entertainment. In 2001, Wilson starred in the national tour of Leader of the Pack ‚Äì The Ellie Greenwich Story. A year later, Wilson was appointed by Secretary of State Colin Powell as a \\"culture-connect ambassador\\" for the U.S. State Department, appearing at international events arranged by that agency. In 2006, a live concert DVD, Mary Wilson Live at the Sands, was released. Four years later, another DVD, Mary Wilson: Live from San Francisco... Up Close, was released. During this period, Wilson became a musical activist, having been part of the Truth in Music Bill, a law proposed to stop impostor groups performing under the names of the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll groups, including Motown groups The Marvelettes and The Supremes. The law was passed in 27 states. Wilson has also toured and lectured internationally, as well as across the United States, speaking to various groups worldwide. Her lecture series, \\"Dare to Dream\\", focuses on reaching goals and triumph over adversity. Wilson's charity work includes the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, the American Cancer Society, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, the Easter Seals Foundation, UNICEF, The NAACP, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the All-Star Network, and Figure Skaters of Harlem, a youth organization devoted to helping children towards entering the Olympics. Most recently, Wilson became the Mine Action spokesperson for the Humpty Dumpty Institute. Wilson at Moscow's Spaso House, February 2011 In April 2008, Wilson made a special appearance on 20/20 to participate in a social experiment involving pedestrians reacting to a young woman singing \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" with intentional amateurishness. Wilson approached the woman and gave her constructive criticism toward her style, in contrast to the pedestrians whose reactions were positive, yet dishonest. On March 5, 2009, she made a special appearance on The Paul O'Grady Show, which ended in a special performance with her, O'Grady and Graham Norton. Wilson is the creator of the Mary Wilson/Supremes Gown Collection, and has had the collection on tour in an exhibition of the Supremes' former stage wear. The collection has been on exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio and on May 12, 2008, commenced its UK tour, starting at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. More than 50 sets of gowns are shown in rotation, starting with early formal wear from the early 1960s, and including famous gowns worn on television specials and nightclub appearances by the group in the 1960s and 1970s. Wilson released two singles on iTunes, \\"Life's Been Good To Me\\" and \\"Darling Mother (Johnnie Mae)\\", in 2011 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, Wilson released a new single, \\"Time To Move On\\", produced by Sweet Feet Music; the song reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Dance charts, peaking at No. 17 as of December 26. At 36 years and seven weeks, Mary Wilson holds the record for the longest gap between hits in the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart as \\"Red Hot\\" debuted on October 6, 1979Whitburn, Joel (2004). Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003. Record Research. . and \\"Time To Move On\\" debuted on November 21, 2015. In 2016, an Indiegogo campaign was launched to help raise $35,000 to fund a gay-themed romantic comedy movie, \\"Please Don't Eat the Pansies\\". The cast included actor/writer Ronnie Kerr, Andrew Lauer, singer/actor Tom Goss and Mary. On August 15, 2019, Wilson published her fourth book, Supreme Glamour with co- author Mark Bego, dedicated to the history of the Supremes and their fashion with a detailed section dedicated to the Supremes gowns in her collection. On August 21, 2019, Wilson was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 28 of Dancing with the Stars. Personal life Wilson married Pedro Ferrer in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 11, 1974. Their union produced three children: Turkessa, Pedro Antonio Jr. and Rafael. Wilson and Ferrer divorced in 1981. Wilson is also adoptive mother to her cousin, Willie. In January 1994, Wilson and her 14-year-old son Rafael were involved in an accident on Interstate 15 between Los Angeles and Las Vegas when their Jeep Cherokee veered off the highway and overturned. Wilson sustained moderate injuries; Rafael's injuries were fatal. As of September 2019, Mary has 10 grandchildren and 1 great granddaughter, which she revealed during the 2nd episode of season 28 of Dancing with the Stars. In 2001, Wilson received an associate degree from New York University. Wilson has received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Paine College in Augusta, Georgia. In 2020, Wilson received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Newspaper Publishers Association.

Several of her works had illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. Some of her correspondence has also been published. She won many literary awards and the Eleanor Farjeon Award for children's literature is presented annually in her memory by the Children's Book Circle, a society of publishers. She was the sister of thriller writer Joseph Jefferson Farjeon. Biography Eleanor Farjeon was born in the Strand, London,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=eleanor%20&lastname;=farjeon on 13 February 1881. The daughter of Benjamin Farjeon and Maggie (Jefferson) Farjeon, Eleanor came from a literary family, her two younger brothers, Joseph and Herbert Farjeon, were writers, while the oldest, Harry Farjeon, was a composer. Her father was Jewish.100 Ideas for Assemblies: Primary School Edition By Fred Sedgwick, p.52 Farjeon, known to the family as \\"Nellie\\", was a small, timid child, who had poor eyesight and suffered from ill-health throughout her childhood. She was educated at home, spending much of her time in the attic, surrounded by books. Her father encouraged her writing from the age of five. She describes her family and her childhood in the autobiographical, A Nursery in the Nineties (1935). She and her brother Harry were especially close. Beginning when Farjeon was five, they began a sustained imaginative game in which they became various characters from theatrical plays and literature. This game, called T.A.R. after the initials of two of the original characters, lasted into their mid-twenties. Farjeon credited this game with giving her \\"the flow of ease which makes writing a delight\\".Eleanor Farjeon, A Nursery in the Nineties, Oxford, 1960. First published as Portrait of a Family, Golancz, 1935. Although she lived much of her life among the literary and theatrical circles of London, much of Farjeon's inspiration came from her childhood and from family holidays. A holiday in France in 1907 was to inspire her to create a story of a troubadour, later refashioned as the wandering minstrel of her most famous book, Martin Pippin in the Apple Orchard. Among her earliest publications is a volume of poems called Pan Worship, published in 1908, and Nursery Rhymes of London Town from 1916.Eleanor Farjeon ‚Äì Farjeon Family Collection. Dunedin Libraries. Retrieved 11 June 2012 During World War I, the family moved to Sussex where the landscape, villages and local traditions were to have a profound effect upon her later writing. It was in Sussex that the Martin Pippin stories were eventually to be located. At eighteen, Farjeon wrote the libretto for an operetta, Floretta, to music by her older brother Harry, who later became a composer and teacher of music. She also collaborated with her youngest brother, Herbert, Shakespearian scholar and dramatic critic. Their productions include Kings and Queens (1932), The Two Bouquets (1938), An Elephant in Arcady (1939), and The Glass Slipper (1944). Farjeon had a wide range of friends with great literary talent including D. H. Lawrence, Walter de la Mare and Robert Frost. For several years she had a close friendship with the poet Edward Thomas and his wife. After Thomas's death in April 1917 during the Battle of Arras, she remained close to his wife, Helen. She later published much of their correspondence, and gave a definitive account of their relationship in Edward Thomas: The Last Four Years (1958). After World War I Farjeon earned a living as a poet, journalist and broadcaster. Often published under a pseudonym, Farjeon's poems appeared in The Herald (Tomfool), Punch, Time and Tide (Chimaera), The New Leader (Merry Andrew), Reynolds News (Tomfool), and a number of other periodicals. Her topical work for The Herald, Reynolds News and New Leader was perhaps the most accomplished of any socialist poet of the 1920s and 30s. Farjeon never married, but had a thirty- year friendship with George Earle, an English teacher. After Earle's death in 1949, she had a long friendship with the actor Denys Blakelock, who wrote of it in the book, Eleanor, Portrait of a Farjeon (1966). In 1951, she became a Roman Catholic.\\"Eleanor Farjeon\\". Find a Grave. Retrieved 21 June 2013. During the 1950s, she received three major literary awards. Both the 1955 Carnegie Medal for British children's books and the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1956 cited The Little Bookroom. The inaugural Regina Medal in 1959 from the U.S.-based Catholic Library Association marks her \\"continued, distinguished contribution to children's literature\\". In 1960, Farjeon donated her family book collection to the Dunedin Public Library. Her father had been a journalist in Dunedin in the 1860s before returning to England. The collection includes works by Farjeon, her father, brothers and niece. It also includes some music, photographs and correspondence, and two pictograph letters by Nicholas Chevalier, who was a family friend and illustrated many of Benjamin Farjeon's books.

Her work is cited as an influence by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki.

She also wrote the Advent carol \\"People, Look East!\\", usually sung to an old French melody, and often performed by children's choirs. Farjeon's plays for children, such as those to be found in Granny Gray, were popular for school performances throughout the 1950s and '60s because they were well within the capabilities of young children to perform and of teachers to direct. Several of the plays have a very large number of small parts, facilitating performance by a class, while others have only three or four performers. Farjeon's books include Martin Pippin in the Apple Orchard (1921) and its sequel, Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field (1937). These books, which had their origins in France when Farjeon was inspired to write about a troubadour, are actually set in Sussex and include descriptions of real villages and features such as the chalk cliffs and the Long Man of Wilmington. In Apple Orchard, the wandering minstrel Martin Pippin finds a lovelorn ploughman who begs him to visit the orchard where his beloved has been locked in the mill-house with six sworn virgins to guard her. Martin Pippin goes to the rescue and wins the confidence of the young women by telling them love stories. Although ostensibly a children's book, the six love stories, which have much the form of Charles Perrault's fairy tales such as Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella, were written not for a child but for a young soldier, Victor Haslam, who had, like Farjeon, been a close friend of Edward Thomas. Among the stories, themes include the apparent loss of a loved one, betrayal, and the yearning of a woman for whom it appears that love will never come. The sequel, Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field concerns six little girls whom Martin entertains while they are making daisy chains. The six stories, this time written for children, include Elsie Piddock Skips in her Sleep which has been published separately and is considered the finest of all Farjeon's stories. The Little Bookroom is a collection of what she considered her best stories, published by Oxford University Press in 1955 with illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. Farjeon won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association for that work, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. She also received the first international Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1956. This biennial award from the International Board on Books for Young People, now considered the highest lifetime recognition available to creators of children's books, soon came to be called the Little Nobel Prize. Prior to 1962 it cited a single book published during the preceding two years. In discussing his introduction to poetry, Stephen Fry cited Farjeon's poems for children alongside those of A. A.

The Rover Group also owned the dormant trademarks from the many companies that had merged into British Leyland and its predecessors such as Triumph, Morris, Wolseley, Riley and Alvis. The Rover Group was owned by British Aerospace (BAe) from 1988 to 1994, when BAe sold the remaining car business to the German company BMW. The group was further broken up in 2000, when Ford acquired the Land Rover division, with the Rover and MG marques continuing with the much smaller MG Rover Group until 2005. Ownership of the original Rover Group marques is currently split between BMW (Germany), SAIC (China), and Tata Motors (India), the latter owning the Rover marque itself with its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover owning much of the assets of the historic Rover company. History For the history of the Rover Group prior to 1986, see the main article: British Leyland The Rover Group plc was formed by renaming BL plc in 1986, soon after the appointment by Margaret Thatcher of Canadian Graham Day to the position of Chairman and Managing Director of BL. After divesting of its commercial vehicle and bus manufacturing divisions (Leyland Trucks, Leyland Bus and Freight Rover), and the spares and logistics firm Unipart, the company then consisted of the car manufacturing arm Austin Rover Group and the Land Rover Group. This group was privatised in 1988 by the sale of the company to British Aerospace (BAe) for ¬£150 million, who retained Day as joint CEO and Chairman, and made Kevin Morley MD of Rover cars. The group changed its name again in 1989 to Rover Group Holdings Limited., whilst the car manufacturing subsidiary Austin Rover Group Limited shortened its name to Rover Group Limited. By this time, all but the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands were still active ‚Äì Austin had already been dropped in 1987, because it was felt by Graham Day's new management that many of the other marque names within the former BL had been tarnished by their association with the poor quality cars of the 1970s. The strategy going forward, therefore, was to concentrate on the upmarket Rover brand instead. On 31 January 1994 BAe sold its 80% stake in the company on to German vehicle manufacturer BMWAlan Pilkington (1996). Transforming Rover, Renewal against the Odds, 1981‚Äì94. Bristol Academic Press, Bristol, pp.199, for ¬£800 million (a takeover which caused uproar in the House of Commons), the name changing again in 1995 to BMW (UK) Holdings Limited. The Japanese manufacturer Honda, who owned the remaining 20% stake, terminated the long-standing alliance with BL/Rover which had been in existence since 1980 and also sold its shares to BMW a month later, although the licensing agreements surrounding the manufacture of the collaboratively developed Rover 200, 400, 600 and 800 models remained in place. Millions of pounds of investment by BMW failed to turn the company into profit. It has been estimated that the entire Rover bankruptcy cost BMW fifteen billion Marks. In March 2000, BMW announced it planned to sell the Rover Group. Within two months, the core of the group (the MG and Rover sections) had been sold to the Phoenix Consortium, while BMW retained the rights to build the forthcoming new Mini family of vehicles. Meanwhile, Land Rover was sold to Ford, where it was ultimately reunited with former BL stablemate Jaguar to form Jaguar Land Rover when Ford dissolved the Premier Automotive Group in the late 2000s. = Subsequent developments = Land Rover was spun off from Rover and sold to the Ford Motor Company, becoming part of Ford's Premier Automotive Group, ultimately reuniting it with Jaguar which had been divested from British Leyland in 1984. Following bids from Alchemy Partners and Phoenix Consortium, core areas of manufacturing capability, along with a collection of marques (such as MG), were purchased by the Phoenix Consortium. Much smaller than its predecessors, the newly created manufacturer struggled as it continued the heritage of building cars at the Longbridge plant, which included the original Mini for the final few months of its 41-year production life. Despite trading as MG Rover Group, the new company's key Rover marque was a property licensed from BMW. The new Mini, which had been developed at Longbridge by Rover Group and was due for launch within a year, along with marques (Riley, Triumph) and former-Rover trademarks (Metro, Maxi) were also strategically retained by BMW. It is believed these names are associated with the heritage of sports saloon car manufacturers, or with the heritage of Mini. After MG Rover Group's financial crisis and talks of acquisition or investment by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) failed in early 2005, the MG Rover Group went into receivership. Following liquidation, SAIC bought the design rights to the acclaimed Rover 75 platform, along with the marques of Austin, Morris, and Wolseley. Nanjing Automobile Corporation bought the rights to the MG marque. In December 2007, Nanjing and SAIC announced their merger, which reunited some of the marques that had formed Rover Group. Despite BMW agreeing to sell the Rover marque to SAIC, Ford gained control of the luxury saloon name. When Ford's Jaguar and Land- Rover businesses were sold to TATA Motors of India, the rights to the historically prestigious Daimler, Lanchester, and Rover marques transferred to TATA Motors. =Timeline= * 1986: BL plc renamed as The Rover Group plc * 1986: Rover SD1 production ceases after 10 years and the car is replaced by a new model called the Rover 800 ‚Äì the result of a joint venture with Honda which led to the manufacture of that model and the Honda Legend. * 1987: The Leyland Trucks division (which by then included Freight Rover Vans) merged with DAF as DAF NV with the Rover Group holding a 40% shareholding, floated in 1989. (Note: After being declared bankrupt in 1993 the DAF NV was split into three independent companies; the UK van operation became LDV, the Dutch operation resumed trading as DAF Trucks and the UK truck operation resumed trading as Leyland Trucks. Both truck operations were later acquired by Paccar of the USA.) * 1987: Leyland Bus sold to Volvo Buses in 1988 * 1987: Unipart spare parts division sold in a management buyout * 1987: The Austin marque is shelved and the remaining models, the Metro, Maestro and Montego continue without a brand name until the Metro was relaunched as a Rover in 1990. * 1988: Rover Group privatised; sold to British Aerospace, fastback version of the Rover 800 launches. * 1989: The volume car manufacturing subsidiary Austin Rover Group Ltd shortens its name to Rover Group Ltd following the shelving of the Austin brand two years earlier. * 1989: The new Rover 200 goes on sale, abandoning the four-door saloon bodystyle in favour of a three and five-door hatchback, the former to launch later. It is also sold as the Honda Concerto. Maestro and Montego production is scaled down as a result. * 1990: The Rover 400 ‚Äì saloon version of the Rover 200 ‚Äì goes on sale. Also going into production is the heavily updated Metro, which features modernised body styling, a reworked interior and a new range of engines. A GTi model replaces the MG version.

The MG versions of the Maestro and Montego are discontinued. * 1992: Cabriolet and coupe versions of the Rover 200 are launched. A coupe version of the Rover 800 also launches. * 1993: The Rover 600 is launched, based on the Honda Accord but restyled and using a mixture of Honda and Rover's own engines. * 1994: 31 January ‚Äì British Aerospace announces the sale of its 80% majority share of Rover Group to BMW. * 1994: 21 February ‚Äì Honda announces it is selling its 20% share of Rover Group causing major problems in Rover's supply chain which was reliant on Honda. * 1994: An estate version of the Rover 400 called the Tourer is launched, along with an updated Metro which sees the 14-year-old nameplate shelved and rebadged as the Rover 100. Maestro and Montego production also ends. * 1995: New versions of the Rover 200 and Rover 400 go on sale, though this time they are entirely different cars.

It was initially available as a saloon with a fastback version launching in 1988. It sold well among buyers in the executive market, with a facelift in November 1991 and the introduction of a coupe version a few months later. However, it stagnated after a replacement targeted for the 1992 model year was cancelled. Many of its duties as a flagship were performed by the 600. The 800 series was updated again in 1996 which gave the car a chrome and silver grill and a lot more standard kit. By its demise in 1999, it was looking considerably dated and was replaced with the 75. =Rover 200 series= Rover 200 (1989‚Äì1995) Rover 200 (1995‚Äì1999) The Rover Group's first significant new car launch was the Rover 200, which was introduced in October 1989. Unlike its predecessor, it was a three or five-door hatchback, the former to launch later, instead of a four-door saloon which would become the Rover 400. It used a new range of 16-valve K Series petrol engines as well as a Peugeot 1.9 diesel and 1.8 turbodiesel both fitted to the Phase 1 Peugeot 405. Sales were stronger than its successors and its launch coincided with a winding-down in production of the similarly sized Maestro, which finally ceased production at the end of 1994 having spent the final years of its life as a budget alternative to the more upmarket Rover 200. Coupe and cabriolet versions of the 200 were later launched in 1992 and these were sold alongside the all-new 1995 model and continued until that model was upgraded to become the Rover 25 in 1999. The 1989 Rover 200 was a strong seller throughout its life and its successor continued this trend, though its final year of production (1999) saw a significant dip in sales. These strong sales were not as high as the ever-popular Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra. The Rover 200 had been around since 1988 as the Longbridge-built Honda Concerto, which offered a higher level of equipment but only achieved a fraction of its sales. =Rover 400 series= Rover 400 (1990‚Äì1995) Rover 400 (1995‚Äì1999) In April 1990, Rover launched the Rover 400 range. The 400 was essentially a four-door version of the 200 hatchback, but was slightly longer and offered more stowage space. It also replaced the saloon version of the previous 200. It was sold as an alternative to the likes of the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier, but was never able to match the success of these cars. An estate version of the 400 was launched in 1994 called the Tourer and continued alongside the all-new Honda Civic-based model that was launched the following year. The 1995 Rover 400 was a more substantial and popular alternative to other large family cars than its successor was, offering impressive equipment levels, but a relative shortage of interior space because it was nearer in size to cars in the next category down. The Rover 400 was facelifted in 1999 to become the Rover 45, and at the same time the estate version of the original 400 was dropped. =Rover Metro/Rover 100= Rover Metro (1990‚Äì1994) Rover 100 (1995‚Äì1997) May 1990 saw Rover give the decade-old Metro a major reworking, which most notably included internal and external restyling, as well as new 1.1 and 1.4 K-Series petrol engines. The new Metro offered some of the best standards of specification in any supermini at the time, and it sold well until being replaced by the Rover 100 (essentially another update of the original 1980 design) in December 1994. The Rover 100 remained in production for three years, selling reasonably well, until it was discontinued after a dismal crash test performance that saw demand fall dramatically. Its demise marked the passing of the last design from the British Leyland era of the company with production ceasing at the end of 1997. =Rover 600 series= Rover 620 ti Rover entered the compact executive market in April 1993 with its 600 range. Sold only as a four-door saloon, the 600 was based on the Honda Accord but used Rover engines as well as Honda engines (Honda used Rover's diesel engine in their European Accord) and had a classier interior. It was very popular in the compact executive market, but could not match the ever-popular BMW 3 Series. This was down in part to the pricing and model restrictions BMW (Rover group's owner) had placed on the 600 series and its very close ties with the more downmarket Honda Accord. Production ended in early 1999 to make way for the new 75 model. =Maestro/Montego= An early 1983 Maestro Post-facelift 1990 Montego Unlike the Metro, which had received a major reengineering and was rebadged a Rover, the two last bastions from the British Leyland era had become increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace and were kept in production merely to cater for the budget end of the market and for sale to fleets, as the newer Rover badged models were pushed further upmarket compared to rivals from Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall/Opel). The MG and high specification variants were both dropped from the Maestro/Montego ranges in 1991 so as not to overlap with the more expensive Rovers. Both had already lost their Austin badging in 1987 and were now known simply by their model names. Although the Montego had received a package of revisions for the 1989 model year, the Maestro remained essentially unchanged until 1992 when it received the Montego's revised dashboard. The Maestro/Montego production line was effectively closed in 1993 (leading to the eventual sale and demolition of the old Morris Motors' works at Cowley in which it was located), and the last cars were essentially hand built on a purpose built line. By 1994 the Montego saloon was only available to special order, and the Maestro was produced in basic 'Clubman' trim with either 1.3 petrol or 2.0 diesel power. Both models were discontinued in December 1994, being replaced by the new Honda Civic based Rover 400 series. =Land Rover= The Land Rover arm of the Rover Group expanded dramatically after the late 1980s. The Ninety/One Ten models received minor equipment and driveline upgrades and sales began to improve after a severe and near-terminal decline in the early part of the decade. The Range Rover enjoyed increased sales following its repositioning as a luxury vehicle, with higher equipment levels and options such as an automatic transmission and a diesel engine option being offered for the first time. The successful Discovery 'family' 4x4 was launched in 1989 and became Europe's top-selling 4x4 within 18 months. The Discovery brought with it an advanced diesel engine, which was soon fitted to the other models in the range. This period saw Land Rover rationalise its operations, closing down satellite factories and increasing parts-sharing between models (axles, transmissions and engines were all shared, and the Discovery used the same chassis and many body panels as the Range Rover). The Ninety/One Ten range was fitted with the new diesel engine and renamed the Defender in 1990. An all-new Range Rover was launched in 1994, together with an improved Discovery which maintained high sales. A fourth model, the 'mini-SUV' Freelander was introduced in late 1997 and replaced the Discovery as Europe's best-selling 4x4 vehicle. =MG= The MG badge-engineering project (first implemented by Austin Rover in 1982 with the Metro) ended in 1991 despite some reasonable success for its Maestro and Montego ranges (the MG Metro had been discontinued after the facelift in 1990). The MG badge was revived in 1992 on the RV8 ‚Äì an updated MGB which made use of a 3.9 V8 Range Rover power unit, but lacked modern refinements that were expected in similarly priced sports car of its era. The car didn't sell as strongly as earlier MG sports car, and production had ended by 1995. The \\"real\\" rebirth of MG sports cars occurred in 1995, when the MG F was launched. Powered by a 1.8 16-valve mid-mounted engine, it was an instant hit with buyers thanks to its distinctive styling and excellent ride and handling. It was a huge success in the roadster renaissance of the late 1990s, despite some buyers being let down by lacklusture build quality and reliability. The MG name was revived on passenger cars in 2001 when the ZR, ZS and ZT models launched, based on the Rover 25, 45 and 75 models respectively. Sponsorship Rover Group sponsored the Scottish football team Dundee United from 1994-1996. The first match of the sponsorship was Dundee United's Scottish Cup triumph in 1994, the club's first ever success in the competition. References External links *Why did BMW buy Rover?

It was the home of William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong, founder of the Armstrong Whitworth armaments firm. An industrial magnate, scientist, philanthropist and inventor of the hydraulic crane and the Armstrong gun, Armstrong also displayed his inventiveness in the domestic sphere, making Cragside the first house in the world to be lit using hydroelectric power. The estate was technologically advanced; the architect of the house, Richard Norman Shaw, wrote that it was equipped with \\"wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things\\". In the grounds, Armstrong built dams and lakes to power a sawmill, a water-powered laundry, early versions of a dishwasher and a dumb waiter, a hydraulic lift and a hydroelectric rotisserie. In 1887, Armstrong was raised to the peerage, the first engineer or scientist to be ennobled, and became Baron Armstrong of Cragside. The original building consisted of a small shooting lodge which Armstrong built between 1862 and 1864. In 1869, he employed the architect Richard Norman Shaw to enlarge the site, and in two phases of work between 1869 and 1882, they transformed the house into a northern Neuschwanstein. The result was described by the architect and writer Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel as \\"one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture\\". Armstrong filled the house with a significant art collection; he and his wife were patrons of many 19th-century British artists. Cragside became an integral part of Armstrong's commercial operations: honoured guests under Armstrong's roof, including the Shah of Persia, the King of Siam and two future Prime Ministers of Japan, were also customers for his commercial undertakings. Following Armstrong's death in 1900, his heirs struggled to maintain the house and estate. In 1910, the best of Armstrong's art collection was sold off, and by the 1970s, in an attempt to meet inheritance tax, plans were submitted for large-scale residential development of the estate. In 1971 the National Trust asked the architectural historian Mark Girouard to compile a gazetteer of the most important Victorian houses in Britain which the Trust should seek to save should they ever be sold. Girouard placed Cragside at the top of the list; in 1977, the house was acquired by the Trust with the aid of a grant from the National Land Fund. A Grade I listed building since 1953, Cragside has been open to the public since 1979. History Armstrong in the 1870s =William Armstrong= William Armstrong was born on 26 November 1810 in Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of a corn merchant. Trained as a solicitor, he moved to London before he was twenty. Returning to Newcastle, in 1835 he met and married Margaret Ramshaw, the daughter of a builder. A keen amateur scientist, Armstrong began to conduct experiments in both hydraulics and electricity. In 1847, he abandoned the law for manufacturing and established W. G. Armstrong and Company at a site at Elswick, outside Newcastle. By the 1850s, with his design for the Armstrong Gun, Armstrong laid the foundations for an armaments firm that would, before the end of the century, see Krupp as its only world rival. He established himself as a figure of national standing: his work supplying artillery to the British Army was seen as an important response to the failures of Britain's forces during the Crimean War. In 1859, he was knighted and made Engineer of Rifled Ordnance, becoming the principal supplier of armaments to both the Army and the Navy. =Shooting box: 1862‚Äì1865= Armstrong had spent much of his childhood at Rothbury, escaping from industrial Newcastle for the benefit of his often poor health. He returned to the area in 1862, not having taken a holiday for over fifteen years. On a walk with friends, Armstrong was struck by the attractiveness of the site for a house. Returning to Newcastle, he bought a small parcel of land and decided to build a modest house on the side of a moorland crag. He intended a house of eight or ten rooms and a stable for a pair of horses. The house was completed in the mid-1860s by an unknown architect: a two-storey shooting box of little architectural distinction, it was nevertheless constructed and furnished to a high standard. =Fairy palace: 1869‚Äì1900= Armstrong's architect for Cragside's expansion was the Scot R. Norman Shaw. Shaw had begun his career in the office of William Burn and had later studied under Anthony Salvin and George Edmund Street. Salvin had taught him the mastery of internal planning which was essential for the design of the large and highly variegated houses which the Victorian wealthy craved. Salvin and Street had taught him to understand the Gothic Revival. At only 24, he won the RIBA Gold Medal and Travelling Studentship. The connection between Armstrong and Shaw was made when Armstrong purchased a picture, Prince Hal taking the crown from his father's bedside by John Callcott Horsley, which proved too large to fit into his town house in Jesmond, Newcastle. Horsley was a friend of both, and recommended that Shaw design an extension to the banqueting hall Armstrong had previously built in the grounds. When this was completed in 1869, Shaw was asked for enlargements and improvements to the shooting lodge Armstrong had had built at Rothbury four years earlier. This was the genesis of the transformation of the house between 1869 and 1884. Over the next thirty years, Cragside became the centre of Armstrong's world; reminiscing years later, in his old age, he remarked, \\"had there been no Cragside, I shouldn't be talking to you todayfor it has been my very life\\". The architectural historian Andrew Saint records that Shaw sketched out the whole design for the \\"future fairy palace\\" in a single afternoon, while Armstrong and his guests were out on a shooting party. After this rapid initial design, Shaw worked on building the house for over 20 years. The long building period, and Armstrong's piecemeal, and changeable, approach to the development of the house, and his desire to retain the original shooting lodge at its core, occasionally led to tensions between client and architect, and to a building that lacks an overall unity. Armstrong changed the purpose of several rooms as his interests developed, and the German architectural historian Hermann Muthesius, writing just after Armstrong's death in 1900, noted that \\"the house did not find the unqualified favour with Shaw's followers that his previous works had done, nor did it entirely satisfy (Shaw)\\". Nevertheless, Shaw's abilities, as an architect and as a manager of difficult clients, ensured that Cragside was composed \\"with memorable force\\". The top-lit Gallery, formerly Armstrong's museum As well as being Armstrong's home, Cragside acted as an enormous display case for his ever-expanding art collection. The best of his pictures were hung in the drawing room, but Shaw also converted the museum into a top-lit picture gallery. Pride of place was given to John Everett Millais's Chill October, bought by Armstrong at the Samuel Mendel sale at Christie's in 1875. Armstrong also bought Millais' Jephthah's Daughter at the Mendel sale. Both were sold in the 1910 sale; Chill October is now in the private collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Jephthah's Daughter is held by the National Museum Cardiff. Cragside was an important setting for Armstrong's commercial activities. The architectural writer Simon Jenkins records: \\"Japanese, Persian, Siamese and German dignitaries paid court to the man who equipped their armies and built their navies\\". In his 2005 book Landmarks of Britain Clive Aslet notes visits with the same purpose from the Crown Prince of Afghanistan and the Shah of Persia. The Shah Naser al-Din visited in July 1889, and the Afghan prince Nasrullah Khan in June 1895. Armstrong's biographer Henrietta Heald mentions two future Prime Ministers of Japan, Kat≈ç Takaaki and Sait≈ç Makoto, among a steady stream of Japanese industrialists, naval officers, politicians and royalty who inscribed their names in the Cragside visitors' book. The Chinese diplomat Li Hung Chang visited in August 1896. King Chulalongkorn of Siam was staying in August 1897, when activity at the Elswick Works was disrupted by a bitter strike over pay and hours. In August 1884 the Prince and Princess of Wales (the future Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) made a three-day visit to Cragside; it was the peak of Armstrong's social career. The royal arrival at the house was illuminated by ten thousand lamps and a vast array of Chinese lanterns hung in the trees on the estate; fireworks were launched from six balloons, and a great bonfire was lit on the Simonside Hills. On the second day of their visit, the Prince and Princess travelled to Newcastle, to formally open the grounds of Armstrong's old house, Jesmond Dean, which he had by then donated to the city as a public park. It is still a public park today, a ravine known as Jesmond Dene. Three years later, at the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Armstrong was ennobled as Baron Armstrong of Cragside, and became the first engineer and the first scientist to be granted a peerage. Among many other celebrations, he was awarded the freedom of the City of Newcastle. In his vote of thanks, the mayor noted that one in four of the entire population of the city was employed directly by Armstrong, or by companies over which he presided. =Armstrong's heirs: 1900‚Äìpresent= Armstrong died at Cragside on 27 December 1900, aged 90, and was buried beside his wife in the churchyard at Rothbury. His gravestone carries an epitaph: His scientific attainments gained him a world wide celebrity and his great philanthropy the gratitude of the poor. Cragside, and Armstrong's fortune, were inherited by his great-nephew, William Watson-Armstrong. Watson-Armstrong lacked Armstrong's commercial acumen and a series of poor financial investments led to the sale of much of the great art collection in 1910. In 1972, the death of Watson-Armstrong's heir, William John Montagu Watson- Armstrong, saw the house and estate threatened by large-scale residential development, intended to raise the money to pay a large inheritance tax bill. In 1971, when advising the National Trust on the most important Victorian houses to be preserved for the nation in the event of their sale, Mark Girouard had identified Cragside as the top priority. A major campaign saw the house and grounds acquired by the Trust in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the National Land Fund. In 2007, Cragside reopened after undergoing an 18-month refurbishment programme that included rewiring the whole house. It has become one of the most-visited sites in North East England, with some 236,672 visitors in 2018. The Trust continues restoration work, allowing more of the house to be displayed: Armstrong's electrical room, in which he conducted experiments on electrical charges towards the end of his life, was re-opened in 2016. The experiments had led to the publication in 1897 of Armstrong's last work, Electrical Movement in Air and Water, illustrated with remarkable early photographs by his friend John Worsnop. The Trust continues the reconstruction of the wider estate, with plans to redevelop Armstrong's glasshouses, including the palm house, the ferneries and the orchid house. Architecture and description The entrance front Shaw's \\"Wagnerian\\" overture Cragside is an example of Shaw's Tudor revival style; the Pevsner Architectural Guide for Northumberland called it \\"the most dramatic Victorian mansion in the North of England\\". The entrance front was described by Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel as \\"one of the most dramatic compositions in all architecture\\", and the architectural historian James Stevens Curl regarded the house as \\"an extraordinarily accomplished Picturesque composition\\". Criticism focuses on the building's lack of overall coherence; in The National Trust Book of the English House, Aslet and Powers describe the house as \\"large and meandering\\", and the architectural critics Dixon and Muthesius write that \\"the plan rambles along the hillside\\". Saint is even more dismissive: for him, \\"the plan of Cragside is little better than a straggle\\". The half-timbering above the entrance has also been criticised as unfaithful to the vernacular tradition of the North-East. Shaw would have been unconcerned; desiring it for \\"romantic effect, he reached out for it like an artist reaching out for a tube of colour\\". The architectural historian J. Mordaunt Crook considers Cragside to be one of the very few country houses built by the Victorian commercial plutocracy that was truly \\"avant-garde or trend-setting\\". In his study, The Rise of the Nouveaux Riches, Crook contends that many new-monied owners were too domineering, and generally chose second-rate architects, as these tended to be more \\"pliant\\", allowing the clients to get their own way, rather than those of the first rank such as Shaw. The Rhenish flavour of the house makes a notable contrast with a country house that was almost contemporaneous with Cragside: the Villa H√ºgel constructed by Armstrong's greatest rival, Alfred Krupp. While Armstrong's Northumbrian fastness drew on Teutonic inspirations, his German competitor designed and built a house that was an exercise in neoclassicism. The location for the house was described by Mark Girouard as \\"a lunatic site\\". Pevsner and Richmond call both the setting and the house Wagnerian. The ledge on which it stands is narrow, and space for the repeated expansions could only be found by dynamiting the rock face behind, or by building upwards. Such challenges only drove Armstrong on, and overcoming the technical barriers to construction gave him great pleasure. His task was made easier by the use of the workforce and the technology of the Elswick Works. The architectural historian Jill Franklin notes that the vertiginous fall of the site is so steep that the drawing room, on a level with the first-floor landing at the front of the house, meets the rock face at the back. Jenkins describes the plan of the house as \\"simpler than the exterior suggests\\". The majority of the reception rooms are located on the ground floor, as are the accompanying service rooms. The exception is the large extension Shaw added to the south-east from 1882. This includes the drawing room, completed for the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales, in August 1884. The house has been a Grade I listed building since 21 October 1953, the listing citing inter alia its \\"largely complete Victorian interior\\". The architectural correspondent of The Times, Marcus Binney, who was closely involved in the campaign to bring Cragside to the National Trust, noted the historic importance of this \\"virtually untouched interior\\", with its collections of furnishings, furniture (much designed especially for Cragside), and fine and decorative arts, with work by many notable designers of the period, including William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Philip Webb and Edward Burne-Jones. Pevsner notes that the art collection demonstrated \\"what was permissible to the Victorian nobleman in the way of erotica\\". =Kitchen, service rooms and Turkish bath= The kitchen is large by Victorian standards and forms a considerable apartment with the butler's pantry. It displays Armstrong's \\"technical ingenuity\\" to the full, having a dumb waiter and a spit both run on hydraulic power. An electric gong announced mealtimes. For the visit of Edward and Alexandra, Armstrong brought in the Royal caterers, Gunters, who used the kitchen to prepare an eight- course menu which included oysters, turtle soup, stuffed turbot, venison, grouse, peaches in maraschino jelly and brown bread ice cream. Off the kitchen, under the library, is a Turkish bath suite, an unusual item in a Victorian private house. The writer Michael Hall suggests that the bath, with its plunge pool, was intended as much to demonstrate Armstrong's copious water supply as for actual use. As was often the case, Armstrong also found practical application for his pleasures: steam generated by the Turkish bath supported the provision of heating for the house. =Library and dining room= The library\\"Shaw's greatest domestic interior\\" Girouard describes the library as \\"one of the most sympathetic Victorian rooms in England\\". It belongs to the first phase of Shaw's construction work and was completed in 1872. It has a large bay window which gives views out over the bridge and the glen. The room is half-panelled in oak and the fireplace includes fragments of Egyptian onyx, collected during Armstrong's visit to the country in 1872. The library originally contained some of Armstrong's best pictures, although most were rehung in the gallery or drawing room, following Shaw's later building campaign of the 1880s, and then sold in 1910, ten years after Armstrong's death. The highlight was Albert Joseph Moore's Follow My Leader, dating from 1872. Andrew Saint considers the room \\"Shaw's greatest domestic interior\\". The dining room off the library contains a \\"Gothic\\" fireplace with an inglenook. A portrait of Armstrong by Henry Hetherington Emmerson shows him sitting in the inglenook with his dogs, under a carved inscription on the mantlepiece reading East or West, Hame's Best. The stained glass in the windows of the inglenook is by William Morris, and other glass from Morris & Co., to designs by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Webb and Ford Madox Brown, was installed in the library, gallery and upper stairs. =Owl suite= The Owl rooms were constructed in the first building campaign and formed a suite for important guests. Their name derives from the carved owls that decorate the woodwork and the bed. The room is panelled in American Black walnut, the same wood from which the tester bed is carved. Saint notes that Shaw was \\"proud of the design\\", displaying a further \\"owl-bed\\" in an exhibition in 1877. The Prince and Princess of Wales occupied the rooms during their stay at Cragside in 1884. Other bedrooms, notably the Yellow and White rooms, were hung with wallpaper by William Morris, including early versions of his Fruit and Bird and Trellis designs. The wallpapers were reprinted using the original printing blocks and rehung in the National Trust's renovations. =Gallery= The gallery originally formed Armstrong's museum room and was built by Shaw between 1872 and 1874. It led to the observatory in the Gilnockie Tower. Later, the room formed a processional route to the newly created drawing room, and was transformed into a gallery for pictures and sculpture. Its lighting displayed further evidence of Armstrong's technical ingenuity. Provided with twelve overhead lamps, the lighting for the room could be supplemented by a further eight lamps, powered by electric current transferred from the lamps in the dining room when they were no longer required. Lighting, and his means of providing it, mattered to Armstrong, on both technical and aesthetic levels; he wrote, \\"in the passageways and stairs the lamps are used without shades and present a most beautiful and star-like appearance.\\" =Drawing room= The drawing room and inglenook fireplace\\"sensational\\", \\"spectacular\\" or \\"sickening\\", according to taste The drawing room was constructed in the 1880s phase of building, when Armstrong had sold his Jesmond house and was residing solely at Cragside. Aslet suggests that the inspiration for the design was the great hall at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, although Saint considers Shaw's Dawpool Hall, Cheshire as the more likely source. Pevsner and Richmond mention Hardwick Hall and Hatfield House as possible models for the \\"spectacular\\" overall design. The room contains a colossal marble inglenook chimneypiece, reputed to weigh ten tons, and designed by Shaw's assistant, W. R. Lethaby. Muthesius describes the fireplace as a \\"splendid example ... with finely composed relief decoration\\". Jenkins considers it \\"surely the world's biggest inglenook\\" and describes the overall impact of the room as \\"sensational\\", noting the top-lit ceiling and the elaborate Jacobethan plasterwork. Others have been less complimentary; the writer Reginald Turnor, no admirer either of Shaw or of Victorian architecture and its architects more generally, wrote of the room's \\"flamboyant and rather sickening detail\\". By the time of its construction, Shaw, increasingly working for clients of great wealth, had moved on from his \\"Old English\\" style, and the room is designed and decorated in a grander and more opulent Renaissance taste. =Billiard room= The billiard room extension of 1895 is by Frederick Waller. It replaced a laboratory, in which Armstrong conducted experiments in electric currents. The billiard table and furniture was supplied by Burroughes and Watts. The billiard room and adjacent gun room formed a smoking suite, the previous absence of which is evidenced in a watercolour painted to commemorate the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Prince and Armstrong are shown smoking cigars on the terrace, as Victorian convention did not permit smoking in the principal reception rooms. Technology Cragside's screw turbine, installed in 2014 Burnfoot Power House, electricity generator After his first visit in 1869, Shaw described the house in a letter to his wife, noting the \\"wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things you can imagine\\". By building dams, Armstrong created five new lakes on the estate, Debdon, Tumbleton, Blackburn, and the Upper and Lower lakes at Nelly's Moss. In 1868, a hydraulic engine was installed. Inspired by a watermill on the Dee in Dentdale, in 1870 Armstrong installed a Siemens dynamo in what was the world's first hydroelectric power station. The generators, which also provided power for the farm buildings on the estate, were constantly extended and improved to meet the increasing electrical demands in the house. The 2006 regeneration project included extensive rewiring. A new screw turbine, with a -long Archimedes' screw, was installed in 2014; it can provide 12 kW, supplying around 10 per cent of the property's electricity consumption. The electricity generated was used to power an arc lamp installed in the picture gallery in 1878. This was replaced in 1880 by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamps in what Swan considered \\"the first proper installation\\" of electric lighting. Armstrong knew Swan well and had chaired the presentation of Swan's new lamps to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne. Historic England describes Cragside as the \\"first (house) in the world to be lit by electricity derived from water power\\". The use of electricity to run the house's appliances and internal systems made Cragside a pioneer of home automation; one of the first private residences to have a dishwasher, a vacuum cleaner and a washing machine, the conservators Sarah Schmitz and Caroline Rawson suggest Cragside was \\"the place where modern living began\\". The spit in the kitchen was also powered by hydraulics. The conservatory contained a self- watering system for the pot plants, which turned on water-powered revolving stands. Telephony was introduced, both between the rooms in the house, and between the house and other buildings on the estate. A plaque at Bamburgh Castle, Armstrong's other residence on the Northumbrian coast, records that his development of these new automated technologies \\"emancipated ... much of the world from household drudgery\\". Grounds and estate Armstrong's bridge over the Debdon Burn Cragside is named after Cragend Hill above the house, and is surrounded by an extensive rock garden, with a collection of rhododendrons, one of which is named after Lady Armstrong, who made a considerable contribution to the design and construction of the gardens, and large plantings of mostly coniferous trees. Among these is the tallest Scots pine in Britain, at a height of 131ft (40m). Over one hundred years after their planting, Jill Franklin wrote that, \\"the great, dark trees form a protective barrier to (Armstrong's) home\\". Armstrong continued to buy land after the purchase of the original site and by the 1880s the gardens and grounds comprised some 1,700 acres, with the wider estate, including Armstrong's agricultural holdings, extending to 15,000 acres according to Henrietta Heald's 2012 biography of Armstrong, and to over 16,000 acres according to the historian David Cannadine. David Dougan records the traditional claim that Armstrong planted over seven million trees in the gardens and parkland. The estate is a sanctuary for some of the last remaining red squirrel colonies in England. Tumbleton Stables, Cragside The glen north-west of the house is spanned by an iron bridge, crossing the Debdon Burn, constructed to Armstrong's design at his Elswick Works in the 1870s. It is a Grade II* listed structure and was restored by the Trust, and reopened to the public in 2008‚Äì2009. The gardens themselves are listed Grade I, and some of the architectural and technological structures have their own historic listings. The Clock Tower, which regulated life on the estate, dates from the time of the construction of the shooting lodge, and might have been designed by the same architect; it is not by Shaw. It is possible that Armstrong himself designed the clock. Like the bridge, the Clock Tower has a Grade II* listing. The formal gardens, where Armstrong's great greenhouses stood and which were long separated from the main estate, have now been acquired by the Trust. Media appearances Cragside has featured in an Open University Arts Foundation Course, Jonathan Meades's documentary series Abroad Again in Britain, BBC One's Britain's Hidden Heritage, and Glorious Gardens from above, and ITV's series Inside the National Trust. The 2017 film The Current War was partly filmed at the estate. Cragside featured as the basis for the representation of Lockwood Manor in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.

He became director in 1914 and was elected president of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1916. Under his leadership the UFA became the most powerful political lobby group in the province. In 1919, Wood oversaw the transition of the UFA into a political party and in 1921 they formed the government of Alberta, winning 38 of 61 seats in the Legislative Assembly.\\"Henry Wise Wood\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia Wood refused to enter electoral politics himself but led the UFA's extra-parliamentary organization throughout, and influenced the elected government from the sidelines. Background and early career Wood was born on a farm near Monroe City, Missouri to a prosperous farming family with land holding in Missouri and Texas. He became an accomplished stockman while still a teenager. At the age of 44 he visited Alberta and the following year (1905) purchased a wheat farm and moved his family to Carstairs, Alberta. Leadership of United Farmers of Alberta An earnest student of agrarian reform, he had observed the Alliance and Populist movements in Missouri during the 1890s and after relocating to Canada soon joined the Society for Equity, an early farm association. In 1909 the Society for Equity merged with the Alberta Farmers' Association to form the United Farmers of Alberta. In 1914 Wood became a director of the UFA; in 1915 he was elected vice-president and was president from 1916 to 1931. =Class conflict ideology= Wood became well known as the main theorist and head of the radical Albertan branch of the wave of agrarian discontent that was sweeping Canada at the time. He consistently refused to run for office, but backed the United Farmers when they ran for office in the province and also supported the Progressive Party of Canada federally. Wood's basic ideology was one of supporting farmers class interests against bankers and industrialists and the concept of \\"group government\\" in which government by political parties representing narrow class interests would be replaced by a government composed of all groups. Later life Wood continued to play an important role in the UFA until 1937 when he retired to his farm in Carstairs, Alberta. He died in 1941. A school in Calgary, Henry Wise Wood Senior High, was named after him.

Categories of hand tools include wrenches, pliers, cutters, files, striking tools, struck or hammered tools, screwdrivers, vises, clamps, snips, saws, drills and knives. Outdoor tools such as garden forks, pruning shears, and rakes are additional forms of hand tools. Portable power tools are not hand tools. History Hand tools have been used by humans since the Stone Age when stones were used for hammering and cutting. During the Bronze Age tools were made by casting the copper and tin alloys. Bronze tools were sharper and harder than those made of stone. During the Iron Age iron replaced bronze, and tools became even stronger and more durable. The Romans developed tools during this period which are similar to those being produced today. In the period since the industrial revolution, the manufacture of tools has transitioned from being craftsman made to being factory produced. A large collection of British hand tools dating from 1700 to 1950 is held by St Albans Museums. Most of the tools were collected by Raphael Salaman (1906‚Äì1993), who wrote two classic works on the subject: Dictionary of Woodworking ToolsSalaman, R. A.

It is situated at the south-eastern part of the Peak District, with the National Park directly to the west. The town is twinned with the French town of Eaubonne. The former spa resort of Matlock Bath lies immediately south of the town on the A6. The civil parish of Matlock Town had a population in the 2011 UK census of 9,543. The population of the wider Matlock urban area (including Darley Dale, Tansley, Hackney and Matlock Bath) is approximately 20,000. Matlock is nine miles (14 km) south-west of Chesterfield and in easy reach of the cities of Derby (19 miles), Sheffield (20 miles) and Nottingham (29 miles); the Greater Manchester conurbation is 30 miles away. Matlock is within the Derbyshire Dales district, which also includes the towns of Bakewell and Ashbourne, as well as Wirksworth. The headquarters of Derbyshire County Council are in the town. History The name Matlock derives from the Old English m√¶thel (or m√¶√∞el), meaning assembly or speech, and ƒÅc, meaning oak tree; thus Matlock means 'moot-oak', an oak tree where meetings are held. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as Meslach and in 1196 it was named Matlac. It is a former spa town that lies on the River Derwent, and has prospered from both the hydrotherapy industry and the cloth mills constructed on the river and its tributary Bentley Brook. It was a relatively inconspicuous collection of villages in Wirksworth Hundred ‚Äî composed of Matlock Town, Matlock Green, Matlock Bridge, Matlock Bank ‚Äì until thermal springs were discovered in 1698. The population increased rapidly in the 1800s, largely because of the popular hydros which were being built.. See downloadable attachments at bottom of page. At one stage there were around twenty hydros, mostly on Matlock Bank, the largest built in 1853 by John Smedley. This closed in 1955, and re-opened in 1956 as the headquarters of the Derbyshire County Council. Matlock is also home to the Derbyshire Dales District Council as well as Matlock Town council. Governance Matlock has a town council (the urban equivent of a rural parish council) which is the lowest tier of local government. The Council meets twice a month. There are 11 Councillors who cover the area and 9 members of staff. Matlock Town Council's jurisdiction extends covers the Town Centre, Matlock Bank, Hurst Farm, Matlock Green, Matlock Town, Starkholmes and Riber. The second tier of local government is Derbyshire Dales District Council which covers almost a third of the mainly rural parts of the County, including the towns of Matlock, Ashbourne, Bakewell, Wirksworth and Darley Dale and over 100 villages. The Council has 39 District Councillors elected in 25 wards. Matlock is represented by 6 councillors in the two wards Matlock All Saints and Matlock St Giles. The top tier of local government is Derbyshire County Council that has responsibilities for the whole of Derbyshire apart from the City of Derby. Matlock is represented by one county councillor (out of 64 councillors in total). The main offices of all three tiers of local government are sited in Matlock. The Town Council is situated in the Imperial Rooms close to the bottom of Bank Road, the District Council is halfway up Bank Road and the County Council is at the top. As regards national democracy, Matlock forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Derbyshire Dales. The MP is currently Sarah Dines, who was elected in the 2019 General Election. Geography =Natural physical features= The main physical features of the Matlock area are the hills and watercourses. The height of the town (above mean level) varies from 91m at Causeway Lane (in the valley bottom) to 203m at the top of Wellington Street. Matlock is overlooked by Riber Castle at 260m from the south-east and by Masson Hill at 339m from the south-west. The first human settlement in the area was in what is now known as Old Matlock or Matlock Green. This was where the Bentley Brook joined the River Derwent. When the town grew in the late 19th century, the town spread up the steep hillsides to the north-east of the narrow valley bottom. Baileys (corn) Mill on Bentley BrookVarious industries made use of the natural features: * The underlying bedrocks were quarried and mined. * The watercourses were harnessed to power corn, cloth and other mills. * The hillside thermal spring water gave rise to the hydros. The natural features also constrained transport links: * In the Derwent gorge below High Tor, the present-day A6 (Dale Road) was squeezed in beside the river. * From the south, the Midland Railway reached Matlock Station via a series of short tunnels constructed under the limestone of the gorge. * A cable tramway was constructed to tackle the very steep Bank Road (see above). =Geology= Specimen of Matlockite in the Mineralogical Museum, Bonn The geology of the Matlock area is extremely complex. Broadly speaking, the Derwent valley bottom forms a boundary between the sandstones and gritstones of the Dark Peak to the NE and the limestones of the White Peak to the SW. There are igneous intrusions into the limestones to the SW. This geology has been exploited by the quarrying and mining industries. The sandstones and gritstones have been quarried as building materials (e.g. at Bentley Brook Quarries) and the limestones for building materials and the manufacture of lime (e.g. at Harvey Dale Quarries). The igneous intrusions gave rise to valuable minerals which have been mined (e.g. in the Bonsall area), particularly for lead. A very rare lead halide mineral called Matlockite was first discovered at nearby Bage Mine in the early 1800s, and is named after the town.Phosgenite and Matlockite in Derbyshire (Part 1), T. Bridges, M.E. Smith, Journal of the Russell Society Volume 1, No. 2, p7-14, 1983 Retrieved on 11 December 2015 The route of the River Derwent downstream (south) of Matlock is especially interesting to geologists in that it appears to have cut its way through a limestone gorge below High Tor (120m above river level), rather than follow the \\"simpler\\" way to the east. It is thought that landslips and/or glaciation may have had an influence over how the present route of the river was established. =Nearby places= =The Dimple= The area on the western edge of the town, bounded on the north and east by Old Hackney Lane, Hurds Hollow, and Dimple Road, and on the south by Bakewell Road, is named as Dimple, on the Ordnance Survey map. =Flooding= The Derwent has occasionally flooded, including during November 2019 when large areas of England were affected. Transportation =Bank Road Tram= Matlock taken from Matlock Bridge ‚Äì looking up the hill of Bank Road across Crown Square (prior to bridge one way system). In 1893, Matlock Cable Tramway, a cable tramway was built up Bank Road from Crown Square at Matlock Bridge to Wellington Street (at the top of Bank Road) with a stop halfway up at Smedley Street where Smedley's Hydro (built by John Smedley) was situated. Conceived by Job Smith, the tram was inspired by San Francisco's famous cable cars, and cost ¬£20,000. When it was built it was the steepest tramway in the world at a gradient of 1 in 5¬Ω, and it rose . The fare was tuppence up, penny down. It closed in 1927 after losing business to cars and buses. =Railways= Peak Rail emblemIn 1849, the railway came to Matlock. Matlock railway station was opened on the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, later the Midland line between London and Manchester, until the section between Matlock and Buxton was closed in 1968 following the Beeching cuts. Network Rail considered re-opening the line, with a study carried out by the county council. Although it proved to be unfeasible in the short term, the track bed will be kept free of development as the study showed that the line could be economically viable from around 2025. The section from Wye Dale (about east of Buxton) to Coombs viaduct, a point about a mile south-east of Bakewell, has now become the Monsal Trail, an walk and cycle trail. Trains still run between Matlock and Derby on the Derwent Valley Line. Peak Rail, a preserved railway, runs steam trains on a section of the closed line between Matlock, Darley Dale and Rowsley. Previously it used its own station, Matlock Riverside, a short distance to the north of the mainline station, however as of 2011 both Peak Rail and trains on the Derwent Valley Line share the same station. Hall Leys Park thumb Hall Leys Park is a Victorian public park in the centre of Matlock, Derbyshire which opened in 1898. It lies between the River Derwent to the south and Causeway Lane to the north. The park has many facilities and in 2004‚Äì2005 underwent major regeneration as part of the Matlock Parks Project with funding from the Millennium Commission. At the Crown Square/Matlock Bridge end of the park there is the town's war memorial and a wishing well. Beside this there is the shelter from the former cable tramway which was moved to the park when the tramway ceased to operate in 1927. Moving away from Crown Square there is, next, a large grass area and some tennis courts. As part of the refurbishments which took place, the old grass tennis courts were replaced with a skateboard park. Hall Leys Park bandstand from footbridge over River DerwentIn the centre of the park is the Victorian bandstand which is used regularly in the summer months by local brass bands and for events such as the annual Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend ‚Äì held on the first weekend of December. Beside the bandstand is a footbridge over the River Derwent which has markings indicating the height of several floods that hit the town in the 1960s and 1970s. The caf√©, on the opposite side of the bandstand, has similar markings for other floods. Hall Leys Park is now a central part of the town's flood protection. The wall which surrounds the northern side of the park has the ability to have the footways sealed with sheets of wood which would dam the progress of any overflow from the river and turn the entire park into a large reservoir. Further down the park there is a putting green and a Crown Green Bowls green. A boating lake, with several small islands, is home to a large number of birds, including ducks and moorhens as well as being host to the longest running pleasure boats in the country. A miniature railway runs half the length of the park along the river but, due to the lack of any turning space, the return journey is made in reverse. At the far end of the park is a children's playground which was significantly upgraded in 2005. Hall Leys Park is occasionally the site for visiting \\"Continental Markets\\" and, since the summer of 2006, regular \\"Farmers' Markets\\". It is also the centre of the Matlock Victorian Christmas Weekend held annually on the first weekend of December. Bank Road Bank Road runs from Crown Square up Matlock Bank, a steep hill which gives the road its name, to Wellington Street. Although many consider the whole incline to be Bank Road, just over halfway up beyond Smedley Street the road is called Rutland Street. Bank Road has many local landmark buildings along it ‚Äì from the bottom of the hill (Crown Square) travelling north: Crown Buildings *The Crown Hotel ‚Äì the original site of the hotel which gave its name to Crown Square is now a building society office. This was built prior to 1899. The Crown is now a Wetherspoon's pub just along Bakewell Road. *Crown Buildings, opposite the original Crown Hotel at the bottom of Bank Road, was built in 1889 and currently houses a caf√© on its ground floor. *Post Office and Sorting Office. These were built prior to 1922. *Police Station ‚Äì built after the second world war. Town Hall *Derbyshire Dales District Council Offices. Formerly Bridge Hall, then a hydro called Bridge House (established by 1861). In 1894 the Matlock Urban District Council bought Bridge House hydro for use as the Town Hall and added a large wing in the Italianate style to house an assembly room etc. It was reopened in 1898 and also housed most local authority undertakings, magistrates courts, etc. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the Town Hall became the headquarters of West Derbyshire District Council (which later changed its name to Derbyshire Dales District Council). To enable the District Council to centralise its several offices spread over the district, the Town Hall was substantially extended in 1979. *Our Lady & St. Joseph's Catholic Church ‚Äì built in 1883 with a presbytery added in 1896. The church was described as a ‚Äòmission‚Äô, established under St Mary's of Derby. A church hall was built alongside in the 1990s. Old Methodist Church above Old Sunday School *Youth Hostel ‚Äì a YHA youth hostel ‚Äì Built in 1882 as Smedley Memorial Hospital. There is a later (Hunter) wing with a datestone of 1897 set further back from the road. The Youth Hostel opened in 1983 and closed on 30 September 2007. *Matlock Methodist & United Reformed Church ‚Äì originally Matlock Wesleyan Chapel, and later the Trinity Methodist Church. The church was designed by C.O. Ellison of Liverpool, with additions designed by Horace G. Bradley. The neo-gothic church was originally built in 1882 without the slender steeple, which is now a landmark feature reaching above the roofs of neighbouring buildings, and, from higher levels, an elegant feature against the backdrop of the hills beyond. The Manse was built at the west of the site, fronting New Street. *Old Sunday School which is now a B&B.; *Old Methodist Church ‚Äì the Primitive Methodist congregation was founded in 1838, although the current church on Bank Road, opposite the entrance to County Hall, was rebuilt in 1856 and the adjacent School Room below was added in 1878. Until recently, the Old Methodist Church housed the Matlock Wurlitzer. County Hall with Winter Gardens in foreground *County Hall ‚Äì formerly Smedley's Hydro, is a grade II listed building which dominates Matlock Bank. The earliest (western) section seen today was built in by Smedley. Much of today's building was added after Smedley's death in 1874. The first phase, in 1881, included the entrance hall and staircase, now in the middle section. In 1886, the eastern section was added by architect George Statham of Nottingham. Later extensions include the tall chimney, impressive for its height on the already prominent site, along with boiler house and bath in 1894. The domed glass Winter Gardens, which housed a ballroom, and the northern block on the other side of Smedley Street were added in 1901. The northern block was linked by the unusual two-storey bridge over Smedley Street. The Gate and, across Bank Road, County Hall The hydro closed in 1955 and re-opened in 1956 as \\"County Offices\\", when Derbyshire County Council moved its headquarters from the old County Hall in Derby. Its name was changed to \\"County Hall\\", during the 1990s. Part of the County Hall complex is seen in Women in Love, Ken Russell's Oscar-winning 1969 film. As the Brangwen sisters walk out of their house (in reality No. 80, New Street) near the beginning of the film they are seen walking towards Bank Road. *Smedley Street traverses Bank Road. It has its own parade of shops and a post office (now closed). The east end of Smedley Street (known as Smedley Street East) is home to Laser Rail, a designer and manufacturer of rail measurement equipment now incorporated into Balfour Beatty's rail division. At the west end is All Saints' Church, Matlock Bank. Rutland Court *The Gate public house ‚Äì There were known to have been numerous public houses on Matlock Bank, thought to have been the result of the ban on alcohol consumption within the hydros themselves, especially at Smedley's. The whereabouts of many is no longer known. The Gate (dated 1869) was one of these, and still stands on the corner of Smedley Street and Bank Road, opposite Smedley's. It now functions as an arts venue known as Designate at the Gate. NB. Beyond Smedley Street, Bank Road is actually Rutland Street. thumb *Rutland Court ‚Äì the former Matlock House Hydro stands prominently on the east side of Rutland Street. The hydro was built in 1863 and an engraving of 1870 shows that the main block, at least that which is visible from the roadside today, is largely unaltered. *Elmtree House ‚Äì a former hydro, now 70‚Äì74 Rutland Street, was opened in 1862. It is located just to the north of the dominant Matlock House (now Rutland Court). *The Old Tram Depot which is now a garage and car repair centre. Rockside Hydro *Rockside Hydro ‚Äì an imposing building with views across Matlock, is a grade II listed building, on higher ground above Smedley's and is distinctive for its two octagonal corner turrets with conical roofs topped by lanterns. Rockside was built circa 1860, but extended significantly by the firm of architects Parker and Unwin between 1901 and 1905, The building was also extended later in 1923 and 1928. An upper floor glazed conservatory with a glazed curved roof was added in , and a block was added on Cavendish Road in 1928. It probably is not so well known that during the Second World War, Rockside Hall was used as an RAF psychiatric hospital, where mentally-scarred service personnel (mostly aircrew) were rehabilitated. It was somewhat unkindly known as \\"Hatters Castle\\" by locals. The building became a hall of residence to Matlock College of Further Education in 1950 but following closure, stood empty and derelict for many years but has recently been renovated and converted into apartments. Large sections have been replaced, including the Cavendish Road block and the curved conservatory roof. Dale Road Dale Road runs all the way from Matlock Bridge (road bridge over the River Derwent) to North Parade in Matlock Bath. It forms part of the Derby to Manchester road (A6) and has very many bends. Dale Road, like Bank Road (see previous section), contains a large number of examples of Victorian architecture, although only four are listed by English Heritage. However all buildings on Dale Road are included in two conservation areas created by Derbyshire Dales District Council. These conservation areas are called \\"Matlock Bridge\\" (from the bridge over the Derwent to the railway bridge over Dale Road), then \\"Matlock Dale\\" to the outskirts of Matlock Bath. In this section, the main features of Dale Road are described, starting at Matlock Bridge and then proceeding in a southerly direction until the High Tor Hotel. *Railway Station and Station House ‚Äì The railway station and the nearby station house were both designed by Joseph Paxton around 1850, as part of the building of the Midland Railway's Derby to Buxton route. The station house, being largely unaltered since being built, is listed Grade II by English Heritage, but the station itself is unlisted. *Matlock Bridge ‚Äì This is the road crossing of the River Derwent. The first stone bridge was constructed over or close to the site of a ford in the mid 13th century. It was only a single carriageway in width and remained so for 550 years. In the 1890s there were discussions regarding the need for a wider bridge to be able to cope with the increasing road traffic. A new bridge was proposed which would have involved the demolition of the existing. However, a decision was taken to double the width of the existing bridge. This work was undertaken in 1903-4. The bridge was made one-way to vehicular traffic at time of building of the access road to the superstore in Cawdor Quarry in 2007. The bridge is listed as Grade II* by English Heritage. HSBC Bank NatWest Bank Market Hall with Queens Head beyond *RBS Bank (now closed) ‚Äì There is a pedestrian access to this bank from Dale Road, although its postal address is Snitterton Road. This a building that has seen several changes of occupancy. In recent times, it has been offices for the Derbyshire Stone Company, then bank premises for William Deacons, then Williams & Glyn, then Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). This stone building was originally built in the late 18th century and is listed as Grade II by English Heritage. *Queens Head Inn ‚Äì The building currently on the corner of the junction of Holt Lane with Dale Road dates from the late 19th century. At that time it was the Queens Head Inn, although it has now been converted to shops. Along with the Market Hall (see below), this was one of the earliest buildings to be constructed at this (north) end of Dale Road. *HSBC Bank (now closed) ‚Äì This building is on the east side of Dale Road (No 5) and has an eye-catching clock. There is a record that Henry Barnwell and his son Harry moved from Birmingham and established a watchmaker and jewellery business there in 1876. Their corner shop became \\"London City and Midland Bank\\" which later became just \\"Midland Bank\\" which then became HSBC. The HSBC bank closed in June 2015. *NatWest Bank (now closed) ‚Äì This building of 1901 is on the east side of Dale Road (No 19). This is one of the few buildings on Dale Road that has a brick frontage (although several that have a stone frontage do use brick for the sides and rear). *Market Hall ‚Äì This building is on the west side of Dale Road (Nos 4,6,8,10) just south of the Queens Head Inn. The Market Hall was constructed in 1867‚Äì68. The ground floor was used as a general market house with 12 shop units while the upper floor was used for assemblies, public meetings and entertainments. The architectural style chosen for this was that of the then-popular Gothic Revival. The building was also an important source of civic pride, designed to impress and sporting a row of carved heraldic shields across its fa√ßade. The Market Hall is now a row of shops and offices. Olde Englishe Hotel *Olde Englishe Hotel ‚Äì This large building is on the east side of Dale Road (No 77). Its \\"old English\\" timber frames, spire-like turret and corner position give it a striking appearance in a street-scene of predominantly darker-stone buildings. The building closed as a hotel in 2009, and has been converted into bars and shops. *Lime ‚Äì This building is on the east side of Dale Road (No 79) and complements the Olde Englishe Hotel which it faces across the road junction. It has a distinctive cupola above its entrance. The building has had a variety of uses, from grocery shop, to antiques sales to hair salon. Evans Jeweller, with Lime and Olde Englishe Hotel beyond *Evans Jeweller ‚Äì Evans Jewellers Shop at Nos 93‚Äì95 Dale Road, with its projecting clock, can be regarded as the focal point of that part of the east side of Dale Road between its junctions with Olde Englishe Road and Holt Lane. W. Evans & Son has traded from these premises continuously since it was first established in 1893. Holt Terrace with railway bridge to left *Holt Terrace ‚Äì This is a five-house terrace that looks down on the southern junction of Holt Lane with Dale Road. It lies just north of the railway crossing of Dale Road and the River Derwent. Holt Lane was the \\"main road\\" along the valley until the Midland Railway opened in 1849. Soon after then, the Dale Road area was developed and Dale Road relegated Holt Lane to a side street. *John Hadfield House ‚Äì This is a post-WWII building on the west side of Dale Road immediately south of the railway bridge. It was built in the former Harveydale limestone quarry as the headquarters of Derbyshire Stone Ltd and named after a leading figure in the company. Derbyshire Stone was ultimately absorbed into Tarmac Ltd in 1968, whose Matlock office was subsequently closed. John Hadfield House is now occupied by offices of the Derbyshire County Council. *The Boat House ‚Äì This pub (now closed) is next to John Hadfield House on the west side of Dale Road. The pub was built in the early 19th century and is listed Grade II by English Heritage. It takes its name from a small ferry which once linked Matlock Dale to Matlock Green. The ferry was replaced by a footbridge in 1872. Footbridge to Pic Tor *Footbridge to Pic Tor ‚Äì This footbridge on the east side of Dale Road replaced a ferry at this point in 1872. The present iron bridge, erected in 1922, was refurbished in 2005. The bridge provides access from this part of Dale Road to Starkholmes Road, Pic Tor, High Tor, Hall Leys Park and Matlock Green. Artists Corner *Artists Corner ‚Äì This is a collection of houses in the valley bottom built along the west side of a sharp bend on Dale Road. It has been a favoured spot through the centuries for artists to come to admire the scenery and either draw or paint High Tor, which overlooks it from the south. It is overlooked on the north side by St Johns Road with its Grade II* listed Baptist Chapel. Artists Corner was also the location of a toll house on the Wirksworth-Moor- to-Longstone Turnpike (opened 1759). *High Tor Hotel ‚Äì This building, squeezed into the valley bottom below High Tor, was built in the early 19th century by Colonel Edward Payne. It was originally known as Tor Cottage and has had a variety of uses since then, including being a private home, lodging house, guest house, hotel and school (Matlock Modern School). As at August 2015, it is called High Tor Hotel and Artists Corner Restaurant and claims to be \\"a modern boutique hotel offering guests luxury, comfort and style\\".

Storytelling is also well represented with a monthly venue at the Imperial Rooms.Storytelling Cafe Retrieved 8 July 2014 =Education history= Ernest Bailey School (now County Council Records Office) The first school in Matlock was founded in 1647 as a free school for local boys, originally funded by local George Spateman of Tansley and from 1668 by Anthony Wolley. This school was rebuilt in 1829 and expanded in 1860 and 1889 and girls first attended in 1816. This school has since been demolished (the date is unknown). Another school, All Saints Primary School, was founded in 1875 to provide for the population of the newly developed Matlock Bank. This school still operates and is the biggest primary school in Matlock. In 1897, a third school, the Council School, was constructed on Matlock Bank, at the junction of Smedley Street and Chesterfield Road. It also still operates as Castle View Primary School. Before Highfields School was founded in 1982, when the tripartite education system in Matlock ended, there were two secondary schools in Matlock; Charles White Secondary Modern School (founded in 1956, and named after two local MPs, father and son, the latter of who died in 1956) and Ernest Bailey's Grammar School (founded in 1924 and named after its wealthy founder). As a Grammar school, Bailey's accepted students whose parents paid or who gained scholarships (by passing the Eleven plus exam) until fees were phased out, leaving scholarship as the only means of entry. Those who didn't attain a scholarship attended Charles White ‚Äì it is estimated that Charles White students outnumbered Bailey's students 3:1. White had been built especially by Derbyshire County Council to accommodate the children who couldn't attend Bailey's. The two schools were merged to create Highfields, a comprehensive school. The site of Charles White in Starkholmes became the 'lower site' of Highfields for years 7‚Äì8, while Bailey's was converted to the county council records offices. A new site was built to house the new 'upper site' at Lumsdale for years 9‚Äì13. The town centre development Dale Road (A6) exiting the edge of Matlock Town, showing traditional buildings housing independent shops and businesses For over 10 years, the council had proposed to allow a Sainsbury's supermarket to be built in Cawdor Quarry, a disused quarry next to the railway station. In early 2007 building work started and it opened 4 October 2007. A new access road with its own bridge over the River Derwent allows the A6 to bypass the town centre. The old bridge is restricted to one-way traffic (out of town) and allows pedestrian access from the town centre to the train station, a newly built bus station and the supermarket.Matlock Area Action Plan Several bus routes continue to serve only the old bus station on Bakewell Road, making Matlock one of the smallest towns in Britain to boast two bus stations. In 2010, Crown Square was updated with the replacement of pavements and street furniture intended to provide a look more appropriate to a conservation area; the old tarmac pavements and traffic island were rebuilt in local sandstone, barriers were replaced with heritage bollards and all street lights replaced. Bakewell Road and Firs Parade were not included in this phase as they are just off Crown Square, and along with Imperial Road they are yet to be redeveloped.

It was part of the National Auto Trail system, and grew out of an earlier Miami to Montreal highway. The final result is better understood as a network of connected paved roads, rather than one single highway. It was constructed and expanded from 1915 to 1929. The Dixie Highway was inspired by the example of the slightly earlier Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States. The prime booster of both projects was promoter and businessman Carl G. Fisher. It was overseen by the Dixie Highway Association, and funded by a group of individuals, businesses, local governments, and states. In the early years the U.S. federal government played little role, but from the early 1920s on it provided increasing funding, until 1927, when the Dixie Highway Association was disbanded and the highway was taken over as part of the U.S. Route system, with some portions becoming state roads. The route was marked by a red stripe with the white letters \\"DH\\", usually with a white stripe above and below. The logo was commonly painted on utility poles. History Monuments like this, and even arches over the roadway, were put up by counties as they built sections of highways including the Dixie Highway. The Dixie Highway, an idea of Carl G. Fisher of the Lincoln Highway Association, was organized in early December 1914 in Chattanooga. On April 3, 1915, governors of the interested states met at Chattanooga, and each selected two commissioners to lay out the route from Chicago to Miami. On May 22, 1915, the commission decided on a split route in order to serve more communities. The route left Chicago to the south via Danville, Illinois and turned east to Indianapolis, where it split. The west branch headed south through Tennessee via Louisville and Nashville to Chattanooga, Tennessee, while the east route went east from Indianapolis to Dayton, Ohio before turning south via Cincinnati; Lexington, Kentucky; and Knoxville, Tennessee; to Chattanooga. Two alternate routes were included between Chattanooga and Atlanta, and again between Atlanta and Macon, Georgia. Finally, between Macon and Jacksonville, Florida, the west route went south to Tallahassee, Florida before turning east, while the east route had yet to be defined in detail. From Jacksonville, the route followed the east coast south to Miami along the John Anderson Highway. The commission voted to invite Michigan and to extend a branch of the east route from Dayton north to Detroit via Toledo, as well as to study a loop around Lake Michigan and a western route between Tallahassee and Miami. Within a week, Michigan agreed to construct a loop around the Lower Peninsula, passing via South Bend, Mackinaw City, Detroit, and Toledo. Detroit became the northern end of the eastern division, with the old route to Indianapolis becoming a connecting link. In early April 1916, the commission approved the route between Macon and Jacksonville via Savannah, Georgia, and designated the more direct route via Waycross, Georgia as the central division. At the urging of locals, the eastern division was realigned to a more direct path northwest from Milledgeville, Georgia to Atlanta over the \\"Old Capitol Route\\", bypassing Macon, and the old eastern division via McDonough, Jackson, and Macon was removed from the system in early July 1916. By early 1917, the western division had been modified in Florida to go southeast from Tallahassee via Kissimmee and Bartow to the eastern division at Jupiter; the old Tallahassee‚ÄìJacksonville route became another connection. The Carolina division, connecting to the eastern division at Knoxville, Tennessee and Waynesboro, Georgia, was approved in mid-May 1918. By mid-1919, a short piece on Michigan's Upper Peninsula to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan became part of the eastern division of the highway, which was extended north from Detroit to Mackinaw City and across the Straits of Mackinac. Construction of various sections was done by convict laborers. Routes Postcard image of Dixie Highway in St. Johns County, Florida. This section was previously part of the older John Anderson Highway. :For local details about the routes, see the individual articles linked. The Western route connected Chicago, Illinois and Miami, Florida via Danville in Illinois; Indianapolis and Bedford in Indiana; Louisville, Elizabethtown, and Bowling Green in Kentucky; Nashville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Atlanta, Macon, and Albany in Georgia; and Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando, Arcadia, and Naples in Florida. Except for realignments made since the 1920s, the western route is now Illinois Route 1 and U.S. Route 136 to Indianapolis, Indiana State Road 37 and U.S. Route 150 to Louisville, U.S. Route 31W, U.S. Route 68, and U.S. Route 431 to Nashville, and U.S. Route 41, U.S. Route 231, U.S. Route 41A, and U.S. Route 41 to Chattanooga. At Chattanooga, the western and eastern routes intersected; the western took a longer route along U.S. Route 27 to Rome and then returned to U.S. Route 41 at Cartersville via U.S. Route 411. At Atlanta, the eastern route split off toward Madison, Georgia, with the western continuing to Macon along the present U.S. Route 41; then Georgia State Route 49, U.S. Route 19, and U.S. Route 319 to Tallahassee; U.S. Route 27 and U.S. Route 441 to Orlando; and U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 41 (over the Tamiami Trail) to Miami. The Eastern route connected Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with Miami, Florida, running via Saginaw and Detroit in Michigan; Toledo, Bowling Green, Lima, Dayton, and Cincinnati in Ohio; Lexington in Kentucky; Knoxville and Chattanooga in Tennessee; Atlanta and Savannah in Georgia; and Jacksonville and West Palm Beach in Florida. In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the highway followed what is now M-129 from Sault Ste. Marie to Pickford and then west to follow a short portion of former U.S. Route 2, replaced by Mackinaw Trail. It crossed the Straits of Mackinac and then used what is now U.S. Route 23 and old U.S. Route 10 to Detroit. Currently it still exists in Michigan as the name of a secondary road from Saginaw southeast to the county line (as an alternate route to Flint), from southeast Flint to northwest Pontiac, and from Flat Rock southwest to Monroe ending at the state line. A short section of the Dixie Highway in northwest lower Michigan running north from Eastport in Antrim County to the village of Norwood in Charlevoix County is named Old Dixie Highway‚ÄîU.S. Route 31 parallels this road to the east. In Ohio, it was old U.S. Route 25 to Cincinnati, current U.S. Route 25 and U.S. Route 25W to Knoxville, and U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 27 to Chattanooga. The eastern division took a more direct route than the western between Chattanooga and Atlanta, following the modern U.S. Route 41 all the way, but it followed a more circuitous path south of Atlanta. Traffic left Atlanta to the east on U.S. Route 278, following U.S. Route 441, Georgia State Route 24, a short section of U.S. Route 301, and Georgia State Route 21 to Savannah. There, the route turned south along the coast via U.S. Route 17 to Jacksonville and U.S. Route 1 to Miami. It is today (2016) a major street in towns and cities along the Florida East Coast. The Central route was a short cutoff between the western division at Macon, Georgia, and the eastern route at Jacksonville, Florida, forming a shorter route to Miami than the western on its own; it followed U.S. Route 41, U.S. Route 341, U.S. Route 129, Georgia State Route 32, and U.S. Route 1. The Carolina route cut the distance between Knoxville and Waynesboro, Georgia, on the eastern route. It is now U.S. Route 25W and U.S. Route 25, and passes through Asheville, Greenville, and Augusta on its way to the eastern route and Savannah. After the U.S. Highway System Much of the eastern route‚Äîand all the Carolina route‚Äîbecame U.S. Highway 25. Then the primary eastern route (Knoxville to Macon) was largely paralleled and in some sections replaced by Interstate 75, which runs from Miami, Florida, to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Large portions of the former US 25 in western Ohio ultimately ended up in 1963 (after Interstate 75's completion in that area) by various names, including County Road 25A, Dixie Drive, Dixie Highway, Cincinnati-Dayton Road, and, through Dayton, Patterson Boulevard and Keowee Street. A four-lane portion runs between Cygnet and Toledo, through Bowling Green, as Ohio State Route 25. In Michigan, M-25 from Port Huron to Bay City incorporates the segment of old US 25 that Interstates 75 and 94 did not supplant as a through route. The eastern portion from Jacksonville, Florida south was largely replaced with U.S. Route 1. The portion of the western route from Nashville, Tennessee north to Louisville, Kentucky is now U.S. Highway 31W. In most of the cities it traverses in Kentucky, it is still referred to as \\"Dixie Highway\\" or \\"Dixie Avenue\\". The western route generally follows the present-day route of US 150, IN 37 and IN 67 from Louisville to Indianapolis. From Nashville to Indianapolis, the route parallels Interstate 65. Portions of this stretch were originally parts of the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike, which began construction in the 1830s. The name \\"Dixie Highway\\" persists in various locations along its route where the main flow of long-distance traffic has been rerouted to more modern highways and the old Dixie Highway remains as a local road. In some south Florida cities, Dixie Highway (or sometimes Old Dixie Highway) parallels \\"Federal Highway\\" (U.S. Route 1), sometimes just a block away. In Tennessee, the name lives on in Dixie Lee Junction (where Dixie Highway and Lee Highway intersected). In western North Carolina, seven bronze plaques on granite pillars were placed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in the late 1920s to mark the route (which today follows US 25) of the Dixie Highway and honor General Robert E. Lee. These markers can be found in the towns of Hot Springs, Marshall, Asheville, Fletcher, and Hendersonville, and on the South Carolina and Tennessee state lines; an eighth monument of identical type can be found on US 25 in downtown Greenville, South Carolina. Two additional monuments can be found in Franklin, Ohio at the intersection of the Old Dixie Highway and Hamilton-Middletown Road, and near Bradfordville, Florida on US 319. The name Dixie Highway is also still commonly used in portions of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, such as in the Waterford area, where it is a major thoroughfare known as US 24. Dixie Highway retains its name running south from Chicago through the towns of Posen, Harvey, and Homewood to the town of Chicago Heights. Here it joins Illinois Route 1, which runs contiguous with the old Dixie Highway's original course. In Indiana, the only portion of the Highway that retains its name is located in southwestern Bedford. Indiana State Road 37 in southern Indiana and US 31 in northern Indiana were once part of the Dixie Highway system. A detailed 1915 map of the Dixie Highway route through Indiana and other states was generated by the National Highways Association. At least a portion of the Dixie Highway in Indiana was paved with brick, although some portions used continuous concrete (meaning no expansion joints). The state has not forgotten the crucial part that entrepreneur and native son Carl G. Fisher played in the development of the Dixie Highway nor the importance of the Dixie Highway itself. In some cities and towns, Dixie Highway is the north‚Äìsouth axis of the street numbering system. The extension of development westward means that the northwest and southwest quadrants of the grid defined in this manner are generally much larger than the northeast and southeast ones which are constrained by the Atlantic Ocean. Also, the route of Dixie Highway generally parallels the coast, often running diagonally instead of straight north and south, causing irregularities in the numbering system. The Dixie Highway- Hastings, Espanola and Bunnell Road (also known as County Road 13 or the Old Brick Road) is a historic section of Old Dixie Highway in Florida. It is located roughly between Espanola (in Flagler County) and CR 204 southeast of Hastings near Flagler Estates (in St. Johns County). This is one of the few extant portions of the original brick Dixie Highway left in Florida. On April 20, 2005, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Maitland, Florida is also home to a brick section of the Dixie Highway stretching around Lake Lily. There is also a small section of the original brick Dixie Highway, and a monument marking the county line, near Loughman, Florida on the Osceola County/Polk County border. A segment of Dixie Highway remains as an arterial street in Hallandale Beach, Florida. The name is mired in controversy due to its antebellum connotation, which some say glorifies the nation's racist history of slavery, and \\"upholds the history of the Confederacy.\\" In popular culture =Music= * \\"Dixie Highway\\", a song by composer Walter Donaldson and lyricist Gus Kahn * \\"On the Dixie Highway\\", music for one-step and two-step by Leo Friedman * \\"Dixie Highway\\", a song from the album Captured, by Journey * \\"Dixie Highway\\", a song from the album Thirty Miles West, by Alan Jackson * \\"Darlington County\\", a song from the album Born in the U.S.A., by Bruce Springsteen, references the highway * \\"Old Dixie Highway\\", a song by Roger Alan Wade See also *Dixie Square Mall References Further reading External links *In Search of...The Dixie Highway in Ohio by Michael G.

A sixteenth- century Portuguese map of Monomotapa lying in the interior of southern Africa. The Portuguese term Monomotapa is a transliteration of the African royal title Mwenemutapa derived from a combination of two words Mwene meaning King or Lord, and Mutapa meaning land. Over time the monarch's royal title was applied to the kingdom as a whole, and used to denote the kingdom's territory on maps from the period.  History  There are several Mutapa origin stories, the most widely accepted told by oral tradition is of the princes of Great Zimbabwe. The first \\"Mwene\\" was a warrior prince named Nyatsimba Mutota from the Kingdom of Zimbabwe who expanded the reach of the kingdom initially to discover new sources of salt in the north.Oliver, page 203 It is believed Prince Mutota found salt in his conquest of the Tavara, a Shona subdivision. Another historical narrative of the empire's origins is that Prince Mutota had broken away from Great Zimbabwe after going to war with Prince Mukwati, (believed to have been either his brother or cousin) over control of the Kingdom. = Expansion = Mutota's son and successor, Nyanhewe Matope, extended this new kingdom into an empire encompassing most of the lands between Tavara and the Indian Ocean.Oliver, page 204 This empire had achieved uniting a number of different peoples in Southern Africa by building strong, well-trained armies and encouraging states to join voluntarily, offering membership in the Great council of the Empire to any who joined without resistance. Matope's armies overran the kingdom of the Manyika as well as the coastal kingdoms of Kiteve and Madanda. By the time the Portuguese arrived on the coast of Mozambique, the Mutapa Kingdom was the premier state in the region. He raised a strong army which conquered the Dande area of the Tonga and Tavara. The empire had reached its full extent by the year 1480 a mere 50 years following its creation. = Religion = The Emperor Mutope had left the empire with a well-organised religion with a powerful priesthood. The religion of the Mutapa kingdom revolved around ritual consultation of spirits and of royal ancestors. Shrines were maintained within the capital by spirit mediums known as mhondoro. The mhondoro also served as oral historians recording the names and deeds of past kings.Oliver, page 205 = Economy = The Mutapa Empire like all Shona Kingdoms had an agrarian economy at its core. While mining operations may have been what made the Shona kingdoms famous among explorers and traders, mining was always considered a secondary activity to agriculture. The mining of gold was heavily controlled by the King and gold was traded for luxuries like silk, ceramics and other exotic items. They also traded other items for livestock, including sorghum, millet, ground beans, cow-peas, and bananas from Indonesia. Local trade was also a major part of the economy, something seen to a great extent in the Rozvi Empire which succeeded it. The citizens of Mutapa also engaged in a number of industries including blacksmithing, cloth production among other activities, in addition to agriculture, especially cattle rearing, and mining, especially of iron. = Government = The Mwene (King) was the political, administrative and religious head of the kingdom. He wore or carried as his badge of office a hoe/axe (gano) and spear made of gold and ivory. The King lived in an enclosed compound with a separate building for the queen and another group of buildings for royal attendants. The latter group typically consisted of males under 20 years of age who came from the families of subjugated tribal chiefs and whose presence guaranteed compliance with Mutapa rule. When these young males were of the age to become warriors, they were sent home and given parcels of land or their own regions to govern in order to ensure their future loyalty. Assisting the king, who ruled as an absolute monarch, were various officials such as the head of the army, chief musician, chief of medicine, a head spirit medium, and the royal doorkeeper. In matters of government, the king could call on the advice of nine ministers, the oddly named ‚Äòking‚Äôs wives‚Äô (MaKaranga). They were not all wives or even women. The queen was a member, and another was perhaps the sister of the king (Tete), but the others could be male ministers who had married into the royal family. The ministers ruled over their own estates and had some judicial powers such as imposing the death sentence on those found guilty of serious crimes. Ministers were served by female servants, much like the young men who served the king. The difference was that these maids could also be the concubines of the king. The senior wife of the king did have real power and was responsible for relations with foreigners. = Portuguese contact = The Portuguese dominated much of southeast Africa's coast, laying waste to Sofala and Kilwa, by 1515.Oliver, page 206 Their main goal was to dominate the trade with India; however, they unwittingly became mere carriers for luxury goods between Mutapa's sub- kingdoms and India. As the Portuguese settled along the coast, they made their way into the hinterland as sertanejos (backwoodsmen). These sertanejos lived alongside Swahili traders and even took up service among Shona kings as interpreters and political advisors. One such sertanejo, Ant√≥nio Fernandes, managed to travel through almost all the Shona kingdoms, including Mutapa's metropolitan district, between 1512 and 1516.Oliver, page 207 The Portuguese finally entered into direct relations with the Mwenemutapa in the 1560s. They recorded a wealth of information about the Mutapa kingdom as well as its predecessor, Great Zimbabwe. According to Swahili traders whose accounts were recorded by the Portuguese historian Jo√£o de Barros, Great Zimbabwe was an ancient capital city built of stones of marvellous size without the use of mortar. And while the site was not within Mutapa's borders, the Mwenemutapa kept noblemen and some of his wives there. In 1569, King Sebastian of Portugal made a grant of arms to the Mwenemutapa. These were blazoned: Gules between two arrows Argent an African hoe barwise bladed Or handled Argent ‚Äì The shield surmounted by a Crown Oriental. This was probably the first grant of arms to a native of southern Africa; however it is unlikely that these arms were ever actually used by the Mwenemutapa. The accidental crusade In 1561, a Portuguese Jesuit missionary managed to make his way into the Mwenemutapa's court and convert him to Christianity. This did not go well with the Muslim merchants in the capital, and they persuaded the king to kill the Jesuit only a few days after the former's baptism. This was all the excuse the Portuguese needed to penetrate the interior and take control of the gold mines and ivory routes. After a lengthy preparation, an expedition of 1,000 men under Francisco Barreto was launched in 1568. They managed to get as far as the upper Zambezi, but local disease decimated the force. The Portuguese returned to their base in 1572 and took their frustrations out on the Swahili traders, whom they massacred. They replaced them with Portuguese and their half-African progeny who became prazeiros (estate holders) of the lower Zambezi. Mutapa maintained a position of strength exacting a subsidy from each captain of Portuguese Mozambique that took the office. The Mwenemutapa also levied a duty of 50 percent on all trade goods imported.Oliver, page 208 =Decline and collapse= Mutapa proved invulnerable to attack and even economic manipulation due to the Mwenemutapa's strong control over gold production. What posed the greatest threat was infighting among different factions which led to opposing sides calling on the Portuguese for military aid. However, the Portuguese proved to be happy with the downfall of the Mutapan state. Portuguese control In 1629 the Mwenemutapa attempted to throw out the Portuguese. He failed and in turn he himself was overthrown, leading to the Portuguese installation of Mavura Mhande Felipe on the throne.Stewart, page 190 Mutapa signed treaties making it a Portuguese vassal and ceding gold mines, but none of these concessions were ever put into effect. Mutapa remained nominally independent, though practically a client state. All the while, Portugal increased control over much of southeast Africa with the beginnings of a colonial system. The Portuguese were now in control of the trade and the trade routes. Loss of prestige Baptism of king Siti of Mutapa by workshop of Tomasz Muszy≈Ñski, 1683, Dominican Monastery in Lublin. The baptism of Siti Kazurukamusapa was celebrated by Jo√£o de Mello on 4 August 1652, the feast day of St Dominic. Another problem for Mutapa was that its tributaries such as Kiteve, Madanda and Manyika ceased paying tribute. At the same time, a new kingdom under a Rozvi dynasty near Barwe was on the rise. All of this was hastened by Portugal retaining a presence on the coast and in the capital. At least one part of the 1629 treaty that was acted on was the provision allowing Portuguese settlement within Mutapa. It also allowed the praezeros to establish fortified settlements across the kingdom. In 1663, the praezeros were able to depose Mwenemutapa Siti Kazurukamusapa and put their own nominee, Kamharapasu Mukombwe on the throne.Hall, page 133  Butwa invasion  In the 17th century, a low ranking Mutapa prince broke away from the Empire, invading the neighboring kingdom of Butua. The leader of this Dynasty became known as Changamire Dombo. A possible reason for the breakaway was Dombo's dissatisfaction with the levels of Portuguese interference in the Mwenemutapa Empire's governance. By the late 17th century, Changamire Dombo was actively challenging Mutapa. In 1684 his forces encountered and decisively defeated those of Mwenemutapa Kamharapasu Mukombwe just south of Mutapa's metro district at the Battle of Mahungwe. When Mukombwe died in 1692, a succession crisis erupted. The Portuguese backed one successor and Dombo another. In support of his candidate, Changamire Dombo razed the Portuguese fair-town of Dembarare next to the Mutapa capital and slaughtered the Portuguese traders and their entire following. From 1692 until 1694, Mwenemutapa Nyakambira rules Mutapa independently. Nyakambira was later killed in battle with the Portuguese who then placed Nyamaende Mhande on the throne as their puppet. In 1695, Changamire Dombo overran the gold-producing kingdom of Manyika and took his army east and destroyed the Portuguese fair-town of Masikwesi. This allowed him complete control of all gold-producing territory from Butwa to Manyika, supplanting Mutapa as the premier Shona kingdom in the region.Oliver, page 209 Shifting rulers It appears neither the Rozwi nor the Portuguese could maintain control of the Mutapa state for very long, and it moved back and forth between the two throughout the 17th century. Far from a victim of conquest, the Mutapa rulers actually invited in foreign powers to bolster their rule. This included vassalage to Portuguese East Africa from 1629 to 1663 and vassalage to the Rozwi Empire from 1663 until the Portuguese return in 1694. Portuguese control of Mutapa was maintained or at least represented by an armed garrison at the capital. In 1712, yet another coveter of the throne invited the Rozwi back to put him on the throne and kick out the Portuguese. This they did, and Mutapa again came under the control of the Rozwi Empire. The new Mwenemutapa Samatambira Nyamhandu I become their vassal, while the outgoing king was forced to retreat to Chidama in what is now Mozambique. Independence and move from Zimbabwe The Rozwi quickly lost interest in Mutapa, as they sought to consolidate their position in the south. Mutapa regained its independence around 1720. By this time, the kingdom of Mutapa had lost nearly all of the Zimbabwe plateau to the Rozwi Empire. In 1723, Nyamhandi moved his capital into the valley near the Portuguese trading settlement of Tete, under Mwmenemutapa Nyatsusu. Upon his death in 1740, the young Dehwe Mapunzagutu took power. He sought Portuguese support and invited them back to Mutapa along with their garrison of armed men, but Mutapa remained independent. =Collapse= The Mwenemutapa died in 1759, sparking yet another civil war for the throne. This one was more destructive than its predecessors and Mutapa never recovered. The \\"winners\\" ended up governing an even more reduced land from Chidima. They used the title Mambo a Chidima and ruled independently of Portugal until 1917 when Mambo Chioko, the last king of the dynasty, was killed in battle against the Portuguese.  Mutapa as Ophir  The empire had another indirect side effect on the history of southern Africa. Gold from the empire inspired in Europeans a belief that Mwenemutapa held the legendary mines of King Solomon, referred to in the Bible as Ophir. The belief that the mines were inside the Mwenemutapa kingdom in southern Africa was one of the factors that led to the Portuguese exploration of the hinterland of Sofala in the 16th century, and this contributed to early development of Mozambique, as the legend was widely used among the less educated populace to recruit colonists. Some documents suggest that most of the early colonists dreamed of finding the legendary city of gold in southern Africa, a belief mirroring the early South American colonial search for El Dorado and quite possibly inspired by it. Early trade in gold came to an end as the mines ran out, and the deterioration of the Mutapa state eliminated the financial and political support for further developing sources of gold.

The incident occurred in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), with Chicago leading 3‚Äì0 and holding a three games to two lead in the best-of-seven series. Marlins batter Luis Castillo hit a fly ball into foul territory in left field. Cubs outfielder Mois√©s Alou pursued the ball and leapt near the fence in an attempt to make the catch. Along with other spectators seated against the wall, Cubs fan Steve Bartman reached for the ball, but he deflected it, disrupting Alou's potential catch. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning, and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first National League pennant since 1945. The Cubs ultimately allowed eight runs in the inning, and lost the game 8‚Äì3. When they were eliminated in Game 7 the next day, the incident was seen as the \\"first domino\\" to fall in affecting the series's outcome. In the moments following the play, Cubs fans shouted insults and threw debris at Bartman. For his safety, security was forced to escort him from the ballpark. Minutes after the game, his name and personal information were published online, necessitating police protection at his home. He faced further harassment from fans and the media after the Cubs' loss in the series, as he was scapegoated for the continuation of the team's then 95-year championship drought. Bartman apologized for the incident and stated his desire to move past it and return to a quiet life. Many Cubs players came to his defense, emphasizing that their performance was to blame for their loss. In 2011, ESPN produced a documentary film exploring the subject as part of its 30 for 30 series. Titled Catching Hell, the film drew comparisons between the Bartman incident and Bill Buckner's fielding error late in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, and explored the incident from different perspectives. Incident Fan Steve Bartman and Moises Alou both attempt to catch the foul ball hit by Luis Castillo during Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS at Wrigley Field in Chicago. At the time of the incident, Mark Prior had allowed only three hits and no runs going into the eighth inning. The Cubs led the game 3‚Äì0 and held a series lead of three games to two. They were five outs away from reaching the World Series for the first time since ; the Cubs had not been baseball's champions since . Luis Castillo was at bat for the Marlins with one out, and a full count, with teammate Juan Pierre on second base. Bartman was sitting in the front row along the left field corner wall behind the on-field bullpen when a pop foul off the bat of Castillo drifted toward his seat. Cubs left fielder Mois√©s Alou approached the wall, jumped, and reached for the ball. Bartman attempted to catch the ball, failed to secure it, and in the process deflected it away from Alou's glove. Alou slammed his glove down in frustration and shouted at several fans. The Cubs, in particular Alou and Prior, argued for fan interference, but umpire Mike Everitt ruled there was no interference because the ball had broken the plane of the wall separating the field of play from the stands and entered the stands. Cubs manager Dusty Baker did not see the play as it happened, because the curvature of the Cubs dugout blocked his view.ASAP Sports ‚Äì Marlins vs. Cubs Everitt's ruling has been heavily scrutinized over the years. For example, the authors of Mad Ball: The Bartman Play argue that photographs show Bartman's arms extending into the playing field and that Castillo should have been called out due to fan interference.Walter J. Yurkanin and R. Thomas Hoffman. Mad Ball: The Bartman Play. Networlding, 2011. . 24‚Äì25. On Fox, Thom Brennaman was commentating, saying \\"Again in the air, down the left field line. Alou... reaching into the stands... and couldn't get it and he's livid with a fan!\\" Aftermath =For the Cubs and Marlins= Following the incident, the Marlins scored eight runs: * Continuing his at bat, Castillo drew a walk. Ball four was a wild pitch from Prior, which allowed Juan Pierre, who doubled before Castillo came to bat, to advance to third base. * Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, on an 0‚Äì2 pitch, singled to drive in the first run of the inning, making the score 3‚Äì1. * Miguel Cabrera hit a ground ball to Alex Gonzalez, who misfielded the ball. Had Gonzalez fielded the ball, the Cubs could have either ended the half-inning with a double play, still ahead by two runs, or at least added the second out. Instead, all runners were safe and the bases were loaded. * Derrek Lee doubled, tying the score and chasing Prior from the game. * Relief pitcher Kyle Farnsworth issued an intentional walk to Mike Lowell, then gave up a sacrifice fly to Jeff Conine, giving Florida a 4‚Äì3 lead. Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa missed the cut-off man, allowing Lowell to move up to second base. The Cubs issued another intentional walk to Todd Hollandsworth, which again loaded the bases. * A bases-clearing double from Mike Mordecai broke the game open, making the score 7‚Äì3. * Mike Remlinger replaced Farnsworth and Pierre singled to put Florida ahead 8‚Äì3. * Finally, Luis Castillo, whose foul pop initiated the controversy, popped out to second to end the inning. The Marlins had sent twelve batters to the plate and scored eight runs. Florida won the game 8‚Äì3. The next night, back at Wrigley Field, Florida overcame Kerry Wood and a 5‚Äì3 deficit to win 9‚Äì6, and win the pennant. The Marlins went on to win the 2003 World Series, beating the New York Yankees, four games to two, but would not qualify again for the postseason until 2020. The Cubs did not win another playoff game after the incident until 2015 when they defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the wild card game, but they were swept in the NLCS by the New York Mets. =For Bartman= Bartman remained seated as Fox repeatedly broadcast live shots of him between multiple replays of the foul ball. The somber image of Bartman wearing a Cubs baseball cap, glasses, headset, and green turtleneck shirt became memorable. Because there were no replay boards or JumboTrons in Wrigley Field at the time, Bartman was not widely recognized until many of the attendees' friends and family members, who were watching the game on TV, started calling them on cell phones, informing them of Bartman and his appearance. When the Marlins scored their first run, many Cubs fans began pointing toward Bartman, repeatedly chanting \\"asshole\\". Bartman had to be led away from the park under security escort for his own safety as many Cubs fans shouted insults toward him and others threw debris, with one fan dumping a cup of beer on him. Security escorted Bartman and two people who accompanied him to the game toward the exit tunnel from the field. News footage of the game showed him surrounded by security as passersby pelted him with drinks and other debris. Bartman's name, as well as personal information about him, appeared on Major League Baseball's online message boards minutes after the game ended. As many as six police cars gathered outside his home to protect Bartman and his family following the incident. Afterwards, then-Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich suggested that Bartman join a witness protection program, while then-Florida Governor Jeb Bush offered Bartman asylum. After the incident, Bartman released a statement, saying he was \\"truly sorry\\". He added, \\"I had my eyes glued on the approaching ball the entire time and was so caught up in the moment that I did not even see Mois√©s Alou, much less that he may have had a play.\\" Trying to maintain a low profile, Bartman declined interviews, endorsement deals, and requests for public appearances, and his family changed their phone number to avoid harassing phone calls. He requested that any gifts sent to him by Florida Marlins fans be donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In July 2008, Bartman was offered $25,000 to autograph a picture of himself at the National Sports Collectors Convention in Rosemont, but he refused the offer. He declined to appear as a VIP at Wrigley Field. In 2011, eight years after the incident, he declined to appear in an ESPN documentary, and he declined a six-figure offer to appear in a Super Bowl commercial.Johnson, K.C., \\"The invisible fans\\", Chicago Tribune, September 27, 2011. Retrieved September 27, 2011. Many fans associated the Bartman incident with the Curse of the Billy Goat, allegedly laid on the Cubs during the 1945 World Series after Billy Sianis and his pet goat were ejected from Wrigley Field. The Cubs lost that series to the Detroit Tigers in seven games and did not return to the World Series until 2016. Bartman was also compared to the black cat that ran across Shea Stadium near an on-deck Ron Santo during a September 9, 1969, regular season game between the Cubs and the New York Mets. The Cubs were in first place at the time, but after the cat appeared, the Cubs lost the game and eventually fell eight games behind the Mets in the standings, missing that season's playoffs. Fans further believed that they had been jinxed when comedian Bernie Mac, singing Take Me Out to the Ballgame during the seventh-inning stretch, prematurely referred to the Cubs as \\"champs\\". On Fox, coming off a commercial break after the Marlins had tied the game, Thom Brennaman said of the incident, as well as the Marlins' subsequent rally: \\"It's safe to say that every Cubs fan has to be wondering right now, is the Curse of the Billy Goat alive and well?\\" =Destruction of the Bartman ball= The loose ball was snatched up by a Chicago lawyer and sold at an auction in December 2003. Grant DePorter purchased it for $113,824.16 on behalf of Harry Caray's Restaurant Group. On February 26, 2004, it was publicly detonated by special effects expert Michael Lantieri. In 2005, the remains of the ball were used by the restaurant in a pasta sauce. While no part of the ball itself was in the sauce, the ball was boiled and the steam captured, distilled, and added to the final concoction. Today, the remains of the ball are on display at the Chicago Sports Museum, while further remains are amid various artifacts at the restaurant itself.5 coolest artifacts at the Chicago Sports Museum Steve Bartman seat, Aisle 4, Row 8, Seat 113. =The Bartman seat= In the years following the incident, the seat Bartman sat in ‚Äì Aisle 4, Row 8, Seat 113 ‚Äì became a tourist attraction at Wrigley Field. When the lower grandstands were reconfigured before the 2017 season, that seat number was changed. It is now Section 2, Row 8, Seat 108. =Mois√©s Alou= In April 2008, Mois√©s Alou was quoted by the Associated Press as saying, \\"You know what the funny thing is? I wouldn't have caught it, anyway.\\" However, Alou later disputed that story: \\"I don't remember that,\\" he said to a writer from The Palm Beach Post. \\"If I said that, I was probably joking to make [Bartman] feel better. But I don't remember saying that.\\" Alou added, \\"It's time to forgive the guy and move on.\\" In the 2011 documentary Catching Hell, Alou states, \\"I'm convinced 100% that I had that ball in my glove.\\" Defense of Bartman After the incident, the Cubs issued the following press release: Several Cubs players publicly absolved Bartman of blame. Mark Prior said, \\"We had chances to get out of that situation. I hung an 0‚Äì2 curveball to [Ivan] Rodriguez that he hit for a single. Alex Gonzalez, who's a sure thing almost at shortstop, the ball came up on him... and things just snowballed. Everybody in the clubhouse and management knows that play is not the reason we lost the game.\\" Former Cubs pitcher Rick Sutcliffe said that the crowd's reactions to Bartman \\"crushed [him]\\". \\"Right after I saw what happened with the fan, I woke up the next morning and told my wife that if the Cubs asked me to throw out the first pitch in the World Series, I was going to take that fan out to the mound with me,\\" he said. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig also came to Bartman's defense, telling an interviewer, \\"[W]hile I understand that people felt so strongly and that their hearts were just breaking, to blame this young man, who is the most devoted Cub fan... it's just unfair. When I read his statement, it broke my heart. ... If you want to blame the Curse of the Bambino and the goat in Chicago or a series of other things, that's fine. But blaming Steve Bartman is just not right.\\" Several of Bartman's friends and family members spoke out in the days following the incident. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times, \\"He's a huge Cubs fan. I'm sure I taught him well. I taught him to catch foul balls when they come near him.\\" A neighbor added, \\"He's a good kid, a wonderful son, never in any trouble. I don't think he should be blamed at all. People reach for balls. This just happened to be a little more critical. If Florida didn't score all the runs, you wouldn't be standing here.\\" Sun-Times sports columnist Jay Mariotti wrote, \\"A fan in that situation should try his best to get out of the way, even if he isn't of the mind to see Alou approaching, as Bartman claims. Still, he's also a human being who was reacting in a tense, unusual moment. And the resulting verbal abuse and trash-hurling, followed by the Neanderthal threats and creepy reaction on the Internet, hasn't reflected well on Chicago's sports culture. As it is, everyone thinks the prototypical local fans are those mopes from the Superfans skits on Saturday Night Live.\\" In a 2011 interview on ESPN's Pardon the Interruption, Cubs President Theo Epstein expressed a desire for the team to reach out to Bartman. \\"From afar, it seems like it would be an important step. Maybe a cathartic moment that would allow people to move forward together. I'm all about having an open mind, an open heart and forgiveness. Those are good characteristics for an organization to have as well. He's a Cubs fan. That's the most important thing,\\" said Epstein. In 2012, former Cubs player Doug Glanville said, \\"[I]t was easy to look at Steve Bartman [...] But that was not the whole story by a long shot.\\" He argued that the Cubs lost the momentum of the series when Marlins ace Josh Beckett shut down the Cubs in Game 5. Glanville drew parallels between that game and Barry Zito's game- winning performance in Game 5 of the 2012 NLCS. 2016 Cubs victory in World Series During the 2016 Chicago Cubs season, Bartman received renewed media attention as the Cubs progressed through the playoffs. On Saturday, October 22, 2016, the Cubs were again at home with a 3‚Äì2 lead in Game 6 of the NLCS, similar to the 2003 NLCS game. The Cubs ended up winning that game and moved onto the 2016 World Series. After winning the pennant, many Cubs fans petitioned for the team to allow Bartman to throw out a first pitch during the 2016 World Series. However, Bartman's spokesman Frank Murtha told CNN that Bartman did not want to be in the spotlight, and that there is \\"probably a slim, none, and no chance\\" that Bartman would agree to throw out a first pitch. On November 2, 2016, the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908, ending the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat. Through Murtha, Bartman congratulated the Cubs in their World Series championship. Murtha said, \\"[Bartman] was just overjoyed that the Cubs won, as all the Cubs fans are.\\" Further, when calls were made for Bartman to be a part of the victory parade, or other similar ideas, \\"The one thing that Steve and I did talk about was if the Cubs were to win, he did not want to be a distraction to the accomplishments of the players and the organization.\\" MLB.com and ESPN have both reported that Cubs owner Tom Ricketts had expressed interest in contacting Bartman for closure \\"at the right time\\". Later on, Cubs president Theo Epstein stated that Bartman is \\"welcome to come back\\" but at his own discretion and that he should be left alone. Bartman received a championship ring from Cubs owner Tom Ricketts and the Ricketts family as a special gift on July 31, 2017. The Cubs said in a statement, \\"We hope this provides closure on an unfortunate chapter of the story that has perpetuated throughout our quest to win a long-awaited World Series. While no gesture can fully lift the public burden he has endured for more than a decade, we felt it was important Steve knows he has been and continues to be fully embraced by this organization. After all he has sacrificed, we are proud to recognize Steve Bartman with this gift today.\\" Bartman released a statement, saying \\"Although I do not consider myself worthy of such an honor, I am deeply moved and sincerely grateful to receive an official Chicago Cubs 2016 World Series Championship ring. I am fully aware of the historical significance and appreciate the symbolism the ring represents on multiple levels. My family and I will cherish it for generations. Most meaningful is the genuine outreach from the Ricketts family, on behalf of the Cubs organization and fans, signifying to me that I am welcomed back into the Cubs family and have their support going forward. I am relieved and hopeful that the saga of the 2003 foul ball incident surrounding my family and me is finally over.\\" In popular culture * The incident was portrayed in the Family Guy film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, which was aired by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox) as three separate episodes in the United States on May 21, 2006. The incident is portrayed showing the character Stewie Griffin urging Bartman to go for the ball, saying, \\"It's a foul ball, what harm could it do?\\" * In 2012, American rapper Serengeti released a song about the incident named \\"Don't Blame Steve\\". * A parody song artist named Tom Latourette, as part of an anti-Cubs album known as \\"Please Stop Believing\\", made a song called \\"Go Blame It on Steve Bartman\\", sung to the tune of \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\". Latourette also briefly mentions Bartman and the 2003 season in \\"We Will Lose 100 Games\\", which is a parody of \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\". * The incident was the basis of a fictional murder in the TV series Law & Order episode \\"Vendetta\\", the 21st episode of season 14.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it lies just to the east of the Peak District. The town is located in the steep-sided valley of the Little Don River, below the Underbank Reservoir. It blends into the areas of Deepcar, Bolsterstone and the eastern end of Ewden valley around Ewden village, which are also within the civil parish. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 13,455.  Early history  Throughout the whole of recorded history, up until the early 18th century, what is now Stocksbridge was a deciduously wooded valley which ran from Midhopestones at its northwestern extremity to Deepcar at its southeastern end. A river, originally called the Hunshelf Water but afterwards renamed the Little Don, ran through the valley. This river was also, unofficially, called the Porter, probably on account of its peaty colour. A dirt road, connecting Sheffield with Manchester, ran through the woods adjacent to the river. There were a few stone houses in the valley and a sprinkling of farms on each hillside. In 1716 John Stocks, a local farmer and landowner, occupied a fulling mill halfway along the valley where a flood plain, created by meltwater at the end of the last ice age, extended southwest from the river. Here he reputedly built a footbridge over the river, perhaps so that his workforce could reach the mill from their homes on the north side. This originally wooden structure, Stocks' Bridge, gave the place its name, not only because it was about the only thing there apart from the mill itself, but also because as a crossing place it appeared under that name on Thomas Jeffrey's map of 1772, so establishing itself as a place name. On various occasions this bridge was destroyed by flooding, and it was eventually replaced by a stone structure in 1812. In 1794 three businessmen, Jonathan Denton, Benjamin Grayson and Thomas Cannon, built a large cotton mill extremely close by, or possibly upon, the site of the original mill. The parish church of St Matthias was consecrated in 1890. Steel industry The valley bottom today is almost entirely occupied by steel works. Samuel Fox acquired the old cotton mill in 1842, at first renting it from its then owner, Joshua Newton. Nine years later, in 1851, he purchased the mill outright from Joshua's son, Thomas Newton. Fox converted the place to use as a wire mill, and built much of the infrastructure of Stocksbridge, primarily to house his new workforce and to supply their needs. The wire was initially for textile pins, but around 1848 the business expanded to include wire for umbrella frames which led to Fox developing the ‚ÄúParagon‚Äù umbrella frame in 1851. The business continued to expand, and extended into different products, but underwent a major change in direction in the early 1860s when Fox realized that he could save large amounts of money by making his own steel for the wire, rather than buying it in. Furnaces and a rolling mill were installed, which in turn allowed the production of railway lines and springs. The business was incorporated into a limited company in 1871. Between 1872 and 1877 a railway line was built to link the works with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Deepcar. This was the Stocksbridge Railway, which existed as a subsidiary company until 1992. Buildings of Samuel Fox's works. The large structure in the background is the original cotton mill. Samuel Fox & Co joined Steel, Peech and Tozer at Templeborough to form the United Steel Companies (USC) following the First World War. From then on the products of the USC sites were coordinated so that each works specialised in set products. Fox‚Äôs specialised in special steel produce such as spring steel and stainless steels. This developed into the manufacture of high-quality steel for the aviation industry. One specialised department assembled and tested springs for Rolls-Royce cars. During the Second World War, 'Sammy Fox's' Steelworks was kept busy as part of the war effort. During the Sheffield Blitz by the Luftwaffe, the bombers used the dam at the end of Stocksbridge as a turning point for their run back toward Sheffield. Following nationalisation in 1967, the British Steel Corporation split the stainless steel departments off into a separate business which by 2004 had become part of Outokumpu. During the 1980s and 1990s the Stocksbridge works was part of the United Engineering Steels group (a joint venture between British Steel and GKN) and was known as \\"Stocksbridge Engineering Steels\\". In 1999 the works were taken over by Corus and are part of the Corus Engineering Steels (CES) group. Although for several years Corus ran at a loss, it returned to profit, in part helped by a rise in demand for steel caused by Chinese economic activity. Steel manufacture in Stocksbridge had always been by melting iron and steel firstly in crucibles (from 1860), then Bessemer converters (from 1862) and Siemens Open Hearth Furnaces (from 1899 until 1968) and lastly Electric arc furnaces (from 1939 until 2005). Iron has never been produced from iron ore at Fox's, by any method. In October 2006, Corus was taken over by the Indian company Tata. Corus Engineering Steels (Stocksbridge site) was renamed Tata Steels Speciality. During the 2008 recession Stocksbridge works reduced its workforce and output, focusing on producing lower quantities of high-value product for the aerospace and oil and gas markets. After the recession the company returned to profitability and began investing once again. In 2011 ¬£6.5 million was invested in boosting the site's ability to produce aerospace steel, and further developments were planned for 2013. However in December 2015 Tata came under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the alleged falsification of certificates guaranteeing the quality of its speciality steels. This was then followed in early 2016 by an announcement from Tata that they would be selling their entire steelmaking interests in the UK, due, they said, to crippling electricity prices in the UK which are more than double the price in the European Union and in other competing countries, and to large volumes of cheap steel which are being exported to the west by China. If a buyer could not be found, then steelmaking in the Stocksbridge valley would finally end, after almost 160 years. However on 9 February 2017 it was announced by Tata and by the Liberty House Group, that the latter had purchased Tata's entire UK steelmaking operation for GBP 100 million. This has secured the continuation of steelmaking in the Stocksbridge valley.  Transport  The main road from Sheffield to Manchester originally passed through the town until the A616 Stocksbridge bypass opened in 1989. The new road links the M1 motorway at Junction 35A (and J36) to the A628 (which is one of the main trans-Pennine routes from Sheffield to Manchester) bypassing the towns of Stocksbridge and Deepcar, diverting the steelworks traffic away from passing through the town. Stocksbridge has multiple bus services that connect the town to Sheffield City Centre, Middlewood tram stop and Barnsley Interchange. The SL1/SL1A (operated by Stagecoach Yorkshire) is an every 12 minute service, connecting with the Sheffield Supertram service to the centre of Sheffield or Hillsborough. Service 57 (operated by Stagecoach Yorkshire) runs hourly (every 30 minutes at peak times) from the far end of Stocksbridge, Unsliven Bridge, all the way into Sheffield City Centre. Service 201 (operated by Powell's Bus) runs hourly connecting Stocksbridge to Chapeltown. Service 23/23a (Stagecoach) connects Stocksbridge to Millhouse Green hourly, and Barnsley twice a day.  Culture  The British Steel Stocksbridge Band [sic] is credited with a tune called \\"Slaidburn\\" (1994) in the trailer of the 1997 film The Full Monty. Stocksbridge Engineering Steels Brass Band has since been renamed to Unite the Union Band and moved rehearsals to central Sheffield. Deepcar Brass Band remains locally. Nearby Bolsterstone is home to a well- known male voice choir led by male vocalist Alan Rodgers, particularly noted for its performances of Sheffield local carols. Stocksbridge has a strong amateur theatre group called Steel Valley Beacon which produces Shakespeare and other plays every year. Mathcore band Rolo Tomassi were formed and are still based in Stocksbridge. Sport The town's local football club is Stocksbridge Park Steels was founded in 1986, following the merger of Stocksbridge Works and Oxley Park FC. The home ground of Stocksbridge Park Steels is Bracken Moor, located near the top of the valley. They play in the Northern Premier League Division One South and also organise many youth teams, from the age of 8 to 18.

The village lies just within the Peak District National Park, inside the park's north-eastern border, is at an altitude of 260 metres (850 feet) AOD and has extensive views across Bradfield Dale towards Derwent Edge and the Dark Peak. The most striking feature of the village is the medieval Church of St. Nicholas, Bradfield. It is one of only five Grade One Listed buildings in Sheffield. The name Bradfield simply failed to shift during the Great Vowel Shift from Old English to Broadfield, a name with a double emphasis on its broad stretch of open countryside.Local place names Bradfield and beyond.

High Bradfield has a sister village, Low Bradfield which lies less than to the south west but at a considerably lower altitude down in the upper Loxley valley. The two villages are linked by the steep Woodfall Lane. High Bradfield is in the civil parish of Bradfield, the largest in England, and in the electoral area of Stannington. History Bailey Hill is the site of a Norman Motte-and-bailey castle. High Bradfield, which was formerly known as kirkton, is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, but it may have been one of the 16 hamlets recorded in the manor of Hallam. On the northwest edge of the village, close to the church, is Bailey Hill, an approximately high man-made conical mound that is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The date and purpose of its construction are unknown, though it has been interpreted as a Saxon fort, a Norman Motte-and-bailey castle, or a place of public village assembly. (wikisource) The late David Hey said there was no doubt that Bailey Hill is a motte-and-bailey castle calling it \\"One of the best preserved and most dramatic motte-and-baileys in Yorkshire.\\" Excavations from 1720 revealed squared stones that had been produced by using tools. The eastern and southern flanks of the bailey are enclosed by a 95 metre long curving earthwork while to the west it is protected by steep slopes.\\"The Making Of South Yorkshire\\", David Hey, Page 43 Gives details of Bailey Hill motte-and-bailey and says Castle Hill may have been look out post.

The Enclosure Act of the early 19th century altered the appearance of the countryside around High Bradfield as the profusion of stones in the soil resulted in many small fields in the area. Around the same time many people in the Bradfield area were influenced by the Industrial Revolution and moved to nearby Sheffield to improve their standard of living.A brief guide to Bradfield ..

The Bradfield Parish workhouse was based in High Bradfield between 1759 and 1847; the building is still there today, standing across the road from the Old Horns pub on Towngate. The building was converted into private houses in the 1870s. Thousands of documents relating to the workhouse were found in a hidden cupboard in one of the houses in the 1950s; these are now in the Bradfield Parish Archives. On Jane Street is the Grade II listed building known as the Old Post Office, built from gritstone with a slate roof in 1835. It was originally an inn called Heaven House or Heaven's Gate and later The Cross Daggers.

The band formed in 1976 in Cambridge, England as Dennis and the Experts comprising Robyn Hitchcock (guitar), Rob Lamb (half-brother of radio host and author Charlie Gillett) guitar, Andy Metcalfe (bass), and Morris Windsor (drums). Alan Davies replaced Lamb after only four gigs late in 1976, and Kimberley Rew eventually replaced Davies. Matthew Seligman replaced Metcalfe in 1979. The band broke up in 1981 after Underwater Moonlight. Rew formed the more mainstream pop group Katrina and the Waves, while Hitchcock went on to a prolific career with a similar whimsical, surrealistic style. They briefly re-formed for a UK tour in 1994 and then again in 2001 for the 20th anniversary of Underwater Moonlight and the release of a new album, Nextdoorland, in 2002. They disbanded once again in 2003. Seligman died in 2020 of complications from COVID-19.

Woodfall Lane can be seen climbing to High Bradfield at the top of the picture Low Bradfield is a village within the civil parish of Bradfield in South Yorkshire, England. It is situated within the boundary of the city of Sheffield in the upper part of the Loxley Valley, 6¬º miles west-northwest of the city centre and just inside the northeast boundary of the Peak District National Park. Low Bradfield and the surrounding area is noted for its attractive countryside which draws many visitors from the more urban parts of Sheffield. At weekends the village can become quite crowded, especially when there is a match on the village cricket pitch. Low Bradfield which stands in the shadow of Agden Reservoir has a sister village High Bradfield which is located at a higher altitude, ¬Ω mile to the northeast. The two villages are joined by the steep Woodfall Lane. History =Early history= The Bar Dike, nearly 2 miles northwest of Low Bradfield is a Dark Ages tribal boundary. The earliest historical sign of settlement in the Bradfield area is an early to mid Bronze Age ring cairn on Broomhead Moors, three miles to the northwest of Low Bradfield. This is believed to be a ritual or burial site from over 4,000 years ago. On the ridge between Bradfield Dale and the Ewden Valley is the Bar Dike, a 492 yards long trench with a rampart on its southern side which is 10 feet high in places. The dike is believed to have marked the boundary between different Dark Ages tribes in the period following the withdrawal of The Romans from Britain.\\"The Making Of South Yorkshire\\", David Hey, Page 23, Gives details of Bar Dike. =Anglo-Saxon cross= The 10th century Saxon cross is now in the nave of St. Nicholas church, High . There is evidence of Anglo-Saxon settlement within the Low Bradfield area with the discovery in 1870 of an Anglo-Saxon cross in a field near the site of the former Cross Inn not far from the village centre. It has been examined by Sheffield University's Phil Sidebottom who has compared it to similar crosses found in Staffordshire that were put up in the middle of the 10th century. He says the cross‚Äôs hammer head design confirms that it dates to just before the Norman conquest. The cross can now be seen in the nave of St. Nicholas' Church at High Bradfield.\\"Medieval South Yorkshire\\", David Hey, Page 47 Gives details of Saxon cross and other medieval history. =Norman development= While Bradfied is not documented in the Domesday Book it is inconceivable that it was not settled at that time and it is believed to be one of 16 unnamed Berewicks (an outlying part of a large manor) within Hallamshire that are mentioned. The hamlet of Low Bradfield grew up around the manorial corn mill which was established on the banks of the River Loxley in the shadow of the local church and castle at High Bradfield. The village developed as a farming community with much of the surrounding countryside set aside by the Norman lords as a deer hunting park. The Howard family showed little interest in hunting and the deer were finally removed from the park in the 16th century.\\"Historic Hallamshire\\", David Hey, , Gives history. =Great Sheffield Flood= Low Bradfield was the first populated place to be flooded by the Great Sheffield Flood when the Dale Dyke Dam broke on 11 March 1864. The original dam wall stood almost one mile west of the village. There was only one fatality in the village mainly because word had spread throughout the immediate area that there was a leak in the earth embankment and the community was partly prepared for the tragedy. The only death was a one-day-old infant, the child of a local couple (Mr. and Mrs. Dawson); despite this the village was extensively damaged.Mick Armitage‚Äòs Sheffield Flood website. Gives details of flood. Two stone bridges were swept away, as was the corn mill, blacksmith‚Äôs shop, schoolroom, schoolmaster's house and a farmhouse.

Gives further details of flood. Present day Looking across the Ibbotson Memorial Field with the village hall to the left. The Old Wesley Chapel now house the offices of Bradfield Parish Council. Low Bradfield continues its tradition as a farming community into the present day. Cross Farm, Nether Farm and Fair House Farm are situated close to the centre of the village. Fair House is a grade II* listed building and is one of the oldest structures in the area dating from the 1630s and was originally called Swinden House. Nether Farm is Grade II listed and dates from the 1820s. There are several other farms in the outlying areas. One of the great attractions to people from outside the village is the large centrally located recreation ground known as the Ibbotson Memorial Field which is a popular site for picnics and family visits and also serves as the village cricket ground, drawing large crowds to games on summer weekends. The field was named after the Ibbotson family who have lived in Low Bradfield for several centuries. The local tennis and bowls clubs also have facilities at the field. There are several other notable buildings in the village. The former Wesleyan chapel on Mill Lee Road was built in 1817 and now serves as the offices for Bradfield Parish Council. Just across the road is another former Wesleyan chapel which was built in 1899 to replace its counterpart. It closed in 1993 and was sold for residential use. Also on Mill Lee Road are the former water board filter houses which filtered water from the Agden, Dale Dike and Strines reservoirs in Bradfield Dale. The filter houses were built in 1913 and extended in 1953 before being closed in 1995 when a new water treatment works was opened in the Loxley Valley. The buildings are derelict and unused at present. The Bradfield village hall, situated on the Memorial Field was completely rebuilt recently and re-opened in 2006. There is just one public house in the village, the Plough. There was a second pub called the Cross Inn which was situated at the foot of Woodfall Lane but this closed in the late 1970s and is now a private house. Just across the road is the village shop which is also the local post office. The former Low Bradfield School is now a private residence which was built in 1867 to replace a school that was washed away in the flood of 1864 in a different part of the village. The school closed in 1985 with its pupils being transferred to nearby Dungworth School.Bradfield Parish Council.

The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the village. =Bradfield Dale= The area to the west of the village is a rural area known as Bradfield Dale and contains the three reservoirs of Agden, Dale Dike and Strines which were constructed in the 1860s. The many construction workers who came into the dale prompted the Haychatter Farm to open a public house on its premises known as the Reservoir Inn and then the Haychatter which remained open until 2003. The dale contains Sugworth Hall which dates from a least the 16th century although the building has been much changed since then. Eminent families who have lived there include the Hooles and the Boots. Charles Boot built a folly tower overlooking Strines Reservoir in 1927 known as Boot's Folly, it is a prominent landmark for miles around. Another ancient residence in the dale is Hallfield House which dates from the Elizabethan era and was the seat of the Greaveses, a very old Hallamshire family. The dale also includes the Strines Inn public house.\\"A Look at Life in Bradfield Dale and the Surrounding Area\\", Joe Castle, Gives details of Bradfield Dale.

Definition The Schnirelmann density of a set of natural numbers A is defined as :\\\\sigma A = \\\\inf_n \\\\frac{A(n)}{n}, where A(n) denotes the number of elements of A not exceeding n and inf is infimum.Nathanson (1996) pp.191‚Äì192 The Schnirelmann density is well-defined even if the limit of A(n)/n as fails to exist (see upper and lower asymptotic density). Properties By definition, and for all n, and therefore , and if and only if . Furthermore, : \\\\sigma A=0 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\forall \\\\epsilon>0\\\\ \\\\exists n\\\\ A(n) < \\\\epsilon n. =Sensitivity= The Schnirelmann density is sensitive to the first values of a set: : \\\\forall k \\\\ k otin A \\\\Rightarrow \\\\sigma A \\\\le 1-1/k. In particular, :1 otin A \\\\Rightarrow \\\\sigma A = 0 and :2 otin A \\\\Rightarrow \\\\sigma A \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{2}. Consequently, the Schnirelmann densities of the even numbers and the odd numbers, which one might expect to agree, are 0 and 1/2 respectively. Schnirelmann and Yuri Linnik exploited this sensitivity as we shall see. Schnirelmann's theorems If we set \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 = \\\\\\\\{k^2\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^{\\\\infty}, then Lagrange's four-square theorem can be restated as \\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{G}^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{G}^2) = 1. (Here the symbol A\\\\oplus B denotes the sumset of A\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and B\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}.) It is clear that \\\\sigma \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 = 0. In fact, we still have \\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{G}^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{G}^2) = 0, and one might ask at what point the sumset attains Schnirelmann density 1 and how does it increase. It actually is the case that \\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{G}^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{G}^2) = 5/6 and one sees that sumsetting \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 once again yields a more populous set, namely all of \\\\N. Schnirelmann further succeeded in developing these ideas into the following theorems, aiming towards Additive Number Theory, and proving them to be a novel resource (if not greatly powerful) to attack important problems, such as Waring's problem and Goldbach's conjecture. > Theorem. Let A and B be subsets of \\\\N. Then \\\\sigma(A \\\\oplus B) \\\\ge \\\\sigma A > + \\\\sigma B - \\\\sigma A \\\\cdot \\\\sigma B. Note that \\\\sigma A + \\\\sigma B - \\\\sigma A \\\\cdot \\\\sigma B = 1 - (1 - \\\\sigma A)(1 - \\\\sigma B). Inductively, we have the following generalization. > Corollary. Let A_i \\\\subseteq \\\\N be a finite family of subsets of \\\\N. Then > \\\\sigma(\\\\bigoplus_i A_i) \\\\ge 1 - \\\\prod_{i}(1 - \\\\sigma A_i). The theorem provides the first insights on how sumsets accumulate. It seems unfortunate that its conclusion stops short of showing \\\\sigma being superadditive. Yet, Schnirelmann provided us with the following results, which sufficed for most of his purpose. > Theorem. Let A and B be subsets of \\\\N. If \\\\sigma A + \\\\sigma B \\\\ge 1, then A > \\\\oplus B = \\\\N. > Theorem. (Schnirelmann) Let A \\\\subseteq \\\\N. If \\\\sigma A > 0 then there > exists k such that \\\\bigoplus^k_{i=1} A=\\\\N. Additive bases A subset A \\\\subseteq \\\\N with the property that A \\\\oplus A \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus A = \\\\N for a finite sum, is called an additive basis, and the least number of summands required is called the degree (sometimes order) of the basis. Thus, the last theorem states that any set with positive Schnirelmann density is an additive basis. In this terminology, the set of squares \\\\mathfrak{G}^2 = \\\\\\\\{k^2\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} is an additive basis of degree 4. (About an open problem for additive bases, see Erd≈ës‚ÄìTur√°n conjecture on additive bases.) Mann's theorem Historically the theorems above were pointers to the following result, at one time known as the \\\\alpha + \\\\beta hypothesis. It was used by Edmund Landau and was finally proved by Henry Mann in 1942. > Theorem. Let A and B be subsets of \\\\N. In case that A \\\\oplus B e \\\\N, we > still have \\\\sigma(A \\\\oplus B) \\\\ge \\\\sigma A + \\\\sigma B. An analogue of this theorem for lower asymptotic density was obtained by Kneser.Nathanson (1990) p.397 At a later date, E. Artin and P. Scherk simplified the proof of Mann's theorem.E. Artin and P. Scherk (1943) On the sums of two sets of integers, Ann. of Math 44, page=138-142. Waring's problem Let k and N be natural numbers. Let \\\\mathfrak{G}^k = \\\\\\\\{i^k\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^\\\\infty. Define r_N^k(n) to be the number of non-negative integral solutions to the equation : x_1^k + x_2^k + \\\\cdots + x_N^k = n and R_N^k(n) to be the number of non-negative integral solutions to the inequality : 0 \\\\le x_1^k + x_2^k + \\\\cdots + x_N^k \\\\le n, in the variables x_i, respectively. Thus R_N^k(n) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n r_N^k(i). We have * r_N^k(n)>0 \\\\leftrightarrow n \\\\in N\\\\mathfrak{G}^k, * R_N^k(n) \\\\ge \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{N}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{N}{k}}. The volume of the N-dimensional body defined by 0 \\\\le x_1^k + x_2^k + \\\\cdots + x_N^k \\\\le n, is bounded by the volume of the hypercube of size n^{1/k}, hence R_N^k(n) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n r_N^k(i) \\\\leq n^{N/k}. The hard part is to show that this bound still works on the average, i.e., > Lemma. (Linnik) For all k \\\\in \\\\N there exists N \\\\in \\\\N and a constant c = > c(k), depending only on k, such that for all n \\\\in \\\\N, r_N^k(m) < > cn^{\\\\frac{N}{k}-1} for all 0 \\\\le m \\\\le n. With this at hand, the following theorem can be elegantly proved. > Theorem. For all k there exists N for which \\\\sigma(N\\\\mathfrak{G}^k) > 0. We have thus established the general solution to Waring's Problem: > Corollary. For all k there exists N, depending only on k, such that every > positive integer n can be expressed as the sum of at most N many k-th > powers. Schnirelmann's constant In 1930 Schnirelmann used these ideas in conjunction with the Brun sieve to prove Schnirelmann's theorem, that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than C prime numbers, where C is an effectively computable constant:Nathanson (1996) p.208 Schnirelmann obtained C < 800000.Gelfond & Linnik (1966) p.136 Schnirelmann's constant is the lowest number C with this property. Olivier Ramar√© showed in that Schnirelmann's constant is at most 7, improving the earlier upper bound of 19 obtained by Hans Riesel and R. C. Vaughan. Schnirelmann's constant is at least 3; Goldbach's conjecture implies that this is the constant's actual value. In 2013, Harald Helfgott proved Goldbach's weak conjecture for all odd numbers. Therefore Schnirelmann's constant is at most 4. Essential components Khintchin proved that the sequence of squares, though of zero Schnirelmann density, when added to a sequence of Schnirelmann density between 0 and 1, increases the density: : \\\\sigma(A+\\\\mathfrak{G}^2)>\\\\sigma(A)\\\\text{ for }0<\\\\sigma(A)<1. This was soon simplified and extended by Erd≈ës, who showed, that if A is any sequence with Schnirelmann density Œ± and B is an additive basis of order k then : \\\\sigma(A+B)\\\\geq \\\\alpha+ \\\\frac{\\\\alpha(1-\\\\alpha)}{2k}\\\\,,Ruzsa (2009) p.177 and this was improved by Pl√ºnnecke to :\\\\sigma(A+B)\\\\geq \\\\alpha^{1-\\\\frac{1}{k}}\\\\ . Ruzsa (2009) p.179 Sequences with this property, of increasing density less than one by addition, were named essential components by Khintchin. Linnik showed that an essential component need not be an additive basis as he constructed an essential component that has xo(1) elements less than x. More precisely, the sequence has : e^{(\\\\log x)^c} elements less than x for some c < 1\\\\. This was improved by E. Wirsing to : e^{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log x}\\\\log\\\\log x}. For a while, it remained an open problem how many elements an essential component must have. Finally, Ruzsa determined that an essential component has at least (log x)c elements up to x, for some c > 1, and for every c > 1 there is an essential component which has at most (log x)c elements up to x.Ruzsa (2009) p.184 References    Has a proof of Mann's theorem and the Schnirelmann-density proof of Waring's conjecture.

Originally a parish church, it was elevated to cathedral status when the diocese was created in 1914. Sheffield Cathedral is one of five Grade I listed buildings in the city, along with the Town Hall, Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet, and the parish churches at Ecclesfield and Bradfield. The cathedral is located on Church Street in the city centre, close to the head of Fargate. Construction of the earliest section of the cathedral dates back to c. 1200, with the newest construction completed in 1966; the building is an unusual mixture of medieval and modern architecture. Cathedral tram stop, located outside the front churchyard, opened in 1994 and is today served by all four lines of the Sheffield Supertram network. Most recently, the cathedral underwent an interior and exterior refurbishment in 2013‚Äì2014. Sheffield Cathedral was damaged in a fire on 14 May 2020, an investigation into which is ongoing; a 40-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with arson. The fire destroyed a portion of the cathedral used by a homelessness charity. A previous fire caused damage to the cathedral belltower in 1979. History The Shrewsbury Chapel The site of the cathedral has a long history of Christian use. The shaft of the 9th-century Sheffield Cross, believed to have formerly been sited here, is now held by the British Museum. It is probable that Sheffield's parish church, a satellite of Worksop Priory, was constructed here in the 12th century by William de Lovetot at the opposite end of the town to Sheffield Castle. This established the area of the parish of Sheffield, unchanged until the 19th century. This church was burnt down in 1266 during the Second Barons' War against King Henry III. Another parish church was completed in 1280, but this church was mostly demolished and rebuilt about 1430 on a cruciform floor plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was added in the next century, and a vestry chapel (now the Chapel of Saint Katherine) was added in 1777. The north and south walls of the nave were rebuilt in 1790‚Äì93 and a major restoration by Flockton & Gibbs, which included the addition of new north and south transepts, was completed in 1880. The church was originally dedicated to Saint Peter, but from some time after the reformation into the 19th century it was dedicated to Holy Trinity; it has since been dedicated to both Saint Peter and Saint Paul. The parish of Sheffield was subdivided into smaller parishes in 1848. The church is still the parish church for the smaller Parish of Sheffield, but in 1914 it was also made the cathedral church for the newly created Diocese of Sheffield. Plans were drafted by Charles Nicholson to extend the church and reorient it on its axis, but due to World War II these were greatly scaled down. The resulting additions leave the church an awkward shape in plan, but with an impressive south elevation. = 1979 fire = During the early hours of 17 July 1979, a major fire broke out in the belltower of Sheffield Cathedral. The fire began inside the belfry, and subsequently spread down the tower to the ground floor and upwards to the clockroom. At least 35 firefighters from Division Street fire station tackled the fire, narrowly preventing the destruction of the cathedral spire and containing the lower portion of the fire to the belltower and surrounding structures. Thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused by the fire, which destroyed several of the cathedral's bells (including one dating to the 16th century) and much of the clock mechanism. Additionally, burst water pipes caused flooding of the choir stalls, adding to the damage. In the Ringing Room, fire damage was severe, with all records of the cathedral's bellringers dating back 600 years completely destroyed. Despite severe damage to the contents of the belltower, the structure of the cathedral ultimately suffered only mild damage and the building was never in danger of collapse. The cathedral was back operational by 26 July 1979 at the latest, according to photographs showing the ringing of the remaining bells on this date. Following police investigation of two phone calls made to the Sheffield Star newspaper the previous evening, warning that the cathedral was being set on fire, the cause of the fire was determined to be arson, although no perpetrator was ever found. = 2015 Royal Maundy = On Thursday 2 April 2015, the Royal Maundy service was held inside Sheffield Cathedral. As is tradition, The Queen (aged 89 at the time) distributed specially-minted Maundy money to 89 men and 89 women from the Sheffield area of state pension age or above. Recipients were handed two leather pouches, containing Maundy money equivalent in value to 89 pence. It was the first time the Royal Maundy service had ever been carried out in South Yorkshire. More than 12,000 people travelled to Sheffield to witness the service. = 2020 fire = A fire broke out at Sheffield Cathedral during the evening of 14 May 2020; emergency services were called to the cathedral around 18:00 BST after smoke was spotted coming from the side of the cathedral facing Campo Lane. The fire was attended by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue crews from Sheffield Central fire station on Eyre Street, and extinguished by around 21:40 the same evening. The cathedral was empty at the time, and there were no injuries. A joint investigation between the police and fire service is underway, with the cause of the fire believed to be arson after a smashed window was found around the rear of the cathedral. The fire caused damage to the interior of the cathedral. Smoke damage affected the entire structure, including the many stained glass windows. The fire is believed to have been started deliberately in a pile of clothes that had been donated to the Cathedral Archer Project, a homelessness charity which occupies part of the cathedral site. The fire destroyed the entire contents of the rooms used by the charity, but was prevented from spreading to other parts of the cathedral. South Yorkshire Police later arrested a 40-year-old woman in connection with the cathedral fire, charging her with arson with reckless endangerment, burglary and assault of an emergency worker. The woman is accused of spitting at two police officers as they arrested her, which was treated with added severity in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The Cathedral Archer Project charity temporarily reduced operations in the aftermath of the fire, as much of their donated stock had been destroyed; increased donations from the public after the fire later allowed them to continue working from a temporary base. Prior to the fire, the charity had been distributing around 180 free meals to homeless people in Sheffield city centre every day, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Art and architecture The lantern tower Screen of bayonets and swords in St George's Chapel The east end of the current church is the oldest. In the east wall of the sanctuary there are stones from the 13th-century church. Dating from the 15th century are the sanctuary and chancel. The 15th-century cruciform church also included lofts and a rood chapel but these were ordered to be removed by Elizabeth I. Their scars can be seen on the walls. The chancel roof likely dates to the 16th century and is a hammerbeam roof with gilded angels. The outstretched wings are a modern gift from the 1960s by George Bailey. In the 1770s, rebuilding included the addition of tracery into the windows and a resurfacing of the walls with moorstone. The addition of the vestry chapel of St Katherine destroyed the cruciform shape of the plan. The Shrewsbury Chapel was constructed in order to house the Tudor monuments of the Earls of Shrewsbury. The altarpiece in this chapel is considered medieval in date. On the south wall of the Shrewsbury Chapel is the alabaster monument to George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury with its architectural surround, armoured effigy, and Latin inscription. Several members of the family are buried in the vault. The monument on the left towards the sanctuary is to George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury. It is made of fine marble, carved in an Italian style to depict the Earl and his two wives in positions of prayer. They are both fine examples of Tudor monuments. The east window is a monument to James Montgomery. Sheffield Parish Church in 1819 Sheffield Cathedral nave in 2019 In the 1880s further reconstruction and rebuilding removed the galleries, moved the organ to the north transept to clear the chancel, and installed new oak pews. The north and south transepts and west end were extended. A screen was constructed by local craftsmen for the Shrewsbury Chapel but was modified and moved to the north aisle in the 1900s. During later restoration work in 2013, it was discovered that a number of the Shrewsbury coffins were missing from the crypt. Charles Nicholson's design in the 1900s called for a radical realignment of the church axis by 90 degrees. However, funds and World Wars forced the designs to change. Those changes were implemented throughout the 20th century. The bulk of the changes have affected the northern part of the cathedral, which was extensively expanded. Immediately to the north of the nave is the chapel of Saint George, which commemorates the York and Lancaster Regiment. It is furnished with regiment flags and a screen made up of the bayonets and swords of the first regiment. Under the chapel of St George is the vaulted crypt chapel of All Saints and the Te Deum window, which was designed by Christopher Webb. At the furthest north end is the Chapel of the Holy Spirit with a four-part vaulting system and a beautifully painted screen. The main entrance of the church is at the expanded west end, added in 1966 when the church was rededicated. The baptism font is at this end. The lantern tower was an earlier addition to improve light but its glass was replaced by an abstract design designed by Amber Hiscott in 1998‚Äì99. In September 2010 it was announced that the cathedral would be applying for a ¬£980,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to fund a ¬£1.25 million scheme to make the building more attractive to visitors.

The choir contained around 40 members, and was composed of adult lay clerks and choral scholars and girl and boy choristers from various local schools. The Chapter stated the closure was to enable the creation of 'a Music Department and Choir ready for the exciting future of the mixed urban community in which we live and work.' and that the Chapter is 'committed to retaining the distinctive choral life of an Anglican cathedral, drawing fully on our long heritage of music-making.' The closure was received negatively by the national media. =Organ= The pipe organ by N. P. Mander Ltd was decommissioned in 1998 with a view to a long-term replacement with another pipe organ. This had not occurred by 2020, when a digital organ by Phoenix Organs was being used. In 2008 negotiations were undertaken with Warrington Borough Council to purchase their Cavaill√©- Coll organ from the Parr Hall, but these failed in 2011.

Change ringing As of 2017, The cathedral has 12 bells hung for change ringing, including a flat sixth bell and an Extra Treble. The bells are rung regularly for practice on Thursday and for Sunday services, in the morning and the evening. Also hanging in the cathedral is the stainless steel ship's bell from .  Cathedral Archer Project  The Cathedral Archer Project is a homelessness charity which operates from rooms around the rear of the cathedral, with a separate entrance from Campo Lane. The charity was founded in 1989, following a decade of economic decline and rising homelessness in Sheffield following the collapse of the local steelworks and coal-mining industries. In 2007, the charity moved into the refurbished rooms to the rear of the cathedral that they occupy today; the rooms include shower and laundry facilities, computer access, lounge areas and a full kitchen for the use of Sheffield's homeless. In 2013, the charity received Investing in Volunteers status. The Archer Project was the official charity of the Sheffield Eagles rugby league side for the 2018 season. The charity has also worked closely with schools, including a formal fundraising partnership with Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School's sixth form college. The rooms used by the Archer Project at Sheffield Cathedral were destroyed by fire in an arson attack on 14 May 2020. The charity had previously been distributing 180 free meals per day to the city's homeless amid the COVID-19 pandemic. More than ¬£22,000 was raised for the charity within 24 hours of the fire, including a ¬£1,000 donation from Sheffield Wednesday football club. Access Sheffield Cathedral has its own stop on the Sheffield Supertram network called Cathedral. Located in front of the cathedral at the edge of the churchyard, it is one of three city centre tram stops served by all four lines, and as such can be accessed from any other stop on the network. The tram stop was opened on 17 February 1995. Tram-train services between Cathedral and Rotherham Parkgate commenced on 25 October 2018. Beyond the tram platforms is Church Street, which since the construction of the tram network now runs westbound only from High Street to West Street. There are two bus stops on Church Street, serving local bus services 7a, 30/30a, 51 and 52/52a as of May 2020. There is no on-street parking on the streets directly surrounding the cathedral; the nearest car park is located on Campo Lane a short walk away, operated by National Car Parks.

However, it is popularly used to mean any long-term clandestine spy or informant within an organization, government or private. In police work, a mole is an undercover law-enforcement agent who joins an organization in order to collect incriminating evidence about its operations and so bring its members to justice. The term was introduced to the public by British spy novelist John Le Carr√© in his 1974 novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and has since entered general usage, but its origin is unclear, as well as to what extent it was used by intelligence services before it became popularized. Le Carr√©, a former British intelligence officer, has said that the term mole was actually used by the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, and that a corresponding term used by Western intelligence services was sleeper agent. While the term mole had been applied to spies in the book Historie of the Reign of King Henry VII written in 1626 by Sir Francis Bacon, Le Carr√© has said he did not get the term from that source. Overview A mole may be recruited early in life, and take decades to get a job in government service and reach a position of access to secret information before becoming active as a spy. Perhaps the most famous examples of moles were the Cambridge Five, five upper-class British men recruited by the KGB as communist students at Cambridge University in the 1930s who later rose to high levels in various parts of the British government. By contrast, most espionage agents, such as CIA Director of Counterintelligence Aldrich Ames and FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied on the US government for the KGB, were either recruited or offer their services as spies after they were in place as members of the target organization. Because their recruitment occurred in the remote past, moles are difficult for a nation's security services to detect. The possibility that a top politician, corporate executive, government minister, or officer in an intelligence service could be a mole working for a foreign government is the worst nightmare of counterintelligence services. For example, James Angleton, director of counterintelligence for the CIA between 1954 and 1975, was reportedly obsessed with suspicions that the top levels of Western governments were riddled with long-term communist agents and accused numerous politicians such as former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Canadian Prime Ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau, former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and many members of Congress before he was removed in 1975. Fears of such moles in prominent positions in American life led to overreactions such as McCarthyism. Moles have been featured in numerous espionage films, television shows, and novels. Reasons for use The most common procedure used by intelligence services to recruit agents is to find the location within the foreign government or organization of the information they want (the target), find out which people have access to it, and attempt to recruit one of them as a spy (espionage agent) to obtain the information. However, the people with access to top secret government information, who are government employees with high security clearances, are carefully monitored by the government's security apparatus for just that sort of espionage approach. Thus, it is difficult for a representative of the foreign intelligence service to meet with them clandestinely to recruit them. Private organizations, such as large corporations or terrorist groups, have similar security monitors. In addition, the security clearance process weeds out employees who are openly disgruntled, ideologically disaffected, or otherwise having motives for betraying their country, so people in such positions are likely to reject recruitment as spies. Therefore, some intelligence services have tried to reverse the above process by first recruiting potential agents and then having them conceal their allegiance and pursue careers in the target government agency in the hope that they can reach positions of access to desired information. Because the spy career of a mole is so long-term, sometimes occupying most of a lifetime, those who become moles must be highly motivated. One common motivation is ideology (political convictions). During the Cold War, a major source of moles in Western countries was so-called fellow travellers, Westerners who, in their youth during the 1920s to 1940s, became disaffected with their own governments and sympathetic to world communism without actually joining a communist party.

The Secret Policeman's Ball shows are credited by many prominent entertainers with having galvanised them to become involved with Amnesty and other social and political causes in succeeding years.Secret Policeman's Ball recruits New York's finest to Amnesty celebration. The Guardian. Retrieved 21 August 2019 Co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese, campaigner Peter Luff (Assistant Director Amnesty International 1974‚Äì1978), and entertainment industry executive Martin Lewis, there have been four distinct eras of the Amnesty benefit shows. The shows of the first era (1976‚Äì1981), featuring five members of Monty Python and newcomers such as Rowan Atkinson, yielded films, television specials, home- videos, and albums that have since been widely seen and heard internationally. The three subsequent eras (1987‚Äì1989, 1991‚Äì2001 and 2006 onwards) have primarily featured locally popular British performers ‚Äì and spin-off products have been released mainly in the UK. In March 2012, The Secret Policeman's Ball took place in the United States for the first time. The one-night show at New York's Radio City Music Hall on 4 March was part of Amnesty's 50th anniversary commemorations.  Overview  The series was created and developed by Monty Python member John Cleese, Peter Luff (Assistant Director Amnesty International 1974‚Äì1978) and entertainment industry executive Martin Lewis who subsequently worked with Peter Walker (Amnesty's Fund-Raising Officer from 1978). Cleese, Lewis and Luff worked together on the first two shows (1976 and 1977). After this, Cleese and Lewis worked on the next two shows (1979 and 1981) with Luff's replacement at Amnesty, Peter Walker ‚Äì using the Secret Policeman's Ball title for the first time in 1979 and developing the series identity. Cleese credits Lewis with coining the Secret Policeman's Ball title. In an interview aired on BBC TV on 22 June 1979, Cleese told interviewer Michael Billington \\"It's Martin Lewis' title, I can pin that one on him. But I thought it was quite funny.\\" Although the Secret Policeman's Ball title was not used until the third show in 1979, the two preceding shows in 1976 and 1977 were retrospectively treated as part of the Secret Policeman's canon. Cleese and Lewis subsequently worked individually on other Amnesty projects. Cleese made brief cameo appearances in the 1987 and 1989 shows and co-directed the latter. Lewis produced two American films drawn from the first four shows (released in the US in 1982 and 1983) and then helped expand the participation of rock musicians for Amnesty (that he first engendered in the 1979 and 1981 shows) with his contributions to the 1986 Conspiracy of Hope US tour and the 1988 Human Rights Now! world tour. The first wave of shows took place approximately every other year, and three of the first four shows were filmed and released theatrically as movies with corresponding record albums. Because multi-artist benefit shows with contemporary performers were a new phenomenon in Britain in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, they were accorded considerable media coverage and public attention. After 1981, there was a six-year hiatus. When Amnesty International re-commenced staging benefit shows, it did so without the benefit of the Amnesty staff members and outside producers who had successfully guided the first wave of shows. The new team running Amnesty International re-commenced staging benefit shows in 1987, and the shows were on a noticeably smaller scale and consequently generated less media attention. The shows from 1987 onwards were videotaped to be shown as TV specials and/or released on home video in Britain rather than filmed as movies with prospects for international release. The sole exception to the smaller scale events was an ill-fated attempt in June 1988 to stage a weekend concert event titled \\"Amnesty International Festival of Youth\\" at the 65,000 capacity Milton Keynes Bowl. The event was a massive failure and for the first time ever, one of Amnesty's fund-raising benefit events lost money. Only two more of Amnesty's benefit shows (in 1987 and 1989) carried a Secret Policeman's Ball-related title. Between 1991 and 2001 Amnesty staged four more benefit events and though they were comedy shows in the same vein as their predecessors, none of them carried the Secret Policeman's Ball title. When Amnesty staged a 40th anniversary show in 2001 it was stated that the Secret Policeman's Ball title had run its course and would not be revived. However, in October 2006, following a 17-year gap, the name was revived, and also used for shows in October 2008 and March 2012. = Lasting impact = The first four shows (1976‚Äì1981) and their spin- offs are credited by many prominent comedians, musicians, actors and producers with having galvanised them to become involved with Amnesty and other social and political causes in succeeding years. Rock stars Bob Geldof, Bono and Sting have all attributed their involvement in humanitarian issues to their exposure to the Secret Policeman's Ball shows: Geldof, Sting and Clapton as participants with Bono as an audience member. Bono told Rolling Stone magazine in 1986: \\"I saw 'The Secret Policeman's Ball' and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...\\" In 2001, Bono described The Secret Policeman's Ball to an Amnesty audience as \\"a mysterious and extraordinary event that certainly changed my life...\\" In 1986, Sting told NBC's Today \\"I've been a member of Amnesty and a support member for five years, due to an entertainment event called 'The Secret Policeman's Ball' and before that I did not know about Amnesty, I did not know about its work, I did not know about torture in the world.\\" Bob Geldof and Ultravox singer Midge Ure first met and worked together at 1981's The Secret Policeman's Other Ball which was the first benefit show that either of them had performed at. Geldof credits the Secret Policeman's Ball series with having inspired his own charity show endeavours. The earliest shows predated the proliferation of comedy and rock benefit shows that took place in the UK and US in the mid-1980s such as Live Aid, Farm Aid, Prince's Trust concerts, The Free Nelson Mandela Concert and Comic Relief. The Amnesty shows are considered to have been the pioneering charity events that helped inspire the later shows. Amnesty directly attributes the leaps in awareness of the human rights issue, the significant increases in its membership (especially among the young) and its dramatically increased fundraising achievements to the impact of the various shows, their spin-offs and successor Amnesty events such as the Conspiracy of Hope and Human Rights Now! tours. Some of the films received international cinema release, and the soundtrack albums enjoyed commercial success worldwide, all of which generated considerable international awareness of the original shows, together with a growing grassroots awareness of Amnesty International and the human rights issue. Amnesty states that public awareness of Amnesty increased by 700% between the first and third shows. Membership of the organisation increased exponentially. = Introduction to an American audience = The films and records of the first three Amnesty benefit shows did not initially receive much exposure in the US, but this started to change in 1981‚Äì1982. The original British versions of the two Secret Policeman's Ball movies were presented at the 1981 and 1982 Filmex Los Angeles International Film Festival. Media coverage of the screenings in magazines such as Rolling Stone created awareness of the benefit shows. The album The Secret Policeman's Other Ball ‚Äì The Music was released by Island Records/Warner Bros. Records in March 1982 and became a Top Thirty album in the Billboard charts. The third major element in bringing the Secret Policeman's Balls to the U.S. was the acquisition of the UK films by American distributors Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein, founders of the independent distribution company Miramax Films. They had acquired the US rights to the film of the 1979 show The Secret Policeman's Ball and subsequently its successor The Secret Policeman's Other Ball. They determined that neither film would be successful in the American marketplace because some of the content was too parochial for American tastes.Book: Peter Biskind, Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film With Amnesty's blessing, they decided to combine the two films for the US. Original producer Martin Lewis distilled the best performances from both films into one new 110-minute film for the American market, with an opening sequence narrated by Saturday Night Live announcer Don Pardo. The new film premiered in New York in May 1982 as a fund-raiser for the U.S. section of Amnesty; it received enthusiastic reviews and went on to box office success. The film is recognised as Miramax's first hit. The American version of the film was released on home video by MGM-UA later in 1982. The US film (though drawn from the UK films of both the 1979 and 1981 shows) used as its title The Secret Policeman's Other Ball ‚Äì a title that by May 1982 had some resonance in the US marketplace because of the success of the music soundtrack album and media coverage of the film festival screenings. In 1983, the Weinsteins and Lewis produced an 80-minute sequel TV special for HBO/Cinemax later released on home video by Media Home Entertainment titled The Secret Policeman's Private Parts. The program compiled material from the first two Amnesty shows (the 1976 and 1977 benefits) and the best of the content from the original 1979 and 1981 films that had not been used in the 1982 US version of The Secret Policeman's Other Ball. = American offshoots (1986 and 1988) = In the early 1980s, Amnesty had a low profile in the US, and its Executive Director Jack Healey was looking for a way to raise the organisation's profile, especially among young people. In a 1986 profile in Rolling Stone Healey related how he decided to find out if the goodwill towards Amnesty of rock musicians that he had seen in the US version of The Secret Policeman's Other Ball could be put to service to help improve Amnesty's profile in America. Consulting with Martin Lewis, Healey conceived and produced Conspiracy of Hope, a 10-day/6-concert rock tour of the US that took place in June 1986 in celebration of Amnesty's 25th anniversary. The tour was headlined by a mixture of British and Irish artists ‚Äì Sting, The Police, Peter Gabriel and U2 ‚Äì with American and Canadian musicians Jackson Browne, Lou Reed, Joan Baez, The Neville Brothers and Bryan Adams. The tour was promoted by rock impresario Bill Graham. The tour concluded with a major all- day concert at Giants Stadium in New Jersey that was televised live by MTV. The final concert featured additional artists including Bob Geldof, Joan Armatrading, Rub√©n Blades, Carlos Santana, Howard Jones, Miles Davis and Joni Mitchell. Just one month after the tour, the membership of Amnesty in the USA had increased by 45,000 members. Subsequent to the A Conspiracy of Hope tour, Lewis and Healey conceived the 1988 Amnesty world tour Human Rights Now!, that featured Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'Dour and Tracy Chapman. Lewis and Healey's intention was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by staging a tour that would visit all five continents. The aim was to raise consciousness of human rights issues rather than fund-raising. The six-week/20-concert tour was produced by Healey and Bill Graham. The tour staged concerts in 19 different nations in all five continents ‚Äì and was considered successful in raising considerable awareness of the human rights issue throughout the world. The two tours were the cornerstone of what subsequently became known collectively as the Human Rights Concerts ‚Äì a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998.  First four shows 1976‚Äì1981  = 1976 ‚Äì A Poke in the Eye = In early 1976, the British section of Amnesty International was seeking a way to simultaneously raise funds for itself and elevate the very low profile of human rights issues in British public discourse. It decided to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Amnesty parent organisation with a simple one-night benefit show with a few entertainers contributing services as was the norm with charity events in that era. There was no anticipation that the event might be filmed or recorded to be shared with an audience beyond the people attending the benefit, and no anticipation that it might be anything other than a one-off event. Amnesty's Assistant Director Peter Luff approached John Cleese of the Monty Python comedy troupe to seek his participation. Cleese was taken with the idea and volunteered to assist the event by helping to \\"round up a few friends\\". Cleese's \\"few friends\\" turned out to be colleagues in Monty Python, pals in the earlier British comedic ensemble Beyond The Fringe, his Footlights and I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again peers (including The Goodies), and other members of the British comedy community from the 1960s and 1970s (primarily those described as \\"Oxbridge\\" comedians). Luff, working with his Amnesty colleague David Simpson, obtained the use of Her Majesty's Theatre, free of charge. The tickets for the show were advertised solely in the satirical magazine Private Eye and were sold out within four days. The other member of the production team was Martin Lewis, a young record industry executive who initially undertook to produce a record album of the show and then became closely involved with Cleese, Luff and Simpson on the show production ‚Äì which evolved into a three-night run. TV documentary maker Roger Graef, approached the team offering to make a \\"fly-on-the-wall\\"-style documentary about the production of the show and to film the show itself. The resulting film was titled Pleasure at Her Majesty's. Lewis also undertook responsibility for publicising the show and its film and record spin-offs.  Show  The show ‚Äì titled by Cleese A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick) ‚Äì took place on 1‚Äì3 April 1976 as a series of late-night galas at Her Majesty's Theatre in London's West End theatre district. The show was directed by Beyond The Fringe alumnus Jonathan Miller. The shows started at 11.30 pm, after the performance of the theatre's regularly scheduled play. Being late-night events became a hallmark of subsequent shows. In addition to Lewis' audio recording team, Roger Graef, used a small 16 mm crew, to film rehearsals and performances. The footage was later assembled into the film Pleasure at Her Majesty's, which premiered in November 1976 at the 20th annual London Film Festival, and was broadcast by the BBC in December 1976. Subsequently, the film received a modest theatrical release at art-house cinemas in 1977. A record album of the show, titled A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick), was released in November 1976 by Transatlantic Records and was a commercial success. The original working title for the show had been An Evening Without David Frost ‚Äì an allusion to the fact that most of the performers had worked with, or for, David Frost early in their careers. = 1977 ‚Äì The Mermaid Frolics = In May 1977 a second Amnesty benefit was held to build on the success of the first show and with the intent of developing momentum for a regularly scheduled benefit show. The returning production team included Amnesty Assistant Director Peter Luff and Martin Lewis. The show was directed by Monty Python member Terry Jones. This show was unlike the first show and its primary successors in three key aspects. It was a single-night event rather than consisting of multiple performances, it started at 8:00 pm on a Sunday evening, and the show was videotaped as a TV special rather than filmed for theatrical release. The show took place at London's Mermaid Theatre and was titled An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles, an affectionate reference to the actor/manager who had founded the Mermaid Theatre. The title grew out of the discarded working title of the previous year's show. The comedic performers in the 1977 show included several who had performed in the first show ‚Äì such as Peter Cook, Terry Jones, John Cleese ‚Äì joined by his then wife Connie Booth ‚Äì and some newcomers including Sir Peter Ustinov. There were also a handful of musical performers including classical guitarist John Williams, actress/singer Julie Covington and folk troubadour Pete Atkin. The album of the show and the TV show were given a fresh title by producer Lewis: The Mermaid Frolics. The album was released on Polydor Records in December 1977 and the TV special was shown on the ITV network that same month through Granada TV. The title of the TV show and record album has since become the name by which the original stage show itself is referred to. = 1979 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Ball = Amnesty decided not to present a benefit show in 1978, in order to consider how to make better use of the performing talent so favourably disposed to assist it in raising funds. Peter Luff left Amnesty in 1978 and the organisation's new fund-raising officer, Peter Walker, was deputed to work with Lewis on reconfiguring the show to raise more money and greater awareness of Amnesty. Lewis and Walker determined that the third show needed to be produced in the same vein as the first show (i.e. multiple performances, late-night and filmed for theatrical release) but with a more professional approach to exploiting the film. They approached John Cleese who agreed to be involved again. He also agreed to direct the show, though requesting that his credit read \\"slightly directed by John Cleese.\\" He also recruited the majority of the comedic performers ‚Äì including Peter Cook and fellow Pythons Michael Palin and Terry Jones. He also selected a newcomer on the British comedy scene named Rowan Atkinson. Lewis recruited Scottish comedian Billy Connolly with whom he had worked while employed at Transatlantic Records. Connolly was the first non-Oxbridge comedian to perform at an Amnesty benefit ‚Äì a distinction he made fun of at the show. Lewis proposed to Cleese that in addition to the comedy performances the show should feature some contemporary rock musicians. Cleese delegated this responsibility to Lewis who recruited Who guitarist Pete Townshend to perform, as well as new wave singer-songwriter Tom Robinson. Cleese and Palin promoted the forthcoming show in an interview conducted by Michael Billington, transmitted on BBC television on 22 June 1979. Cleese and Palin explained their support for Amnesty and their reasons for doing the shows. The shows took place over four consecutive nights at Her Majesty's Theatre in London on 27‚Äì30 June 1979. The shows were again filmed by a rudimentary 16 mm documentary crew and the resulting 100-minute film ‚Äì also titled The Secret Policeman's Ball was released theatrically by ITC in June 1980 heralded by a special preview attended by many of the show's participants. (A one-hour television special drawn from the performances aired on Britain's ITV network by London Weekend Television in December 1979, to coincide with the release of The Secret Policeman's Ball record album on Island Records, produced by Lewis, of the comedy performances.) A second record was released to coincide with the release of the film, a 12-inch EP containing eight musical performances from the show including three Townshend songs. Peter Cook's nine-minute parody of the summing up of Mr Justice Cantley in the Thorpe Trial, \\"Entirely A Matter for You,\\" was so successful that the audio recording of the live performance was released as an album on Virgin Records entitled Here Comes the Judge: Live. The film and record albums enjoyed critical and commercial success in the UK and sparked international interest. The film was released in several countries with notable success in Australia. For the first time there was also interest in the US with the EP of the musical performances being released as an album by Atco/Atlantic Records and the US movie rights being acquired by fledgling independent distributor Miramax Films. The iconic Secret Policeman's cartoon character used to promote the show, film and record albums made its first appearance in 1979. It was created by New Statesman cartoonist Colin Wheeler who had been commissioned by Peter Walker. This film, plus four others, is included on the Secret Policeman's Balls DVD. = 1981 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Other Ball = Following the success of the 1979 show and the financial benefits accruing to Amnesty from the spin-off movie, TV special and record albums ‚Äì Cleese, Lewis and Walker planned the next show to be a more spectacular event. Cleese focused on broadening the comedic talent to be presented at the show. In addition to the Amnesty show stalwarts drawn from the Oxbridge/Monty Python/Beyond The Fringe orbit, he invited newcomers such as Rowan Atkinson's colleagues from the BBC TV show Not the Nine O'Clock News including Pamela Stephenson and Griff Rhys Jones; comedian Victoria Wood and regional comic Jasper Carrott. Lewis secured a return appearance by Billy Connolly and a debut appearance by \\"alternative\\" comedian Alexei Sayle who Lewis had recently discovered and was managing. Building on the success of Pete Townshend's 1979 appearance Lewis recruited other rock musicians to perform at the 1981 show including Sting, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Donovan and Bob Geldof. The show was presented at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on four consecutive nights on 9‚Äì12 September 1981. Cleese invited theatre director Ron Eyre to co-direct the show with him. Walker secured funds to have the show filmed (at Lewis' suggestion) by new wave filmmaker Julien Temple. For the first time an Amnesty show was filmed with a full 35 mm film crew. The resulting film was released in the UK by UIP in March 1982. It became a commercial success on both its theatrical release and its subsequent home video release. Two record albums were also released by Springtime/Island Records. One featured highlights of the comedy material, while the other featured the musical performances. In addition to the movies and albums, Methuen published a large coffee-table book edited by Lewis and Walker, featuring transcripts of the sketches from the show, photographs and some specially written comedic notes by Michael Palin and Terry Jones. = Distinctive elements of early shows = The reputation of the original four shows has endured and grown over the years. In September 2006, 30 years after the first show, a profile in the respected British newspaper The Daily Telegraph referred to the \\"talismanic power of the words The Secret Policeman's Ball\\" and \\"the show's folkloric status\\". There are many factors that contributed to the reputation of the shows, particularly those of the 'first wave': * The galas were the first stage shows in the UK to feature a broad cross-section of the baby boomer generation of contemporary comedic performers who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s. Media reviews at the time described the 1976 show as a gathering of the tribes. * They were the first stage shows in the UK to present comedic performers (such as Monty Python and Rowan Atkinson) in the same setting and shows as their contemporaries in rock music. * Solo live performances by rock musicians of their hits was not a familiar phenomenon prior to the Secret Policeman's shows. This changed with Townshend's performance of \\"Pinball Wizard\\", Sting singing \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Roxanne\\", Phil Collins performing \\"In The Air Tonight\\". * The shows presented unusual permutations of performers, in the 1976 show, Peter Cook of Beyond The Fringe became an honorary member of Monty Python for their Courtroom Sketch. Terry Jones of Monty Python took the place of the absent Dudley Moore in Beyond The Fringe's Shakespeare skit. In a later show, Rowan Atkinson was a guest performer with three members of Monty Python for the Four Yorkshiremen sketch. John Cleese had the opportunity to perform in \\"two- handers\\" (skits for just two performers) with two of his mentors: Jonathan Miller in 1977 and Peter Cook in 1979. In 1981, it was Cleese's turn to fulfil the role of mentor in a two-hander with Rowan Atkinson. * The out-of-the- ordinary pairings extended to musical performers. In the 1979 show, producer Martin Lewis arranged for rock guitarist Pete Townshend to duet with classical guitar virtuoso John Williams on The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". Lewis also arranged for new-wave rock performers Sting and Bob Geldof to perform in a specially assembled super-group (named \\"The Secret Police\\") with 1960s guitar icons Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck on a grand finale performance of Bob Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released\\". * Much of the material performed in the much heralded first four shows (1976‚Äì1981) came from the repertoire of sketches and skits created in the preceding 15 years by Beyond The Fringe alumni, and by Monty Python and its radio and TV antecedents, this radio or TV material was presented on stage. For example: several skits from the cult 1960s TV show At Last the 1948 Show were resuscitated by John Cleese (one of that show's creators) and performed by him with cast members, including fellow Pythons (Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Graham Chapman) and other peers (John Bird, John Fortune and Tim Brooke-Taylor (the last also an At Last the 1948 Show writer and performer), along with younger performers (Rowan Atkinson, Griff Rhys Jones), and Cleese's then wife, actress/writer Connie Booth. * The shows were also the first to present a new wave of comedians to a wider audience, such as Billy Connolly and Alexei Sayle. By the time of the second and third waves of Secret Policeman's shows (in 1987‚Äì1989 and 1991‚Äì2001, respectively), \\"alternative comedians\\" had become the new mainstream, succeeding the Oxbridge comedy school of the 1960s and 1970s. The later Amnesty shows followed the lead of the earlier shows in presenting the most popular comedy performers of the era, such as Ben Elton, French & Saunders, and Eddie Izzard. = Aftermath = Following the success of The Secret Policeman's Ball shows, there was a substantial increase in the number of benefit shows and charity projects in the UK in the early to mid-1980s ‚Äì for a wide variety of causes. Many of the shows were modelled on the format of the Secret Policeman's Ball shows. At a certain point the media started to refer to a phenomenon described as \\"benefit fatigue\\" a term coined to describe the attitude towards the glut of benefit shows ‚Äì many featuring the same group of performers ‚Äì that were taking place each year. By 1982, Amnesty had lost the services of two key staff members, Peter Luff and Peter Walker, who had guided the first 4 benefit shows. The British Section of Amnesty responded to these two factors by taking a break from staging new benefit shows for six years. When it restarted the Secret Policeman's series in 1987 it scaled back from producing theatrical movies of its shows to making them into TV and home video specials.  1987‚Äì2001 shows  = 1987 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Third Ball = When the British Amnesty shows finally resumed in 1987 after a six-year hiatus, the show format was retooled in an effort to take advantage of the growing number of rock musicians supporting Amnesty. Instead of the live show being primarily a comedy show with a few musical cameos, the event made a point of giving equal emphasis to comedy and music. The show's four nights were divided up into two nights of comedy and two nights of music. The line-up of musicians included several who were already veterans of earlier Amnesty benefits in the UK and/or USA: Bob Geldof, Peter Gabriel, Jackson Browne and Lou Reed. Other performers included Kate Bush, David Gilmour, Mark Knopfler, Joan Armatrading, Chet Atkins, World Party and Duran Duran. Most of the comedic performers in the 1987 show were talents familiar primarily just to British audiences. This made the film of the show far less appealing to overseas audiences and unlike its predecessors; it did not find major international distribution in lucrative markets such as the US and Canada. Comedic performers included: Stephen Fry & Hugh Laurie, Mel Smith & Griff Rhys Jones, Dawn French & Jennifer Saunders, Ruby Wax, Hale and Pace, Lenny Henry, Rory Bremner, Robbie Coltrane, Ben Elton and the Spitting Image puppets. The shows took place at The London Palladium over four consecutive nights 26‚Äì29 March 1987. The shows were videotaped and a home video special was created integrating performances from the two comedy nights and two music nights. It was released by Virgin Vision. Two TV specials were created and transmitted ‚Äì one featuring musical performances, the other featuring comedy performances. Following the pattern established by the 1979 and 1981 shows, separate albums of the comedic and musical performances was released by Virgin Records. The shows were produced by Tony Hollingsworth, and the videos were produced by Hollingsworth and Neville Bolt. The 92-minute TV and video specials were subsequently criticised for the increased musical content. While all the musical performances were presented in full, the comedic performances were often edited heavily. The TV version also prominently featured spoof documentary segments by newcomer Ruby Wax, which took time from the performances of the comedians and musicians. This reflected the fact that, unlike the previous shows (which had been stage events that integrated comedy and music) the performances were edited together from two entirely different types of stage show. = 1988 ‚Äì Amnesty International Festival of Youth = In 1986, the US Section of Amnesty International had organised the very successful Conspiracy of Hope tour featuring leading rock musicians on an 11-day/6-concert tour of the US. This tour built upon the participation of rock musicians in the 1979 and 1981 Secret Policeman's shows. In early 1988, the US Section of Amnesty announced plans for a world tour featuring major musicians to take place later that year. Titled Human Rights Now! the tour would commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The primary artists who had signed on to perform were Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'Dour and Tracy Chapman. It was also announced that the world tour would commence with a gigantic kick-off concert in England ‚Äì a salute to the fact that Amnesty had been founded in UK. The choice of England for the first concert was also in acknowledgement of the English Secret Policeman's Ball shows that had pioneered the deployment of rock musicians for Amnesty's benefit, and the presence in the line-up of two prominent English musicians, Sting and Peter Gabriel. Shortly after the announcement of the forthcoming concert in England, the British Section of Amnesty International announced that it too had decided to salute the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with a rock concert in England. The British Section of Amnesty scheduled its own concert to take place less than ten weeks prior to the announced date of the Human Rights Now! English concert already organised by their American sister organisation. Amnesty's British Section then booked one of Britain's largest concert venues, the 65,000 capacity Milton Keynes Bowl and at very short notice staged a weekend-long extravaganza titled Amnesty International Festival of Youth. Fatally for the event, Amnesty's in-house producer Pat Duffy scheduled the event to follow just one week after the long-announced Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at England's 82,000 capacity Wembley Stadium. The Nelson Mandela concert had already lined up appearances by many of Amnesty's most prominent supporters in the music community ‚Äì including Sting, Peter Gabriel, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Bryan Adams, Jackson Browne, Steven van Zandt, Midge Ure, Simple Minds, Youssou N‚ÄôDour, Joan Armatrading ‚Äì all of whom declined to partake in the new Amnesty show taking place just one week later. This made it virtually impossible for the comparatively last- minute Amnesty event, with less celebrated performers, organised by people without much previous experience, to succeed. Amnesty resisted recommendations to postpone or cancel the event and proceeded with the weekend. Amnesty's Festival of Youth weekend featured: Aswad, Joe Strummer, Big Country, The Stranglers, Aztec Camera, Mot√∂rhead, The Bhundu Boys, Go West, The Damned, Spear of Destiny, Martin Stephenson and the Daintees, New Model Army, The Icicle Works, Rhythm Sisters, The Men They Couldn't Hang, Transvision Vamp, So, World Domination Enterprises, Runrig. Positioned chronologically between the two previously announced major benefit concerts that summer in the UK ‚Äì the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Concert and Amnesty's own Human Rights Now! concert, both of which featured far more stellar line-ups. Thus the Festival of Youth was a major financial disaster for Amnesty. Uniquely among all the Amnesty benefit shows, Amnesty failed to find a film studio, television network, radio broadcaster, home-video distributor or record company to partner with it on the event and this compounded the substantial financial losses sustained by Amnesty. = 1989 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball = After the criticisms of the 1987 production's disproportionate focus on music ‚Äì and the financial disaster of its music-only Festival of Youth weekend concert in 1988 ‚Äì Amnesty returned to the original formula that had been so successful in the 1976‚Äì81 era with a primary focus on comedy. Pat Duffy was dropped from organising any further benefit events for Amnesty and for the 1989 show, Amnesty hired producer Judith Holder. John Cleese and Michael Palin made brief cameo appearances, establishing a connection to the original shows. Also returning was Peter Cook ‚Äì on this occasion performing with his longtime comedic partner, Dudley Moore ‚Äì and satirist John Bird. Several performers from the 1987 show returned including: Adrian Edmondson, Stephen Fry & Hugh Laurie, Dawn French & Jennifer Saunders, Lenny Henry, Rory Bremner, Ben Elton, Robbie Coltrane, Willie Rushton and the Spitting Image puppets. Performances took place at the Cambridge Theatre between 30 August and 2 September. The show was directed by Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese, and a videotape was televised in October 1989. = 1991 ‚Äì Barf Bites Back and The Big 3-0 = In early 1991, Amnesty held a comedy gala at the Duke of York's Theatre in London to commemorate its 30th anniversary. The event was the first Amnesty comedy show since 1979 which did not use the Secret Policeman's title. The performers were primarily alternative comedians including: Tony Slattery, Lee Evans, Simon Fanshawe, Martin Soan, Eddie Izzard and Richard Vranch. The show was videotaped and televised by Granada TV in August 1991. At the end of 1991, a second event commemorating Amnesty's 30th anniversary was organised as a TV special. The cast included Ben Elton, Lenny Henry, Steve Coogan, Julian Clary, Frank Skinner, Paul Merton, Vic Reeves and comedic music from Spinal Tap. The show's musical directors were David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Jools Holland. Musical guests included Dave Stewart, Seal, Tom Jones, Morrissey, EMF, Jason Donovan, Kim Wilde, Rick Astley, Daryl Hall and Lisa Stansfield. The show was hosted by Jonathan Ross and Alexei Sayle. Unlike Amnesty's previous shows, these shows took place in a television studio. The performers were videotaped at Central Independent Television Studios, Nottingham, on 13 and 15 December 1991 and the resulting TV show was televised later that month. = 1997 & '98 ‚Äì So You Think You're Irish and So You Think You're Irish 2 = In early 1997, Amnesty held a comedy gala at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. The performers were primarily Irish performers including: Barry Murphy, Brendan O'Carroll, Pauline McLynn, Dermot Morgan, Kevin McAleer, Owen O'Neill, and Kevin Gildea. The show was videotaped and televised on ITV in March 1997. In 1998, Amnesty staged a reprise of \\"So You Think You're Irish\\" in Dublin. The performers were again primarily Irish performers including: Milo O'Shea, Barry Murphy, Pauline McLynn, Dylan Moran, Dara √ì Briain, Tommy Tiernan, Ed Byrne, Kevin McAleer, Owen O'Neill, Ian Coppinger, Eddie Bannon, Brendan Dempsey and Kevin Gildea. The show was videotaped and televised on ITV in August 1998. = 2001 ‚Äì We Know Where You Live = In June 2001, Amnesty staged a benefit show that was video-taped as a TV special to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Titled We Know Where You Live the show was a one-night performance at the Wembley Arena. The show was coordinated by comedian Eddie Izzard. The majority of the performers were British comedians popular in their homeland but not well known internationally. Performers included Izzard, Dawn French, Harry Enfield, Vic Reeves, Phill Jupitus, and Jonathan Ross ‚Äì with cameo appearances by actors Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Richard E. Grant, Tim Roth, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters. In a salute to the original Secret Policeman's Ball, the finale of the show was a re-creation by Alan Rickman, Vic Reeves, Eddie Izzard and Harry Enfield of the Four Yorkshiremen sketch that had been performed at the 1979 Amnesty show by John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Rowan Atkinson. Coordinator Eddie Izzard also acknowledged the show's heritage in an interview in London's Evening Standard (31 May 2001) saying: \\"The musical elements will follow the previous format because it's the son of Secret Policeman's Ball ‚Äì so they're more acoustic than electric...\\" Explaining the show's new title, Izzard told the Evening Standard: \\"The title is designed to streamline the message of Secret Policeman's Ball, which was a bit more ambiguous. We Know Where You Live is about gangsters or governments who run countries and withhold human rights.\\" The audience saw a musical performance on a giant video screen by U2 via satellite. Also acknowledging the heritage of the show, Bono introduced U2's performance by saying: \\"Right, what we'd like to do now is go live from Toronto to London, to The Secret Policeman's Ball ‚Äì which is a mysterious and extraordinary event that certainly changed my life...\\" (Notwithstanding the description of the show as \\"live\\" the U2 performance had actually been pre-recorded in Toronto two weeks earlier on 21 May 2001.)  Shows since 2006  On 18 August 2006, Amnesty International announced that it was reviving the Secret Policeman's Ball title for its forthcoming benefit show ‚Äì a one-night show to be held at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14 October 2006. The name that had by then become the colloquially used umbrella title for all of Amnesty's fund-raisers. The 2006 show was coordinated by British comedian Eddie Izzard ‚Äì who had coordinated the 2001 Amnesty show. = 2006 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Ball 2006 = The 13th show in the Amnesty series took place at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14 October 2006. Unlike the first (1976‚Äì1981) era of Amnesty shows featuring mainly internationally known stars ‚Äì the line-up mirrored the later (1987‚Äì1989 and 1991‚Äì2001) eras of Amnesty shows with the vast majority of performers being little known outside the UK. The one internationally known British performer ‚Äì Eddie Izzard ‚Äì headlined a roster of locally popular acts ‚Äì including Russell Brand, Jon Culshaw, Al Murray, The Mighty Boosh and Meera Syal. Four American performers also made cameo appearances: comedic actor Chevy Chase appeared in a skit along with actor Seth Green ‚Äì and comedians Jimmy Fallon and Sarah Silverman also performed. There was a cameo from actor Richard E. Grant and animations featuring familiar voices including Jennifer Saunders. Music was supplied by The Zutons and The Magic Numbers. The 2006 edition of The Secret Policeman's Ball was not filmed for international theatrical release, but was instead videotaped for a UK TV special of highlights that was broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 on 31 October 2006. A DVD with 90 minutes of highlights from the three-hour event was also issued. There was also a \\"cinecast\\" in which the event was shown live in 17 cinemas in major British cities. = 2008 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Ball 2008 = In July 2008, Amnesty announced that it would present another show to be titled The Secret Policeman's Ball 2008. Like its immediate predecessor, the show was a single- night event at London's Royal Albert Hall which took place on Saturday 4 October 2008. The majority of the performers were again British (or UK-based) and not well known outside Great Britain, (one Canadian comedian Russell Peters and one American comedian Kristen Schaal were involved). There were contradictory announcements about the cast list for the show, with one \\"finalised line-up\\" for the event announced on Amnesty's webpage and a different \\"finalised cast list\\" announced by the event's broadcaster Channel Four indicating a lack of coordination between the two wings of the production. The show included appearances from Frank Skinner, Alan Carr, Graham Norton, Sean Lock, Kristen Schaal, Fearne Cotton, Matt Berry, Katherine Parkinson, Mitchell and Webb, Jason Manford, Shappi Khorsandi, Russell Howard, Katy Brand, Tim Minchin, Sarah Millican, Kayvan Novak, Meera Syal, Shaun Williamson, Sharon Horgan, Nick Mohammed, Dan Clark, David Armand, Eddie Izzard, Ed Byrne, Deborah Meaden, Jon Culshaw, Gok Wan, and Mike Fenton Stevens. Additionally, Keane and Razorlight gave musical performances while Russell Peters appeared via video-tape. The three-hour event was video-taped and a 95-minute television version was broadcast the following day on Britain's Channel Four. There was also a \\"cinecast\\" in which the event was shown live in 35 cinemas in major British cities in addition to four cinemas in Australia and cinemas in six of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories. The Cineplex cinema chain made the film available on 50 of its 1,317 screens. = 2012 ‚Äì The Secret Policeman's Ball 2012 = Coinciding with Amnesty's 50th anniversary, the 2012 edition of The Secret Policeman's Ball took place outside of the UK for the first time under that title. It was staged on 4 March 2012 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The three- hour show featured a mix of prominent comedians from both Britain and the United States. After a taped introduction by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the live comedy lineup included US comedic performers: Jon Stewart, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Seth Meyers, Jason Sudeikis, Bobby Moynihan, Jay Pharoah, and Taran Killam from Saturday Night Live), Rachel Dratch, David Cross & Bob Odenkirk, Hannibal Buress, Sarah Silverman, Paul Rudd, Rashida Jones, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Hader (as Julian Assange), Rex Lee (as Kim Jong-un), comedic music by Reggie Watts. Participating UK comedians were : Russell Brand, Eddie Izzard, Peter Serafinowicz, David Walliams, Jimmy Carr, Catherine Tate, Noel Fielding, Matt Berry, Micky Flanagan, Jack Whitehall, John Oliver. Also appearing were actors Tim Roth and Liam Neeson. Neeson introduced a short presentation by formerly imprisoned Burmese comedian and political activist Zarganar. There was a cameo appearance by Richard Branson in one skit. There were music sets, each of three songs, by Mumford & Sons and Coldplay. There were real-time comedic commentaries on the show from Statler and Waldorf of the Muppets and from Beavis and Butt-head in animated sequences. Monty Python alumni Michael Palin, Eric Idle, and Terry Jones appeared in pre-recorded video segments explaining comedically why they were not there. The event was streamed live in the USA on Epix, and televised by Channel 4 in the UK.

Because there have been many different versions released in different configurations in different countries over the years, there has been some public confusion as to which version is which. The confusion is most notable in respect of the two widely different versions of the film The Secret Policeman's Other Ball. The only home-video/DVD version presently available is based on the UK version of the film. There is currently no home-video version of the very different, original 1982 US version of the film. The first two Amnesty productions Pleasure at Her Majesty's (1976) and The Mermaid Frolics (1977) have only been released on home video in truncated form. Video reissues of The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979) and The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (1981) have also had original sequences edited out. The US compilation The Secret Policeman's Private Parts (1983) ‚Äì that featured special additional content and outtakes not included in the original UK films ‚Äì has not been available in any format since the early 1980s and was only released in the US. The most recent home-video release has been a 5-disc box set of DVDs entitled The Secret Policeman's Ball: 25th Anniversary Silver Box Set. Released on region zero international format. The discs feature the edited, truncated versions of the earlier films. The original audio albums of comedy and music from the shows have not been commercially available since the early 1990s. Shout! Factory released The Secret Policeman's Balls in January 2009. The 3-DVD set includes Pleasure at Her Majesty's (1976), The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979), The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (1981), The Secret Policeman's Third Ball (1987) and The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball (1989). In early 2010, Shout! Factory released the DVD The Secret Policeman's Private Party, featuring the best comedic moments from various Secret Policeman's Balls. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Secret Policeman's Ball, Shout! Factory partnered with Amnesty International on a collection of musical highlights entitled \\"The Secret Policeman Rocks.\\" The 14-track CD was released on 29 September 2009.

Dendritic spines serve as a storage site for synaptic strength and help transmit electrical signals to the neuron's cell body. Most spines have a bulbous head (the spine head), and a thin neck that connects the head of the spine to the shaft of the dendrite. The dendrites of a single neuron can contain hundreds to thousands of spines. In addition to spines providing an anatomical substrate for memory storage and synaptic transmission, they may also serve to increase the number of possible contacts between neurons. Structure Dendritic spines are small with spine head volumes ranging 0.01 Œºm3 to 0.8 Œºm3. Spines with strong synaptic contacts typically have a large spine head, which connects to the dendrite via a membranous neck. The most notable classes of spine shape are \\"thin\\", \\"stubby\\", \\"mushroom\\", and \\"branched\\". Electron microscopy studies have shown that there is a continuum of shapes between these categories. The variable spine shape and volume is thought to be correlated with the strength and maturity of each spine-synapse. =Distribution= Dendritic spines usually receive excitatory input from axons, although sometimes both inhibitory and excitatory connections are made onto the same spine head. Excitatory axon proximity to dendritic spines is not sufficient to predict the presence of a synapse, as demonstrated by the Lichtman lab in 2015. Spines are found on the dendrites of most principal neurons in the brain, including the pyramidal neurons of the neocortex, the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Dendritic spines occur at a density of up to 5 spines/1 Œºm stretch of dendrite. Hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons may receive tens of thousands of mostly excitatory inputs from other neurons onto their equally numerous spines, whereas the number of spines on Purkinje neuron dendrites is an order of magnitude larger. =Cytoskeleton and organelles= The cytoskeleton of dendritic spines is particularly important in their synaptic plasticity; without a dynamic cytoskeleton, spines would be unable to rapidly change their volumes or shapes in responses to stimuli. These changes in shape might affect the electrical properties of the spine. The cytoskeleton of dendritic spines is primarily made of filamentous actin (F-actin). tubulin Monomers and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are present, and organized microtubules are present.Kapitein, 2010 Because spines have a cytoskeleton of primarily actin, this allows them to be highly dynamic in shape and size. The actin cytoskeleton directly determines the morphology of the spine, and actin regulators, small GTPases such as Rac, RhoA, and CDC42, rapidly modify this cytoskeleton. Overactive Rac1 results in consistently smaller dendritic spines. In addition to their electrophysiological activity and their receptor- mediated activity, spines appear to be vesicularly active and may even translate proteins. Stacked discs of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SERs) have been identified in dendritic spines. Formation of this \\"spine apparatus\\" depends on the protein synaptopodin and is believed to play an important role in calcium handling. \\"Smooth\\" vesicles have also been identified in spines, supporting the vesicular activity in dendritic spines. The presence of polyribosomes in spines also suggests protein translational activity in the spine itself, not just in the dendrite. Physiology =Receptor activity= Dendritic spines express glutamate receptors (e.g. AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor) on their surface. The TrkB receptor for BDNF is also expressed on the spine surface, and is believed to play a role in spine survival. The tip of the spine contains an electron-dense region referred to as the \\"postsynaptic density\\" (PSD). The PSD directly apposes the active zone of its synapsing axon and comprises ~10% of the spine's membrane surface area; neurotransmitters released from the active zone bind receptors in the postsynaptic density of the spine. Half of the synapsing axons and dendritic spines are physically tethered by calcium-dependent cadherin, which forms cell-to-cell adherent junctions between two neurons. Glutamate receptors (GluRs) are localized to the postsynaptic density, and are anchored by cytoskeletal elements to the membrane. They are positioned directly above their signalling machinery, which is typically tethered to the underside of the plasma membrane, allowing signals transmitted by the GluRs into the cytosol to be further propagated by their nearby signalling elements to activate signal transduction cascades. The localization of signalling elements to their GluRs is particularly important in ensuring signal cascade activation, as GluRs would be unable to affect particular downstream effects without nearby signallers. Signalling from GluRs is mediated by the presence of an abundance of proteins, especially kinases, that are localized to the postsynaptic density. These include calcium-dependent calmodulin, CaMKII (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), PKC (Protein Kinase C), PKA (Protein Kinase A), Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP-1), and Fyn tyrosine kinase. Certain signallers, such as CaMKII, are upregulated in response to activity. Spines are particularly advantageous to neurons by compartmentalizing biochemical signals. This can help to encode changes in the state of an individual synapse without necessarily affecting the state of other synapses of the same neuron. The length and width of the spine neck has a large effect on the degree of compartmentalization, with thin spines being the most biochemically isolated spines. =Plasticity= Dendritic spines are very \\"plastic\\", that is, spines change significantly in shape, volume, and number in small time courses. Because spines have a primarily actin cytoskeleton, they are dynamic, and the majority of spines change their shape within seconds to minutes because of the dynamicity of actin remodeling. Furthermore, spine number is very variable and spines come and go; in a matter of hours, 10-20% of spines can spontaneously appear or disappear on the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex, although the larger \\"mushroom\\"-shaped spines are the most stable. Spine maintenance and plasticity is activity-dependent and activity-independent. BDNF partially determines spine levels, and low levels of AMPA receptor activity is necessary to maintain spine survival, and synaptic activity involving NMDA receptors encourages spine growth. Furthermore, two-photon laser scanning microscopy and confocal microscopy have shown that spine volume changes depending on the types of stimuli that are presented to a synapse. =Importance to learning and memory= Evidence of importance Experience-dependent spine formation and elimination Spine plasticity is implicated in motivation, learning, and memory. In particular, long-term memory is mediated in part by the growth of new dendritic spines (or the enlargement of pre-existing spines) to reinforce a particular neural pathway. Because dendritic spines are plastic structures whose lifespan is influenced by input activity, spine dynamics may play an important role in the maintenance of memory over a lifetime. Age- dependent changes in the rate of spine turnover suggest that spine stability impacts developmental learning. In youth, dendritic spine turnover is relatively high and produces a net loss of spines. This high rate of spine turnover may characterize critical periods of development and reflect learning capacity in adolescence‚Äîdifferent cortical areas exhibit differing levels of synaptic turnover during development, possibly reflecting varying critical periods for specific brain regions. In adulthood, however, most spines remain persistent, and the half-life of spines increases. This stabilization occurs due to a developmentally regulated slow-down of spine elimination, a process which may underlie the stabilization of memories in maturity. Experience- induced changes in dendritic spine stability also point to spine turnover as a mechanism involved in the maintenance of long-term memories, though it is unclear how sensory experience affects neural circuitry. Two general models might describe the impact of experience on structural plasticity. On the one hand, experience and activity may drive the discrete formation of relevant synaptic connections that store meaningful information in order to allow for learning. On the other hand, synaptic connections may be formed in excess, and experience and activity may lead to the pruning of extraneous synaptic connections. In lab animals of all ages, environmental enrichment has been related to dendritic branching, spine density, and overall number of synapses. In addition, skill training has been shown to lead to the formation and stabilization of new spines while destabilizing old spines, suggesting that the learning of a new skill involves a rewiring process of neural circuits. Since the extent of spine remodeling correlates with success of learning, this suggests a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. In addition, changes in spine stability and strengthening occur rapidly and have been observed within hours after training. Conversely, while enrichment and training are related to increases in spine formation and stability, long- term sensory deprivation leads to an increase in the rate of spine elimination and therefore impacts long-term neural circuitry. Upon restoring sensory experience after deprivation in adolescence, spine elimination is accelerated, suggesting that experience plays an important role in the net loss of spines during development. In addition, other sensory deprivation paradigms‚Äîsuch as whisker trimming‚Äîhave been shown to increase the stability of new spines. Research in neurological diseases and injuries shed further light on the nature and importance of spine turnover. After stroke, a marked increase in structural plasticity occurs near the trauma site, and a five- to eightfold increase from control rates in spine turnover has been observed. Dendrites disintegrate and reassemble rapidly during ischemia‚Äîas with stroke, survivors showed an increase in dendritic spine turnover. While a net loss of spines is observed in Alzheimer's disease and cases of intellectual disability, cocaine and amphetamine use have been linked to increases in dendritic branching and spine density in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Because significant changes in spine density occur in various brain diseases, this suggests a balanced state of spine dynamics in normal circumstances, which may be susceptible to disequilibrium under varying pathological conditions. There is also some evidence for loss of dendritic spines as a consequence of aging. One study using mice has noted a correlation between age-related reductions in spine densities in the hippocampus and age-dependent declines in hippocampal learning and memory. Importance contested Despite experimental findings that suggest a role for dendritic spine dynamics in mediating learning and memory, the degree of structural plasticity's importance remains debatable. For instance, studies estimate that only a small portion of spines formed during training actually contribute to lifelong learning. In addition, the formation of new spines may not significantly contribute to the connectivity of the brain, and spine formation may not bear as much of an influence on memory retention as other properties of structural plasticity, such as the increase in size of spine heads. Modeling Theoreticians have for decades hypothesized about the potential electrical function of spines, yet our inability to examine their electrical properties has until recently stopped theoretical work from progressing too far. Recent advances in imaging techniques along with increased use of two-photon glutamate uncaging have led to a wealth of new discoveries; we now suspect that there are voltage- dependent sodium, potassium, and calcium channels in the spine heads. Cable theory provides the theoretical framework behind the most \\"simple\\" method for modelling the flow of electrical currents along passive neural fibres. Each spine can be treated as two compartments, one representing the neck, the other representing the spine head. The compartment representing the spine head alone should carry the active properties. =Baer and Rinzel's continuum model= To facilitate the analysis of interactions between many spines, Baer & Rinzel formulated a new cable theory for which the distribution of spines is treated as a continuum. In this representation, spine head voltage is the local spatial average of membrane potential in adjacent spines. The formulation maintains the feature that there is no direct electrical coupling between neighboring spines; voltage spread along dendrites is the only way for spines to interact. =Spike-diffuse-spike model= The SDS model was intended as a computationally simple version of the full Baer and Rinzel model. It was designed to be analytically tractable and have as few free parameters as possible while retaining those of greatest significance, such as spine neck resistance. The model drops the continuum approximation and instead uses a passive dendrite coupled to excitable spines at discrete points. Membrane dynamics in the spines are modelled using integrate and fire processes. The spike events are modelled in a discrete fashion with the wave form conventionally represented as a rectangular function. =Modeling spine calcium transients= Calcium transients in spines are a key trigger for synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptors, which have a high permeability for calcium, only conduct ions if the membrane potential is suffiently depolarized. The amount of calcium entering a spine during synaptic activity therefore depends on the depolarization of the spine head. Evidence from calcium imaging experiments (two-photon microscopy) and from compartmental modelling indicates that spines with high resistance necks experience larger calcium transients during synaptic activity. Development Dendritic spines can develop directly from dendritic shafts or from dendritic filopodia. During synaptogenesis, dendrites rapidly sprout and retract filopodia, small membrane organelle-lacking membranous protrusions. Recently, I-BAR protein MIM was found to contribute to the initiation process.Saarikangas, Juha, et al. \\"MIM- induced membrane bending promotes dendritic spine initiation.\\" Developmental cell 33.6 (2015): 644-659. During the first week of birth, the brain is predominated by filopodia, which eventually develop synapses. However, after this first week, filopodia are replaced by spiny dendrites but also small, stubby spines that protrude from spiny dendrites. In the development of certain filopodia into spines, filopodia recruit presynaptic contact to the dendrite, which encourages the production of spines to handle specialized postsynaptic contact with the presynaptic protrusions. Spines, however, require maturation after formation. Immature spines have impaired signaling capabilities, and typically lack \\"heads\\" (or have very small heads), only necks, while matured spines maintain both heads and necks. Clinical significance Cognitive disorders such as ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, autism, intellectual disability, and fragile X syndrome, may be resultant from abnormalities in dendritic spines, especially the number of spines and their maturity. The ratio of matured to immature spines is important in their signaling, as immature spines have impaired synaptic signaling. Fragile X syndrome is characterized by an overabundance of immature spines that have multiple filopodia in cortical dendrites. History Dendritic spines were first described at the end of the 19th century by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal on cerebellar neurons.Ram√≥n y Cajal, S. Estructura de los centros nerviosos de las aves. Rev. Trim. Histol. Norm. Pat. 1, 1-10 (1888). Ram√≥n y Cajal then proposed that dendritic spines could serve as contacting sites between neurons. This was demonstrated more than 50 years later thanks to the emergence of electron microscopy. Until the development of confocal microscopy on living tissues, it was commonly admitted that spines were formed during embryonic development and then would remain stable after birth. In this paradigm, variations of synaptic weight were considered as sufficient to explain memory processes at the cellular level. But since about a decade ago, new techniques of confocal microscopy demonstrated that dendritic spines are indeed motile and dynamic structures that undergo a constant turnover, even after birth.Yoshihara, Y., De Roo, M. & Muller, D. \\"Dendritic spine formation and stabilization.

As a comedian of slapstick he is credited with popularizing the custard- pie-in-the-face gag.Leslie Halliwell, John Walker (2001). \\"Halliwell's Who's who in the Movies\\". p. 240. HarperCollinsEntertainment, 2001 During the 1890s, in order to circumvent stage censorship, Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue. Cheeky authority-defying playlets such as Jail Mum (1896) in which prisoners play tricks on warders and Early Birds (1903), where a small man defeats a large ruffian in London's East End, can be seen as precursors of movie silent comedy. Film producer Hal Roach stated: \\"Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him.\\"J. P. Gallagher (1971). \\"Fred Karno: master of mirth and tears\\". p. 165. Hale. Among the music hall comedians who worked for him were Charlie Chaplin and his understudy, Arthur Jefferson, who later adopted the name of Stan Laurel. These were part of what was known as \\"Fred Karno's Army\\", a phrase still occasionally used in the UK to refer to a chaotic group or organisation. The phrase was also adapted by British soldiers into a trench song in the First World War, as a parody of, or rather to the tune of, the hymn \\"The Church's One Foundation\\". In the Second World War it was adapted as the Anthem of the Guinea Pig Club, the first line becoming \\"We are McIndoe's Army ...\\". Biography Karno was born in Exeter, Devon, England, in 1866. He worked as a cabinet maker with a workshop in Waterbeer Street. He married Edith and in 1896 his son, Fred Karno Jr. was born. In 1904 he visited Tagg's Island on London's River Thames and in 1912 he bought the island and the existing hotel. He demolished the original hotel and hired architect Frank Matcham to build The Karsino. With the advent of cinema, the music hall's popularity declined and as a result of this decline, Karno went bankrupt in 1925. On 24 May 1927 his wife Edith, from whom he had been separated since 1904, died in her sleep of diabetes. Three weeks later, Karno married his second wife, his long-time partner, Marie Moore. Karno went to the US in 1929, and was hired by the Hal Roach Studios as a writer-director, and was reunited with one of his former prot√©g√©s, Stan Laurel. However, his stay at the studio was brief and unsuccessful as Hal Roach found out Karno's main abilities were as a producer, and he departed in February 1930. On his return to Britain, Karno helped to write and produce several short films and in 1936 returned to the theatre with a show called Real Life.Book-Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy (Faber and Faber Ltd.) Author-Simon Louvish. Publishing Date-2001. Karno spent his last years in southwest England in the village of Lilliput, Dorset, as a part-owner of an off-licence bought with financial help from Charlie Chaplin, and died there in 1941 from diabetes, aged 75. Musician and broadcaster Benny Green in his work The Last Empires, a study of the British music-hall, describes the brutalities Karno inflicted on his first wife, and expresses the opinion that he was 'certifiable' (as a mentally- disturnbed person).Green, Benny, The Last Empires.

It runs north-east / south-west between London and the coastal town of Lowestoft in the north-eastern corner of Suffolk, following a similar route to the Great Eastern Main Line. A section of the road between Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth became part of the A47 in 2017. Between the junctions with the M25 and the A14, the A12 forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E30 (prior to 1985, it was the E8). Unlike most A roads, this section of the A12, together with the A14 and the A55, has junction numbers as if it were a motorway. The 84 km section of the A12 through Essex has sections of dual two lanes and dual three lanes, with eight changes in width between the M25 to Ipswich. It was named as Britain's worst road because of \\"potholes and regular closures due to roadworks\\" in a 2007 survey by Cornhill Insurance. The A12 is covered by Highways England's A12 and A120 Route Management Strategy. Starting just north of the Blackwall Tunnel, where it connects end on to the A102, it heads north through Bow and Hackney Wick, then north east through Leyton and Romford, then into Essex, passing Brentwood and Colchester. In Suffolk, it passes Ipswich and Saxmundham, then follows the coast through Lowestoft before entering Norfolk, passing through Gorleston-on-Sea and ending at Great Yarmouth. In February 2017, the route was renumbered between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft to become the A47, so the road now terminates at the Bascule Bridge south of Lowestoft town centre. History The A12 was formed in 1922 as part of the Great Britain road numbering scheme, and initially the route went from Stratford to Gallows Corner along the present A118 road before continuing to Great Yarmouth. This section in London was rerouted to run on Eastern Avenue by the mid-1940s, and extended to follow the current route from Blackwall Tunnel along the East Cross Route, (previously the A102(M) & A106), the M11 link road in 1999. The route from London to Essex has long been important, with Old Ford being the location of an ancient Celtic crossing of the River Lea. The route was altered slightly by the Romans who created a paved road from London to Colchester, which was part of Inter V on the Antonine Itinerary, and parts of this were used by a turnpike road, the Great Essex Road. The crossing of the Lea moved to its current location at Bow around 1110 when Matilda, wife of Henry I, ordered a distinctively bow-shaped, three-arched bridge to be built over the river. A map from 1766 shows a route from London to Lowestoft which follows much of the current A12. The \\"Ipswich to South Town and Bungay Turnpike Trust\\" was established in 1785, operating between Ipswich and Great Yarmouth. The trust was wound up in 1872 following the arrival of the East Suffolk Line which was fully operational between the two towns in 1859. Following the demise of the Turnpike trust, responsibility reverted to parish responsibility until the new county councils took over in 1889. John Gibson's 1776 map of a road from London to Great Yarmouth. The original route of the A12 mostly ran on this alignment, particularly the Roman Road from London to Colchester. A new section of the A12, known as the \\"M11 link road\\" or \\"A12 Hackney-M11 Link Road\\", was built in the early 1990s in the face of the major M11 link road protest and finally opened in October 1999. The section of road had originally been proposed in 1903 in a Royal Commission on London Traffic. A public inquiry had been held in September 1961 and a further three public inquiries, a Parliamentary Bill and a High Court challenge had been required before the work started. Initiated in 2000, the London to Ipswich Multi-modal study reported its conclusions late in 2002. In 2008 improvements were made to the junction between the A12 and the M25 to increase slip-road capacity, in particular for clockwise M25 traffic turning north onto the A12, and to ease congestion on the Brook Street Roundabout (serving the M25, A12 and local Brentwood traffic as the A1023). The bascule bridge in Lowestoft, built in 1972, was refurbished in spring 2008. Essex County Council carried out its own inquiry into the road in 2008 (see below for details). Work on a ¬£12.4m scheme for the a new junction on the A12 at Cuckoo Farm, Colchester adjacent to the Colchester Community Stadium started in December 2009. It was promoted by Essex County Council who prepared plans in 2001. and received funding from the Community Infrastructure Fund. It opened on 16 December 2010. The section of A12 between Brentwood and Ipswich and previously between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, which is now classified as a Southern extension of the A47 was classed as a major trunk road, and therefore managed by Highways England, whereas the section between Ipswich and Lowestoft was de-trunked in 2001 and therefore passed control over from Highways England to Suffolk County Council, hence why this section is primarily single carriageway and poorly invested in, therefore the A12 has only now been labelled as a main trunk road between Brentwood and Ipswich with the Northern half after the A14 being deemed a non- primary extension, and a lesser important road. Bypasses The Eastern Avenue was built in the 1920s as a bypass for the section between Romford and Ilford, meeting what was the A11 at Leytonstone. It was numbered A106 until the 1930s when it became part of the A12. The long Brentwood bypass was opened in November 1965. A bypass for Chelmsford was first included in the roads programme in 1968. Draft orders for the southern bypass were published in 1974, however the public inquiry in 1975 suggested that the government should re-examine the appropriateness of a 'central route' and the government delayed the road. In 1979 the government announced that it would proceed with the southern dual two lane route which opened in 1986. The Wickham Market bypass opened in July 1976, providing a much needed improvement to avoid the narrow, one-lane wide section of road through Wickham Market. Wickham Market A12 Bypass Ipswich's 'Southern by-pass' via the Orwell Bridge was opened in 1982. This section, when first numbered, was part of the A45 and later designated as part of the A14. The Martlesham bypass (previously known as the Kesgrave and Martlesham Bypass) was completed in 1987/1988 as was the Saxmundham bypass. A white paper, Roads for Prosperity, published in 1989, proposed to widen the Chelmsford Bypass and the section from Hatfield Peverel to Witham to dual 3 lane; it also proposed widening the section from Saxmundham to Lowestoft and from Wickham Market to Farnham to dual 2 lanes. It also included a 'new route from the M25 to Chelmsford' as a dual two lane road following the proposed route of the M12 motorway. The Department for Transport published Trunk roads, England, into the 1990s in May 1990 which included ten proposed developments for the A12 between the M25 and Lowestoft including the M12 motorway between M25 and the Chelmsford bypass, Chelmsford bypass widening and improvements on the sections from Hatfield Peverel to Marks Tey, Four Sisters to Stratford St. Mary, Martlesham to Wickham Market, Wickham Market to Saxmundham, the bypass around Saxmundham, Saxmundham to south of Wrentham, South of Wrentham to Kessingland and the Lowestoft relief road. A public inquiry in the 'Saxmundham to Wickham Market bypass' was held in 1995 but this road has not been built. M12 motorway During the 1960s, there were plans for an M12 motorway, also known as the South Woodford ‚Äì Chelmsford Motorway; this would have run from the North Circular road, at the base of the current M11 motorway, joining the A12 south of Chelmsford or at Brentwood. The North Circular was to be upgraded to motorway-standard as part of Ringway 2 and be designated as the M15 motorway. The M11 was to have provided a motorway standard road into central London past Ringway 1, terminating at the Angel in Islington. The M12 motorway was never built, although the junction of the M11 with the North Circular was designed to accommodate it. Plans for the M12 motorway were withdrawn in March 1994, following a review of the trunk roads programme.

From here to past Ipswich (including the entire section through London) the road is a dual carriageway. North of the junction, the A12 heads northwards as a 2/3 lane dual carriageway mostly at street level. This stretch of road is known as the Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach. This stretch ends at the triple-layer interchange with the A11 at Bow Road where it becomes the East Cross Route. This is mainly a 3/4 lane dual carriageway built mainly on flyovers and underpasses and was built in the late 1960s, previously called the A102(M). The road turns North Eastwards at the unfinished Hackney Wick Interchange where the carriageways split and the northbound carriageway has a right hand entrance. When the London Ringways plan was being proposed, a motorway (North Cross Route) was to end here and the M11 was meant to extend from its current terminus on the A406 through this junction and to Angel. The A12 heads to Lea. The section from the Lea Interchange to Leytonstone, also known as the M11 Link road, was built in the 1990s in the face of a major road protest. During this work the old section as far as Wanstead was rebuilt as a dual carriageway. Prior to that, the A12 started at the Green Man Roundabout at Leytonstone, and was single carriageway west of Wanstead Underground station. It now has an underpass at that roundabout, which again is a junction with the old A11. East of Wanstead, the A12 runs roughly due east. It is known as Eastern Avenue, then Eastern Avenue West and Eastern Avenue East, built in the 1920s as a bypass for the section of the Roman road from Colchester to London running through Ilford and Romford (today's A118). The eastern end of the Eastern Avenue is Gallows Corner in the London Borough of Havering, just east of Romford. The junction also marks the start-point of the A127 Southend Arterial Road, also 1920s vintage. At the roundabout, an extemporised two-lane flyover still provides priority for A12 eastbound to A127 traffic (and vice versa). However, the A12 now veers roughly north-eastward, because it starts to follow the course of the Roman road; the Romans started building this road from Colchester, their original capital for the province. However, the stretch from Gallows Corner to the junction with the M25 motorway, called Colchester Road, is still perfectly straight. The M25 junction is number 28; it also marks where the A12 crosses the boundary from London to Essex. =Essex= Originally, the A12 followed the route of the Roman road closely and so was fairly straight, but there are now several town bypasses, so the road through Essex now has several meanders. The A12 formerly went through Brentwood, Mountnessing, Ingatestone, Margaretting, Chelmsford, Boreham, Hatfield Peverel, Witham, Kelvedon, Copford, Stanway and Colchester, but these are all now bypassed, and the A12 is a dual carriageway with mostly grade-separated junctions for its whole length in Essex. Now, the A12 is behind the suburb of Chelmer Village. It is this stretch of the A12, particularly between Chelmsford and Colchester, which has led to the poor reputation for surface quality of the A12. This is mainly for its bumpy or potholed surface, mostly due to worn concrete surfaces. In an ongoing process these sections are being relaid with tarmac, however some sections including the Kelvedon bypass, and between Copford and Stanway have yet to be resurfaced. Built in 1982, the A12 Colchester bypass provides an uninterrupted dual carriageway where the national speed limit of 70 mph applies. Before 1982, the A12 took a route much closer to Colchester itself, and although still a bypass it consisted of urban single carriageways with roundabouts and pedestrian crossings. The old bypass is still in existence ‚Äì the western half now forms part of the A1124 and the eastern half part of the A133. =Suffolk= The Suffolk stretch of the A12 starts with the Capel St Mary by- pass. Originally the route from the Northern end of this bypass ran through the villages of Washbrook and Copdock and into Ipswich. When Ipswich's Southern by-pass was built in the early 1980s, the route picked up from the northern Capel St Mary junction (now numbered 32b), to pass to the West of the original line ‚Äì this allowed the relevant ground works and interchanges to be completed with minimal traffic disruption. The old dual carriageway through Washbrook and Copdock is blocked off at White's Corner and was renumbered to be the C475. A footpath still exists which enables passage underneath the A14. multiplexed with the A14) passes over the Orwell Bridge south of Ipswich The old route through Ipswich was renumbered as the A1214 following construction of the Ipswich Southern By-pass. The old route is more locally known by the road names, notably \\"London Road\\" to the Town Centre and Woodbridge Road out the other side. The Ipswich Southern By-pass allows the A12 to overlap the A14 to Seven Hills Interchange, from the Copdock junction, where the A12 reappears and heads North. As the A14 the road passes over the large Orwell Bridge with total length of 1,287 metres. This has a summit at 43 metres above the river giving a humped feel with reduced visibility for traffic. There are at-grade roundabout junctions past BT Adastral Park at Martlesham and around the Woodbridge bypass. For most of its remaining length through Suffolk the A12 is a mostly single carriageway road, and in many places its speed limit is less than the national limit, for example as it passes through towns and villages. During 2003/2004 some of these speed restrictions were further reduced from to . There are, though, a few stretches of dual carriageway between the Woodbridge bypass and Lowestoft (at Wickham Market, Saxmundham, Wangford and Kessingland). This section of the A12 was detrunked in 2001 as part of the Highways Agency's streamlining of its Trunk Road Network. Control was therefore passed to the local authorities. Just south of Blythburgh, the old milestone shows it is to London. The A47 passes over Breydon Bridge to the west of Great Yarmouth. Close to where the A47/A12 originally met. The A12 ran through Lowestoft for about on urban limited roads. However, as of June 2006, the A12 now follows the course of the new single carriageway Southern Relief Road that joins the original A12 at Lowestoft bascule bridge. A further impediment is the harbour bridge, which has three lanes, the centre lane operating as a one-way addition to whichever direction of flow is deemed greater. The presence of these bridge choke points can cause serious disruption to north‚Äìsouth trunk traffic, especially when local traffic is added during rush hours. An adequate bypass for Lowestoft would need to be well to the west, even to the west of Oulton Broad (the body of water), and its route would have to consider the great areas of marshland in that area. For that reason an often discussed compromise is a third bridge, crossing Lake Lothing, linking the sections of urban spine-road that run approximately along the western edge of Lowestoft. =Norfolk= From February 2017, the A12 no longer reaches Norfolk as it terminates in Lowestoft at . Before February 2017, From a point just south west of the mouth of the River Yare, northwards to the point where it crosses the River Yare in Great Yarmouth, the A12 followed the route originally used by the railway line from Lowestoft to its terminus north of Breydon Bridge at Vauxhall Roundabout where the A47 previously terminated. Proposed Improvements In November 2008 the government announced a ¬£60 million technology package including variable message signs, CCTV, Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras and automatic incident detection sensors embedded in the road surface to improve journey reliability, reduce delays and give better information to drivers. Work is due to start in 2011/12. A bypass for various villages was proposed in 1986 as part of the government's 1989 Roads for Prosperity white paper which detailed many road schemes across the country. Suffolk county council considered a bypass for the villages of Farnham, Stratford St Andrew, Glemham and Marlesford for the 2006 Local Transport Plan. The scheme will not be implemented until after 2016. Essex county council has put forwards plans for a bypass of Chelmsford connecting Junction 19 of the A12 to the A131. Plans to upgrade additional sections of the A120 into a dual two-lane carriageway were scrapped in 2009. 2008 inquiry In response to this increasing congestion Essex County Council announced it would hold an A12 inquiry which was tasked with deciding how to improve the A12 and prevent the congestion. The inquiry was headed by Sir David Rowlands, KCB, a former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, with Professor Stephen Glaister, Dr David Quarmby and Lord Whitty, all with significant knowledge of the transport sector. The inquiry began taking submissions in April 2008. The Inquiry, the first ever local council sponsored inquiry into a major trunk road, heard from 24 organisations and 36 witnesses over three days including Department for Transport and Highways Agency officials, MPs, local and regional agencies and authorities, the emergency services, business and motoring groups. Comments were also received from over two hundred members of the public and through a petition organised by the Essex Chronicle newspaper.

The road is closely paralleled by the M1 motorway between Derby and Leeds. Route A58 and the Leeds Inner Ring Road), in Sheepscar, Leeds. Heading south, the road begins as single carriageway from Thirsk which bypasses Ripon and travels towards Harrogate, eventually passing through Harrogate town centre. Here, the road divides into two major one-way streets which enclose the town centre and run along The Stray, a stretch of grassland in Harrogate. As Leeds Road, it then passes through the southern suburbs of Harrogate before meeting the A658 near the village of Pannal. The A61 continues through Harewood before approaching the north's metropolis, where a sudden urban fringe approaches. As the road enters Leeds and crosses the A6120 outer ring road, the road becomes Scott Hall Road, a main dual carriageway (or Trunk Road) and artery for north Leeds. There are sections of guided bus route using kerb guidance near Potternewton. Here, the A61 rises slightly, and a panoramic view of Leeds skyline is revealed. The descent into Leeds is quick and the road soon turns into a multi-lane road, as it approaches Sheepscar Interchange. Fast-flowing traffic is directed onto the A61, although some traffic is directed off the A61 to avoid Leeds City Centre as it routes around the back of Quarry House. The A61 meets it shortly after, as it shares the city centre loop for a short distance. After crossing the river, the road splits again before taking traffic out to the motorways. The road then continues out of Leeds towards Wakefield and Barnsley. South of Barnsley it crosses the M1 at Junction 36 then heads towards Sheffield. Between the M1 at Junction 36 and the Westwood roundabout intersection with the A616, the road is designated as a trunk road under the responsibility of Highways England. Northwards past Sheffield Wednesday Hillsborough Stadium The A61 travels into Sheffield through Grenoside and Hillsborough, passing next to the Sheffield Wednesday football stadium as Penistone Road. It continues down to Shalesmoor and at this point it forms a major artery into the City Centre from the north, becoming the Sheffield Inner Ring Road (which is labelled as A61 all the way around). It meets the A57 twice; at Park Square and Brookhill roundabout. At Junction 4 (Bramall Lane) of the Sheffield Inner Ring Road, is a spur road the A621 - Bramall Lane, this road takes you past the western side of Sheffield United F.C.'s stadium and back onto the A61 as Queens Road. The A621 is used as a shortcut, instead of continuing on the Sheffield Inner Ring Road to Junction 3 (Granville Square), where it meets Queens Road further north. The A61 then continues through Heeley as Chesterfield Road and climbs up to Norton and onto Bowshaw roundabout. Between Sheffield and Chesterfield it is a dual carriageway, avoids Dronfield and Unstone as the eponymous by- pass. The road used to go through Chesterfield town centre, passing by the famous crooked spire, but was heavily congested. This was alleviated by the construction of the Chesterfield bypass in the 1980s on the alignment of the former Great Central Railway. The road reverts to single carriageway south of Chesterfield, passing through Clay Cross and Alfreton. Southwards past Chesterfield South of Alfreton, the A61 merges with the dual carriageway A38, but the old A61 continues as the B6179 through Swanwick and Denby, meeting the A38 again just north of the City. The A61 road continues towards the city centre along Sir Frank Whittle Road until it finally ends at the junction with the A52 near to the headquarters of Derbyshire County Cricket Club. =Map of Route= * Route of A61 overlaid on Google Maps Road safety In June 2008 a stretch of the A61 between Barnsley and Wakefield was named as the most dangerous road in Britain, when motorcycle accidents were excluded. In the latest EuroRAP findings from the Road Safety Foundation, this stretch of road was also found to be the most dangerous road in Yorkshire and Humber. With 22 fatal and serious injury accidents in the three years analysed (2004-2006), this single carriageway route was rated as Red -- the second highest risk category.

For some years around 1990, the rights to use the name on motorcycles was owned by North American financiers. Later, a line of motorcycles was produced under Chief Executive Stuart Garner. Due to financial failure with large debts, in April 2020 administrators BDO agreed to sell certain aspects of Garner's business to Project 303 Bidco Limited, a new business established for the purpose with links to Indian motorcycle producer TVS Motor Company.Norton sold to Indian bike firm TVS Bennetts, 18 April 2020.

By 1902 the company had begun manufacturing motorcycles with bought-in engines. In 1908 a Norton-built engine was added to the range. This began a long series of production of single and eventually twin-cylinder motorcycles, and a long history of racing involvement. During the Second World War Norton produced almost 100,000 of the military Model 16 H and Big 4 sidevalve motorcycles. When major shareholders started to leave Norton in 1953 the company declined and Associated Motor Cycles bought the shares. Although motorcycle sales went through a recession in the 1950s, and Norton Motors Ltd was only a small manufacturer, Norton sales flourished. A series of Norton Dominator Twins of 500 cc, then 600 cc, then 650 cc and then the 750 cc Norton Atlas kept sales buoyant, especially with sales to the United States. In 1968 the new 750 cc Norton Commando Model appeared, with the engine/gearbox/swingarm unit isolastically insulated from the frame with a series of rubber mountings. This kept the vibrations from the rider, giving a smoother, more-comfortable ride. The Commando was a best seller, and voted #1 Motorcycle of the Year a number of times in Britain. 850 cc models appeared for 1973, giving more torque. For 1975 an electric start arrived in the 850 Mk3. The largest UK motorcycle manufacturer at the time was BSA-Triumph, comprising Birmingham Small Arms Company in Birmingham, and Triumph Motorcycles in Meriden. BSA-Triumph faced difficulties caused by poor management, outdated union practices, old- fashioned motorcycle designs and antiquated factory conditions. A merger with Norton Motorcycles was proposed; but although Dennis Poore's Norton Motorcycles was by far the smaller partner, Poore effectively secured a take- over of BSA-Triumph, forming Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT). The Triumph factory Meriden was the least modern; but workers engaged in a \\"sit-in\\", forming a workers' co-operative. Poore was CEO of Manganese Bronze Holdings, a company apparently more concerned with asset stripping than with motorcycle production. Subsequent political manoeuvrings led to the downfall of NVT, as taxpayer-assisted wranglings over amalgamations and sell-offs all but killed the once extensive UK motorcycle industry. In late 2008, Stuart Garner, a UK businessman, bought the rights to Norton from some US concerns and relaunched Norton in its Midlands home at Donington Park where it was to develop the 961cc Norton Commando and a new range of Norton motorcycles.

Early history 1907 Norton The original company was formed by James Lansdowne Norton (known as \\"Pa\\") at 320, Bradford Street, Birmingham, in 1898. In 1902 Norton began building motorcycles with French and Swiss engines. In 1907 a Norton with Peugot engine, ridden by Rem Fowler, won the twin-cylinder class in the first Isle of Man TT race, beginning a sporting tradition that went on until the 1960s. In April 1907 the Norton Manufacturing Co. moved to a larger factory at Deritend Bridge, Floodgate Street, Birmingham.The Motor Cycle, 10 April 1907, p292 The first Norton engines were made in 1907, with production models available from 1908. These were the 3.5 hp (490 cc) and the 'Big 4' (633cc), beginning a line of side-valve single-cylinder engines which continued with few changes until the late 1950s. The first Norton logo was a fairly simple, art nouveau design, with the name spelled in capitals.See e.g. Holliday, Norton Story, p.17. However, a new logo appeared on the front of the catalogue for 1914, which was a joint effort by James Norton and his daughter Ethel. It became known as the \\"curly N\\" logo, with only the initial letter as a capital, and was used by the company thereafter, first appearing on actual motorcycles in 1915.Woollett, Mick, Norton The Complete Illustrated History, Osprey, 1992, pp. 43, 48. Ethel Norton also did some testing of her father's motorcycles. In 1913 the business declined, and R. T. Shelley & Co., the main creditors, intervened and saved it. Norton Motors Ltd was formed shortly afterwards under joint directorship of James Norton and Bob Shelley. Shelley's brother-in-law was tuner Dan O'Donovan, and he managed to set a significant number of records on the Norton by 1914 when the war broke out - and as competition motorcycling was largely suspended during the hosilities, these records still stood when production restarted after the war.The Motor Cycle, 3 April 1919, p354 1914 Dan O'Donovan records set in April 1914 : * Under 500 cc flying km 81.06 mph, flying mile 78.60 mph - 490 cc Norton * Under 750 cc flying km and flying mile see above * Under 500 cc with sidecar flying km 65.65 mph, flying mile 62.07 mph - 490 cc Norton * Under 750 cc with sidecar flying km and flying mile see above On 17 July 1914 O'Donovan also took the flying 5 mile record at 75.88 mph, and the standing start 10 mile record at 73.29 mph, again on the 490 cc Norton. First World War Norton continued production of their 3.5 hp and Big 4 singles well into the war period, though in November 1916 the Ministry of Munitions issued an order that no further work on motor cycles or cars would be allowed from 15 November 1916 without a permit.\\"Permits for new motor vehicles\\", The Motor Cycle, 16 November 1916 By this time most motor cycle companies were already either producing munitions (or aircraft parts), or devoted to the export trade. Norton were involved in exporting and earlier that year had announced\\"A new colonial model Norton\\", Motor Cycle, 6 July 1916 a new 'Colonial Model' of their 633cc Big 4. This featured an increase in ground clearance from 4.25\\" to 6.5\\", by altering the frame, larger tank, greater clearance on mudguards, and a sturdy rear carrier. The engine was unaltered, and transmission was via a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed gearbox. In February 1918, Motor Cycle reported\\"The Norton Programme after the War\\", The Motor Cycle, 28 February 1918 on a visit to Norton Motors. Mr Norton had stated that he expected three post-war models, the 3.5 hp 490 cc TT with belt drive (for the 'speed merchant'), and two utility mounts, one with detuned TT engine, and the other being the Big Four for very heavy solo or sidecar work, both of these with three-speed Sturmey-Archer countershaft gearbox and all chain drive. It was also stated that he had been experimenting with aluminium pistons, and that Norton had produced a book of driving hints which also contained details of their Military and Empire models. In May 1918, Norton stated in one of their advertsThe Motor Cycle, 9 May 1918 that 'The ministry are taking the whole of our present output, but we have a waiting list' - this advert also uses the \\"Unapproachable Norton\\" phrase. Few Norton WD models appear in the For Sale column of The Motor Cycle after the war, suggesting they were shipped abroad, apparently one order going to the Russian Army . The 1913‚Äì1917 Red BookThe Motor, Marine and Aircraft Red Book 1917 compiled by W. C. Bersey and A. Dorey, publ. The Technical Publishing Company, p111-129 listing UK Motor, Marine and Aircraft production shows Norton dropped from a full range in 1916, to only the Military Big Four in 1917. Inter-War years Norton resumed deliveries of civilian motorcycles in April 1919 with models aimed at motorcyclists who enjoyed the reliability and performance offered by long-stroke single-cylinder engines with separate gearboxes. Norton also resumed racing and in 1924 the Isle of Man Senior TT was the first win with a race average speed over 60 mph, rider Alec Bennett. Norton won this event ten times until they withdrew from racing in 1938. J.L. Norton died in 1925 aged only 56, but he saw his motorcycles win the Senior and sidecar TTs in 1924, specifically with the 500 cc Model 18, Norton's first overhead valve single. Designed by Walter Moore, the Norton CS1 engine appeared in 1927, based closely on the ES2 pushrod engine and using many of its parts. Moore was hired away to NSU in 1930, after which Arthur Carroll designed an entirely new OHC engine destined to become the basis for all later OHC and DOHC Norton singles. (Moore's move to NSU prompted his former staff to quip NSU stood for \\"Norton Spares Used\\") The Norton racing legend began in the 1930s. Of the nine Isle of Man Senior TTs (500 cc) between 1931 and 1939, Norton won seven. Until 1934 Norton bought Sturmey-Archer gearboxes and clutches. When Sturmey discontinued production Norton bought the design rights and had them made by Burman, a manufacturer of proprietary gearboxes.

From 900 in 1936 to 2000 in 1937, Norton was ahead of the competition as war loomed, and there was good reason in terms of spares and maintenance for the military to keep to the same model. Between 1937 and 1945 nearly a quarter (over 100,000) of all British military motorcycles were Nortons, basically the WD 16H (solo) and WD Big Four outfit with driven sidecar wheel. Post-war Norton Big Four (1952 model) The Isle of Man Senior TT successes continued after the war, with Nortons winning every year from 1947 to 1954. After the Second World War, Norton reverted to civilian motorcycle production, gradually increasing its range. A major addition in 1949 was the twin cylinder Model 7, known as the Norton Dominator, a pushrod 500 cc twin-cylinder machine designed by Bert Hopwood. Its chassis was derived from the ES2 single, with telescopic front and plunger rear suspension, and an updated version of the gearbox known as the \\"lay-down\\" box. More shapely mudguards and tanks completed the more modern styling to Nortons new premium model twin. Norton struggled to reclaim its pre-WWII racing dominance as the single-cylinder machine faced fierce competition from the multi-cylinder Italian machines and AJS from the UK. In the 1949 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, the first year of the world championship, Norton made only fifth place and AJS won. That was before the Featherbed frame appeared, developed for Norton by the McCandless brothers of Belfast in January 1950, used in the legendary Manx Norton and raced by riders including Geoff Duke, John Surtees and Derek Minter. Very quickly the featherbed frame, a design that allowed the construction of a motorcycle with good mass-stiffness distribution,Dr G. Roe in a review of Motorcycle Chassis Design: The Theory and Practice by T. Foale and V. Willoughby in Bike Magazine, November 1984 became a benchmark by which all other frames were judged. Norton also experimented with engine placement, and discovered that moving the engine slightly up/down, forward/back, or even right/left, could deliver a \\"sweet spot\\" in terms of handling. Motorcycle designers still use this method to fine-tune motorcycle handling.The Victory: The Making of the New American Motorcycle (1999, Motorbooks International) In 1951 the Norton Dominator was made available to export markets as the Model 88 with the Featherbed frame. Later, as production of this frame increased, it became a regular production model, and was made in variants for other models, including the OHV single-cylinder machines. Manx Nortons also played a significant role in the development of post war car racing. At the end of 1950, the English national 500 cc regulations were adopted as the new Formula 3. The JAP Speedway engine had dominated the category initially but the Manx was capable of producing significantly more power and became the engine of choice. Many complete motorcycles were bought in order to strip the engine for 500 cc car racing, as Norton would not sell separate engines. The racing successes were transferred to the street through cafe racers, some of which would use the featherbed frame with an engine from another manufacturer to make a hybrid machine with the best of both worlds. The most famous of these were Tritons - Triumph twin engines in a Norton featherbed frame. The company went into administration in January 2020.

Reynolds could not make many of the highly desired Featherbed frames and customers lost interest in buying machines with the older frames. In 1953 Norton sold out to Associated Motorcycles (AMC), who owned the brands AJS, Matchless, Francis-Barnett and James. In 1962 the Norton factory in Bracebridge Street, Birmingham was closed and production was moved to AMC's Woolwich factory in south-east London. Under AMC ownership a much improved version of the Norton gearbox was developed, to be used on all the larger models of AJS, Matchless and Norton. Again, the major changes were for improved gear selection. In September 1955 a 600 cc Dominator 99 was launched. The 1946 to 1953 Long Stroke Manx Norton was initially SOHC, the DOHC engine becoming available to favoured racers in 1949. The Short Stroke model (1953 to 1962) had bore and stroke of . It used a dry sump 499 cc single-cylinder motor, with two valves operated by bevel drive, shaft driven twin overhead camshafts. Compression ratio was 11:1. It had an Amal GP carburettor, and a Lucas racing magneto. The 1962 500 cc Manx Nortons produced at 6,780rpm, weighed , and had a top speed of . In 1960, a new version of the road-going Featherbed frame was developed in which the upper frame rails were bent inwards to reduce the width between the rider's knees for greater comfort. The move was also to accommodate the shorter rider as the wide frame made it difficult to reach the ground. This frame is known as the \\"slimline\\" frame; the earlier frames then became known as the \\"wideline\\". The last Manx Nortons were sold in 1963. Even though Norton had pulled out of Grand Prix racing in 1954, the race-shop at Bracebridge Street continued until 1962, and the Manx became a mainstay of privateer racing, and even today are highly sought after, commanding high prices. On 7 November 1960 the first new 650 cc Norton Manxman was launched for the American market only. By September 1961 the Norton 650SS appeared for the UK market, the 750 cc (Atlas). By 20 April 1962 for the American market as they demanded more power, but the increases to the vertical twin engine's capacity caused a vibration problem at 5500 rpm. A 500 cc vertical twin is smoother than a single-cylinder, but if the vertical twin's capacity is enlarged vibration increases. The 750 Norton Atlas proved too expensive and costs could not be reduced. Financial problems gathered.Best- Motorcycle-Gear.com , Norton Motorcycle History, Retrieved 23 October 2006.

AJS Model 33, Matchless G15 and Norton N15 which used the Norton Atlas engine in a modified Matchless G85CS scrambler frame with Norton wheels and front forks. This bike was reputed to vibrate less than the Featherbed frame model. AMC singles were also sold with Norton badging in this era.Ianchadwick.com, Retrieved 23 October 2006. Also during this period Norton developed a family of three similar smaller-capacity twin cylinder machines: first the Norton Jubilee 250 and then the Navigator 350 and the Electra 400, which had an electric starter. These models were Norton's first use of unit construction. The engine was an entirely new design by Bert Hopwood and the frame and running gear were from the Francis-Barnett range, also owned by AMC. These machines had a reputation for poor reliability. Norton-Villiers By the late 1960s, competition from Japanese manufacturers and a rapidly declining home market had driven the whole British motorcycle industry into decline. In 1966 AMC became insolvent and was reformed as Norton-Villiers, part of Manganese Bronze Holdings Ltd. The 750 Norton Atlas was noted for its vibration. Rather than change engines Norton decided to change the frame, and the isolastic-framed Norton Commando 750 was the result. 1973 850 Commando In 1967 the Commando prototype was shown at the Earls Court Show in November, and introduced as a production model for 1968. Its styling, innovative isolastic frame and powerful engine made it an appealing package. The Commando easily outperformed contemporary Triumph and BSA twins and was the most powerful and best-handling British motorcycle of its day. The isolastic frame made it much smoother than the Atlas. It used rubber bushings to isolate the engine and swing arm from the frame, forks, and rider. However, as the steel-shims incorporated in the Isolastic bearings wore, often from rusting, the bike became prone to poor handling ‚Äì fishtailing in high-speed turns. The \\"Combat\\" engine was released in January 1972 with a twin roller bearing crank, 10:1 compression and developing at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main bearing and one roller bearing main bearing but the Combat engine featured two roller bearings in a mistaken belief that this would strengthen the bottom-end to cope with the higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to \\"dig-in\\" to the races, causing rapid failure. This fragility was particularly obvious when measured against the reliability of contemporary Japanese machines.Realclassic.co.uk , Dominator 99 Build, Retrieved 23 October 2006. This problem was solved initially by a special roller bearing of 'superblend' fame later in 1972. This was superseded by a standard high capacity roller bearing early in 1973. The Commando was offered in several different styles: the standard street model, a pseudo-scrambler with upswept pipes and the Interstate, packaged as a tourer. Electric start was introduced on the Mark III in 1974. Sales were respectable but the company declined financially and became insolvent in 1975. In 1976 a Norton with a US-flag theme on the tank could be purchased for US$1,976. Norton Villiers Triumph 1978 Commando Interstate Mk3 In 1972 BSA was also in financial trouble. It was given UK Government help on the condition that it merged with Norton-Villiers, and in 1973 the new Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT) was formed. The Triumph Motorcycles name came from BSA's Triumph subsidiary. In April 1973 an 8.5:1 compression 828 cc \\"850\\" engine was released with German FAG SuperBlend bearings. These, featuring slightly barrel-shaped rollers, had been introduced on late model 750 cc engines to cure the Combat engine's problems of crank- flex and the consequent digging-in to the bearing-surface of the initial cylindrical bearing rollers. This model produced at 6,250 rpm but the stated power does not give a true picture of the engine performance because increased torque seemed to make up for the reduced horsepower.NTNOA, Combat Questions & Comments, Retrieved 23 October 2006. In 1974 the UK's outgoing Conservative government of Edward Heath withdrew subsidies, but the incoming Labour government of Harold Wilson restored them after the General Election. Rationalisation of the factory sites to Wolverhampton and Birmingham (BSA's Small Heath site) caused industrial disputes at Triumph's Coventry site; Triumph would go on as a workers cooperative alone. Despite mounting losses, 1974 saw the release of the 828 Roadster, Mark 2 Hi Rider, JPN Replica (John Player Norton) and Mark 2a Interstate. In 1975 the range was down to just two models: the Mark 3 Interstate and the Roadster, but then the UK Government asked for a repayment of its loan and refused export credits, further damaging the company's ability to sell abroad. Production of the two models still made was ended and supplies dwindled. 1973 also saw the start of development on a new machine with a monocoque pressed steel frame, that also included a 500 cc twin, stepped piston engine called the 'Wulf'. However, as the Norton Villiers Triumph company was again in serious financial problems, development of the 'Wulf' was dropped in favour of the rotary Wankel type engine inherited from BSA. Wankel engine Ron Haslam on a rotary-engined Norton RCW588 racer Norton Interpol Norton Commander P53, sold as a civilian tourer In the 1980s, the company went through several incarnations ‚Äì mainly because the name was popular and now owned by several parties. In liquidation from NVT the global rights were split between (at least) Norton UK, Germany, America and Rest of the World. MidWest acquired the rights for light aviation use and at Staverton Airport the MidWest AE series was an aero engine developed from the twin-rotor engine. The brand was relaunched on an ambitious scale in Shenstone near Lichfield in 1988. The new models succeeded in racing ‚Äì winning the Senior TT in 1992 ‚Äì but they moved rather more slowly in the commercial market. The company had some success making the Wankel-engined Interpol 2 motorcycle for civilian and military police forces and the RAC. This led to a civilian model in 1987 called the Classic. Subsequent Norton Wankels were water-cooled. The Commander was launched in 1988 and was followed by the Spondon-framed F1. This model was a de-tuned replica of Norton's RCW588 factory racing machines which won many short distance races, but had many reliability issues requiring frequent servicing i.e. changing the primary drive chain every 100 miles. 1988 saw a new team brought in to replace Brian Crighton's team, to try to improve the model and reduce some of its reliability issues. The team, headed by ex Honda-team manager Barry Symmons, Honda engineer Chris Mehew and chassis specialist Ron Williams, were tasked with producing a chassis that could be produced cheaply and an engine which would have a long term reliability. The chassis, designed by Ron Williams and made by Harris Products, was based on Yamaha's Delta box stamped panels. However, in spite of many innovative solutions from Chris Mehew, the team's efforts to improve the reliability of the engine could not succeed to a commercially saleable level. The team quickly realized that placing an engine generating 1100 ¬∞C exhaust temperatures was not the item to place under a petrol tank. The team's project - renamed the NRS 588 - did win the 1992 Isle of Man TT, ridden by Steve Hislop, as well as North West 200 and Ulster Grand Prix races ridden by Robert Dunlop. Whilst in Northern Ireland, the team met Professor Gordon Blair, one of the foremost automotive engineers from Queen's University Belfast. Prof Blair commented that the Japanese had abandoned development of the motorcycle variant of the Wankel engine on two main counts: 1. As the team had realised, there was just too much heat to be confined in a motorcycle chassis. 2. The pollution created by the engine burning both oil for lubrication and fuel for power was just too great to meet the impending pollution regulations without a large and expensive exhaust scrubbing system. In his TV Series on British industry, Sir John Harvey-Jones commented that the company was governed more by heart than head and the Racing team were the only ones worth saving. The F1 was succeeded by the restyled and slightly less expensive F1 Sport. Chief Executive Phillippe LeRoux attempted to diversify the company to a group with interests in property and leisure,\\"All Change\\", an article by Julian Ryder in Motorcycle International, March 1998, p. 2 meanwhile supply of Norton Classic was being delayed by supply problems with petrol tanks and headlight shells. At this point the UK Department of Trade and Industry started to investigate improprieties in the investments of financier Philippe LeRoux and his associates following which LeRoux resigned his position as Chief Executive. In a move to manage an outstanding debt of ‚Ç§7 million, in 1991 David MacDonald was appointed Chief Executive at the behest of the Midland Bank. McDonald sold the company to the Canadian company Wildrose Ventures in 1993 for around half a million pounds.Motor Cycle News 23 February 1994 p.3 Norton 'a snip'. \\"Norton was sold to Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania for just a third of its true value, claims an ex-boss of the British bike firm.

This proved controversial as the museums had assumed the loans had been made on a permanent basis, and former Chief Executive David MacDonald stated \\"Without doubt anything which existed before 1984 does not belong to the present company. The assets were simply not transferred\\"Motor Cycle News 23 March 1994 p.5 Museum bikes sell-off blocked.

The Skalbania connection was reported as being severed by July of that year By 1996 the service side of the Shenstone site was closed and transferred to a small factory at Rugeley, Staffordshire. The focus of manufacture was moved to the manufacture of components for light aircraft engines based on the rotary design.

He modernised the design and in the early 2000s went into series production with the 961 Commando, but then suspended operations in April 2006. After fifteen years of US ownership the Norton brand was secured by Stuart Garner, UK businessman and owner of Norton Racing Ltd. Garner established a new Norton factory at Donington Park to develop the Dreer-based machine. The new Norton is a 961 cc (), air- and oil-cooled pushrod parallel twin with a gear-driven counterbalancer and a 270¬∞ crank (a concept pioneered on the Yamaha TRX850).

The new motorcycle only shared the outline of the Dreer bike; all aspects of the motorcycle were re-designed in order to move into production. An updated and revised version of the rotary machine first produced in the 1980s is also being developed. The company logo was altered by \\"doing away with the double crossing of the 't, in use since 1924, thereby \\"honouring the very first configuration of the identity, designed by [James] Norton and his daughter.\\" In January 2011 it was announced designer Pierre Terblanche had departed Piaggio/Moto Guzzi to join Norton. In August 2011 UK minister Vince Cable announced that the Government was underwriting a ¬£7.5 million bank loan to Norton, to promote secure cash flow for their export sales. Garner responded that this finance would allow Norton to double annual production from 500 to 1,000 machines.Motorcycle News 10 August 2011 On 17th April 2020, it has been reported that India's TVS Motor Company acquired Norton Motorcycles in an all cash deal. In the short term, they will be continue production of motorcycles at Donington Park using the same staff. Donington Hall Donington Hall Norton acquired Donington Hall near the village of Castle Donington, North West Leicestershire as its new corporate headquarters in March 2013. This office and engineering facility is situated behind Donington Hall in a modern building complex, known as Hastings House. The Donington Hall site includes 26 country acres surrounded by parkland and ancient deer park. Norton Motorcycles purchased Donington Hall (formerly the headquarters of British Midland International) from British Airways for an undisclosed sum, and will vacate the current Norton factory at Donington Park, which has about 40 employees. Shifting operations from Donington Park will be carried out in phases so as to not interfere with either production or distribution of Norton's bikes.

Zimbabwe Rhodesia was preceded by an unrecognised republic named Rhodesia and was briefly followed by the re-established British colony of Southern Rhodesia, which according to British constitutional theory had remained the proper government after Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. About three months later, the re-established colony of Southern Rhodesia was granted internationally recognised independence within the Commonwealth as the Republic of Zimbabwe. Under pressure from the international community to satisfy the civil rights movement by blacks in Rhodesia, an \\"Internal Settlement\\" was drawn up between the Smith administration of Rhodesia and moderate African nationalist parties not involved in armed resistance. Meanwhile, the government continued to battle armed resistance from both Soviet- and Chinese-backed Marxist liberation movements it referred to as terrorists. The Rhodesian Bush War was an extension of the Cold War, being a proxy conflict between the West and East, similar to those in Vietnam and Korea. The \\"Internal Settlement\\" agreement led to relaxation of education, property and income qualifications for voter rolls, resulting in the first ever black-majority electorate. The country's civil service, judiciary, police and armed forces continued to be administered by the same officials as before, of whom most were whites, due to the composition of the upper-middle class of the period.Will We Destroy Zimbabwe- Rhodesia? , Sarasota Journal, July 18, 1979, page 4 Despite these changes, the new state did not gain international recognition, with the Commonwealth claiming that the \\"so-called 'Constitution of Zimbabwe Rhodesia'\\" would be \\"no more legal and valid\\" than the UDI constitution it replaced.An Analysis of the Illegal Regime's \\"Constitution for Zimbabwe Rhodesia\\" , Commonwealth Secretariat, 1979, page 2 Nomenclature As early as 1960, African nationalist political organisations in Rhodesia agreed that the country should use the name \\"Zimbabwe\\"; they used that name as part of the titles of their organisations. The name \\"Zimbabwe\\", broken down to Dzimba dzamabwe in Shona (one of the two major languages in the country), means \\"houses of stone\\". Meanwhile, the white Rhodesian community was reluctant to drop the name \\"Rhodesia\\", hence a compromise was met.A Concise Encyclopedia of Zimbabwe , Donatus Bonde, Mambo Press, 1988 page 422 The Constitution named the new state simply as \\"Zimbabwe Rhodesia\\", with no reference to its status as a republic in its name. As such, it was similar in style to post-1994 South Africa renaming the Natal province as \\"KwaZulu-Natal\\".

A 40-member Senate acted as the upper House, and both together chose a figurehead President in whose name the government was conducted. =Legislative branch= House of Assembly Of the 100 members of the House of Assembly, 72 were \\"common roll\\" members for whom the electorate was every adult citizen. All of these members were black Africans. Those on the previous electoral roll of Rhodesia (due to education, property and income qualifications for voter rolls, mostly but not only white constituencies) elected 20 members; although this did not actually exclude non-whites, very few black Africans met the qualification requirements. A delimitation commission sat in 1978 to determine how to reduce the previous 50 constituencies to 20. The remaining eight seats for old voter role non- constituency members were filled by members chosen by the other 92 members of the House of Assembly once their election was complete. In the only election held by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Bishop Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council (UANC) won a majority in the common-roll seats, while Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front (RF) won all of the old voter roll seats. Ndabaningi Sithole's Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) won 12 seats. Senate The Senate of Zimbabwe Rhodesia had 40 members. Ten members each were returned by the old voter roll members of the House of Assembly and the common roll members, and five members each by the Council of Chiefs of Mashonaland and Matabeleland. The remaining members were directly appointed by the President under the advice of the Prime Minister. While the House of Assembly had changed greatly to be nearly in line with modern ideals of universal suffrage, the Senate remained dominated by the former political stalwarts, effectively allowing a check on the new House. =Executive branch= President The President of Zimbabwe Rhodesia was elected by the members of the Parliament, sitting together.

Depending on context in which a phrase (or clich√©) is used, it may actually be valid and not qualify as thought-terminating; it does qualify as such when its application intends to dismiss dissent or justify fallacious logic. Its only function is to stop an argument from proceeding further, in other words \\"end the debate with a cliche... not a point.\\" The term was popularized by Robert Jay Lifton in his 1961 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, who called the use of the clich√©, along with \\"loading the language\\", as \\"The language of Non- thought\\".  Origin and definitions  The earliest recorded definition of the term was published in Robert Jay Lifton's book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism in 1961, wherein he was describing the structure of language used by the Communist Party of China, defining the term as \\"the start and finish of any ideological analysis\\". It was listed as the sixth (of eight) totalistic themes. The term is written under the sixth (of eight) criteria for thought reform 'Loading the Language', of which various authors and scholars also consider the term to be a form of loaded language. Charles \\"Chaz\\" Bufe in his book Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure? (1997) broadly put the use of the clich√© as \\"thought-stopping phrases (that) include any use of the language, especially repeated phrases, to ward off forbidden thoughts\\" in describing his interactions with the Alcoholics Anonymous aid movement. Author, show-host and doctor Robert \\"Bo\\" Bennett described the term as a substitute for \\"a person's actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument\\". in his 2017 book Logically Fallacious, along with a proposed logical form of the clich√©; \\"Person 1 makes claim Y. Claim Y sounds catchy. Therefore, claim Y is true.\\" In the Southern California law review, Volume 51, Part 1, it describes the use of such clich√©s as \\"to capture the vehicles of thought and communication; 'Doctrine over reality' (which includes the rewriting of history and reinterpretation of one's past)\\" and as a property of 'ideological totalists'. = Exception of the criteria = Bennett explains that exceptions are made to the use of phrases, that would otherwise be considered thought-terminating, if they are used in addition to evidence or strong claims. = General examples = *\\"That's just your opinion.\\" ‚Äì Implying all opinions are of equal value, suggesting that you shouldn't try to push your \\"opinion\\" on other people, but this is false when talking about factual matters. *\\"It is what it is.\\" ‚Äì Adds no value to any debate; its intent is to disengage. \\"Why is it so?\\" *\\"Lies of the devil.\\" ‚Äì Used as a response to any fact that threatens the integrity of an individual/group. *\\"Stop thinking so much.\\" ‚Äì A literal request to stop any debate. *\\"It's all good.\\" ‚Äì In the event that the situation is not in fact in a good state, yet you want people to stop analysing it. *\\"Here we go again.\\" ‚Äì Implies that the topic has been debated about too frequently and is never going to reach a conclusion, so you may as well stop the debate. * \\"You are too negative\\" or \\"You can never admit you're wrong.\\" In both of these cases, either one agrees, in which case one is discredited for being too negative or unreliable, or one disagrees, thereby illustrating the very point one is trying to deny. This is a subtle form of a complex question, as the very act of replying assumes an implicit argument.  Criticism of use  = Politics = A major criticism made by various journalists is that the use of the clich√© tends to halt debate and restrict/censor freedom of speech, and it tends to be synonymous with language that would be utilized by totalitarian states as Lifton originally identified with Communist China. Chancellor Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany is remarked to have employed such clich√©s and platitudes to justify his actions prior and during the events of World War II for example. Historical personalities listed to also have used such clich√©s include Joseph Stalin of Soviet-Russia, Ruhollah Khomeini of the Iranian Revolution, Pol Pot of the former communist country Democratic Kampuchea and Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China. David Volodzko in The Diplomat in 2015 characterised China's justification for persecuting Tibetans, Uyghurs, Falun Gong, artists, journalists (including Liu Xiaobo), summed up as \\"for security reasons\\" as a thought-terminating clich√©, going on to say \\"that's every bit as vapid as 'God moves in a mysterious way' or 'support our troops'. What it really means is that the Party is more important than the people.\\" In an article in Vice, Lee Zachariah determined the language used by the Australian government in regards to the casualties, including one death, as a result of the Christmas Island detention centre protests, often included terms like \\"boat people\\" and \\"illegals\\" that referred to the asylum seekers, implying that the act of coming by boat is heinous, whilst \\"illegals\\" \\"says that their very nature is defined by being illegal, despite the fact that seeking asylum is not illegal\\". = Religion = An example of the clich√© in use provided by Chaz Bufe is \\"the admonition given to Catholic schoolchildren to recite the Hail Mary or rosary to ward off 'impure thoughts'. The use of repetitive chanting by the Hare Krishnas serves the same thought-stopping purpose.\\" Author Ann Morisy criticized the Christian Church for their uses of such clich√©s coinciding with their doctrines that intentionally reduce the possibility of dialogue, stating that failure to move beyond them risks falling prey \\"to a new version of gnosticism\\" along with alienating those not of the faith. Scientology has also been criticized for using protocols, language and lexicons that utilize thought-terminating clich√©s to condition its members or to reaffirm a confirmation bias, which makes it difficult for members to think \\"outside the box\\".

He was the titular ruler of the Han Empire from 6 CE to 9 CE, even though he did not officially ascend to the throne and only assumed the title of crown prince. After Emperor Ai and Emperor Ping died without heirs, Wang Mang chose the youngest of the available successors in order to maintain his power in the government. The child Ying was soon deposed by Wang Mang who declared the Xin dynasty in place of the Han. During the Xin Dynasty, Ying was under effective house arrest‚Äîso much so that as an adult, he did not even know the names of common animals. Before and after the Xin Dynasty was overthrown in 23 CE, a number of ambitious individuals claimed to be restoring the Han dynasty. In 25 CE, a rebellion against the Gengshi Emperor used the former Emperor Ruzi as a focus, and when the rebellion was defeated, Liu Ying (Ruzi) was killed. He is often viewed as an innocent child who was the victim of tragic circumstances.  Choice as the titular ruler  In 5 CE, Wang Mang, then already nearly unlimited in power as the imperial regent and fearful that the 13-year-old Emperor Ping, once grown-up, would retaliate against him for having slaughtered his uncles in 3 CE, murdered Emperor Ping by poisoning him. Because the young emperor had not had any children by his wife Empress Wang (Wang Mang's daughter) or any of his concubines, there was no heir. Emperor Ping's grandfather, Emperor Yuan, had no surviving male issue. Of his three sons, Emperor Cheng had no issue, and sons of the other two, Liu Kang, Prince of Dingtao (ÂäâÂ∫∑) and Liu Xing, Prince of Zhongshan (ÂäâËàà), had succeeded to the imperial throne (as Emperor Ai and Emperor Ping, respectively) and died without issue. The descendants of Emperor Ping's great-grandfather Emperor Xuan were therefore considered as possible successors. There were 53 great-grandsons of Emperor Xuan then still living by this stage, but they were all adults, and Wang Mang disliked that situation. He wanted a child whom he could control. Therefore, he declared that it was inappropriate for members of the same generation to succeed each other (even though Emperor Ping had succeeded his cousin Emperor Ai several years earlier). He then considered the 23 great-great-grandsons of Emperor Xuan‚Äîall of whom were infants or toddlers. While the examination process was proceeding, the mayor of South Chang'an submitted a rock with a mysterious red writing on it -- \\"Wang Mang, the Duke of Anhan, should be emperor.\\" (During his regency, Wang, building a personality cult about himself, had made it an open secret that he encouraged the manufacturing of false prophecies that would call for him to have more and more power; this appears to be one of those instances.) Wang had his political allies force his aunt, Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun, to issue an edict granting him the title of \\"Acting Emperor\\" (ÂÅáÁöáÂ∏ù), with the commission to rule as emperor until a great-great- grandson of Emperor Xuan could be selected and raised. In the spring of 6 CE, Acting Emperor Wang selected Ying, then just one year old, as the designated successor to Emperor Ping, claiming that soothsayers told him that Ying was the candidate most favoured by the gods. He gave Ying the epithet Ruzi‚Äîthe same epithet that King Cheng of Zhou had when he was in his minority and under the regency of Ji Dan, the Duke of Zhou‚Äîto claim that he was as faithful as the Duke of Zhou. However, Emperor Ruzi did not ascend the throne, but was given the title of crown prince. Empress Wang, who was only 13, was given the title empress dowager.  Brief \\"reign\\"  Several members of the imperial Liu clan were suspicious of Acting Emperor Wang's intentions. They started or assisted in several failed rebellions against Wang: * In 6 CE, Liu Chong (ÂäâÂ¥á), the Marquess of Anzhong, made an attack against Wancheng (ÂÆõÂüé, in modern Nanyang, Henan). His attack failed, but historians did not specify what happened to him, other than that as punishment, Wang had his house filled with filthy water. * In 7 CE, Zhai Yi (ÁøüÁæ©), the governor of the Commandery of Dong (roughly modern Puyang, Henan) and Liu Xin (Âäâ‰ø°), the Marquess of Yanxiang (and the father of Liu Kuang (ÂäâÂå°), the Prince of Dongping (roughly modern Tai'an, Shandong) started the largest of these rebellions. They were joined by agrarian rebellion leaders Zhao Peng (Ë∂ôÊúã) and Huo Hong (ÈúçÈ¥ª) from the area immediately west of the capital Chang'an. They declared Liu Xin emperor. Wang Mang responded by sending messengers around the nation to pledge that he would in fact return the throne to Emperor Ruzi once Ruzi was adult. Wang's armies defeated Zhai and Liu's armies in the winter of 7 CE, and Zhai was captured and executed by drawing and quartering. Liu fled and was never captured. Zhao and Huo were also eventually defeated and executed. * In 9 CE (after Wang Mang had usurped the throne), Liu Kuai (ÂäâÂø´), the Marquess of Xuxiang, attacked the Fuchong dukedom of his brother Liu Ying (ÂäâÊÆ∑), the former Prince of Jiaodong. He was defeated and died while fleeing from the battle. After Zhai and Liu Xin were defeated, Wang became even more satisfied that the empire was entirely under his control, and decided to finally seize the throne and start a new dynasty. In the winter of 8 CE, a prophecy written on a casket was presented by Ai Zhang (ÂìÄÁ´†). The prophecy was said to be a divine decree from Emperor Gao (Liu Bang) stating that the throne should be given to Wang, and that Empress Dowager Wang (who was Wang Mang's own daughter) should follow this divine will. Wang issued a decree accepting the position of emperor and establishing the Xin dynasty.  Life during the Xin Dynasty  In the spring of 9 CE, Wang Mang, now emperor, made the former Emperor Ruzi the Duke of Ding'an (and made his daughter, the former Empress Dowager, Duchess Dowager). The dukedom allegedly included 10,000 households, in which Han emperors were to be enshrined in temples, and Han calendars and uniforms would be allowed. However, Wang did not actually follow through on these promises. Indeed, he never allowed the Duke of Ding'an to rule his dukedom, but effectively put the child duke under house arrest under heavy guard. Not even his wet nurses were allowed to stay with him. As a grown man, Ying did not even know of such common animals as cattle, horses, sheep, chickens, dogs, and pigs. Wang gave his granddaughter to the Duke of Ding'an in marriage. She was the daughter of his son Wang Yu (ÁéãÂÆá), whom he had forced to commit suicide in 3 CE after Wang Yu, unhappy with his dictatorial rule, conspired with Emperor Ping's uncles of the Wei clan to overthrow him. Other than this, not much is known about the Duke of Ding'an's life during the Xin Dynasty.  Death  After the Xin Dynasty was overthrown in 23 CE and Wang Mang was killed, the imperial descendant Liu Xuan (ÂäâÁéÑ) became emperor as the Gengshi Emperor. However, due to Gengshi Emperor's incompetence, conspiracies and rebellions arose throughout the empire, seeking to displace him. Two co-conspirators started one of these rebellions in 25 CE‚ÄîFang Wang (ÊñπÊúõ), the former strategist for the local warlord Wei Xiao (ÈöóÂõÇ), and a man named Gong Lin (ÂºìÊûó) -- and their group of several thousand men, after kidnapping Ying, occupied Linjing (Ëá®Ê∂á, in modern Qingyang, Gansu). Gengshi Emperor sent his prime minister Li Song (ÊùéÊùæ) to attack them, and wiped out this rebel force, killing Liu Ying.

He was best known as the founder and owner of the Buffalo Bills, a team in the National Football League (NFL). He was one of the founding owners of the American Football League (AFL), the league with which the NFL merged in 1970, and was the last of the original AFL owners to own his team. At the time of his death he was the oldest owner in the NFL, at age 95, and the third-longest tenured owner in NFL history (over 54 years, behind the 63 years George Halas owned the Chicago Bears and almost equal to the 55 years Art Rooney owned the Pittsburgh Steelers, although Rooney's ownership and team operations were interrupted in the 1940s due to some complicated dealings). He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009. Career Wilson grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of salesman Ralph Wilson Sr. and his wife, Edith Cole.Gaughan, Mark. Father's example inspired Wilson in football and business. The Buffalo News. Retrieved March 26, 2014. He graduated from the University of Virginia (where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity) and attended the University of Michigan Law School. He was a 1936 graduate of Detroit University School, now University Liggett School. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served in the Atlantic and Pacific Theaters. After the war ended, he took over his father's insurance business and invested in Michigan area mines and factories. He eventually purchased several manufacturing outlets, construction firms, television and radio stations, and founded Ralph Wilson Industries. A minority owner of the Detroit Lions, Wilson got wind of Lamar Hunt's plans for a new league, the American Football League, to challenge the NFL. He tried to put together a team in Miami, but was turned down. His next choice was Buffalo, where the AFL's first choice of owner, Pat McGroder, had declined to start a team. In September 1959, Wilson sent Hunt a telegram with the words, \\"Count me in with Buffalo.‚Äù He named his new team the Bills, after a previous team that had played in the All-America Football Conference from 1946 to 1949. On October 28, 1959 the Buffalo Bills officially became the seventh AFL team. Wilson made professional football a resounding success in a \\"small market\\", signing such stars as Cookie Gilchrist, Jack Kemp, and Tom Sestak and Hall of Famers Billy Shaw and O. J. Simpson. He was a guiding force in AFL policies that ensured success, such as gate and television revenue sharing. As one of only three AFL owners to be on relatively solid financial ground (along with Hunt and Bud Adams), Wilson lent the financially troubled Oakland Raiders $400,000 and was also willing to lend money to Billy Sullivan of the New England Patriots. Wilson helped keep those franchises afloat, likely saving the entire league from folding (the AFL was unique among professional football leagues in that not a single AFL franchise folded in its history). In November 1963, Wilson along with then Raiders general manager Al Davis lobbied successfully to have AFL games postponed the Sunday after President John F. Kennedy's assassination; NFL games were played as scheduled. Wilson was most concerned about his team's financial solvency and was largely indifferent to the Bills' on-field success; O. J. Simpson later noted of his contract negotiations with the Bills that when Simpson's agent told Wilson of Simpson's potential to make the team a championship contender, Wilson shot back \\"What good would a championship do me? All that means is everybody wants a raise.\\" In 1989, after league commissioner Pete Rozelle announced his retirement, Wilson was on the six-member committee who was tasked with nominating potential candidates for the open position. Wilson's nominee, his former quarterback Jack Kemp, declined to pursue the post, as he had already taken a position in the U.S. Cabinet. (The job ultimately went to league attorney Paul Tagliabue.) After the original naming rights deal on the Bills' current stadium expired in 1998, the facility's name was changed from Rich Stadium to Ralph Wilson Stadium; it would not receive its current name of New Era Field until 2016, after his death and the subsequent sale of the team. According to an article on msn.com, Wilson, described as \\"stubborn\\", turned down numerous naming rights deals for the stadium. Wilson was one of the league's most outspoken owners, even near the end of his life. Wilson voted against the Cleveland Browns' relocation to Baltimore in 1995. He publicly rebuked NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in an open letter in 1998 over league policy, which disallowed criticism of referees, after poor officiating had a direct impact on a Bills loss that season.Ralph Wilson - Remember This One? WBEN. Retrieved March 30, 2014. He was one of two owners (the Cincinnati Bengals' Mike Brown being the other) to oppose the league's former (pre-2011) collective bargaining agreement. (Wilson and Brown were commended for their foresight when the agreement later led to the 2011 NFL Lockout.) He also negotiated a deal to have his team play home games in Toronto from 2008 until 2014. Wilson retired from the position of president in 2001, giving operational control to General Manager Tom Donahoe; Wilson retook control of the team's operations in 2006. Wilson again retired as team president, this time surrendering all control of the team's operations to Russ Brandon, on January 1, 2013. He continued to consult with Brandon on team and league operations up until his death. Personal life Wilson maintained a permanent residence in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan with his wife, Mary McLean, whom he met in 1989. He had three daughters from his first marriage to Janet McGregor Wilson, two of whom became involved in team business: Linda Bogdan (1948‚Äì2009), Pro Football's first female scout, was the franchise's Corporate Vice President until her death. Another daughter, Christy Wilson Hofmann, served as a consultant in the area of merchandising. The third daughter, Edith \\"Dee Dee\\" Wilson Jr., was never involved with the franchise. The highest ranking relative in the organization was Mary Owen, Wilson's niece, who served as Vice President of Strategic Planning until the team was sold.Update: Wilson still hospitalized . WGRZ.

Wilson also stated that he was \\"very surprised\\" at the team's 41-7 victory over Kansas City in Week 1. He was hospitalized in August and early September 2012 with an unspecified infection and missed the entire 2012 season.

Pro Football Hall of Fame On January 31, 2009, Wilson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame along with former Buffalo Bills defensive end Bruce Smith. The Hall of Fame game, played the day after the 2009 inductions, strayed from the usual AFC‚ÄìNFC format and instead was contested by two original American Football League teams: the Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers). This matchup was announced after Wilson was elected. Like Wilson, Titans owner Bud Adams was the only owner his team has ever had, and the two were the only living members of the \\"Foolish Club\\", the founders of the original eight AFL teams. Wilson and Adams are two of only four men who have owned a professional football franchise continuously for fifty years (George Halas, who owned the Chicago Bears from 1920 until his death in 1983, is the third, and William Clay Ford Sr., Wilson's neighbor, who owned the Detroit Lions from 1961 to 2014, is the fourth). The Hall of Fame game on Sunday, August 9, was a kickoff to the 2009 season, which would have been the 50th season of play for the AFL, if the NFL had not merged with it. Wilson was officially inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday, August 8, 2009 with ESPN icon Chris Berman acting as his \\"presenter\\". Wilson was scheduled to receive his Hall of Fame ring in a halftime ceremony during the Bills game against the Cleveland Browns on October 11, 2009. However, Wilson cancelled the event at the last moment, without notifying the press or fans, and no explanation was given. It was widely speculated that Wilson cancelled the event out of fear of being booed by Bills fans for the team's chronic poor performance on the field and a series of highly unpopular managerial decisions. He was eventually presented with the ring on November 1. Wilson donated US$2.5 million to the construction of a \\"Pro Football Research and Preservation Center\\" at the Hall of Fame; the facility was named in Wilson's honor on August 13, 2012.http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2012/07/27/pro-football-hall-to- unveil-wilson.html Thoroughbred racing Wilson was also involved for a number of years in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing both as a breeder and as an owner in France and the United States.

The cars were also marketed under the Princess and Vanden Plas marque names. The Princess name was also used as follows: * From October 1959, the name Princess was used on a deluxe version of BMC's full-sized executive cars badged as an Austin Westminster, Vanden Plas Princess and Wolseley 6/99-6/110 * From October 1962, Princess was used on a deluxe version of the Austin/Morris 1300. * From September 1975, Princess was used as a name for mass-produced family cars in Leyland's 1800/2200 former Austin/Morris/Wolseley range. Naming State car of the President of Malta The first Austin Princess A120 was launched in 1947 as the most expensive flagship model in the Austin range at the same time as the A110 Austin Sheerline (designed during the war) which body was built on the same chassis at Longbridge, the A110 produced 10 less horsepower being fitted with a single carburetter. Both cars always had bodies that were massive and heavy in appearance. The Princess (model code A120) featured a body by the coachbuilder Vanden Plas and was a large saloon or limousine. The car was offered with two distinct interiors. The \\"DM\\" or limousine type had a sliding glass partition between the driver and rear passengers plus picnic tables, and the \\"DS\\" was the saloon. The saloons were successful as a top-executive car, many Princesses (and Sheerlines, for that matter) were bought for civic ceremonial duties or by hire companies as limousines for hire. The standard saloon weighed almost two tons, was 16 ft 9 inches long and 6 feet 1¬º inches wide on a 10-foot 1¬º-inch (the short) wheelbase. The Princess model was updated over the years through Mark I (A120), Mark II (A135) and Mark III versions, the largest variation being the introduction of the long-wheelbase version in 1952 with a longer body and seven seats: apart from that the bodywork and running gear hardly changed, nor did the 4-litre straight-6 engine. The radiator was fairly upright in old-fashioned style and the car had separate front wings, but these cars were always more modern in style than the equivalent-sized Bentley or Rolls-Royce and, for the saloon, the price was little more than two-thirds of the Rolls-Royce. From August 1957 the Austin part of the badging was dropped so it could be sold by Nuffield dealerships. From May 1960, the Vanden Plas name was added in front of \\"Princess\\". Austin Princess I, II and III In 1947, Austin produced two virtually identical chassis, one for the A110 (later A125 Sheerline, built entirely by Austin at their Longbridge factory) and the A120 (later A135) chassis used by Vanden Plas to produce the Princess at their Kingsbury works (North London). Although Vanden Plas was by now wholly owned by Austin and much of the running gear and instrumentation was the same in the two cars, the Princess was the Austin flagship, with a higher specification leather, wool and burr walnut interior. The original Princess was powered by a 3.5-litre straight-six engine. This was enlarged to a 4.0-litre unit without further modifications. The Princess was often built to order. Customers could specify the colour required and a range of different setups were available. These included triple or single carburetors and twin or single exhaust systems. Whilst the sportier multiple carb version performed better, it achieved only 12 to 14 mpg. The single carburetor version gave slightly better fuel consumption. Performance was good for a car of its size, with a top speed of and acceleration 0 to 60 mph in 20 seconds. In 1950, the Limousine version was introduced. The chassis length and passenger area were enlarged to enable a pair of drop down seats to be mounted on the rear of the front seats and a glass division was standard. These early cars are now extremely rare, especially the saloon versions. Many of the saloons were converted for use as taxis in the late 1950s, fitted with Perkins diesel engines for better economy. The 3993cc 6-cylinder engine was also fitted, as a petrol option seldom taken up, to the Austin and Morris normal- control (i.e. \\"bonneted\\") WEK and WFK commercial vehicles. During the life of this model (in 1952), Austin became part of the British Motor Corporation (BMC). File:Austin_A135_Princess_MkII_DS3_rear.jpgAustin A135 Princess II (DS3) Austin Princess IV and Princess IV The Austin Princess IV was introduced in 1956. Offered in Saloon and Touring Limousine models, this replacement for the former Sheerline and A135 only stayed in the catalogue until 1959; 200 were built.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945‚Äì1970, page 26 The last A135 Mark 3 had been priced at five times the price of an Austin A30. The new IV had to be priced at 6.5 times the price of an Austin A30, at which price there was almost no demand. The name was shortened in August 1957 when the car lost its \\"Austin\\" designation, now being branded simply as the Princess IV so it might be sold by either Morris or Austin dealers. The Times tested the Princess IV and reported on it at some length in early February 1959. The Princess IV was discontinued in 1959 and replaced in the catalogue by a much smaller model, an upgraded Austin Westminster (Pininfarina-designed Vanden Plas Princess see below), which retailed at little more than 40 per cent of the Mark IV's price. An Austin Princess IV was road tested by The Autocar magazine on 3 October 1958, as No.1703 in the series. The engine was rated at 150 bhp (gross) and it returned a maximum speed of 98.7 mph, under the test conditions prevailing. { Princess IV rear view } Austin Princess, Princess and Vanden Plas Princess Long Wheelbase Limousine (or Saloon) The Austin A135 Princess Long Wheelbase Saloon (DS6) and Limousine (DM4) were introduced in 1952. The automatic transmission and power steering from Princess IV were fitted from 1956.Graham Robson, The Cars of BMC, page 131 The marque name was changed from Austin to Princess in August 1957, and then to Vanden Plas from July 1960. The long wheelbase models continued to be built by hand in limited numbers as the Vanden Plas Princess 4-litre Limousine, until 1968. All now being parts of British Leyland, the Jaguar Mark X-based Daimler DS420 was initially produced at the Vanden Plas works in Kingsbury, North London then replaced the Vanden Plas Princess within the new, slightly rationalised range. This had been foreseen in 1966 when British Motor Holdings (BMH) had brought BMC and Jaguar together, and stopped development at Vanden Plas of the potential successor car. The limousine was luxuriously appointed with much polished wood, optional mohair rugs and radio with controls in the armrest. Among the long list of available extras were monograms and a flagstaff. The driving compartment was separated from the rear of the car by a division with an optional telephone for the passengers to communicate with the driver. The driving seat was finished in leather but the rear seats were trimmed in cloth, the usual arrangement on many luxury cars of the time. Though not as durable as leather, cloth was considered kinder to passengers' clothes. To increase seating capacity two occasional seats could be folded out of the floor. The car had independent coil suspension at the front with semi elliptic leaf springs and anti roll bar at the rear. The cam and peg type steering gear had optional power assistance.

Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth's surface and about 12% of the world's oceans. Much of the world's sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth's polar regions: the Arctic ice pack of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic ice pack of the Southern Ocean. Polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent, a natural process upon which depends the Arctic ecology, including the ocean's ecosystems. Due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, sea ice is very dynamic, leading to a wide variety of ice types and features. Sea ice may be contrasted with icebergs, which are chunks of ice shelves or glaciers that calve into the ocean. Depending on location, sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs.  General features and dynamics  Hypothetical sea ice dynamics scenario showing some of the most common sea ice features. Sea ice does not simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the combined action of winds, currents, water temperature, and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation. Sea ice is classified according to whether or not it is able to drift, and according to its age. = Fast ice versus drift (or pack) ice = Sea ice can be classified according to whether or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between shoals or to grounded icebergs). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, fast ice (from fastened). Alternatively, and unlike fast ice, drift ice occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the fast ice boundary. The drift ice zone may be further divided into a shear zone, a marginal ice zone and a central pack. Drift ice consists of floes, individual pieces of sea ice or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: small ‚Äì ; medium ‚Äì ; big ‚Äì ; vast ‚Äì ; and giant ‚Äì more than . The term pack ice is used either as a synonym to drift ice, or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely packed. The overall sea ice cover is termed the ice canopy from the perspective of submarine navigation. = Classification based on age = Another classification used by scientists to describe sea ice is based on age, that is, on its development stages. These stages are: new ice, nilas, young ice, first-year and old.  New ice, nilas and young ice  Nilas in Baffin Bay New ice is a general term used for recently frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice. It may consist of frazil ice (plates or spicules of ice suspended in water), slush (water saturated snow), or shuga (spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across). Other terms, such as grease ice and pancake ice, are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves. When sea ice begins to form on a beach with a light swell, ice eggs up to the size of a football can be created. Nilas designates a sea ice crust up to in thickness. It bends without breaking around waves and swells. Nilas can be further subdivided into dark nilas ‚Äì up to in thickness and very dark, and light nilas ‚Äì over in thickness and lighter in color. Young ice is a transition stage between nilas and first-year ice, and ranges in thickness from to , Young ice can be further subdivided into grey ice ‚Äì to in thickness, and grey-white ice ‚Äì to in thickness. Young ice is not as flexible as nilas, but tends to break under wave action. In a compression regime, it will either raft (at the grey ice stage) or ridge (at the grey-white ice stage).  First-year sea ice  Distinction between 1st year sea ice (FY), 2nd year (SY), multiyear (MY) and old ice. First-year sea ice is ice that is thicker than young ice but has no more than one year growth. In other words, it is ice that grows in the fall and winter (after it has gone through the new ice ‚Äì nilas ‚Äì young ice stages and grows further) but does not survive the spring and summer months (it melts away). The thickness of this ice typically ranges from to . First-year ice may be further divided into thin ( to ), medium ( to ) and thick (>).  Old sea ice  Old sea ice is sea ice that has survived at least one melting season (i.e. one summer). For this reason, this ice is generally thicker than first-year sea ice. Old ice is commonly divided into two types: second-year ice, which has survived one melting season, and multiyear ice, which has survived more than one. (In some sources, old ice is more than 2-years old.) Multi-year ice is much more common in the Arctic than it is in the Antarctic. The reason for this is that sea ice in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts. In the Arctic, much of the sea ice is land-locked. = Driving forces = While fast ice is relatively stable (because it is attached to the shoreline or the seabed), drift (or pack) ice undergoes relatively complex deformation processes that ultimately give rise to sea ice's typically wide variety of landscapes. Wind is thought to be the main driving force along with ocean currents. The Coriolis force and sea ice surface tilt have also been invoked. These driving forces induce a state of stress within the drift ice zone. An ice floe converging toward another and pushing against it will generate a state of compression at the boundary between both. The ice cover may also undergo a state of tension, resulting in divergence and fissure opening. If two floes drift sideways past each other while remaining in contact, this will create a state of shear. = Deformation = Sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes, as they are driven against each other. The end result may be of three types of features: 1) Rafted ice, when one piece is overriding another; 2) Pressure ridges, a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the keel) and upward (to make the sail); and 3) Hummock, an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A shear ridge is a pressure ridge that formed under shear ‚Äì it tends to be more linear than a ridge induced only by compression. A new ridge is a recent feature ‚Äì it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a weathered ridge is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees. Stamukhi are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice. Level ice is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation, and is therefore relatively flat. = Leads and polynyas = Leads and polynyas are areas of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air temperatures are below freezing, and provide a direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is important for the wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear ‚Äì they vary in width from meter to km scale. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes ‚Äì even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path, and submarines to surface more easily. Polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger ‚Äì two types are recognized: 1) Sensible-heat polynyas, caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) Latent-heat polynyas, resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.

Formation Satellite image of sea ice forming near St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea. Only the top layer of water needs to cool to the freezing point. Convection of the surface layer involves the top , down to the pycnocline of increased density. In calm water, the first sea ice to form on the surface is a skim of separate crystals which initially are in the form of tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than . Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called frazil or grease ice. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent ‚Äì that is the ice called nilas. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on to the bottom of the existing ice sheet, a process called congelation growth. This growth process yields first-year ice. In rough water, fresh sea ice is formed by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The uppermost layer of the ocean is supercooled to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (frazil ice) form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as grease ice. Frazil ice formation may also be started by snowfall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called pancake ice. These float on the ocean surface, and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated pancake ice. Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom. If sufficient snow falls on sea ice to depress the freeboard below sea level, sea water will flow in and a layer of ice will form of mixed snow/sea water. This is particularly common around Antarctica. Russian scientist Vladimir Vize (1886‚Äì1954) devoted his life to study the Arctic ice pack and developed the Scientific Prediction of Ice Conditions Theory, for which he was widely acclaimed in academic circles. He applied this theory in the field in the Kara Sea, which led to the discovery of Vize Island. Yearly freeze and melt cycle Seasonal variation and annual decrease of Arctic sea ice volume as estimated by measurement backed numerical modelling. Volume of arctic sea ice over time using a polar coordinate system draw method (time goes counter clockwise; one cycle per year) The annual freeze and melt cycle is set by the annual cycle of solar insolation and of ocean and atmospheric temperature, and of variability in this annual cycle. In the Arctic, the area of ocean covered by sea ice increases over winter from a minimum in September to a maximum in March or sometimes February, before melting over the summer. In the Antarctic, where the seasons are reversed, the annual minimum is typically in February and the annual maximum in September or October, and the presence of sea ice abutting the calving fronts of ice shelves has been shown to influence glacier flow and potentially the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet. The growth and melt rate are also affected by the state of the ice itself. During growth, the ice thickening due to freezing (as opposed to dynamics) is itself dependent on the thickness, so that the ice growth slows as the ice thickens. Likewise, during melt, thinner sea ice melts faster. This leads to different behaviour between multiyear and first year ice. In addition, melt ponds on the ice surface during the melt season lower the albedo such that more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to a feedback where melt is accelerated. The presence of melt ponds is affected by the permeability of the sea ice- i.e. whether meltwater can drain- and the topography of the sea ice surface, i.e. the presence of natural basins for the melt ponds to form in. First year ice is flatter than multiyear ice due to the lack of dynamic ridging, so ponds tend to have greater area. They also have lower albedo since they are on thinner ice, which blocks less of the solar radiation from reaching the dark ocean below. Monitoring and observations Changes in sea ice conditions are best demonstrated by the rate of melting over time. A composite record of Arctic ice demonstrates that the floes' retreat began around 1900, experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50 years. Satellite study of sea ice began in 1979, and became a much more reliable measure of long-term changes in sea ice. In comparison to the extended record, the sea-ice extent in the polar region by September 2007 was only half the recorded mass that had been estimated to exist within the 1950‚Äì1970 period. Arctic sea ice extent ice hit an all-time low in September 2012, when the ice was determined to cover only 24% of the Arctic Ocean, offsetting the previous low of 29% in 2007. Predictions of when the first \\"ice free\\" Arctic summer might occur vary. Antarctic sea ice extent gradually increased in the period of satellite observations, which began in 1979, until a rapid decline in southern hemisphere spring of 2016. Relationship to global warming and climate change As ice melts, the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them, forming these melt ponds in the Arctic. These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two. Sea ice provides an ecosystem for various polar species, particularly the polar bear, whose environment is being threatened as global warming causes the ice to melt more as the Earth's temperature gets warmer. Furthermore, the sea ice itself functions to help keep polar climates cool, since the ice exists in expansive enough amounts to maintain a cold environment. At this, sea ice's relationship with global warming is cyclical; the ice helps to maintain cool climates, but as the global temperature increases, the ice melts, and is less effective in keeping those climates cold. The bright, shiny surface (albedo) of the ice also serves a role in maintaining cooler polar temperatures by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space. As the sea ice melts, its surface area shrinks, diminishing the size of the reflective surface and therefore causing the earth to absorb more of the sun's heat. As the ice melts it lowers the albedo thus causing more heat to be absorbed by the Earth and further increase the amount of melting ice. Though the size of the ice floes is affected by the seasons, even a small change in global temperature can greatly affect the amount of sea ice, and due to the shrinking reflective surface that keeps the ocean cool, this sparks a cycle of ice shrinking and temperatures warming. As a result, the polar regions are the most susceptible places to climate change on the planet. Furthermore, sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. In the freezing process, much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations, though some remains frozen in the ice. This salt becomes trapped beneath the sea ice, creating a higher concentration of salt in the water beneath ice floes. This concentration of salt contributes to the salinated water's density, and this cold, denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold water moves along the ocean floor towards the equator, while warmer water on the ocean surface moves in the direction of the poles. This is referred to as \\"conveyor belt motion\\", and is a regularly occurring process. \\\\---- Image:Sea- ice-2013-en.svgChange in extent of the Arctic Sea ice between April and August, in 2013.

Modelling In order to gain a better understanding about the variability, numerical sea ice models are used to perform sensitivity studies. The two main ingredients are the ice dynamics and the thermodynamical properties (see Sea ice emissivity modelling, Sea ice growth processes and Sea ice thickness). There are a number of sea ice model computer codes available for doing this, including the CICE numerical suite. Many global climate models (GCMs) have sea ice implemented in their numerical simulation scheme in order to capture the Ice-albedo feedback correctly. Examples include: * The Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model is a numerical model of sea ice designed for climate studies and operational oceanography developed at Universit√© catholique de Louvain. It is coupled to the ocean general circulation model OPA (Ocean Parall√©lis√©) and is freely available as a part of the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean. * The MIT General Circulation Model is a global circulation model developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology includes a package for sea-ice. The code is freely available there. * The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research develops the Community Sea Ice Model. * CICE is run by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The project is open source and designed as a component of GCM, although it provides a standalone mode. * The Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model developed at Alfred Wegener Institute uses an unstructured grid. * The neXt Generation Sea-Ice model (neXtSIM) is a Lagrangian model using an adaptive and unstructured triangular mesh, and includes a new and unique class of rheological model called Maxwell-Elasto-Brittle to treat the ice dynamics. This model is developed at the Nansen Center in Bergen, Norway. The Coupled model intercomparison project offers a standard protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The coupling takes place at the atmosphere-ocean interface where the sea ice may occur. In addition to global modeling, various regional models deal with sea ice. Regional models are employed for seasonal forecasting experiments and for process studies. Ecology Sea ice is part of the Earth's biosphere. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain sympagic organisms such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the Bald notothen, fed upon in turn by larger animals such as Emperor penguins and Minke whales. A decline of seasonal sea ice puts the survival of Arctic species such as ringed seals and polar bears at risk.  See also  Rare phenomenon ‚Äì the formation of ball ice.

With the invasion of the Soviet Union, he served in Einsatzgruppe A before becoming a commander in the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and all RSHA personnel in Riga, Latvia. He attended the Wannsee Conference, and was largely responsible for implementing the murder of Latvia's Jewish population during Holocaust.  Early life and career  Lange was born in Wei√üwasser, Prussian Silesia, a town in present-day Saxony. His father was a railway construction supervisor. Lange finished high school in Sta√üfurt in 1928 and studied law in the University of Jena. He received a doctorate in law in 1933, and was recruited by the Gestapo office of Halle. He joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) in November 1933, but soon felt that this had been a bad career move. Thus, in 1936 Lange joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) (member number 290,308). As a mid-level Gestapo official, Lange rose rapidly. He adopted the SS ideology wholeheartedly, and resigned from the church in 1937. From 1936 he worked in the Gestapo office in Berlin. In May 1938, Lange was transferred to Vienna to supervise the annexation of the Austrian police system. There, he met and worked with Franz Walter Stahlecker, who later became his superior in Riga. In June 1939 Lange was transferred to Stuttgart. In September 1939 the security and police agencies of Nazi Germany (with the exception of the Orpo) were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) of the SS, headed by Reinhard Heydrich. The Gestapo became Amt IV (Department IV) of the RSHA and Heinrich M√ºller became the Gestapo Chief, with Heydrich as his immediate superior. From May to July 1940, Lange ran the Gestapo offices of Weimar and Erfurt, while working as the deputy head of the office of the Inspector of the SiPo in Kassel. In September 1940, Lange was promoted as the deputy head of police for Berlin. In April 1941, he was promoted to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer (major).  Mass murder in Latvia  On 5 June 1941 Lange was ordered to Pretzsch and the command staff of Einsatzgruppe A, headed by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer und Generalmajor der Polizei Dr. Franz Walter Stahlecker. Lange was a Teilkommando (detachment) leader in Einsatzkommando 2, or EK2. He was one of the few people aware of the F√ºhrerbefehl or \\"fundamental orders\\" for the so-called \\"Jewish problem\\" in Latvia. According to Lange himself: > From the very beginning, the goal of EK2 was that radical solution of the > Jewish problem by killing all Jews. On 3 December 1941, he was promoted as commander of EK2, replacing Eduard Strauch. Lange was also the area chief of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the Nazi Security Service, with the title Kommandant des Sicherheitsdienst. He was in charge of Department IV of the SD in Latvia. The department was the \\"hub of the whole SD organization in Latvia, the other departments served it.\\" Matters of formal rank and titles were never clear in the Nazi occupation regime for Latvia, as the lines of authority within agencies and the relationship between one agency and others were \\"ambiguous, overlapping, and unclear\\". Nevertheless, Lange is widely recognized as one of the primary perpetrators of the Holocaust in Latvia. His headquarters were in Riga, on Reimersa Street. From the beginning of his involvement in Latvia, Lange gave orders to squads of Latvians, such as the Arajs Kommando, that the Germans had organised to carry out massacres in the smaller cities. According to one historian, Victors ArƒÅjs was \\"held on a short leash\\" by Lange. Another local organisation receiving orders from Lange was the VagulƒÅns Kommando, which was responsible for the Jelgava massacres in July and August 1941. Lange also personally supervised executions conducted by the ArƒÅjs commando. He appears to have ordered that all the SD officers should personally participate in the killings. Lange was responsible for the Latvian part of the decision by the Nazi regime to deport Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia to Riga. In this connection, on 8 November 1941, he issued detailed orders to Hinrich Lohse, who was Reichskommissar Ostland, regarding the transport of 50,000 Jews to the East, with 25,000 going to Riga and 25,000 to Belarus. At the same time, Lange was organising the construction of the Salaspils concentration camp, originally intended to accommodate these deportees. Because the Salaspils camp would not be ready by the time the Jews would arrive, Lange decided to send the transports to an abandoned estate near Riga called Jungfernhof or Jumpravmuiza, which would be set up as Jungfernhof concentration camp. In November 1941 Lange was involved in the planning and carrying out the murder of 24,000 Latvian Jews from the Riga ghetto which occurred on 30 November and 8 December 1941. This crime has come to be known as the Rumbula massacre. In addition to the Latvian Jews, another 1,000 Jews from Germany were also murdered. They had been brought to Latvia on the first train of deportees, which arrived on 29 November 1941. Following the 29 November train, more rail transports of Jews began arriving in Riga from Germany, starting on 3 December 1941. The Jews on the first few transports were not immediately housed in the ghetto, but were left at Jungfernhof concentration camp. In May 1942, Lange issued orders to SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer G√ºnter Tabbert to kill the surviving Jews in the Daugavpils ghetto. Only about 450 Jews survived in Daugavpils after this action, which involved killing of the sick, children, infants and hospital workers. In addition to Tabbert, the Arajs Kommando of native Latvians was responsible for a major part of these killings. In 1942, Lange became an SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel) in the head office in Riga until 1945, when he became Head of Reichsgau Wartheland's SD and SiPo. He was promoted to SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel) in 1945.  Wannsee Conference  Lange was called to the Wannsee Conference by Heydrich in January 1942. Lange (an SS major) was the lowest-ranking officer present. Heydrich viewed Lange's first-hand experience in conducting the mass murder of deported Jews as valuable for the conference. Instead of Lange, Heydrich could have invited either Karl J√§ger or Erich Ehrlinger, who commanded the SiPo and SD in Lithuania and Belarus respectively, and were responsible for similar massacres. He chose Lange because Riga was the main deportation destination, and because Lange's doctorate made him seem more intellectual than the other two men. Lange's superior, Franz Walter Stahlecker, was not invited, as he was not familiar with the realities of the Jewish deportations and was not located in Riga. *(Note: One possible indication of Lange's low rank may perhaps be evident in Ian Kershaw's Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis, where the SS major twice is mistakenly referred to as Dr. \\"Otto\\" Lange.)  Disappearance  Early in 1945 Lange was appointed head of the SD and the SS in Pozna≈Ñ, Warthegau. Soon after he reached the city, Posen was surrounded by the Soviet Red Army and was declared a fortified city (Festung). Lange, who could not have any doubts about his destiny as a prisoner, directed the police under his command with fanaticism. He was wounded during the Battle of Pozna≈Ñ and the siege by Soviet forces and was promoted SS-Standartenf√ºhrer on 30 January 1945. At Hitler's behest, on 6 February 1945 he received the German Cross in gold. Lange may have died or committed suicide when the Red Army seized Pozna≈Ñ on 23 February 1945 after a last-ditch defence of the city by the remnants of the German garrison.  Character  Lange was said to have been a favourite student of Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler. He demanded unconditional obedience from his subordinates. Joseph Berman, a survivor of one of the concentration camps administered by Lange, described him as follows: > As far as Lange is concerned, he was the biggest murderer I have ever known. > To write a book about him would definitely not be enough. As he is dead, it > is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention that he was one of > the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much > that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the > motor pool or anywhere else. Lange made himself one of the most feared officials among those responsible for the Riga ghetto. He supervised the arrival of the transports, aided by SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Gerhard Maywald, whom historian Gertrude Schneider, a survivor of the Riga ghetto, describes as Lange's \\"sidekick\\". Lange personally shot a young man, Werner Koppel, who he felt was not opening a railway car door fast enough. Schneider described Lange's appearance: > Even though he was somewhat smaller and darker than the blond, blue-eyed > Maywald, he looked very handsome in his fur-collared uniform coat and seemed > every inch an officer and a gentleman. It never occurred to the newcomers to > suspect such a man of being a murderer.

It is located near the source of the River Tame. Historically part of Staffordshire in the Hundred of Offlow, at the 2011 Census the town has a population of 37,817. St Bartholomew's, Wednesbury History =Pre-Medieval and Medieval times= Wednesbury Clock Tower, built for the coronation of George V The substantial remains of a large ditch excavated in St Mary's Road in 2008, following the contours of the hill and predating the Early Medieval period, has been interpreted as part of a hilltop enclosure and possibly the Iron Age hillfort long suspected on the site. The first authenticated spelling of the name was Wodensbyri, written in an endorsement on the back of the copy of the will of Wulfric Spot, dated 1004. Wednesbury (\\"Woden's borough\\") is one of the few places in England to be named after a pre-Christian deity. During the Anglo-Saxon period there are believed to have been two battles fought in Wednesbury, in 592 and 715. According to The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle there was \\"a great slaughter\\" in 592 and \\"Ceawlin was driven out\\". Ceawlin was a king of Wessex and the second Bretwalda, or overlord of all Britain. The 715 battle was between Mercia (of which Wednesbury was part) and the kingdom of Wessex. Both sides allegedly claimed to have won the battle, although it is believed that the victory inclined to Wessex. Wednesbury was fortified by √Üthelfl√¶d (Ethelfleda), daughter of Alfred the Great and known as the Lady of Mercia. She erected five fortifications to defend against the Danes at Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford and Warwick, with Wednesbury in the centre. Wednesbury's fort would probably have been an extension of an older fortification and made of a stone foundation with a wooden stockade above. Earthwork ramparts and water filled ditches would probably have added to its strength. There is a plaque on the gardens between Ethelfleda Terrace and St Bartholomew's church stating that the gardens there ‚Äì created in the 1950s ‚Äì used stone from the graaf, or fighting platform, of the old fort. Exploration of the gardens reveals several dressed stones, which appear to be those referred to on the plaque. In 1086, the Domesday Book describes Wednesbury (Wadnesberie) as being a thriving rural community encompassing Bloxwich and Shelfield (now part of Walsall). During the Middle Ages the town was a rural village, with each family farming a strip of land with nearby heath being used for grazing. The town was held by the king until the reign of Henry II, when it passed to the Heronville family. During the 12th or 13th centuries, a motte and bailey castle (Wednesbury Castle) is believed to have been built in Wednesbury. Medieval Wednesbury was very small, and its inhabitants would appear to have been farmers and farm workers. In 1315, coal pits were first recorded, which led to an increase in the number of jobs. Nail making was also in progress during these times. William Paget was born in Wednesbury in 1505, the son of a nail maker. He became Secretary of State, a Knight of the Garter and an Ambassador. He was one of executors of the will of Henry VIII. =Post- Medieval times= An art installation on a local supermarket celebrating the town's industrial past In the 17th century Wednesbury pottery ‚Äì \\"Wedgbury ware\\" ‚Äì was being sold as far away as Worcester, while white clay from Monway Field was used to make tobacco pipes. By the 18th century the main occupations were coal mining and nail making. With the introduction of the first turnpike road in 1727 and the development of canals and later the railways came a big increase in population. In 1769 the canal banks were soon full of factories as in this year, the first Birmingham Canal was cut to link Wednesbury's coalfields to the Birmingham industries. In 1743 the Wesleys and their new Methodist movement were severely tested.Charles H. Goodwin, \\"Vile or reviled? The causes of the anti-Methodist riots at Wednesbury between May, 1743 and April, 1744 in the light of New England revivalism.\\" Methodist history 35#1 (1996): 14‚Äì28. Early in the year, John and Charles Wesley preached in the open air on the Tump.A step for travellers to get on or off their horses They were warmly received and made welcome by the vicar. Soon afterwards another preacher came and was rude about the current state of the Anglican clergy. This angered the vicar, and the magistrates published a notice ordering that any further preachers were to be brought to them. When Wesley next came his supporters were still there but a crowd of others heckled him and threw stones. Later the crowd came to his lodgings and took him to the magistrates, but they declined to have anything to do with Wesley or the crowd. The crowd ill-treated Wesley and nearly killed him but he remained calm. Eventually they came to their senses and returned him to his hosts. Soon afterward the vicar asked his congregation to pledge not to associate with Methodists, and some who refused to pledge had their windows smashed. Others who hosted Methodist meetings had the contents of their houses destroyed. This terrible episode came to an end in December when the vicar died. After that Anglican/Methodist relations were generally cordial. Methodism grew strongly and Wesley visited often, almost until his death.. Witness statements collected by John Wesley, quoted by Hackwood Francis Asbury, Richard Whatcoat and the Earl of Dartmouth are among those who attended Methodist meetings, all to have a profound effect on the United States. A steam tram service opened to Dudley, also serving Tipton, on 21 January 1884. The line was electrified in 1907 but discontinued in March 1930 on its replacement by Midland Red buses. Wednesbury was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1886, maintaining this status for 80 years until it was absorbed into an expanded borough of West Bromwich in 1966. In 1887, Brunswick Park was opened to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. 20th & 21st centuries Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery Stuckist show at Wednesbury, 2003 On the evening of 31 January 1916, Wednesbury was hit by one of the first wave of German Zeppelins aimed at Britain during the First World War. Joseph Smith and his three children were killed in their house in the King Street area. His wife survived, having left the house to investigate the cause of a loud noise at a nearby factory, caused by the first bombs falling. The first council houses in Wednesbury were built in the early 1920s, but progress was low compared to nearby towns including Tipton and West Bromwich. By 1930, a mere 206 families had been rehoused from slums. However, the building of council houses rose dramatically at the start of the 1930s, the 1,000th council house being occupied before the end of 1931. By 1935, some 1,250 older houses had been demolished or earmarked for demolition. By 1944 there were more than 3,000 council properties; by 1959, more than 5,000; the largest development in Wednesbury being the Hateley Heath estate in the late 1940s and early 1950s, which straddled the border of Wednesbury and West Bromwich. In 1947, the Corporation granted a licence for the operation of a cinema, on the condition that no children under 15 were to be admitted on Sundays. The cinema operator challenged this decision in court, claiming that the imposition of the condition was outside the Corporation's powers. The court used this case to establish a general test for overturning the decision of a public body in this type of case, which is now known as \\"Wednesbury unreasonableness\\". The borough of Wednesbury ceased to exist in 1966, with the majority being absorbed into West Bromwich, and small parts in the County Borough of Walsall. These changes saw the Dangerfield Lane estate (developed during the interwar and early postwar years) being absorbed into Darlaston (now part of an expanded Walsall borough), while the Wednesbury section of Hateley Heath was absorbed into West Bromwich township, and Wednesbury township gained the Friar Park estate from West Bromwich township.British History Online: West Bromwich Social Life West Bromwich amalgamated with Warley in 1974 to form the present-day borough of Sandwell.British Publishing: The Sandwell Official Guide Wednesbury has the postcode WS10, shared with Darlaston in the borough of Walsall. During the 1970s and 1980s, Wednesbury's traditional industry declined and unemployment rose, but since 1990 new developments such as a new light industrial estate, a retail park and the pedestrian-only Union Street have given a new look to the town. The traditional market is still a feature of the bustling centre, and the streets around Market Place are now a protected conservation area. In the late 1980s, a section of land near junction 9 of the M6 motorway was designated as the location for a new retail development. The first retailer to move onto the site was Ikea, who opened their superstore in January 1991. Throughout the 1990s, the retail park expanded to include several more large units, although most of these were empty by 2009 due to the recession. However, most of the units were occupied again by 2012 and the retail park is now home to retailers including Next, TK Maxx, Outfit, Boots, Curry's, B&Q; and B&M.; Curry's opened their original store on the site in 1995 in what was then Europe's largest electrical superstore, but within 10 years had relocated to an even bigger building on the retail park, with Next taking over the original Curry's building. The retail park was expanded in 2017 with the construction of more retail units and eateries, while the existing car park was remodelled to create more parking spaces.Sandwell MBC: Conservation Wednesbury was also the scene of two major tragedies during the second half of the 20th century. On 21 December 1977, four siblings aged between 4 and 12 years died in a house fire in School Road, Friar Park, at the height of the national firefighters strike. The house was demolished soon afterwards, leaving a gap in a terrace of council houses. On 24 September 1984, four pupils and a teacher from Stuart Bathurst RC High School were killed when their minibus was struck by a roll of steel which fell from the back of a lorry, on Wood Green Road close to the park keepers house.ref> For well over 100 years, Wednesbury was dominated by the huge Patent Shaft steel works, dating from the 19th century and active until closure in 1980, which escalated the rise in unemployment locally. The factory was demolished four years later, and by the mid-1990s it had been developed as a new light industrial estate. The iron gates of the factory are still in existence and have recently been mounted on the traffic island where the Holyhead Road passes the bus station, in tribute to the works. In 2003, Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery staged Stuck in Wednesbury,\\"Archive: Diary\\", stuckism.com.

An essay from the book is online at stuckism.com. Morrisons opened a supermarket in the town centre on 4 November 2007, creating some 350 new jobs. A number of council bungalows had been demolished, along with a section of the town centre shops, to make way for it. The archives for Wednesbury Borough are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service. =Oakeswell Hall= Second in importance to Wednesbury manor house was Oakeswell Hall, built c. 1421 by William Byng. The property descended to the family of Jennyns. By 1662 the house was known as Okeswell or Hopkins New Hall Place (it being adjacent to the Hopkins family's New Hall Fields). Richard Parkes, a Quaker ironmaster, bought it in 1707 and moved in the following year. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was a farmhouse. Between 1825 and 1962 it had several different owners, including Joseph Smith (the first town clerk) who greatly restored it. In 1962 it was demolished.Bev Parker A History of Wednesbury; accessed 5 June 2019 Dr Walter Chancellor Garman (1860‚Äì1923), a general practitioner, and his wife, Margaret Frances Magill lived at Oakeswell Hall. Their children included the Garman sisters who were associated with the Bloomsbury group. There were nine children, seven sisters and two brothers: Mary (1898), Sylvia (1899), Kathleen (1901), Douglas (1903), Rosalind (1904), Helen (1906), Mavin (1907), Ruth (1909) and Lorna (1911). Road transport Wednesbury is on Thomas Telford's London to Holyhead road, built in the early 19th century. The section between Wednesbury and Moxley was widened in 1997 to form a dual carriageway, completing the Black Country Spine Road that had been in development since 1995 when the route between Wednesbury and West Bromwich had opened, along with a one-mile route to the north of Moxley linking with the Black Country Route. The original plan was for a completely new route between Wednesbury and Moxley, but this was abandoned as part of cost-cutting measures, as were the planned grade-separated junctions, which were abandoned in favour of conventional roundabouts. The bus station, rebuilt in 2004, is in the town centre near the swimming baths with links to Wolverhampton, Birmingham, West Bromwich, Walsall and Dudley where connections can be made to the Merry Hill shopping centre. The previous direct link to Merry Hill was withdrawn due traffic congestion. Railways Wednesbury railway station in 2003 It is served by the West Midlands Metro light rail (tram) system, with stops at Great Western Street and Wednesbury Parkway. The maintenance depot is also here. It runs from Wolverhampton to Birmingham, and the line for a proposed extension to Brierley Hill is currently being cleared ready for the new track bed and electrification. It will utilize sections of the South Staffordshire Line alongside freight traffic which will run from Walsall to Brierley Hill via Wednesbury Town and Dudley but freight traffic may start later than the metro due to relaying of the track and assessing the space required for the joint line to work. It may also be used by tram-trains which can run on heavy rail. Between 1850 and 1993 the line built by the South Staffordshire Railway served Wednesbury. Passenger services were withdrawn after Wednesbury railway station closed in 1964 under the Beeching Axe,Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands: Wednesbury Town Station but a steel terminal soon opened on the site and did not close until December 1992, with the railway closing on 19 March 1993 after serving the town for nearly 150 years. Until 1972, the town was served by the Great Western Railway between Birmingham and Wolverhampton at Wednesbury Central station. Passenger trains were withdrawn at this time, with Wednesbury-Birmingham section of the line closing. The Wednesbury- Wolverhampton section survived for another decade, and between Wednesbury and Bilston, serving a scrapyard at Bilston, remained open until 30 August 1992 and was re-opened within seven years as part of the West Midlands Metro.

Demolition of the site took place in 1983. Metro Cammell set up business after buying the Old Park Works near the border with Darlaston from Patent Shaft in 1949, where it produced railway coach bodies, railway wagons and pressings for other factories in the group. The plant remained opened until 1989. F.H. Lloyd steelworks was formed at a site on Park Lane near the boundaries with Walsall and Darlaston during the 1880s, and provided employment for some 100 years. However, F.H. Lloyd was hit hard by the economic problems of the 1970s and early 1980s, and went out of business in 1982. Triplex Iron Foundry of Tipton then took the site over, but the new owners kept the factory open for just six years and it was then sold to Swedish home products company IKEA in 1988, being demolished almost immediately to make way for the superstore, which opened in January 1991. =Current= IKEA purchased the former F.H. Lloyd steel plant from Triplex in 1988, and opened one of its first British stores on the site in January 1991, just 14 months after the development had been given the go-ahead. Property developers J.J. Gallagher had purchased the bulk of the Lloyd site in 1988 and once mineshafts were filled in, decontamination was completed and the River Tame diverted, the land was suitable for mass retail development. A Cargo Club supermarket-style retail warehouse, part of the Nurdin and Peacock group, opened in July 1994. It was one of three Cargo Club stores in Britain, and the venture was not a success: by the end of 1995 it had been shut down following heavy losses. A B&Q; DIY superstore opened on the site in 1997. The next two units were opened in 1995 and let to Currys and PC World, and a Burger King fast food restaurant opened opposite. By this stage the area was known as Gallagher Retail Park and incorporated the nearby Ikea and Cargo Club stores. A further phase was completed in 2000, with Furniture Village, Furnitureland and ScS, while Currys moved to a new store in this phase (the largest electrical superstore in Europe on its completion) and their original unit was re-let to furniture retailer MFI, who remained there until the business went into liquidation eight years later. Pizza Hut and KFC opened fast food restaurants in 2002. Next and later TK Maxx, Outfit, Boots and Mamas & Papas opened in the refurbished phase next to Currys after they moved to the site, with the Next store being the first unit to open in this phase in late 2005. Both Currys and PC World are now known as 'Megastores'. In 2016, successful German supermarket chain Lidl opened a new distribution centre just off Wood Green Road, on land near Junction 9 Retail Park. New stores, including a Marks and Spencer Simply Food supermarket, Nandos, Smash Burger and Costa are due to open in 2017. Quantum print and packaging Limited employs 30 people since relocating to Wednesbury in 2013 from their Willenhall base. The Factory occupies a 30000 sq ft site in the town centre Cock-fighting ballad A ballad about cock-fighting in the town called \\"Wedgebury Cocking\\" or \\"Wednesbury Cocking\\" became well known in the 19th century. The ballad begins: > At Wednesbury there was a cocking, A match between Newton and Skrogging; The > colliers and nailers left work, And all to Spittles' went jogging To see > this noble sport. Many noted men there resorted, And though they'd but > little money, Yet that they freely sported.

Autopilot does not replace human operators. Instead, autopilot assists the operator's control of the vehicle, allowing the operator to focus on broader aspects of operations (for example, monitoring the trajectory, weather and on- board systems). When present, autopilot is often used in conjunction with an autothrottle, a system for controlling the power delivered by the engines. An autopilot system is sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"George\\" (e.g. \\"we'll let George fly for a while\\"). The etymology of the nickname is unclear: some claim it is a reference to inventor George De Beeson, who patented an autopilot in the 1930s, while others claim that Royal Air Force pilots coined the term during World War II to symbolize that their aircraft technically belonged to King George VI. First autopilots A World War II-era Honeywell C-1 autopilot control panel In the early days of aviation, aircraft required the continuous attention of a pilot to fly safely. As aircraft range increased, allowing flights of many hours, the constant attention led to serious fatigue. An autopilot is designed to perform some of the tasks of the pilot. The first aircraft autopilot was developed by Sperry Corporation in 1912. The autopilot connected a gyroscopic heading indicator and attitude indicator to hydraulically operated elevators and rudder. (Ailerons were not connected as wing dihedral was counted upon to produce the necessary roll stability.) It permitted the aircraft to fly straight and level on a compass course without a pilot's attention, greatly reducing the pilot's workload. Lawrence Sperry (the son of famous inventor Elmer Sperry) demonstrated it in 1914 at an aviation safety contest held in Paris. Sperry demonstrated the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers. Elmer Sperry Jr., the son of Lawrence Sperry, and Capt Shiras continued work on the same autopilot after the war, and in 1930 they tested a more compact and reliable autopilot which kept a US Army Air Corps aircraft on a true heading and altitude for three hours.\\"Now ‚Äì The Automatic Pilot\\" Popular Science Monthly, February 1930, p. 22. In 1930, the Royal Aircraft Establishment in the United Kingdom developed an autopilot called a pilots' assister that used a pneumatically-spun gyroscope to move the flight controls.\\"Robot Air Pilot Keeps Plane on True Course\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1930, p. 950. The autopilot was further developed, to include e.g. improved control algorithms and hydraulic servomechanisms. Adding more instruments such as radio-navigation aids made it possible to fly at night and in bad weather. In 1947 a US Air Force C-53 made a transatlantic flight, including takeoff and landing, completely under the control of an autopilot.Flightglobal/Archive Bill Lear developed his F-5 automatic pilot and automatic approach control system, and was awarded the Collier Trophy for 1949.Collier Trophy awards In the early 1920s, the Standard Oil tanker J.A. Moffet became the first ship to use an autopilot. The Piasecki HUP-2 Retriever was the first production helicopter with an autopilot. The lunar module digital autopilot of the Apollo program was an early example of a fully digital autopilot system in spacecraft. Modern autopilots The modern flight control unit of an Airbus A340Not all of the passenger aircraft flying today have an autopilot system. Older and smaller general aviation aircraft especially are still hand-flown, and even small airliners with fewer than twenty seats may also be without an autopilot as they are used on short- duration flights with two pilots. The installation of autopilots in aircraft with more than twenty seats is generally made mandatory by international aviation regulations. There are three levels of control in autopilots for smaller aircraft. A single-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the roll axis only; such autopilots are also known colloquially as \\"wing levellers,\\" reflecting their single capability. A two-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the pitch axis as well as roll, and may be little more than a wing leveller with limited pitch oscillation-correcting ability; or it may receive inputs from on-board radio navigation systems to provide true automatic flight guidance once the aircraft has taken off until shortly before landing; or its capabilities may lie somewhere between these two extremes. A three-axis autopilot adds control in the yaw axis and is not required in many small aircraft. Autopilots in modern complex aircraft are three-axis and generally divide a flight into taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise (level flight), descent, approach, and landing phases. Autopilots that automate all of these flight phases except taxi and takeoff exist. An autopilot-controlled landing on a runway and controlling the aircraft on rollout (i.e. keeping it on the centre of the runway) is known as a CAT IIIb landing or Autoland, available on many major airports' runways today, especially at airports subject to adverse weather phenomena such as fog. Landing, rollout, and taxi control to the aircraft parking position is known as CAT IIIc. This is not used to date, but may be used in the future. An autopilot is often an integral component of a Flight Management System. Modern autopilots use computer software to control the aircraft. The software reads the aircraft's current position, and then controls a flight control system to guide the aircraft. In such a system, besides classic flight controls, many autopilots incorporate thrust control capabilities that can control throttles to optimize the airspeed. The autopilot in a modern large aircraft typically reads its position and the aircraft's attitude from an inertial guidance system. Inertial guidance systems accumulate errors over time. They will incorporate error reduction systems such as the carousel system that rotates once a minute so that any errors are dissipated in different directions and have an overall nulling effect. Error in gyroscopes is known as drift. This is due to physical properties within the system, be it mechanical or laser guided, that corrupt positional data. The disagreements between the two are resolved with digital signal processing, most often a six-dimensional Kalman filter. The six dimensions are usually roll, pitch, yaw, altitude, latitude, and longitude. Aircraft may fly routes that have a required performance factor, therefore the amount of error or actual performance factor must be monitored in order to fly those particular routes. The longer the flight, the more error accumulates within the system. Radio aids such as DME, DME updates, and GPS may be used to correct the aircraft position. =Control Wheel Steering= Servomotor for Autopilot applications An option midway between fully automated flight and manual flying is Control Wheel Steering (CWS). Although it is becoming less used as a stand-alone option in modern airliners, CWS is still a function on many aircraft today. Generally, an autopilot that is CWS equipped has three positions: off, CWS, and CMD. In CMD (Command) mode the autopilot has full control of the aircraft, and receives its input from either the heading/altitude setting, radio and navaids, or the FMS (Flight Management System). In CWS mode, the pilot controls the autopilot through inputs on the yoke or the stick. These inputs are translated to a specific heading and attitude, which the autopilot will then hold until instructed to do otherwise. This provides stability in pitch and roll. Some aircraft employ a form of CWS even in manual mode, such as the MD-11 which uses a constant CWS in roll. In many ways, a modern Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft in Normal Law is always in CWS mode. The major difference is that in this system the limitations of the aircraft are guarded by the flight computer, and the pilot cannot steer the aircraft past these limits. =Computer system details= The hardware of an autopilot varies from implementation to implementation, but is generally designed with redundancy and reliability as foremost considerations. For example, the Rockwell Collins AFDS-770 Autopilot Flight Director System used on the Boeing 777 uses triplicated FCP-2002 microprocessors which have been formally verified and are fabricated in a radiation-resistant process. Software and hardware in an autopilot are tightly controlled, and extensive test procedures are put in place. Some autopilots also use design diversity. In this safety feature, critical software processes will not only run on separate computers and possibly even using different architectures, but each computer will run software created by different engineering teams, often being programmed in different programming languages. It is generally considered unlikely that different engineering teams will make the same mistakes. As the software becomes more expensive and complex, design diversity is becoming less common because fewer engineering companies can afford it. The flight control computers on the Space Shuttle used this design: there were five computers, four of which redundantly ran identical software, and a fifth backup running software that was developed independently. The software on the fifth system provided only the basic functions needed to fly the Shuttle, further reducing any possible commonality with the software running on the four primary systems.  Stability augmentation systems  A stability augmentation system (SAS) is another type of automatic flight control system; however, instead of maintaining the aircraft on a predetermined attitude or flight path, the SAS will actuate the aircraft flight controls to dampen out aircraft buffeting regardless of the attitude or flight path. SAS can automatically stabilize the aircraft in one or more axes. The most common type of SAS is the yaw damper which is used to eliminate the Dutch roll tendency of swept-wing aircraft. Some yaw dampers are integral to the autopilot system while others are stand- alone systems. Yaw dampers usually consist of a yaw rate sensor (either a gyroscope or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to determine the amount of rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed. There are two types of yaw dampers: series yaw dampers and parallel yaw dampers. The servo actuator of a parallel yaw damper will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the servo actuator of a series yaw damper is clutched to the rudder control quadrant and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move. Some aircraft have stability augmentation systems that will stabilize the aircraft in more than a single axis. The Boeing B-52, for example, requires both pitch and yaw SAS in order to provide a stable bombing platform. Many helicopters have pitch, roll and yaw SAS systems. Pitch and roll SAS systems operate much the same way as the yaw damper described above; however, instead of dampening out Dutch roll, they will dampen pitch and roll oscillations or buffeting to improve the overall stability of the aircraft.  Autopilot for ILS landings  Instrument-aided landings are defined in categories by the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO. These are dependent upon the required visibility level and the degree to which the landing can be conducted automatically without input by the pilot. CAT I ‚Äì This category permits pilots to land with a decision height of and a forward visibility or Runway Visual Range (RVR) of . Autopilots are not required. CAT II ‚Äì This category permits pilots to land with a decision height between and and a RVR of . Autopilots have a fail passive requirement. CAT IIIa -This category permits pilots to land with a decision height as low as and a RVR of . It needs a fail-passive autopilot. There must be only a 10‚àí6 probability of landing outside the prescribed area. CAT IIIb ‚Äì As IIIa but with the addition of automatic roll out after touchdown incorporated with the pilot taking control some distance along the runway. This category permits pilots to land with a decision height less than 50 feet or no decision height and a forward visibility of in Europe (76 metres, compare this to aircraft size, some of which are now over long) or in the United States. For a landing-without-decision aid, a fail-operational autopilot is needed. For this category some form of runway guidance system is needed: at least fail-passive but it needs to be fail-operational for landing without decision height or for RVR below . CAT IIIc ‚Äì As IIIb but without decision height or visibility minimums, also known as \\"zero-zero\\". Not yet implemented as it would require the pilots to taxi in zero-zero visibility. An aircraft that is capable of landing in a CAT IIIb that is equipped with autobrake would be able to fully stop on the runway but would have no ability to taxi. Fail-passive autopilot: in case of failure, the aircraft stays in a controllable position and the pilot can take control of it to go around or finish landing. It is usually a dual-channel system.

These checks were enacted by a legislature (sejm) controlled by the nobility (szlachta).

Other names include the Republic of Nobles () and the First Commonwealth (), the latter relatively common in Polish historiography. History The Union of Lublin joined the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1569. Poland and Lithuania underwent an alternating series of wars and alliances during the 14th century and early 15th century. Several agreements between the two (the Union of Krak√≥w and Vilna, the Union of Krewo, the Union of Wilno and Radom, the Union of Grodno, and the Union of Horod≈Ço) were struck before the permanent 1569 Union of Lublin. This agreement was one of the signal achievements of Sigismund II Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagiellon dynasty. Sigismund believed he could preserve his dynasty by adopting elective monarchy. His death in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system; these adjustments significantly increased the power of the Polish nobility and established a truly elective monarchy. The Commonwealth reached its Golden Age in the early 17th century. Its powerful parliament was dominated by nobles (Pic. 2) who were reluctant to get involved in the Thirty Years' War; this neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of contemporary Europe. The Commonwealth was able to hold its own against Sweden, the Tsardom of Russia, and vassals of the Ottoman Empire, and even launched successful expansionist offensives against its neighbors. In several invasions during the Time of Troubles, Commonwealth troops entered Russia and managed to take Moscow and hold it from 27 September 1610 to 4 November 1612, when they were driven out after a siege. Commonwealth power began waning after a series of blows during the following decades. A major rebellion of Ukrainian Cossacks in the southeastern portion of the Commonwealth (the Khmelnytskyi Uprising in modern-day Ukraine) began in 1648. It resulted in a Ukrainian request, under the terms of the Treaty of Pereyaslav, for protection by the Russian Tsar.. In 1651, in the face of a growing threat from Poland, and forsaken by his Tatar allies, Khmelnytsky asked the Tsar to incorporate Ukraine as an autonomous duchy under Russian protection. Russian annexation of part of Ukraine gradually supplanted Polish influence. The other blow to the Commonwealth was a Swedish invasion in 1655, known as the Deluge, which was supported by troops of Transylvanian Duke George II R√°k√≥czi and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. The Tatars of the Crimean Khanate and the Nogai Horde conducted almost annual slave-raids in the eastern territories controlled by the Commonwealth. In the late 17th century, the king of the weakened Commonwealth, John III Sobieski, allied with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I to deal crushing defeats to the Ottoman Empire. In 1683, the Battle of Vienna marked the final turning point in the 250-year struggle between the forces of Christian Europe and the Islamic Ottomans. For its centuries-long opposition to Muslim advances, the Commonwealth would gain the name of Antemurale Christianitatis (bulwark of Christianity).Poland, the knight among nations, Louis Edwin Van Norman, New York: 1907, p. 18 During the next 16 years, the Great Turkish War would drive the Turks permanently south of the Danube River, never again to threaten central Europe. By the 18th century, destabilization of its political system brought Poland to the brink of civil war. The Commonwealth was facing many internal problems and was vulnerable to foreign influences. An outright war between the King and the nobility broke out in 1715, and Tsar Peter the Great's mediation put him in a position to further weaken the state. The Russian army was present at the Silent Sejm of 1717, which limited the size of the armed forces to 24,000 and specified its funding, reaffirmed the destabilizing practice of liberum veto, and banished the king's Saxon army; the Tsar was to serve as guarantor of the agreement. Western Europe's increasing exploitation of resources in the Americas rendered the Commonwealth's supplies less crucial. By 1768, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth started to be considered by Russians as the protectorate of the Russian Empire (despite the fact that it was officially still an independent state).Andrzej Jezierski, Cecylia Leszczy≈Ñska, Historia gospodarcza Polski, 2003, s. 68. A majority of control over Poland was central to Catherine the Great's diplomatic and military strategies.Russia's Rise as a European Power, 1650‚Äì1750, Jeremy Black, History Today, Vol. 36 Issue: 8, August 1986 Attempts at reform, such as the Four-Year Sejm's May Constitution, came too late. The country was partitioned in three stages by the neighboring Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy. By 1795, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had been completely erased from the map of Europe. Poland and Lithuania were not re-established as independent countries until 1918. State organization and politics =Golden Liberty= Royal Election of 1573 The political doctrine of the Commonwealth was our state is a republic under the presidency of the King. Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when he said that Rex regnat et non-gubernat (\\"The King reigns but [lit. 'and'] does not govern\\"). The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a Senat and an elected king (Pic. 1). The king was obliged to respect citizens' rights specified in King Henry's Articles as well as in pacta conventa, negotiated at the time of his election. The monarch's power was limited in favor of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to uphold the Henrician Articles, which were the basis of Poland's political system (and included near-unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance). Over time, the Henrician Articles were merged with the pacta conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). The foundation of the Commonwealth's political system, the \\"Golden Liberty\\" (, a term used from 1573 on), included: * election of the king by all nobles wishing to participate, known as wolna elekcja (free election); * Sejm, the Commonwealth parliament which the king was required to hold every two years; * pacta conventa (Latin), \\"agreed-to agreements\\" negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier Henrician Articles. * religious freedom guaranteed by Warsaw Confederation Act 1573, * rokosz (insurrection), the right of szlachta to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms; * liberum veto (Latin), the right of an individual Sejm deputy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a \\"free veto\\" nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the liberum veto in provincial sejmiks; * konfederacja (from the Latin confederatio), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim. The three regions (see below) of the Commonwealth enjoyed a degree of autonomy. Each voivodship had its own parliament (sejmik), which exercised serious political power, including choice of pose≈Ç (deputy) to the national Sejm and charging of the deputy with specific voting instructions. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had its own separate army, treasury and most other official institutions. Golden Liberty created a state that was unusual for its time, although somewhat similar political systems existed in the contemporary city-states like the Republic of Venice.Joanna Olkiewicz, Naja≈õniejsza Republika Wenecka (Most Serene Republic of Venice), KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, 1972, Warszawa Both states were styled \\"Serenissima Respublica\\" or the \\"Most Serene Republic\\".Joseph Conrad, Notes on Life and Letters: Notes on Life and Letters, Cambridge University Press, 2004, , Google Print, p. 422 (notes) At a time when most European countries were headed toward centralization, absolute monarchy and religious and dynastic warfare, the Commonwealth experimented with decentralization, confederation and federation, democracy and religious tolerance. 2000\\\\. Especially pp. 9‚Äì11, 114, 181, 323. This political system unusual for its time stemmed from the ascendance of the szlachta noble class over other social classes and over the political system of monarchy. In time, the szlachta accumulated enough privileges (such as those established by the Nihil novi Act of 1505) that no monarch could hope to break the szlachta's grip on power. The Commonwealth's political system is difficult to fit into a simple category, but it can be tentatively described as a mixture of: * confederation and federation, with regard to the broad autonomy of its regions. It is, however, difficult to decisively call the Commonwealth either confederation or federation, as it had some qualities of both; * oligarchy, as only the szlachta (nobility)around 15% of the populationhad political rights; * democracy, since all the szlachta were equal in rights and privileges, and the Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). Also, the 15% of Commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights (the szlachta) was a substantially larger percentage than in majority European countries even in the nineteenth century; note that in 1820 in France only about 1.5% of the male adult population had the right to vote, and in 1840 in Belgium, only about 5%. * elective monarchy, since the monarch, elected by the szlachta, was Head of State; * constitutional monarchy, since the monarch was bound by pacta conventa and other laws, and the szlachta could disobey any king's decrees they deemed illegal. =Shortcomings= The Troelfth Cake, an allegory of the First Partition of Poland. Contemporary drawing by Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune The end of the Jagiellon dynasty in 1572after nearly two centuriesdisrupted the fragile equilibrium of the Commonwealth's government. Power increasingly slipped away from the central government to the nobility. When presented with periodic opportunities to fill the throne, the szlachta exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who would not establish a strong and long-lasting dynasty. This policy often produced monarchs who were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the nobility. Furthermore, aside from notable exceptions such as the able Transylvanian Stefan Batory (1576‚Äì86), the kings of foreign origin were inclined to subordinate the interests of the Commonwealth to those of their own country and ruling house. This was especially visible in the policies and actions of the first two elected kings from the Swedish House of Vasa, whose politics brought the Commonwealth into conflict with Sweden, culminating in the war known as The Deluge (1655), one of the events that mark the end of the Commonwealth's Golden Age and the beginning of the Commonwealth's decline. The Zebrzydowski rebellion (1606‚Äì1607) marked a substantial increase in the power of the Polish magnates, and the transformation of szlachta democracy into magnate oligarchy. The Commonwealth's political system was vulnerable to outside interference, as Sejm deputies bribedWilliam Christian Bullitt, Jr., The Great Globe Itself: A Preface to World Affairs, Transaction Publishers, 2005, , Google Print, pp. 42‚Äì43John Adams, The Political Writings of John Adams, Regnery Gateway, 2001, , Google Print, p. 242 by foreign powers might use their liberum veto to block attempted reforms. This sapped the Commonwealth and plunged it into political paralysis and anarchy for over a century, from the mid-17th century to the end of the 18th, while its neighbors stabilized their internal affairs and increased their military might. =Late reforms= Constitution of 3 May adopted in 1791 was the first modern constitution in Europe. The Commonwealth did eventually make a serious effort to reform its political system, adopting in 1791 the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which historian Norman Davies calls the first of its kind in Europe. The revolutionary Constitution recast the erstwhile Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth as a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian federal state with a hereditary monarchy and abolished many of the deleterious features of the old system. The new constitution: * abolished the liberum veto and banned the szlachta's confederations; * provided for a separation of powers among legislative, executive and judicial branches of government; * established \\"popular sovereignty\\" and extended political rights to include not only the nobility but the bourgeoisie; * increased the rights of the peasantry; * preserved religious tolerance (but with a condemnation of apostasy from the Catholic faith). These reforms came too late, however, as the Commonwealth was immediately invaded from all sides by its neighbors, which had been content to leave the Commonwealth alone as a weak buffer state, but reacted strongly to attempts by king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski and other reformers to strengthen the country. Russia feared the revolutionary implications of the May 3rd Constitution's political reforms and the prospect of the Commonwealth regaining its position as a European power. Catherine the Great regarded the May constitution as fatal to her influenceHenry Eldridge Bourne, The Revolutionary Period in Europe 1763 to 1815, Kessinger Publishing, 2005, , Google Print p. 161 and declared the Polish constitution Jacobinical.Wolfgang Menzel, Germany from the Earliest Period Vol. 4, Kessinger Publishing, 2004, , Google Print, p. 33 Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin drafted the act for the Targowica Confederation, referring to the constitution as the \\"contagion of democratic ideas\\".Isabel de Madariaga, Russia in the Age of Catherine the Great, Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2002, , Google Print p. 431 Meanwhile, Prussia and Austria used it as a pretext for further territorial expansion.

In the end, the May 3 Constitution was never fully implemented, and the Commonwealth entirely ceased to exist only four years after its adoption. Economy Cereals exports through Gda≈Ñsk, 1619‚Äì1799 The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the plantation system (serfs). Slavery was forbidden in Poland in the 15th century, and formally abolished in Lithuania in 1588, replaced by the second enserfment. Typically a nobleman's landholding comprised a folwark, a large farm worked by serfs to produce surpluses for internal and external trade. This economic arrangement worked well for the ruling classes in the early era of the Commonwealth, which was one of the most prosperous eras of the grain trade. The economic strength of Commonwealth grain trade waned from the late 17th century on. Trade relationships were disrupted by the wars, and the Commonwealth proved unable to improve its transport infrastructure or its agricultural practices. Serfs in the region were increasingly tempted to flee. The Commonwealth's major attempts at countering this problem and improving productivity consisted of increasing serfs' workload and further restricting their freedoms in a process known as export-led serfdom. Urban population of the Commonwealth was low compared to Western Europe. Exact numbers depend on calculation methods. According to one source, the urban population of the Commonwealth was about 20% of the total in the 17th century, compared to approximately 50% in the Netherlands and Italy (Pic. 7). Another source suggests much lower figures: 4‚Äì8% urban population in Poland, 34‚Äì39% in the Netherlands and 22‚Äì23% in Italy. The Commonwealth's preoccupation with agriculture, coupled with the szlachta's privileged position when compared to the bourgeoisie, resulted in a fairly slow process of urbanization and thus a rather slow development of industries. While similar conflicts among social classes may be found all over Europe, nowhere were the nobility as dominant at the time as in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. There is, however, much debate among historians as to which processes most affected those developments, since until the wars and crises of the mid-17th century the cities of the Commonwealth had not markedly lagged in size and wealth behind their western counterparts. The Commonwealth did have numerous towns and cities, commonly founded on Magdeburg rights. Some of the largest trade fairs in the Commonwealth were held at Lublin. See the geography section, below, for a list of major cities in the Commonwealth (commonly capitals of voivodships). Poland‚ÄìLithuania played a significant role in the supply of 16th century Western Europe by the export of three sorts of goods, notably grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland- and maritime trade. Coat of arms of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth on 15 ducats of Sigismund III from 1617 Although the Commonwealth was Europe's largest grain producer, the bulk of her grain was consumed domestically. Estimated grain consumption in the Polish Crown (Poland proper) and Prussia in 1560‚Äì70 was some 113,000 tons of wheat (or 226,000 ≈Çaszt ‚Äì a ≈Çaszt, or \\"last\\", being a large bulk measure; in the case of grain, about half a ton). Average yearly production of grain in the Commonwealth in the 16th Century was 120,000 tons, 6% of which was exported, while cities consumed some 19% and the remainder was consumed by the villages. Commonwealth grain achieved far more importance in poor crop years, as in the early 1590s and the 1620s, when governments throughout southern Europe arranged for large grain imports to cover shortfalls in their jurisdictions. Still, grain was by far the largest export commodity of the Commonwealth. The owner of a folwark usually signed a contract with merchants of Gda≈Ñsk, who controlled 80% of this inland trade, to ship the grain north to that seaport on the Baltic Sea. Many rivers in the Commonwealth were used for shipping purposes: the Vistula, Pilica, Bug, San, Nida, Wieprz, Neman. The rivers had relatively developed infrastructure, with river ports and granaries. Most of the river shipping moved north, southward transport being less profitable, and barges and rafts were often sold off in Gda≈Ñsk for lumber. Hrodna become an important site after formation of a customs post at August√≥w in 1569, which became a checkpoint for merchants travelling to the Crown lands from the Grand Duchy. From Gda≈Ñsk, ships, mostly from the Netherlands and Flanders, carried the grain to ports such as Antwerp and Amsterdam. Besides grain, other seaborne exports included carminic acid from Polish cochineal, lumber and wood-related products such as ash, and tar. The land routes, mostly to the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire such as the cities of Leipzig and Nuremberg, were used for export of live cattle (herds of around 50,000 head) hides, furs, salt, tobacco, hemp, cotton (mostly from Greater Poland) and linen. The Commonwealth imported wine, fruit, spices, luxury goods (e.g. tapestries, Pic. 5), clothing, fish, beer and industrial products like steel and tools. A few riverboats carried south imports from Gda≈Ñsk like wine, fruit, spices and herring. Somewhere between the 16th and 17th centuries, the Commonwealth's trade balance shifted from positive to negative. With the advent of the Age of Discovery, many old trading routes such as the Amber Road (Pic. 4) lost importance as new ones were created. Poland's importance as a caravan route between Asia and Europe diminished, while new local trading routes were created between the Commonwealth and Russia. Many goods and cultural artifacts continued to pass from one region to another via the Commonwealth. For example, Isfahan rugs imported from Persia to the Commonwealth were actually known in the West as \\"Polish rugs\\" (). Commonwealth currency included the z≈Çoty and the grosz. The City of Gda≈Ñsk had the privilege of minting its own coinage. Military The military of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth evolved from the merger of the armies of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The army was commanded by the Hetman. The most unusual formation of the army was the heavy cavalry in the form of the Polish winged hussars. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Navy never played a major role in the military structure, and ceased to exist in the mid-17th century. Commonwealth forces were engaged in numerous conflicts in the south (against the Ottoman Empire), the east (against the Tsardom of Muscovy, later known as the Russian Empire) and the north (the Kingdom of Sweden); as well as internal conflicts (most notably, numerous Cossack uprisings). For the first century or so, the Commonwealth military was usually successful, but became less so from around the mid-17th century. Plagued by insufficient funds, it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors. The Commonwealth was formed at the Union of Lublin of 1569 from the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The armies of those states differed from the organization common in the west of Europe, as according to Bardach, the mercenary formations (Polish: wojsko najemne), common there, never gained popularity in Poland.Juliusz Bardach, Boguslaw Lesnodorski, and Michal Pietrzak, Historia panstwa i prawa polskiego (Warsaw: Paristwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe), 1987, p. 229 Brzezinski, however, notes that foreign mercenaries did form a significant portion of the more elite infantry units, at least till the early 17th century.Brzezinski (1988), p. 6. In the 15th century Poland, several other formations formed the core of the military.Bardach et al. (1987), pp. 229‚Äì230. There was a small standing army, obrona potoczna (\\"continuous defense\\") about 1,500‚Äì3,000 strong, paid for by the king, and primarily stationed at the troubled south and eastern borders.Brzezinski (1987), p. 10. It was supplemented by two formations mobilized in case of war: the pospolite ruszenie (Polish lev√©e en masse ‚Äì feudal levy of mostly noble knights-landholders), and the wojsko zaciƒô≈ºne, recruited by the Polish commanders for the conflict (it differed from Western mercenary formations in that it was commanded by Polish officers, and dissolved after the conflict has ended). Several years before the Union of Lublin, the Polish obrona potoczna was reformed, as the Sejm (national parliament of Poland) legislated in 1562‚Äì1563 the creation of wojsko kwarciane (named after kwarta tax levied on the royal lands for the purpose of maintaining this formation). This formation was also paid for by the king, and in the peacetime, numbered about 3,500‚Äì4,000 men according to Bardach; Brzezinski gives the range of 3,000‚Äì5,000. It was composed mostly of the light cavalry units manned by nobility (szlachta) and commanded by hetmans.Bardach et al. (1987), pp. 227‚Äì228. Often, in wartime, the Sejm would legislate a temporary increase in the size of the wojsko kwarciane. Following the end of the Commonwealth, Polish military tradition would be continued by the Napoleonic Polish Legions and the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw. Culture =Science and literature= Multi-stage rocket, from Kazimierz Siemienowicz's Artis Magn√¶ Artilleri√¶ pars prima The Commonwealth was an important European center for the development of modern social and political ideas. It was famous for its rare quasi-democratic political system, praised by philosophers, and during the Counter-Reformation was known for near-unparalleled religious tolerance, with peacefully coexisting Roman Catholic, Jewish, Orthodox Christian, Protestant and Muslim (Sufi) communities. In the 18th century, the French Catholic Rulhiere wrote of 16th century Poland: \\"This country, which in our day we have seen divided on the pretext of religion, is the first state in Europe that exemplified tolerance. In this state, mosques arose between churches and synagogues.\\" The Commonwealth gave rise to the famous Christian sect of the Polish Brethren, antecedents of British and American Unitarianism. With its political system, the Commonwealth gave birth to political philosophers such as Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503‚Äì1572) (Pic. 9), Wawrzyniec Grzyma≈Ça Go≈õlicki (1530‚Äì1607) and Piotr Skarga (1536‚Äì1612). Later, works by Stanis≈Çaw Staszic (1755‚Äì1826) and Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (1750‚Äì1812) helped pave the way for the Constitution of 3 May 1791, which Norman Davies calls the first of its kind in Europe. Go≈õlicki's The Counsellor published in England in 1598 Krak√≥w's Jagiellonian University is one of the oldest universities in the world (established in 1364), together with the Jesuit Academy of Wilno (established in 1579) they were the major scholarly and scientific centers in the Commonwealth. The Komisja Edukacji Narodowej, Polish for Commission for National Education, formed in 1773, was the world's first national Ministry of Education. Commonwealth scientists included: Martin Kromer (1512‚Äì1589), historian and cartographer; Micha≈Ç Sƒôdziw√≥j (1566‚Äì1636), alchemist and chemist; Jan Bro≈ºek (Ioannes Broscius in Latin) (1585‚Äì1652), polymath: a mathematician, physician and astronomer; Krzysztof Arciszewski (Crestofle d'Artischau Arciszewski in Portuguese) (1592‚Äì1656), engineer, ethnographer, general and admiral of the Dutch West Indies Company army in the war with the Spanish Empire for control of Brazil; Kazimierz Siemienowicz (1600‚Äì1651), military engineer, artillery specialist and a founder of rocketry; Johannes Hevelius (1611‚Äì1687), astronomer, founder of lunar topography; Micha≈Ç Boym (1612‚Äì1659), orientalist, cartographer, naturalist and diplomat in Ming Dynasty's service (Pic. 11); Adam Adamandy Kocha≈Ñski (1631‚Äì1700), mathematician and engineer; Baal Shem Tov (◊î◊ë◊¢◊ú ◊©◊ù ◊ò◊ï◊ë in Hebrew) (1698‚Äì1760), considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism; Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt (1728‚Äì1810), astronomer and mathematician (Pic. 12); Jan Krzysztof Kluk (1739‚Äì1796), naturalist, agronomist and entomologist, John Jonston (1603‚Äì1675) scholar and physician, descended from Scottish nobility. In 1628 the Czech teacher, scientist, educator, and writer John Amos Comenius took refuge in the Commonwealth, when the Protestants were persecuted under the Counter Reformation. The works of many Commonwealth authors are considered classics, including those of Jan Kochanowski (Pic. 10), Wac≈Çaw Potocki, Ignacy Krasicki, and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz. Many szlachta members wrote memoirs and diaries. Perhaps the most famous are the Memoirs of Polish History by Albrycht Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1595‚Äì1656) and the Memoirs of Jan Chryzostom Pasek (ca. 1636‚Äìca. 1701). Jakub Sobieski (1590‚Äì1646) (father of John III Sobieski) wrote notable diaries. During the Khotyn expedition in 1621 he wrote a diary called Commentariorum chotinensis belli libri tres (Diary of the Chocim War), which was published in 1646 in Gda≈Ñsk. It was used by Wac≈Çaw Potocki as a basis for his epic poem, Transakcja wojny chocimskiej (The Progress of the War of Chocim). He also authored instructions for the journey of his sons to Krak√≥w (1640) and France (1645), a good example of liberal education of the era. =Art and music= An example of a coffin portrait from the mid-17th century The two great religious cultures of the Commonwealth, Latin and Eastern Orthodox, coexisted and penetrated each other, which is reflected in the great popularity of icons (Pic. 13) and the icons resembling effigies of Mary, as well as the metal dresses typical of the Orthodox Church in the predominantly Latin territories of today's Poland (Black Madonna) and Lithuania (Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn). The implementation of post-Renaissance naturalism and the sentimentality of the Polish baroque in Orthodox painting as well as the creation of the Cossack Baroque style in architecture, also inspired by Polish patterns, were the major factors of Latin infiltration into Eastern Orthodox art (Pic. 3). A common art form of the Sarmatian period were coffin portraits, particular to the culture of the Commonwealth, used in funerals and other important ceremonies. As a rule, such portraits were nailed to sheet metal, six- or eight- sided in shape, fixed to the front of a coffin placed on a high, ornate catafalque. Franciszek Salezy Potocki in Sarmatian attire, wearing a red kontusz adorned by a gold-silk pas with blue sash of the Order of the White Eagle and a karabela sword. Portrait by Bacciarelli Another characteristic is common usage of black marble. Altars, fonts, portals, balustrades, columns, monuments, tombstones, headstones and whole rooms (e.g. Marble Room at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, St. Casimir Chapel of the Wilno Cathedral and Vasa Chapel of the Wawel Cathedral) were decorated with black marble. Music was a common feature of religious and secular events. To that end many noblemen founded church and school choirs, and employed their own ensembles of musicians. Some, like Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski built their own opera houses (in Nowy Wi≈õnicz). Yet others, like Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz and Krzysztof Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç were known for their sponsorship of arts which manifested itself in their permanently retained orchestras, at their courts in Wilno. Musical life further flourished during the reign of the Vasas. Both foreign and domestic composers were active in the Commonwealth. King Sigismund III brought in Italian composers and conductors, such as Luca Marenzio, Annibale Stabile, Asprilio Pacelli, Marco Scacchi and Diomedes Cato for the royal orchestra. Notable home grown musicians, who also composed and played for the King's court, included Bart≈Çomiej Pƒôkiel, Jacek R√≥≈ºycki, Adam Jarzƒôbski, Marcin Mielczewski, Stanis≈Çaw Sylwester Szarzy≈Ñski, Damian Stachowicz, Miko≈Çaj Ziele≈Ñski and Grzegorz Gorczycki. Wilan√≥w Palace, completed in 1696, exemplifies the opulence of royal and noble residences in the Commonwealth. Magnates often undertook construction projects as monuments to themselves: churches, cathedrals, monasteries (Pic. 14), and palaces like the present-day Presidential Palace in Warsaw and Pidhirtsi Castle built by Grand Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski herbu Pob√≥g. The largest projects involved entire towns, although in time many of them would lapse into obscurity or be totally abandoned. Usually they were named after the sponsoring magnate. Among the most famous is the town of Zamo≈õƒá, founded by Jan Zamoyski and designed by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando. The magnates throughout Poland competed with the kings. The monumental castle Krzy≈ºtop√≥r, built in the style palazzo in fortezza between 1627 and 1644, had several courtyards surrounded by fortifications. Due to efforts of powerful Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, the town of Nesvizh in today's Belarus came to exercise significant influence in many domains ‚Äì the Nesvizh manufactures of firearm, carpets, kontusz sashes and tapestries as well as school of painting produced renowned and luxury items. The fascination with the culture and art of the Orient in the late Baroque period is reflected by Queen Marie's Chinese Palace in Zolochiv. 18th century magnate palaces represents the characteristic type of Baroque suburban residence built entre cour et jardin (between the entrance court and the garden). Its architecture ‚Äì a merger of European art with old Commonwealth building traditions are visible in Wilan√≥w Palace in Warsaw (Pic. 15), Branicki Palace in Bia≈Çystok and in Warsaw, Potocki Palace in Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski and in Krystynopol, Raczy≈Ñski Palace in Rogalin and Sapieha Palace in Ruzhany. =Szlachta and Sarmatism= The First Lady of the Republic, W ka≈ºdym razie \\"kr√≥lowa bez korony i pierwsza dama Rzeczypospolitej\\", jak wsp√≥≈Çcze≈õni okre≈õlali SieniawskƒÖ, zas≈Çuguje na biografiƒô naukowƒÖ. El≈ºbieta Sieniawska, portrayed in Sarmata pose and in male coat delia The prevalent ideology of the szlachta became \\"Sarmatism\\", named after the Sarmatians, alleged ancestors of the Poles. This belief system was an important part of szlachta culture, penetrating all aspects of its life. Sarmatism enshrined equality among szlachta, horseback riding, tradition, provincial rural life, peace and pacifism; championed oriental-inspired attire (≈ºupan, kontusz, sukmana, pas kontuszowy, delia, szabla); and served to integrate the multi-ethnic nobility by creating an almost nationalistic sense of unity and of pride in the Golden Freedoms. In its early, idealistic form, Sarmatism represented a positive cultural movement: it supported religious belief, honesty, national pride, courage, equality and freedom. In time, however, it became distorted. Late extreme Sarmatism turned belief into bigotry, honesty into political na√Øvet√©, pride into arrogance, courage into stubbornness and freedom into anarchy.Andrzej Wasko, Sarmatism or the Enlightenment: The Dilemma of Polish Culture, Sarmatian Review XVII:2, online The faults of Sarmatism were blamed for the demise of the country from the late 18th century onwards. Criticism, often one-sided and exaggerated, was used by the Polish reformists to push for radical changes. This self-deprecation was accompanied by works of Prussian, Russian and Austrian historians, who tried to prove that it was Poland itself that was to blame for its fall.Dziejochciejstwo, dziejokrƒôtactwo, Janusz Tazbir, Polityka 6 (2591) 10 February 2007 (in Polish) =Demographics and religion= Some social strata in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth's society ‚Äì 1655. From left: Jew, barber surgeon, painter, butcher, musician, tailor, barmaid, pharmacist, shoemaker, goldsmith, merchant and Armenian Population density per voivodeships in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1650 The Commonwealth comprised various identities: Poles, Lithuanians, Czechs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Ruthenians (Belarusians and Ukrainians), and Vlachs (Romanians). Sometimes, inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were called Litvins, a Slavic term for people from Lithuania, regardless of their ethnicity (with the exception of Jews, who were called Litvaks). Shortly after the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Commonwealth's population was around 7 million, with roughly 4.5 million Poles, 750,000 Lithuanians, 700,000 Jews and 2 million Ruthenians. In 1618, after the Truce of Deulino, the Commonwealth population increased together with its territory, reaching 12 million people, which was composed roughly of 4.5 million Poles, 3.5 million Ukrainians, 1.5 million Belarusians, 750,000 Lithuanians, 750,000 Old Prussians, 500,000 Jews, and 500,000 Livonians. At that time nobility was 10% of the population, and burghers were 15%. The average population density per square kilometer was: 24 in Mazovia, 23 in Lesser Poland, 19 in Great Poland, 12 in Lublin palatinate, 10 in the Lvov area, 7 in Podolia and Volhynia, and 3 in Ukraine. There was a tendency for the people from the more densely inhabited western territories to migrate eastwards.R. B. Wernham, The new Cambridge modern history: The Counter-Reformation and price revolution, 1559‚Äì1610, 1968, Cambridge University Press, Google print p. 377 In the period from 1648 to 1657, populations losses are estimated at 4 m. Coupled with further population and territorial losses, in 1717 the Commonwealth population had fallen to 9 m, with roughly 4.5 m/50% Poles, 1.5 m/17% Ukrainians, 1.2 m Belarusians, 0.8 m Lithuanians, 0.5 m Jews, and 0.5 m others.Based on 1618 population map (p. 115), 1618 languages map (p119), 1657‚Äì67 losses map (p. 128) and 1717 map (p. 141) from Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski, Poland a Historical Atlas, Hippocrene Books, 1987, Just before the first partition of Poland, the Commonwealth's population stood at some 14 million, including around 1 million nobles,Matthew P.

A History of Poland, Vol. 1: The Origins to 1795, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present. Oxford: Oxford University Press. / Poland has a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century. Complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in Poland in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Poland kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.Zamoyski, Adam. The Polish Way. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987 The Commonwealth was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge. In 1561 Bonifacio d‚ÄôOria, a religious exile living in Poland, wrote of his adopted country's virtues to a colleague back in Italy: \\"You could live here in accordance with your ideas and preferences, in great, even the greatest freedoms, including writing and publishing. No one is a censor here.\\" > \\"This country became a place of shelter for heretics\\" ‚Äì Cardinal Hosius, > papal legate to Poland. Original act of the Warsaw Confederation in 1573, the first act of religious freedom in Europe To be Polish, in remote and multi-ethnic parts of the Commonwealth, was then much less an index of ethnicity than of religion and rank; it was a designation largely reserved for the landed noble class (szlachta), which included Poles, but also many members of non-Polish origin who converted to Catholicism in increasing numbers with each following generation. For the non-Polish noble such conversion meant a final step of Polonization that followed the adoption of the Polish language and culture.Linda Gordon, Cossack Rebellions: Social Turmoil in the Sixteenth Century Ukraine, SUNY Press, 1983, , Google Print, p. 51 Poland, as the culturally most advanced part of the Commonwealth, with the royal court, the capital, the largest cities, the second-oldest university in Central Europe (after Prague), and the more liberal and democratic social institutions had proven an irresistible magnet for the non-Polish nobility in the Commonwealth. Many referred to themselves as \\"gente Ruthenus, natione Polonus\\" (Ruthenian by blood, Polish by nationality) since the 16th century onwards. As a result, in the eastern territories a Polish (or Polonized) aristocracy dominated a peasantry whose great majority was neither Polish nor Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge colonization efforts to nowadays Ukraine, heightening the tensions among nobles, Jews, Cossacks (traditionally Orthodox), Polish and Ruthenian peasants. The latter, deprived of their native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, turned for protection to cossacks that facilitated violence that in the end broke the Commonwealth. The tensions were aggravated by conflicts between Eastern Orthodoxy and the Greek Catholic Church following the Union of Brest, overall discrimination of Orthodox religions by dominant Catholicism,\\"Poland, history of\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Premium Service. .

In the west and north, many cities had sizable German minorities, often belonging to Lutheran or Reformed churches. The Commonwealth had also one of the largest Jewish diasporas in the world ‚Äì by the mid-16th century 80% of the world's Jews lived in Poland (Pic. 16). Until the Reformation, the szlachta were mostly Catholic or Eastern Orthodox (Pic. 3, 13). However, many families quickly adopted the Reformed religion. After the Counter-Reformation, when the Catholic Church regained power in Poland, the szlachta became almost exclusively Catholic, despite the fact that Catholicism was not a majority religion (the Catholic and Orthodox churches counted approximately 40% of the population each, while the remaining 20% were Jews and members of various Protestant churches). The Crown had about double the population of Lithuania and five times the income of the latter's treasury. As with other countries, the borders, area and population of the Commonwealth varied over time. After the Peace of Jam Zapolski (1582), the Commonwealth had approximately 815,000 km2 area and a population of 7.5 million. After the Truce of Deulino (1618), the Commonwealth had an area of some 990,000 km2 and a population of 11‚Äì12 million (including some 4 million Poles and close to a million Lithuanians). =Languages= First anniversary anthem of the Constitution of 3 May 1791 (1792) in Hebrew, Polish, German and French * Polish ‚Äì officially recognized; dominant language, used by most of the Commonwealth's nobilityAnatol Lieven, The Baltic Revolution: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence, Yale University Press, 1994, , Google Print, p. 48Stephen Barbour, Cathie Carmichael, Language and Nationalism in Europe, Oxford University Press, 2000, , Google Print p. 184√ñsten Dahl, Maria Koptjevskaja- Tamm, The Circum-Baltic Languages: Typology and Contact, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2001, , Google Print, p. 45Glanville Price, Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe, Blackwell Publishing, 1998, , Google Print, p. 30 and by the peasantry in the Crown province;Mikulas Teich & Roy Porter, The National Question in Europe in Historical Context, Cambridge University Press, 1993, , Google Print, p. 295 official language in the Crown chancellery and since 1697 in the Grand Duchy chancellery.Kevin O'Connor, Culture And Customs of the Baltic States, Greenwood Press, 2006, , Google Print, p. 115 Dominant language in the towns. * Latin ‚Äì off. recog.; commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility.Karin Friedrich et al., The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569‚Äì1772, Cambridge University Press, 2000, , Google Print, p. 88 * French ‚Äì not officially recognized; replaced Latin at the royal court in Warsaw in the beginning of the 18th century as a language used in foreign relations and as genuine spoken language.

Legacy The Duchy of Warsaw, established in 1807, traced its origins to the Commonwealth. Other revival movements appeared during the November Uprising (1830‚Äì31), the January Uprising (1863‚Äì64) and in the 1920s, with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's failed attempt to create a Polish-led Miƒôdzymorze (\\"Between-Seas\\") federation that would have included Lithuania and Ukraine. Today's Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the Commonwealth,A. stated, for instance by the preamble of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 1997. whereas the Republic of Lithuania, re-established at the end of World War I, saw the participation of the Lithuanian state in the old Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth mostly in a negative light at the early stages of regaining its independence,Alfonsas Eidintas, Vytautas Zalys, Lithuania in European Politics: The Years of the First Republic, 1918‚Äì1940, Palgrave, 1999, . Print, p. 78 although this attitude has been changing recently. Administrative divisions While the term \\"Poland\\" was also commonly used to denote this whole polity, Poland was in fact only part of a greater wholethe Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which comprised primarily two parts: * the Crown of the Polish Kingdom (Poland proper), colloquially \\"the Crown\\" * the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, colloquially \\"Lithuania\\" The Commonwealth was further divided into smaller administrative units known as voivodeships (wojew√≥dztwa). Each voivodeship was governed by a Voivode (wojewoda, governor). Voivodeships were further divided into starostwa, each starostwo being governed by a starosta. Cities were governed by castellans. There were frequent exceptions to these rules, often involving the ziemia subunit of administration. The lands that once belonged to the Commonwealth are now largely distributed among several Central and East European countries: Poland, Ukraine, Moldova (Transnistria), Belarus, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Also some small towns in Slovakia, then within the Kingdom of Hungary, became a part of Poland in the Treaty of Lubowla. Other notable parts of the Commonwealth, without respect to region or voivodeship divisions, include: * Lesser Poland (), southern Poland, with two largest cities, its capital at Krak√≥w and Lublin in the north-east; * Greater Poland (), west‚Äìcentral Poland around Pozna≈Ñ and the Warta River system; * Mazovia (), central Poland, with its capital at Warsaw; * Lithuania Proper (), northwest Grand Duchy, its most Catholic and ethnically Lithuanian part, capital Vilnius; * Duchy of Samogitia (; ), westernmost and most autonomous part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, also the western part of Lithuania Proper, capital Raseiniai; * Royal Prussia (), at the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, was an autonomous area since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), incorporated into the Crown in 1569 with the Commonwealth's formation; **Pomerelia (), Pomerania around Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig), western part of Royal Prussia; * Ruthenia (), the eastern Commonwealth, adjoining Russia; * Duchy of Livonia (), a joint domain of the Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Parts lost to Sweden in the 1620s and in 1660; * Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (; ), a northern fief of the Commonwealth. It established a colony in Tobago in 1637 and on St. Andrews Island at the Gambia River in 1651 (see Couronian colonization); * Silesia () was not within the Commonwealth, but small parts belonged to various Commonwealth kings; in particular, the Vasa kings were dukes of Opole (Oppeln) and Racib√≥rz (Ratibor) from 1645 to 1666. Commonwealth borders shifted with wars and treaties, sometimes several times in a decade, especially in the eastern and southern parts. After the Peace of Jam Zapolski (1582), the Commonwealth had approximately 815,000 km2 area and a population of 7.5 million. After the Truce of Deulino (1618), the Commonwealth had an area of some 1 million km2 (990,000 km2) and a population of about 11 million. Geography Topographical map of the Commonwealth in 1764 In the 16th century, the Polish bishop and cartographer Martin Kromer published a Latin atlas, entitled Poland: about Its Location, People, Culture, Offices and the Polish Commonwealth, which was regarded as the most comprehensive guide to the country. Kromer's works and other contemporary maps, such as those of Gerardus Mercator, show the Commonwealth as mostly plains. The Commonwealth's southeastern part, the Kresy, was famous for its steppes. The Carpathian Mountains formed part of the southern border, with the Tatra Mountain chain the highest, and the Baltic Sea formed the Commonwealth's northern border. As with most European countries at the time, the Commonwealth had extensive forest cover, especially in the east. Today, what remains of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest constitutes the last largely intact primeval forest in Europe.

He was a war criminal who perpetrated mass murder and genocide in German-occupied Poland during the Holocaust.  Early life  Karl Georg Sch√∂ngarth was born on 22 April 1903 in Leipzig, Germany,. His father was a master brewer. Sch√∂ngarth began high school at the age of 11, but soon dropped out in order to work at a garden center to support the war effort. On 7 March 1918 Sch√∂ngarth was awarded a ‚ÄúYoung Men's Iron Medal‚Äù. After the war, he was to go back to high school to complete his education, but instead joined a Freikorps paramilitary group in Thuringia. This eventually lead to Sch√∂ngarth joining a local Nazi group in Erfurt on November 1923, as he felt the organization agreed with his ethno-nationalistic tendencies. Sch√∂ngarth fled to Coburg to try and escape from his crime of treason, but eventually came back to Erfurt and was given amnesty. In 1924 Sch√∂ngarth finished his high school education and got a job at the Deutsche bank while also joining the Army Infantry Regiment 1/15 in Gie√üen. Karl Eberhard Sch√∂ngarth later joined the SA (Sturmabteilung) as member number 43,870 while claiming expulsion from the army. By 1924, Sch√∂ngarth's involvement with the Nazi party had decreased, and he enrolled at the University of Leipzig, majoring in economics and law. He completed his first bar exam in 1928 and landed a job in the Naumburg Superior Courts. He then went on to acquire his doctorate in law from the Institute for Labor and Law, on 28 June 1929 at just the age of 26, and was awarded a Cum Laude. His thesis was on the subject of 'the refusal of notices of termination of employment contracts. He then decided to take his second bar exam in December 1933 and became a court official for Magdeburg, Erfurt and Torgau. Eberhard married Dorothea Gross, with whom he had 2 sons.  SS career  After becoming a court official, Sch√∂ngarth began involving himself more heavily in the Nazi party. On 1 February 1933 he joined the SS (member No¬∞. 67,174 and Nazi N¬∞. 2,848,857). Because party membership was now crucial for getting a government job in Germany, his involvement allowed him to become a postmaster in Erfurt. In 1933 he became a member of the SD, the SS's own intelligence service. He eventually left his postmaster position on November 1, 1935, and joined the Gestapo. During his time working with the Gestapo, he worked in the main press office, the political-church council, and the Arnsberg district office in Dortmund, he also served as police chief in M√ºnster and was named a government counselor. Though unknown why he found employment at the political church, a letter from Reinhard Heydrich to the Reich Ministry of the Interior recommended Eberhard become a part of the Secret State Police due to his broad and insightful law background. He was placed with the Gestapo, and later with the SS. He also rose in ranks in the SS, becoming a first lieutenant, captain, major and lieutenant colonel in 1939, and from colonel to brigadier general in 1940. War crimes During the German attack on Poland he was promoted to SS Obersturmbannfuhrer. He later served as a Senior Inspector for the Reich Main Security Office in Dresden. In January 1941 he was sent to Krak√≥w, occupied Poland, as senior commander of the SiPo and SD (). During this time Sch√∂ngarth was stationed in Krak√≥w, he formed several Einsatzgruppen (Special Action Groups) in Warsaw, Radom, and Lublin, with the intention of perpetrating massacres. He was responsible for the murder of up to 10,000 Polish Jews between July and September 1941 and the massacre of Lw√≥w professors behind the frontlines of Operation Barbarossa in the Soviet Union. Sch√∂ngarth attended the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, along with Dr. Rudolf Lange (Einsatzgruppe A), who had also participated in the Holocaust. From early July 1944 until the end of war he was the BdS in the Netherlands. He is also reported to have killed 263 persons (including one German soldier) in reprisal for the ambushing of SS General Hanns Albin Rauter March 6, 1945. In 2019, a mass grave containing the remains of more than 1,000 Jews was discovered during renovation work on houses in Brest. An Einsatzgruppe led by Sch√∂ngarth murdered more than 5,000 Jews in the area between 10 and 12 July 1941. Trial and execution Sch√∂ngarth was captured by the allies at the end of the war in Europe. After an investigation into his background, he was charged with the crime of murdering a downed Allied pilot (on 21 November 1944) at Enschede, NetherlandsCould have been a US POW airman Find a grave memorial or one of two murdered POWs of 192nd Squadron RAF-see RAF Commands query. and tried by a British military court in Burgsteinfurt. He was found guilty of this war crime on 11 February 1946 and sentenced to death by hanging. Sch√∂ngarth was executed by Albert Pierrepoint on 16 May 1946 at .

The rite is named after Saint Ambrose, a bishop of Milan in the fourth century. The Ambrosian Rite, which differs from the Roman Rite, is used by some five million Catholics in the greater part of the Archdiocese of Milan, Italy (excluding, notably, the areas of Monza, Treviglio, Trezzo sull'Adda and a few other parishes), in some parishes of the Diocese of Como, Bergamo, Novara, Lodi, and in about fifty parishes of the Diocese of Lugano, in the Canton of Ticino, Switzerland. Although the distinctive Ambrosian Rite has risked suppression at various points in its history, it survived and was reformed after the Second Vatican Council, partly because Pope Paul VI belonged to the Ambrosian Rite, having previously been Archbishop of Milan. In the 20th century, it also gained prominence and prestige from the attentions of two other scholarly Archbishops of Milan: Achille Ratti, later Pope Pius XI, and the Blessed Ildefonso Schuster, both of whom had been involved in studies and publications on the rite before their respective appointments. History Diffusion of the Ambrosian Rite There is no direct evidence that the rite was the composition of St. Ambrose, but his name has been associated with it since the eighth century. It is possible that Ambrose, who succeeded the Arian bishop Auxentius of Milan, may have removed material seen as unorthodox by the mainstream church and issued corrected service books which included the principal characteristics distinguishing it from other rites. According to St. Augustine (Confessiones, IX, vii) and Paulinus the Deacon (Vita S. Ambrosii, ¬ß 13), St. Ambrose introduced innovations, not indeed into the Mass, but into what would seem to be the Divine Office, at the time of his contest with the Empress Justina, for the Portian Basilica which she claimed for the Arians. St. Ambrose filled the church with Catholics and kept them there night and day until the peril was past. And he arranged Psalms and hymns for them to sing, as St. Augustine says, \\"after the manner of the Orientals, lest the people should languish in cheerless monotony\\"; and of this Paulinus the deacon says: \\"Now for the first time antiphons, hymns, and vigils began to be part of the observance of the Church in Milan, which devout observance lasts to our day not only in that church but in nearly every province of the West\\". From the time of St. Ambrose, whose hymns are well-known and whose liturgical allusions may certainly be explained as referring to a rite which possessed the characteristics of that which is called by his name, until the period of Charlemagne (circ AD 800), there is a gap in the history of the Milanese Rite. However, St. Simplician, the successor of St. Ambrose, added much to the rite and St. Lazarus (438-451) introduced the three days of the litanies (Cant√π, Milano e il suo territorio, I, 116). The Church of Milan underwent various vicissitudes and for a period of some eighty years (570-649), during the Lombard conquests, the see was moved to Genoa in Liguria. In the eighth- century, manuscript evidence begins. In a short treatise on the various cursus entitled \\"Ratio de Cursus qui fuerunt ex auctores\\" (sic in Cott. Manuscripts, Nero A. II, in the British Museum), written about the middle of the eighth century, probably by an Irish monk in France, is found perhaps the earliest attribution of the Milan use to St. Ambrose, though it quotes the authority of St. Augustine, probably alluding to the passage already mentioned: \\"There is yet another Cursus which the blessed Bishop Augustine says that the blessed Ambrose composed because of the existence of a different use of the heretics, which previously used to be sung in Italy\\". According to a narrative of Landulphus Senior, the eleventh-century chronicler of Milan, Charlemagne attempted to abolish the Ambrosian Rite, as he or his father, Pepin the Short, had abolished the Gallican Rite in France, in favour of a Gallicanized Roman Rite. He sent to Milan and caused to be destroyed or sent beyond the mountain, quasi in exilium (as if into exile), all the Ambrosian books which could be found. Eugenius the Bishop, (transmontane bishop, as Landulf calls him), begged him to reconsider his decision. After the manner of the time, an ordeal, which reminds one of the celebrated trials by fire and by battle in the case of Alfonso VI and the Mozarabic Rite, was determined on. Two books, Ambrosian and Roman, were laid closed upon the altar of St. Peter's Church in Rome and left for three days, and the one which was found open was to win. They were both found open, and it was resolved that as God had shown that one was as acceptable as the other, the Ambrosian Rite should continue. But the destruction had been so far effective that no Ambrosian books could be found, save one missal which a faithful priest had hidden for six weeks in a cave in the mountains. Therefore the Manuale was written out from memory by certain priests and clerks (Landulph, Chron., 10-13). Walafridus Strabo, who died Abbot of Reichenau in 849, and must therefore have been nearly, if not quite, contemporary with this incident, says nothing about it, but (De Rebus Ecclesiasticis, xxii), speaking of various forms of the Mass, says: \\"Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, also arranged a ceremonial for the Mass and other offices for his own church and for other parts of Liguria, which is still observed in the Milanese Church\\". In the eleventh century Pope Nicholas II, who in 1060 had tried to abolish the Mozarabic Rite, wished also to attack the Ambrosian and was aided by St. Peter Damian but he was unsuccessful, and Pope Alexander II his successor, himself a Milanese, reversed his policy in this respect. St. Gregory VII made another attempt, and Le Brun (Explication de la Messe, III, art. I, ¬ß 8) conjectures that Landulf's miraculous narrative was written with a purpose about that time. Having weathered these storms, the Ambrosian Rite had peace for some three centuries and a half. In the first half of the fifteenth century Cardinal Branda da Castiglione, who died in 1448, was legate in Milan. As part of his plan for reconciling Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and the Holy See, he endeavoured to substitute the Roman Rite for the Ambrosian. The result was a serious riot, and the Cardinal's legateship came to an abrupt end. After that the Ambrosian Rite was safe until the Council of Trent. The Rule of that Council, that local uses which could show a prescription of two centuries might be retained, saved Milan, not without a struggle, from the loss of its Rite, and St. Charles Borromeo though he made some alterations in a Roman direction, was most careful not to destroy its characteristics. A small attempt made against it by a Governor of Milan who had obtained a permission from the Pope to have the Roman Mass said in any church which he might happen to attend, was defeated by St. Charles, and his own revisions were intended to do little more than was inevitable in a living rite. Since his time the temper of the Milan Church has been most conservative, and the only alterations in subsequent editions seem to have been slight improvements in the wording of rubrics and in the arrangement of the books. The district in which the Ambrosian Rite is used is nominally the old archiepiscopal province of Milan before the changes of 1515 and 1819, but actually it is not exclusively used even in the city of Milan itself. In parts of the Swiss Canton of Ticino it is used; in other parts the Roman Rite is so much preferred that it is said that when Cardinal Gaisruck tried to force the Ambrosian upon them the inhabitants declared that they would be either Roman or Lutheran. There are traces also of the use of the Ambrosian Rite beyond the limits of the Province of Milan. In 1132-34, two Augustinian canons of Ratisbon, Paul, said by B√§umer to be Paul of Bernried, and Gebehard, held a correspondence with Anselm, Archbishop of Milan, and Martin, treasurer of St. Ambrose, with a view of obtaining copies of the books of the Ambrosian Rite, so that they might introduce it into their church. In the fourteenth century the Emperor Charles IV introduced the Rite into the Church of St. Ambrose at Prague. Traces of it, mixed with the Roman, are said by Hoeyinck (Geschichte der kirchl. Liturgie des Bisthums Augsburg) to have remained in the diocese of Augsburg down to its last breviary of 1584, and according to Catena (Cant√π, Milano e il suo territorio, 118) the use of Capua in the time of St. Charles Borromeo had some resemblance to that of Milan. =Recent history= An Ambrosian Rite Mass being celebrated in the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Legnano Important editions of the Ambrosian Missal were issued in 1475, 1594, 1609, 1902 and 1954. The last of these was the final edition in the form of the Ambrosian Rite that preceded the Second Vatican Council, and is now used mainly in the church of San Rocco al Gentilino in Milan. Following the guidelines of the Second Vatican Council and the preliminary revisions of the Ordinary of the Mass of the Roman Rite, a new bilingual (Latin and Italian) edition of the Ambrosian Missal was issued in 1966, simplifying the 1955 missal, mainly in the prayers the priest said inaudibly and in the genuflections, and adding the Prayer of the Faithful. The eucharistic prayer continued to be said in Latin until 1967. The altars were moved to face the people. When the Mass of Paul VI was issued in 1969, most Ambrosian-Rite priests began to use the new Roman Missal (only omitting the Agnus Dei), the Roman Lectionary, and the General Roman Calendar (with its four-week Advent). The Ambrosian form of administering the other sacraments was for the most part already identical with the Roman. This made it uncertain whether the Ambrosian Rite would survive. But in promulgating the documents of the 46th diocesan synod (1966‚Äì1973), Cardinal Archbishop Giovanni Colombo, supported by Pope Paul VI (a former Archbishop of Milan), finally decreed that the Ambrosian Rite, brought into line with the directives of the Second Vatican Council, should be preserved. Work, still in progress, began on all the Ambrosian liturgical texts. On 11 April 1976 Cardinal Colombo published the new Ambrosian Missal, covering the whole liturgical year. Later in the same year an experimental Lectionary appeared, covering only some liturgical seasons, and still following the Roman-Rite Lectionary for the rest. Minor modifications of the Ambrosian Missal were implemented in 1978, restoring for example the place of the Creed in the Mass, and the new Ambrosian rite for funerals was issued. The Ambrosian Missal also restored two early-medieval Ambrosian eucharistic prayers, unusual for placing the epiclesis after the Words of Institution, in line with Oriental use. In 1984-1985 the new Ambrosian Liturgy of the Hours was published, and in 2006 the new Ambrosian rite of marriage. On 20 March 2008 the new Ambrosian Lectionary, superseding the 1976 experimental edition, and covering the whole liturgical year, was promulgated, coming into effect from the First Sunday of Advent 2008 (16 November 2008).Il Segno: La Parola ogni giorno dell'anno . It is based on the ancient Ambrosian liturgical tradition, and contains in particular, a special rite of light (\\"lucernarium\\") and proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus, for use before the Saturday-evening celebration of the Mass of the Sunday, seen as the weekly Easter. Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in Milan using the Ambrosian Rite in 1983, as did Pope Francis in 2017. Origin The Catholic Encyclopedia or 1907 gives three theories of the ancient origin of the rite, none conclusive.The question resolves itself into whether the Ambrosian Rite is archaic Roman, or a much Romanized form of the Gallican Rite. J. M. Neale and others from the Anglican tradition referred the Hispano- Gallican and Celtic family of liturgies to an original imported into Provence from Ephesus in Asia Minor by St. Iren√¶us, who had received it through St. Polycarp from St. John the Divine. The name Ephesine was applied to this liturgy, and it was sometimes called the Liturgy of St. John. In support of this theory, Colman, at the Synod of Whitby in 664, attributed the Celtic rule of Easter to St. John. But Neale greatly exaggerated the Romanizing effected by St. Charles Borromeo. W. C. Bishop, however, in his article on the Ambrosian Breviary, takes up the same line as Neale in claiming a Gallican origin for the Ambrosian Divine Office. Louis Duchesne in his \\"Origines du culte chr√©tien\\" theorizes that the rite was imported or modified from the East, perhaps by the Cappadocian Arian Bishop Auxentius (355-374), the predecessor of St. Ambrose, and gradually spread to Gaul, Spain, and Britain. Jungmann later concluded that \\"Duchesne's thesis can be accepted in the sense that Milan was the center from which a Gallican type liturgy took its origin.\\" Here, \\"Gallican\\" means a Latin (not Eastern) liturgy somewhat different from that of Rome.J. A. Jungmann, The Early Liturgy (Notre Dame, Ind. 1959) 227‚Äì237. Antonio Maria Ceriani and Magistretti maintain that the Ambrosian Rite has preserved the pre-Gelasian and pre-Gregorian form of the Roman Rite. Differences from the Roman Rite Some features of the Ambrosian Rite distinguish it from the Roman Rite liturgy. =Mass= The main differences in the Mass are:Ambrosian Rite Ordinary of the Mass (in Italian) *The principal celebrant blesses all the readers, not only the deacon. *The Gospel is followed by a short antiphon. *The Rite of Peace comes before the Presentation of the Gifts. *The Creed follows the Preparation of the Gifts, before the Prayer over the Gifts *There are some differences between the First Eucharistic Prayer of the Ambrosian Missal and the Roman Canon, the first in the Roman Missal; but its Eucharistic Prayers II, III, and IV are the same as in the Roman Rite. In addition, the Ambrosian Rite has two proper Eucharistic Prayers, used mainly on Easter and Holy Thursday. *The priest breaks the Host and places a piece in the main chalice before the Lord's Prayer, while an antiphon (the Confractorium) is sung or recited. *The Agnus Dei is not said. *Before the final blessing, the people say Kyrie, eleison (\\"Lord have mercy\\") three times. *At the end of the Mass, instead of saying \\"The Mass is ended, go in peace\\" the priest says simply \\"Go in peace\\", to which the people respond \\"In the name of Christ\\". *The Ambrosian Rite has its own cycle of readings at Mass. *Many of the prayers said by the priest during Mass are peculiar to the Ambrosian Rite, which has a particularly rich variety of prefaces. =Liturgical year= The main differences in the liturgical year are: *Advent has six weeks, not four. *Lent starts four days later than in the Roman Rite, so that Ash Wednesday is postponed to a week later than in the Roman Rite, and Carnival continues until \\"sabato grasso\\" (\\"Fat Saturday\\" in Italian), corresponding to Shrove Tuesday (called \\"mardi gras\\", i.e. \\"Fat Tuesday\\", in French) in areas where the Roman Rite is used. *On Fridays in Lent, Mass is not celebrated and, with a few exceptions, Communion is not distributed. *Red, rather than the green used in the Roman Rite, is the standard colour of vestments from Pentecost to the third Sunday of October, and there are other differences in liturgical colours throughout the year. =Other= Other differences are that: *The Liturgy of the Hours (also known as the Divine Office or Breviary) is different in structure and in various features. *The liturgical rites of Holy Week are quite different. *The rite of funerals is different. *Baptism of infants is done by triple immersion of the head. *The thurible has no top cover, and is swung clockwise before the censing of a person or object.The form of the thurible and the manner in which it is swung can be seen in this video *Ambrosian deacons wear the stole over the dalmatic and not under it. *The Ambrosian cassock, buttoned with only five buttons below the neck, is held with a fascia at the waist, and is worn with a round white collar. *Ambrosian chant is distinct from Gregorian chant. *Some senior priests (notably Provosts and certain Canons) are entitled to wear vestments commonly associated with bishops, including the mitre. *The liturgical burning of the faro (a large cotton sphere suspended in the air, inside the church) on feasts of martyrs. Early manuscripts The early manuscripts of the Ambrosian Rite are generally found in the following forms: *The \\"Sacramentary\\" contains the Orationes super Populum, Prophecies, Epistles, Gospels, Orationes super Sindonem, and Orationes super Oblata, the Prefaces and Post-Communions throughout the year, with the variable forms of the Communicantes and Hanc igitur, when they occur, and the solitary Post Sanctus of Easter Eve, besides the ceremonies of Holy Week, etc., and the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass. There are often also occasional offices usually found in a modern ritual, such as Baptism, the Visitation and Unction of the Sick, the Burial of the Dead, and various benedictions. It is essentially a priest's book, like the Euchologion of the Greeks. *The \\"Psalter\\" contains the Psalms and Canticles. It is sometimes included with the \\"Manual\\". *The \\"Manual\\" is nearly the complement of the \\"Sacramentary\\" and the \\"Psalter\\" as regards both the Mass and the Divine Office. It contains for the Divine Office: the Lucernaria, Antiphons, Responsoria, Psallenda, Completoria, Capitula, Hymns, and other changeable parts, except the Lessons, which are found separately. And for the Mass it contains: the Ingress≈ì, Psalmell≈ì, Versus, Cantus, Antiphon≈ì ante and post Evangelium, Offertoria, Confractoria, and Transitoria. The \\"Manual\\" often also contains occasional services such as are now usually found in a Ritual. *The \\"Antiphoner\\" is a Manual with notes. *The \\"Rituale\\" and \\"Pontificale\\" have contents similar to those of Roman books of the same name, though the early Manuscripts are less ample. =Sacramentaries and missals= The following are some of the most noted Manuscripts of the rite: *The \\"Biasca Sacramentary\\"; Bibl.

History Coat of arms of the former Municipal Borough of Oldbury Oldbury was part of the ancient parish of Halesowen, a detached part of Shropshire surrounded by Worcestershire and Staffordshire, and the manor was owned by the Oldbury family until the 17th century when Alderman John Oldbury had no male heir and his two daughters, Mary, Countess of Warrington and Dorothy, Baroness Herbert, married into the aristocracy.www.historyofparliamentonline.org By the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, Oldbury was reincorporated into Worcestershire after a nine-hundred- year absence. It became an Urban District in 1894, receiving Municipal Borough-status in 1935. The local government structure within North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire ‚Äì Prior to the West Midlands Order 1965 reorganisation In 1966, Oldbury was merged with the County Borough of Smethwick and the Municipal Borough of Rowley Regis to form the County Borough of Warley, which also included most of the Tividale area of Tipton and the eastern section of Oakham in Dudley. The geographical county boundaries were also changed to include the whole of Warley as part of Worcestershire; formerly, both Rowley Regis and Smethwick had been in Staffordshire. Oldbury council built several thousand houses, flats and bungalows for 40 years from 1893 until its disbandment, the 1,000th of which was completed in 1933 at Wallace Road near the border with Rowley Regis. In 1974, Oldbury became part of the new Sandwell Metropolitan Borough (a merger between the county boroughs of West Bromwich and Warley), and was transferred into the West Midlands Metropolitan County. Since 1986, after the abolition of the West Midlands County Council, Sandwell effectively became a unitary authority. Sandwell Council's headquarters are situated in Oldbury Town Centre. Oldbury comes within the B68 and B69 postal districts, the latter of which also covers part of Tipton. The postal town is Oldbury, although it previously came under the Warley post town, along with Smethwick, Rowley Regis, and Cradley Heath. Notable businesses The first branch of Lloyds Bank was opened in Oldbury in 1864. The branch was founded to serve fellow Quakers Arthur Albright and John Wilson's local chemical factory. The original building survives to this day, but was recently made redundant as a bank and became a Subway fast food restaurant. Subway moved from the building early in 2012. In October 1980, retail giant J Sainsbury opened one of its first SavaCentre hypermarkets in Oldbury town centre. 20 years later, it was rebranded as a traditional Sainsbury's store as the retailer gradually phased out the SavaCentre side of the business. The town saw a large expansion in retail since then, including a Toys \\"R\\" Us superstore on at Birchley Island, which opened in October 1988 and stayed open until the retail chain went out of business in 2018, and Oldbury Green Retail Park was built on the town's ring road in the mid-1990s. A Homebase store which was built during the 1980s also relocated to the Oldbury Green development, with the previous building being taken over by Gala Bingo.https://www.expressandstar.com/news/business/2018/07/31/toys-r-us-in- oldbury-facing-demolition-to-pave-way-for-new-shops/ This, along with the development of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre some six miles away during the second half of the 1980s, has contributed to a decline in the fortunes of nearby West Bromwich town centre as a retail centre since the 1980s, although West Bromwich has bounced back since the New Square shopping centre opened in the summer of 2013. Due to the socio-economics of Sandwell, the area has a number of social housing organisations such as Black Country Housing Group which has been operating in Sandwell since its relocation from Birmingham in the 1980s. In October 2013, the commercial radio station Free Radio moved its local operations for the Black Country and Shropshire from Wolverhampton to new studios at Black Country House.Free Radio opens new studios in Oldbury, RadioToday, 24 October 2013 In November 2015, Hagley Road West, Oldbury became home to the new Home Interiors Store; Thrift Vintage Interiors, which has since won the 'Best Local Business' award at the Birmingham inspiration Awards 2017. In July 2016, nearly new car retailer Motorpoint opened its five acre site on Churchbridge Road. The site has since held numerous events at the branch and supported various charities within the community. Transport links For over thirty years, there were three railway stations in the parish named Oldbury; only one is still open, but under a new name. The oldest surviving one is on the Stour Valley Line at Bromford Road. It has been there since the 1850s. It was originally called Oldbury & Bromford Lane, then Oldbury, and since 1984, Sandwell & Dudley.Intelligence Railway Gazette International May 1983 page 314 The second nearest railway station to the centre of Oldbury is at Langley Green, at Western Road, on the Stourbridge Extension Line, now the Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line. It opened in April 1867 and was originally called Langley Green & Rood End. However, a short half-mile long branch line, the Oldbury Railway, was linked to the station with its own (third) platform. It opened in November 1884; and Langley Green & Rood End was renamed Langley Green. The Oldbury Railway, which also linked to Albright and Wilson, had both a passenger station, named Oldbury, on Halesowen Road; and a goods station, at the Birmingham Canal Navigations wharf in Oldbury. Passenger services ran to Oldbury station until March 1915; and the line closed completely other than as a freight line for Albright and Wilson. All traces of its viaduct and embankment beyond Tat Bank Road were destroyed when the M5 motorway was built. However until recently a short stub of the line to Oldbury remained in situ, out of use. The M5 has served Oldbury since 1964 and passes the town on an elevated section built on reinforced concrete pillars. Access is from junction 2. This is also the closest junction to the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley. A major concrete repair and waterproofing scheme began on the M5 viaduct in April 2017. This was expected to be completed by autumn 2018, however due to unforeseen repairs the works have been delayed until the following year.M5 Oldbury roadworks hit by further delays BBC News 13 March 2019 Neighbourhoods * Bristnall Fields ‚Äì a residential area centred on the roundabout where Pound Road, Moat Road, Bristnall Hall Road, George Road and Brandhall Road meet.

Considered one of the six 'towns' that comprise the modern-day Sandwell Metropolitan Borough, it encompasses the wards of Blackheath, Cradley Heath, Old Hill, Whiteheath and Rowley Village. At the 2011 census, the combined population of Rowley Regis was 50,257. History The history of Rowley Regis began in the 12th century, when a small village grew around the parish church of St. Giles, southeast of Dudley. Rowley was part of the Royal hunting grounds - Regis was added to the name of Rowley in around 1140 to signify it was that part of Rowley belonging to the King. It began to develop substantially between the two World Wars, when thousands of privately owned and local authority houses were built in the surrounding area. During that time Rowley Regis became a borough, and incorporated the communities of Blackheath, Old Hill, and Cradley Heath. These places were all within the ancient parish of Rowley Regis, which (despite being in the county of Staffordshire) was in the diocese of Worcester. The parish contained the manors of Rowley Regis and Rowley Somery, the latter being part of the barony of Dudley, but the extents of these manors and the relationship between them are not clear. The present St. Giles Church on Church Road is not the original church in Rowley Regis. The church built in 1840 to succeed the original mediaeval building, was found to be unsafe and condemned in 1900. The next church, built in 1904, was burned down in 1913, some believing the fire to have been started by Suffragettes or local striking steelworkers; this however is supposition and it was more than probable it was a simple accident, the church at this time using paraffin as a means of lighting and the latter perhaps causing the fire. Its present day successor was designed by Holland W. Hobbiss and A. S. Dixon, and was built in 1923.The Buildings of England: Worcestershire, Nikolaus Pevsner, 1963 p89 Black Country Living Museum Rowley Regis railway station opened in 1867 in the south of the then village, and remains in use to this day. Rowley's grammar school was opened on Hawes Lane in September 1962. Well-known former pupils include Pete Williams (original bass player with Dexys Midnight Runners), and actress Josie Lawrence. In 1974, when comprehensive schools became universal in the new borough of Sandwell, the grammar school became Rowley Regis Sixth Form College, the last intake of grammar school pupils having been inducted the previous year. In 2003 it became an annexe of Dudley College, but this arrangement lasted just one year before the buildings fell into disuse. It was demolished three years later, and the site was redeveloped as the new Rowley Learning Campus under Sandwell's Building Schools for the Future programme,Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council: Building Schools for the Future www.bsf.sandwell.gov.uk comprising St Michael's Church of England High School, Westminster Special School, and Whiteheath Education Centre, which opened in September 2011. =Civic history= Originally in Staffordshire, the Rowley Regis Urban District was formed in 1894 to cover the villages of Rowley, Blackheath, Cradley Heath, and Old Hill. The urban district was incorporated into a municipal borough in 1933. Following the acquisition of borough status, plans were unveiled to build new council offices in the borough to replace the existing offices in Lawrence Lane, Old Hill. A site on the corner of Halesowen Road and Barrs Road was selected, with working commencing in October 1937, and the building being completed in December 1938. The local government structure within North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire ‚Äì Prior to the West Midlands Order 1965 reorganisation In 1966, the borough of Rowley Regis merged with the boroughs of Oldbury and Smethwick to form the Warley County Borough, and became part of Worcestershire. There had previously been plans to incorporate Rowley Regis into an expanded Dudley borough, and for Halesowen to join up with Oldbury and Smethwick instead. Eight years later, in 1974, on the formation of the West Midlands Metropolitan county, Warley merged with West Bromwich to form the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough. It is now right in the core of the West Midlands conurbation. Following the demise of Rowley Regis as a standalone borough in 1966, the council offices in Barrs Road were retained by Warley council and then by Sandwell council. However, a plan was submitted in July 2012 by Sandwell Leisure Trust to demolish the buildings to make way for an expansion to the neighbouring Haden Hill Leisure Centre, and the development of a new fire station.

His first job was assisting at the double hanging of James Owen and George Thomas outside Stafford Gaol on 11 April 1840. He learnt the job and was able to perform executions himself, principally in the Midlands. Smith's most famous solo execution was that of the Rugeley poisoner, Dr William Palmer for the murder of John Parsons Cook, before a large crowd at Stafford Gaol on 14 June 1856. Smith was to hang a further 14 men and one woman at Stafford, the last in August 1872. He assisted Calcraft at the first private hanging in England (of Thomas Wells see below) in August 1868. He was renowned for his long white coat and top hat which he wore at public hangings. Smith's son, also George, assisted at three executions at Stafford prison. Initially, it is said that he was hired by the Under Sheriff of Staffordshire to save the cost of bringing Calcraft up from London. With the advent of a good rail network, Smith, like Askern and Calcraft, could operate much further afield in later years. George Smith carried out two private executions, the last at Stafford on 13 August 1872, when he hanged 34-year-old Christopher Edwards for the murder of his wife. * James Woodhouse 1735-1820 - poet, born in Rowley Regis, known as the \\"cobbler poet\\".

Ice shelves are only found in Antarctica, Greenland, Canada, and the Russian Arctic. The boundary between the floating ice shelf and the anchor ice (resting on bedrock) that feeds it is called the grounding line. The thickness of ice shelves can range from about to . In contrast, sea ice is formed on water, is much thinner (typically less than ), and forms throughout the Arctic Ocean. It also is found in the Southern Ocean around the continent of Antarctica. The movement of ice shelves is principally driven by gravity-induced pressure from the grounded ice. That flow continually moves ice from the grounding line to the seaward front of the shelf. Formerly, the primary mechanism of mass loss from ice shelves was thought to have been iceberg calving, in which a chunk of ice breaks off from the seaward front of the shelf. A study by NASA and university researchers, published in the June 14, 2013 issue of Science, found however that ocean waters melting the undersides of Antarctic ice shelves are responsible for most of the continent's ice shelf mass loss. Typically, a shelf front will extend forward for years or decades between major calving events. Snow accumulation on the upper surface and melting from the lower surface are also important to the mass balance of an ice shelf. Ice may also accrete onto the underside of the shelf. The density contrast between glacial ice and liquid water means that at least 1/9 of the floating ice is above the ocean surface, depending on how much pressurized air is contained in the bubbles within the glacial ice, stemming from compressed snow. The formula for the denominators above is 1/(\\\\rho_{seawater} - \\\\rho_{glacial ice})/\\\\rho_{seawater}, density of cold seawater divided by kg/m3 is about 1.028 and that of glacial ice from about 0.85 to well below 0.92, the limit for very cold ice without bubbles. The height of the shelf above the sea can be even larger, if there is much less dense firn and snow above the glacier ice. The world's largest ice shelves are the Ross Ice Shelf and the Filchner- Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The term captured ice shelf has been used for the ice over a subglacial lake, such as Lake Vostok. Canadian ice shelves All Canadian ice shelves are attached to Ellesmere Island and lie north of 82¬∞N. Ice shelves that are still in existence are the Alfred Ernest Ice Shelf, Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, Milne Ice Shelf and Smith Ice Shelf. The M'Clintock Ice Shelf broke up from 1963 to 1966; the Ayles Ice Shelf broke up in 2005; and the Markham Ice Shelf broke up in 2008. The remaining ice shelves have also lost a significant amount of their area over time, with the Milne Ice Shelf being the last to be affected with it breaking off in August of 2020. Antarctic ice shelves A large portion of the Antarctic coastline has ice shelves attached. Their aggregate area is over 1,550,000 km2. Russian ice shelves The Matusevich Ice Shelf was a 222 km¬≤ ice shelf located in Severnaya Zemlya being fed by some of the largest ice caps on October Revolution Island, the Karpinsky Ice Cap to the south and the Rusanov Ice Cap to the north.Mark Nuttall, Encyclopedia of the Arctic, p. 1887 In 2012 it ceased to exist.

July 10, 2008. Yahoo! News. The Ellesmere ice shelf was reduced by 90 per cent in the twentieth century, leaving the separate Alfred Ernest, Ayles, Milne, Ward Hunt, and Markham ice shelves. A 1986 survey of Canadian ice shelves found that 48 km¬≤. (3.3 cubic kilometres) of ice calved from the Milne and Ayles ice shelves between 1959 and 1974.Jeffries, Martin O.

Polar Record 37 (201): 133‚Äì142 (2001) In summer 2002, the Ward Ice Shelf experienced another major breakup, and other instances of note happened in 2008 and 2010 as well. The last remnant to remain mostly intact, the Milne Ice Shelf, also ultimately experienced a major breakup at the end of July 2020, losing over 40% of its area. Two sections of Antarctica's Larsen Ice Shelf broke apart into hundreds of unusually small fragments (hundreds of meters wide or less) in 1995 and 2002, Larsen C calved a huge ice island in 2017. The breakup events may be linked to the dramatic polar warming trends that are part of global warming. The leading ideas involve enhanced ice fracturing due to surface meltwater and enhanced bottom melting due to warmer ocean water circulating under the floating ice. The cold, fresh water produced by melting underneath the Ross and Flichner-Ronne ice shelves is a component of Antarctic Bottom Water. Although it is believed that the melting of floating ice shelves will not raise sea levels, technically, there is a small effect because sea water is ~2.6% more dense than fresh water combined with the fact that ice shelves are overwhelmingly \\"fresh\\" (having virtually no salinity); this causes the volume of the sea water needed to displace a floating ice shelf to be slightly less than the volume of the fresh water contained in the floating ice. Therefore, when a mass of floating ice melts, sea levels will increase; however, this effect is small enough that if all extant sea ice and floating ice shelves were to melt, the corresponding sea level rise is estimated to be ~4 cm. Much more importantly, if and when these ice shelves melt sufficiently, and cease to grip on the small islands and another obstacle of the former grounding line, they will no longer impede glacier flow off the continent, so that glacier flow will accelerate. This new source of ice volume flows down from above sea level, displacing sea water and so contributing to sea level rise.

Scholars disagree over the details of the decisions made at the convention, especially whether the ruler of Poland was pledged the king's crown or not. Background Silver relic coffin of St. Adalbert at Gniezno Cathedral After his death in 997 during a mission among the pagan Prussian tribes, Bishop Adalbert of Prague was quickly canonized by the common effort of Duke Boles≈Çaw I and Emperor Otto III. Thus, Adalbert became the first Slavic bishop to become a saint. His body, bought back by Boles≈Çaw from the Prussians for its weight in gold, was put into a tomb at Gniezno Cathedral, which became the ecclesiastical center of Poland. According to the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg, Otto III, who had been a friend and pupil of Adalbert, committed to a pilgrimage from Italy to St. Adalbert's tomb in Gniezno; in his attempt to extend the influence of Christianity in Eastern Europe, and to renew the Holy Roman Empire based on a federal concept (\\"renovatio Imperii Romanorum\\") with the Polish and Hungarian duchies upgraded to eastern federati of the empire.Andreas Lawaty, Hubert Or≈Çowski, Deutsche und Polen: Geschichte, Kultur, Politik, 2003, p.24, , As part of this policy he also invested Grand Prince Stephen I of Hungary with the king's crown (the Crown of Saint Stephen). The Polish Piast dynasty under Mieszko I had extended their domains beyond the Oder river, where their claims to power collided with the interests of the Saxon margrave Gero. After his defeat by Gero's troops in 963, Mieszko I decided to come to terms with Emperor Otto I and agreed to pay tribute for this part of his lands. In turn he gained the title of amicus imperatoris (\\"Friend of the Emperor\\") and the acknowledgment of his position as a Dux of Poland. He continued his policy of convergence with the Empire by marrying Oda, the daughter of the Saxon margrave Dietrich of Haldensleben, in 978 and by marrying his son Boles≈Çaw I to a daughter of Margrave Rikdag of Meissen. As a precaution however, shortly before his death in 992 he placed his realm (Civitas Schinesghe) under the protection of Pope John XV according to the dagome iudex regest. When his son Boles≈Çaw succeeded him, Poland remained an ally of the Empire in the campaigns against the Polabian Lutici tribes. Emperor Otto II, father of Otto III, died at age 28 in 983 and his widow Theophanu and grandmother reigned for the child-king Otto III. In 996 Otto III was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor at Rome. By the time of the congress at Gniezno in 1000 AD, he was 20 years old. The act Portrait of Boles≈Çaw with the replica of the Holy Lance, Jan Matejko (1838‚Äì1893) On the pilgrimage to Gniezno, Emperor Otto III was received by Boles≈Çaw at the Polish border on the B√≥br river near Ma≈Çomice. Bishop Unger of Pozna≈Ñ escorted him to Gniezno. Between the 7th and 15th of March Otto invested Boles≈Çaw with the titles frater et cooperator Imperii (\\"Brother and Partner of the Empire\\") and populi Romani amicus et socius as rendered in the 1115 Gesta principum Polonorum by the Krak√≥w chronicler Gallus Anonymus, the first author of Polish history. Whether the act implemented an elevation of Boles≈Çaw to the status of \\"king\\" has not been conclusively established. In any case, Boles≈Çaw had himself crowned King of Poland at Gniezno Cathedral in 1025. On the same visit, Otto III raised Gniezno to the rank of an archbishopric. Three new dioceses subordinate to Gniezno were created: the Bishopric of Krak√≥w (assigned to Bishop Poppo), the Bishopric of Wroc≈Çaw (assigned to Bishop Jan) and the Bishopric of Ko≈Çobrzeg in Pomerania (assigned to bishop Reinbern).Janine Bo√ümann, Otto III. Und der Akt von Gnesen, 2007, pp.9-10, , St. Adalbert's brother Radzim Gaudenty became the first archbishop of Gniezno. Otto III gave Boles≈Çaw a replica of his Holy Lance, part of the Imperial Regalia, and Boles≈Çaw presented the Emperor with a relic, an arm of St. Adalbert in exchange. The status of the Bishopric of Pozna≈Ñ of Bishop Unger, whose diocese had also comprised Gniezno before and who had not supported the creation of a separate archdiocese in Gniezno, is also subject to historical debate. One view holds that it stayed independent and with Unger as a missionary bishop directly subordinate to the pope while another one holds that it was attached to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, the nearest German ecclesiastical province.Nora Berend, Christianization and the Rise of Christian Monarchy: Scandinavia, Central Europe and Rus' C. 900-1200, 2007, pp.281-182, , However, generally, the congress is seen as having established complete ecclesiastical independence of the Polish church from Magdeburg.Uta- Renate Blumenthal, \\"The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century\\", University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991, pg. 38 Boles≈Çaw subsequently accompanied Otto III on his way back to Germany. Both proceeded to the grave of Charlemagne at Aachen Cathedral, where Boles≈Çaw received Charlemagne's throne as a gift. Both arranged the betrothal of Boles≈Çaw's son Mieszko II Lambert with the Emperor's niece Richeza of Lotharingia. Aftermath Due to Otto's early death in 1002, his renovatio policies were not fully realized. King Henry II, Otto's successor, changed the empire's policies. Boles≈Çaw supported Henry's rival, Margrave Eckard I of Meissen, expanded the Polish realm into the March of Lusatia and the Milceni lands, and also took the Bohemian throne at Prague, interfering with Henry's interests. During a meeting with Henry II in Merseburg, Boles≈Çaw was attacked by Henry's men and narrowly escaped with his life. As a consequence, the excellent relations between the Empire and Poland marked by the Congress of Gniezno turned into a state of hostility that soon emerged into a German- Polish War which finally ended with the 1018 Peace of Bautzen. Memorial erected in 2000 at Ko≈Çobrzeg It wasn't until Henry's death in 1024, that Boles≈Çaw was able to acquire the papal consent for his coronation as Polish king. The Pomeranian diocese of Ko≈Çobrzeg, founded as a consequence of the Congress of Gniezno, was overthrown by a pagan resurgence of the Pomeranians around 1007, and bishop Reinbern was forced to return to Boleslaw's court. The creation of the separate Archdiocese of Gniezno, as directly subordinate to the Holy see rather than a German archdiocese, kept Poland independent from the Holy Roman Empire throughout the Middle Ages. Around 1075 the Bishopric of Pozna≈Ñ became a suffragan diocese of Gniezno. The archdiocese then controlled the whole Piast realm, as confirmed by the papal Bull of Gniezno in 1136.

These cultural parades are predominantly showcased in the Bahamas where the music is also mainstreamed. There are also Junkanoo parades in Miami in June and Key West in October, where local black populations have their roots in the Caribbean. In addition to being a culture dance for Afro-North Carolinians and the Garifuna people, this type of dancing is also performed in The Bahamas on Independence day and other historical holidays. Dances are choreographed to the beat of goatskin drums and cowbells. History The festival may have originated several centuries ago, when enslaved descendants of Africans on plantations in The Bahamas celebrated holidays granted around Christmas time with dance, music, and costumes. After emancipation the tradition continued and junkanoo evolved from simple origins to a formal, organised parade with intricate costumes, themed music and official prizes within various categories. The origin of the word junkanoo is disputed. Theories include that it is named after a folk hero named John Canoe or that it is derived from the French gens inconnus (unknown people) as masks are worn by the revelers. Douglas Chambers, professor of African studies at the University of Southern Mississippi, suggests a possible Igbo origin from the Igbo yam deity Njoku Ji referencing festivities in time for the new yam festival. Chambers also suggests a link with the Igbo okonko masking tradition of southern Igboland which feature horned maskers and other masked characters in similar style to jonkonnu masks. Similarities with the Yoruba Egungun festivals have also been identified. However, an Akan origin is argued by some to be more likely because the celebration of the Fancy Dress Festivals/Masquerades are the same Christmas week(Dec 25- Jan 1st) and also John Canoe was in fact an existing king and hero that ruled Axim, Ghana before 1720, the same year the John Canoe festival was created in the Caribbean.\\"Fort Gross Frederiksburg, Princestown (1683)\\", Ghana Museums and Monuments Board. According to Edward Long, an 18th-century Jamaican slave owner/historian, the John Canoe festival was created in Jamaica and the Caribbean by enslaved Akans who backed the man known as John Canoe. John Canoe, from Axim, Ghana, was an Akan from the Ahanta. He was a soldier for the Germans, until one day he turned his back on them for his Ahanta people and sided with Nzima and Ashanti troops, in order to take the area from the Germans and other Europeans. The news of his victory reached Jamaica and he has been celebrated ever since that Christmas of 1708 when he first defeated Prussic forces for Axim. Twenty years later his stronghold was broken by neighbouring Fante forces aided by the military might of the British and Ahanta, Nzima and Ashanti captives were taken to Jamaica as prisoners of war. The festival itself included motifs from battles typical of Akan fashion. The Ashanti swordsman became the \\"horned headed man\\"; the Ashanti commander became \\"Pitchy patchy\\" who also wears a battledress with what would resemble charms, referred to as a \\"Batakari\\". Description Many of the colonies Jonkonnu was prominent, Bahamas, Jamaica (as Jankunu), Virginia celebrated Jonkonnu. Historian Stephen Nissenbaum described the festival as it was performed in 19th-century North Carolina: > Essentially, it involved a band of black men--generally young--who dressed > themselves in ornate and often bizarre costumes. Each band was led by a man > who was variously dressed in animal horns, elaborate rags, female disguise, > whiteface (and wearing a gentleman's wig!), or simply his \\"Sunday-go-to- > meeting-suit.\\" Accompanied by music, the band marched along the roads from > plantation to plantation, town to town, accosting whites along the way and > sometimes even entering their houses. In the process the men performed > elaborate and (to white observers) grotesque dances that were probably of > African origin. And in return for this performance they always demanded > money (the leader generally carried \\"a small bowl or tin cup\\" for this > purpose), though whiskey was an acceptable substitute.Stephen Nissenbaum, > The Battle for Christmas. New York: Vintage Books, 1997, p. 285. Example of Junkanoo costume December 2007 Popular culture The Junkanoo parade has featured in movies including the James Bond film Thunderball (erroneously described as a local Mardi Gras-type festival), After the Sunset and Jaws The Revenge, as well as in the season one episode \\"Calderone's Return (Part II)\\" of the 1984 television series Miami Vice, taking place on the fictitious island of St. Andrews. In the television show Top Chef: Allstars Season 8, episode 13, \\"Fit for a King\\", the contestants danced at the Junkanoo parade, learned about its history and competed to make the best dish for the Junkanoo King.

Some universities wanted to support high-performance applications like data mining, medical imaging and particle physics. This resulted in the creation of the very-high-performance Backbone Network Service, or vBNS, developed in 1995 by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and MCI for supercomputers at educational institutions. After the expiration of the NSF agreement, vBNS largely transitioned to providing service to the government. As a result, the research and education community founded Internet2 to serve its networking needs. The Internet2 Project was originally established by 34 university researchers in 1996 under the auspices of EDUCOM (later EDUCAUSE), and was formally organized as the not-for-profit University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) in 1997. It later changed its name to Internet2. Internet2 is a registered trademark.\\"Internet2 - Terms of Use\\" , Internet2. The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project.\\"Optical networking: The next generation - CNET News.com, By Marguerite Reardon (Staff Writer), Published October 11, 2004 4:00 AM PDT During 2004‚Äì2006, Internet2 and NLR held extensive discussions regarding a possible merger.\\"Internet2, National Lambda Rail, In Merger Talks (July 18, 2005)\\" Those talks paused in spring, 2006, resumed in March, 2007, but eventually ceased in the fall of 2007,Internate archive of now defunct www.internet2-nlr.org site) due to unresolved differences. In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s.\\"Speedy Internet2 gets 10x boost - USAToday.com, By Anick Jesdanun (AP Internet Writer), Published October 11, 2007 8:16 AM\\", Retrieved on 2009-06-26 In October, 2007, Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network. In 2010, Internet2 received a $62.5 million American Recovery and Reinvestment ACT grant,https://www2.ntia.doc.gov/grantee/university-corporation-for-advanced- internet-development which allowed Internet2 to put in place a long term IRU for fiber and upgrade the network with its own DWDM optical network system. Ciena later announced that this was the first 100G nationwide optical network. The upgrade to the new optical system was completed in December 2012. Objectives Internet2 provides the U.S. research and education community with a network that satisfies their bandwidth-intensive requirements. The network itself is a dynamic, robust and cost-effective hybrid optical and packet network. It furnishes a 100 Gbit/s network backbone to more than 210 U.S. educational institutions, 70 corporations and 45 non-profit and government agencies. The objectives of the Internet2 consortium are: * Developing and maintaining a leading-edge network. * Fully exploiting the capabilities of broadband connections through the use of new-generation applications. * Transferring new network services and applications to all levels of educational use, and eventually the broader Internet community. The uses of the network span from collaborative applications, distributed research experiments, grid-based data analysis to social networking. Some of these applications are in varying levels of commercialization, such as IPv6, open- source middleware for secure network access, Layer 2 VPNs and dynamic circuit networks. Achievements These technologies and their organizational counterparts were not only created to make a faster alternative to the Internet. Many fields have been able to use the Abilene network to foster creativity, research, and development in a way that was not previously possible. Users of poor quality libraries can now download not only text but sound recordings, animations, videos, and other resources, which would be otherwise unavailable. Another application is the robust video conferencing now available to Internet2 participants. Neurosurgeons can now video conference with other experts in the field during an operation in a high resolution format with no apparent time lag. Application awards The Internet2 Driving Exemplary Applications (IDEA) award (not to be confused with IDEA awards) was first announced by Internet2 in 2006 as a way of recognizing those who create and use advanced network applications at their best.Internet2 IDEA Awards The judging is conducted by many universities and based upon the following criteria: * Magnitude of the positive impact of the application for its (current) users * Technical merit of the application. * Breadth of impact, as indicated by current user base and likelihood of broader adoption by its full natural community of potential users Winners of the award are announced each year at the Spring member meeting: 2006, 2007, 2008.

He was also known by his courtesy name Shenggong () and as the King or Prince of Huaiyang (), a posthumous title bestowed upon him by Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han. The Gengshi Emperor was viewed as a weak and incompetent ruler, who briefly ruled over an empire willing to let him rule over them, but was unable to keep that empire together. He was eventually deposed by the Chimei (\\"Red Eyebrows\\") and strangled a few months after his defeat. Traditional historians treat his emperor status ambiguously‚Äîand sometimes he would be referred to as an emperor (with reference to his era name‚Äîthus, the Gengshi Emperor) and sometimes he would be referred to by his posthumous title, Prince of Huaiyang. The later title implied that he was only a pretender and the Eastern Han was the legitimate restoration of the earlier Han. The regime of the Gengshi Emperor is known in historiography as the Xuan Han (), after his personal name Liu Xuan.  Liu Yan and new emperor  Gengshi was a descendant of Emperor Jing of early Western Han dynasty, via the lineage of Liu Mai, Prince Ding of Changsha. His third cousin, Liu Yan, was a prominent general in the rebellions against the reign of Wang Mang in the short-lived Xin dynasty. In the year 22 AD, many rebel leaders were jealous of Liu Yan's capabilities despite many of their men admiring Liu Yan and wanting him to become the emperor of a restored Han dynasty. They found Liu Xuan, then another local rebel leader who was claiming the title of General Gengshi () at the time and was considered a weak personality, and requested that he be made emperor. Liu Yan initially opposed this move and instead suggested that Liu Xuan carry the title \\"King of Han\\" first (echoing the founder of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu). The other rebel leaders refused, and in early 23, Liu Xuan was proclaimed emperor. Liu Yan became prime minister.  Infighting, defeat of Wang Mang and the capture of Chang'an  The first major incident involving infighting in the Gengshi Emperor's regime happened shortly after the Battle of Kunyang which would lead to the demise of Wang Mang and the Xin dynasty. The Gengshi Emperor was fearful of Liu Yan's capabilities and keenly aware that many of Liu Yan's followers were angry that Liu Yan was not made emperor. Liu Ji (), was particularly critical of the Gengshi Emperor. The emperor arrested Liu Ji and wanted to execute him, but Liu Yan tried to intercede. The emperor took Liu Yan's intercession as a justification to execute Liu Yan as well. Subsequently, ashamed of what he had done, he spared Liu Yan's brother Liu Xiu and honoured him by creating him Marquess of Wuxin. The Gengshi Emperor then commissioned two armies, one led by Wang Kuang, targeting Luoyang, and the other led by Shentu Jian () and Li Song (), targeting Chang'an directly. All the populace on the way gathered, welcomed, and joined the Han forces. Shentu and Li quickly reached the outskirts of Chang'an. In response, the young men within Chang'an also rose up and stormed Weiyang Palace, the main imperial palace. Wang died during the battle at the palace, as did his daughter Princess Huanghuang (the former empress of Han). After Wang died, the crowd fought over the right to have the credit for having killed Wang, and many soldiers died in the ensuing fight. Wang's body was cut into pieces, and his head was delivered to the provisional Han capital Wancheng, to be hung on the city wall.  Attempted consolidation of power  After Wang Mang's death, the Gengshi Emperor moved his capital from Wancheng to Luoyang. He then issued edicts to the entire empire, promising to allow Xin local officials who submitted to him to keep their posts. For a brief period, nearly the entire empire showed at least nominal submission, even including the powerful Chimei general Fan Chong (), who moved to Luoyang following promises of titles and honours. However, this policy was applied inconsistently, and local governors soon became apprehensive about giving up their power. Fan Chong soon left the capital and returned to his troops. In response, the Gengshi Emperor sent out his generals to try to calm the local governors and populace; these included Liu Xiu, who was sent to pacify the region north of the Yellow River. Soon the people began to see that the powerful officials around the Gengshi Emperor were in fact uneducated men lacking ability to govern; this made them lose confidence in the emperor's government. The Gengshi Emperor's government was challenged by a major pretender in winter 23 AD. A fortuneteller in Handan named Wang Lang claimed to be actually named Liu Ziyu () and a son of Emperor Cheng. He claimed that his mother was a singer in Emperor Cheng's service, and that Empress Zhao Feiyan had tried to kill him after his birth, but that a substitute child was killed instead. After he spread these rumours, the people of Handan believed that he was a genuine son of Emperor Cheng, and the commanderies north of the Yellow River quickly pledged allegiance to him as emperor. Liu Xiu was forced to withdraw to the northern city of Jicheng (modern Beijing). After some difficulties, however, Liu Xiu was able to unify the northern commanderies still loyal to the Gengshi Emperor and besiege Handan in 24 AD, killing Wang Lang. The Gengshi Emperor put Liu Xiu in charge of the region north of the Yellow Rivera and created him the Prince of Xiao, but Liu Xiu, still aware that he was not truly trusted and angry about his brother's death, secretly planned to break away from the Gengshi Emperor's rule. He put in place a strategy to strip other imperially-commissioned generals of their powers and troops, and then concentrated the troops under his own command. The Gengshi Emperor moved his capital again, this time back to the Western Han capital of Chang'an. The people of Chang'an had previously been offended by the emperor's officials, who did not appreciate their rising up against Wang Mang but rather considered them traitors. Once the Gengshi Emperor was back in the capital, he issued a general pardon, which calmed the situation for a while. At this time, Chang'an was still largely intact, except for Weiyang Palace which had been destroyed by fire. However, the Gengshi Emperor's timidity quickly caused problems. When the imperial officials gathered for an official meeting, the emperor, who had never seen or been trained for such solemn occasions, seemed frightened and uncomfortable. Later, when generals submitted reports to him, he asked questions such as, \\"How much did you pillage today?\\" This type of behavior further reduced the people's confidence in him. The emperor entrusted his government to Zhao Meng (), whose daughter he took as an imperial consort. The emperor engaged in frequent drinking and was often unable to receive officials or make important decisions. In the meantime Zhao greatly abused his power. So when an honest official finally revealed Zhao's crimes to the Gengshi Emperor, the emperor had him executed. The other powerful officials also greatly abused their power causing great confusion and anger. In the autumn of 24 AD, the Gengshi Emperor sent his generals Li Bao () and Li Zhong () to try to capture modern Sichuan, then held by the local warlord Gongsun Shu (), but his generals were defeated by Gongsun.  Defeat by the Chimei (Red Eyebrows)  In the winter of 24 AD, there was an ominous development. The Chimei troops stationed at Puyang were weary and wanted to go home. Their leaders felt that if they did so, Chimei forces would scatter and would be unable to be gathered again when needed. So to give them a purpose for remaining together, their leaders decided to announce that they were attacking the imperial capital Chang'an and, divided the troops into two armies and then headed west. Liu Xiu, while he had a fairly strong force at his disposal, chose to stand by and wait for the Chimei to destroy the Gengshi Emperor. Liu Xiu used the Henei region (modern northern Henan, north of the Yellow River) as his base of operations because of its strategic location. The Chimei armies met up at Hongnong (ÂºòËæ≤, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), and defeated the armies that the emperor sent to stop them. In 25 AD, the Gengshi Emperor's forces led to the death of the former Western Han emperor-designate, Emperor Ruzi (Liu Ying). Two co-conspirators, Fang Wang (), the former strategist for the local warlord Wei Xiao (), and Gong Lin () led a force of several thousand men, which kidnapped Liu Ying and then occupied Linjing (Ëá®Ê∂á, in modern Qingyang, Gansu). The Gengshi Emperor sent his prime minister Li Song () with an army to attack them. They wiped out the rebel force, killing Liu Ying in the process. In the summer of 25, Liu Xiu finally made a formal break with the emperor, after his forces and those of the emperor fought over control of the Henei and Luoyang regions. Liu Xiu declared himself emperor (establishing the regime known later as the Eastern Han Dynasty). His general Deng Yu then captured Shanxi, further reducing the Gengshi Emperor's strength. Feeling trapped, a number of the emperor's generals conspired to kidnap him and flee back to their home region of Nanyang (in modern Henan). Their plan was uncovered and many were executed. However, one general, Zhang Ang () occupied most of Chang'an, forcing the Gengshi Emperor to flee, just as the Chimei forces were approaching. In the meantime, the Chimei decided that they also needed their own emperor. They found three descendants of Liu Zhang, Prince of Chengyang, who had been very popular with the people of his principality (from where many Chimei soldiers came) and who was worshipped as a god after his death. After drawing lots, the youngest of Liu Zhang's descendants, the 15-year-old Liu Penzi was chosen and declared emperor. However, the young \\"emperor\\" was not given any power. Rather, he was effectively a puppet of the Chimei army. Generals still loyal to the Gengshi Emperor were eventually able to evict Zhang Ang from the capital, but by that time the situation was desperate. Zhang and his allies surrendered to the Chimei and, working with them, attacked Chang'an, which fell quickly. The emperor fled, followed by his few remaining loyal followers, including Liu Zhi () the Prince of Dingtao and Liu Gong () the Marquess of Shi (who was Liu Penzi's older brother). They were eventually made prisoners by one of the Gengshi Emperor's generals, Yan Ben (), who, planned to hold them as bargaining chips. When Liu Xiu heard about the fall of Chang'an, he created the emperor Prince of Huaiyang, in absentia, and decreed that anyone who harmed the Prince of Huaiyang would be severely punished and that anyone who delivered him to Eastern Han would be rewarded. (This appears to be basically political propaganda on Liu Xiu's part.) When news of Chang'an's fall arrived in Luoyang, the city surrendered to Liu Xiu, who entered the city and made it his capital. In the winter of 25 AD, after being held by Yan Ben for a few months, the Gengshi Emperor realised that his situation was futile and requested Liu Gong to negotiate surrender terms. A promise was made that he would be made the Prince of Changsha. Emperor Penzi's general Xie Lu () arrived at Yan's camp and escorted the Gengshi Emperor back to Chang'an to offer his seal (seized from Wang Mang) to Emperor Penzi. However, the Chimei generals, notwithstanding the earlier promise, wanted to execute him. It was only Liu Gong's final intercession (in which he threatened to commit suicide at the execution site) that allowed the Gengshi Emperor to be spared and he was created the Prince of Changsha. However, the Gengshi Emperor was forced to stay in Xie Lu's headquarters, with Liu Gong protecting him. The Chimei generals were even less able to govern the capital than the emperor, because they were unable to control their soldiers from pillaging from the people. The people began to yearn for the return of the Gengshi Emperor. Zhang Ang and his allies, afraid of what might happen if the emperor returned to power, persuaded Xie Lu to strangle him. Liu Gong hid his body in a secure location, and years later, after Eastern Han had completely captured the Chang'an region, Liu Xiu had the Gengshi Emperor's body buried with princely honours at Baling (), near the tomb of Emperor Wen.

Todorov published a total of 39 books, including The Poetics of Prose (1971), Introduction to Poetics (1981), The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other (1982), Mikhail Bakhtin: The Dialogical Principle (1984), Facing the Extreme: Moral Life in the Concentration Camps (1991), On Human Diversity (1993), A French Tragedy: Scenes of Civil War, Summer 1944 (1994), Voices from the Gulag: Life and Death in Communist Bulgaria (1999), Hope and Memory (2000), Imperfect Garden: The Legacy of Humanism (2002), In Defence of the Enlightenment (2009), Memory as a Remedy for Evil (2010), The Totalitarian Experience (2011), The Inner Enemies of Democracy (2014) and Insoumis (2015). Todorov's historical interests have focused on such crucial issues as the conquest of The Americas and the German Nazi concentration camps. Todorov's greatest contribution to literary theory was his definition, in Introduction √† la litt√©rature fantastique (1970), of the Fantastic, the fantastic uncanny, and the fantastic marvelous. Todorov defines the fantastic as being any event that happens in our world that seems to be supernatural. Upon the occurrence of the event, we must decide if the event was an illusion or whether it is real and has actually taken place. Todorov uses Alvaro from Jacques Cazotte's Le Diable amoureux as an example of a fantastic event. Alvaro must decide whether the woman he is in love with is truly a woman or if she is the devil. Upon choosing whether the event was real or imaginary, Todorov says that we enter into the genres of uncanny and marvelous. In the fantastic uncanny, the event that occurs is actually an illusion of some sort. The \\"laws of reality\\" remain intact and also provide a rational explanation for the fantastic event. Todorov gives examples of dreams, drugs, illusions of the senses, madness, etc. as things that could explain a fantastic/supernatural event. In the fantastic marvelous, the supernatural event that occurs has actually taken place and therefore the \\"laws of reality\\" have to be changed to explain the event. Only if the implied reader cannot opt for one or the other possibility is the text purely fantastic. Aside from his work in literary theory, Todorov has also published studies of philosophy. He wrote Frail Happiness about the writings of Jean- Jacques Rousseau. He focuses on Rousseau's ideas of attaining human happiness and how we can live in 'modern' times. In one of his major works, Facing the Extreme, Todorov asks whether it is true the Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet Gulags revealed that in extreme situations \\"all traces of moral life evaporate as men become beasts locked in a merciless struggle for survival\\" (31‚Äì46). That opinion is commonplace of popularized accounts of the camps, and also appears in accounts of survivors themselves. Primo Levi, quoted in Todorov, writes that camp life is a \\"continuous war of everyone against everyone.\\" To survive, all dignity and conscience had to be sacrificed and everyone is alone. Reports from gulag survivors are similar. However, in his reading of actual survivor testimonies, Todorov says the picture is not that bleak, that there are many examples of inmates helping each other and showing compassion in human relationships despite the inhumane conditions and terror. Survivors point out that survival always depended on the help of others. He concludes that life in the camps and gulag did not follow the law of the jungle and that the counter-examples are numerous, even in Levi's work. Todorov's honors include the CNRS Bronze Medal, the Charles L√©v√™que Prize of the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques and the first Maugean Prize of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences; he was also an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He also received the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences. In 2015, he was awarded the [Wayne C. Booth] Award for lifetime achievement in narrative studies by the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Personal life and death Todorov was married twice. His first wife was the scholar Martine van Woerkens and his second was Nancy Huston, with whom he had two children, until 2014. He died on 7 February 2017, at the age of 77. He is survived by a son, Boris, from the first marriage, and a daughter, L√©a, and a son, Sacha, from the second.

The original purpose of the mug shot was to allow law enforcement to have a photographic record of an arrested individual to allow for identification by victims, the public and investigators. However, in the United States, entrepreneurs have recently begun to monetize these public records via the mug shot publishing industry. Photographing of criminals began in the 1840s only a few years after the invention of photography, but it was not until 1888 that French police officer Alphonse Bertillon standardized the process. Etymology \\"Mug\\" is an English slang term for \\"face\\", dating from the 18th century. Mug shot can more loosely mean any small picture of a face used for any reason. Description Self- portrait mug shot of Alphonse Bertillon, who developed and standardized this type of photograph, 22 August 1900 A typical mug shot is two-part, with one side-view photo, and one front-view. The background is usually stark and simple, to avoid distraction from the facial image (as distinguished from a casual snapshot in a more naturalistic setting). Mug shots may be compiled into a mug book in order to determine the identity of a criminal. In high- profile cases, mug shots may also be published in the mass media. History The earliest photos of prisoners taken for use by law enforcement may have been taken in Belgium in 1843 and 1844. In the United Kingdom, police in London were photographing criminals by 1846.‚ÄúA Cracksman,‚Äù The Will O‚Äôthe Wisp, 1 (2) Saturday 11 July 1846, p.3 In Liverpool and Birmingham they were doing so by 1848. By 1857, the New York City Police Department had a gallery where daguerreotypes of criminals were displayed. The Pinkerton National Detective Agency began using these on wanted posters in the United States. By the 1870s the agency had amassed the largest collection of mug shots in the US. The paired arrangement may have been inspired by the 1865 prison portraits taken by Alexander Gardner of accused conspirators in the Lincoln assassination trial, though Gardner's photographs were full-body portraits with only the heads turned for the profile shots. After the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871, the Prefecture of Police of Paris hired a photographer, Eug√®ne Appert, to take portraits of convicted prisoners. In 1888, Alphonse Bertillon invented the modern mug shot featuring full face and profile views, standardizing the lighting and angles. This system was soon adopted throughout Europe, and in the United States and Russia. The arrested person is sometimes required to hold a placard with name, date of birth, booking ID, weight, and other relevant information on it. With digital photography, the digital photograph is linked to a database record concerning the arrest. Use in wanted posters John Anglin Mug shots have often been incorporated into wanted posters, including those for the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Online mug shot publishing In the US in the early 21st century an online industry developed around the publication and removal of mug shots from internet websites. Prejudicial nature The US legal system has long held that mug shots can have a negative effect on juries. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, \\"The double-shot picture, with front and profile shots alongside each other, is so familiar, from 'wanted' posters in the post office, motion pictures and television, that the inference that the person involved has a criminal record, or has at least been in trouble with the police, is natural, perhaps automatic.\\"Barnes v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 318, 365 F.2d 509, 510--11 (1966) According to the Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence, \\"Because of the risk of prejudice to the defendant inherent in the admission of photographs of the 'mug shot' variety, judges and prosecutors are required to 'use reasonable means to avoid calling the jury's attention to the source of such photographs used to identify the defendant.'\\" (p. 617) Elsewhere, it cites a ruling in Commonwealth v. Martin that \\"admission of a defendant's mug shot is 'laden for characterizing the defendant as a careerist in crime. Other states have similar rules.\\"Where admitted, to the extent possible, the mug shots should be taped over or cut to delete all reference to booking information and be undated. The photographs should not be referred to as either \\"mug shots\\" or \\"booking photographs.\\"\\" Handbook of Illinois Evidence, Michael H.

Life Brought up on his father's estate of M√©r√© in Touraine, he conceived a bitter aversion for the nobility, which seemed to strengthen with time. He would never take the name \\"de M√©r√©\\", to which he was entitled, lest he should be thought a nobleman. At the age of fifteen he was sent to Paris to complete his education; his father's teaching had already inspired him with a passionate devotion to Greek literature, and although he showed considerable mathematical ability, he continued to devote all his leisure to the classics. He entered the school of artillery at Ch√¢lons, however, and immediately on receiving his appointment as sub-lieutenant in September 1793 he joined the army of the Rhine. He served in various campaigns of the Revolutionary wars, especially in those of Italy in 1798-99 and 1806-7, and in the German campaign of 1809. He became chef d'escadron in 1803. He made his first appearance as an author in 1802, when he contributed to the Magasin encyclop√©dique a critique on Johann Schweigh√§user's edition of Athenaeus. In the following year appeared his Eloge d'H√©l√®ne, a free imitation rather than a translation from Isocrates, which he had sketched in 1798. Courier had given up his commission in the autumn of 1808, but the general enthusiasm in Paris over the preparations for the new campaign affected him, and he attached himself to the staff of a general of artillery. But he was horror-struck by the carnage at Wagram (1809), refusing from that time to believe that there was any art in war. He hastily quit Vienna, escaping the formal charge of desertion because his new appointment had not been confirmed. The savage independence of his nature rendered subordination intolerable to him; he had been three times disgraced for absenting himself without leave, and his superiors resented his satirical humour. After leaving the army he went to Florence, and was fortunate enough to discover in the Laurentian Library a complete manuscript of Longus's Daphnis and Chloe, an edition of which he published in 1810. In consequence of a misadventure‚Äîblotting the manuscript‚Äîhe was involved in a quarrel with the librarian, and was compelled by the government to leave Tuscany. He retired to his estate at V√©retz (Indre-et-Loire), but frequently visited Paris, and divided his attention between literature and his farm. After the second restoration of the Bourbons the career of Courier as political pamphleteer began. He had before this time waged war against local wrongs in his own district, and had been the adviser and helpful friend of his neighbours. He now made himself by his letters and pamphlets one of the most dreaded opponents of the government of the Restoration. The first of these was his Petition aux deux chambres (1816), exposing the sufferings of the peasantry under the royalist reaction. In 1817 he was a candidate for a vacant seat in the Institute; and failing, he took his revenge by publishing a bitter Lettre √† Messieurs de l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1819). This was followed (1819‚Äì1820) by a series of political letters of extraordinary power published in Le Censeur Europ√©en. He advocated a liberal monarchy, at the head of which he doubtless wished to see Louis Philippe. The proposal, in 1821, to purchase the estate of Chambord for the duke of Bordeaux called forth from Courier the Simple Discours de Paul Louis, vigneron de la Chavonni√®re, one of his best pieces. For this he was tried and condemned to suffer a short imprisonment and to pay a fine. Before he went to prison he published a compte rendu of his trial, which had a still larger circulation than the Discours itself. In 1823 appeared the Livret de Paul Louis, the Gazette de village, followed in 1824 by his famous Pamphlet des pamphlets, called by his biographer, Armand Carrel, his swan-song. Courier published in 1807 his translation from Xenophon, Du commandement de la cavalerie et de l'equitation, and had a share in editing the Collections des romans grecs. He also projected a translation of Herodotus, and published a specimen, in which he attempted to imitate archaic French; but he did not live to carry out this plan. On April 10, 1825, on a Sunday afternoon, Courier was found shot in a wood near his house. The murderers, who were servants of his own, remained undiscovered for five years. There were many stories in the village of Veretz that they had been fired for their sexual liaisons with his wife, who left him for Paris shortly afterwards. He is buried in Veretz cemetery, close to his son and the grave of the later poet Eug√®ne Bizeau. The anarchist poet's grandmother was mentioned in Courier's own work. There were, however, rumours of a political murder by the authorities which remained current for many years. The writings of Courier, dealing with the facts and events of his own time, are valuable sources of information as to the condition of France before, during, and after the Revolution. Sainte-Beuve finds in Courier's own words, \\"peu de mati√®re et beaucoup d'art\\", the secret and device of his talent, which gives his writings a value independent of the somewhat ephemeral subject-matter. A Collection compl√®te des pamphlets politiques et opuscules litteraires de P. L. Courier appeared in 1826. See editions of his ≈íuvres (1848), with an admirable biography by Armand Carrel, which is reproduced in a later edition, with a supplementary criticism by Francisque Sarcey (1876‚Äì1877); also three notices by Sainte-Beuve in the Causeries du lundi and the Nouveaux Lundis. In the centre of Veretz there is a stele, raised in honour of Courier 50 years after his murder, and the opening was observed by many eminent writers of the time.

The circuit was invented in 1915 by American engineer Ralph Hartley. The distinguishing feature of the Hartley oscillator is that the tuned circuit consists of a single capacitor in parallel with two inductors in series (or a single tapped inductor), and the feedback signal needed for oscillation is taken from the center connection of the two inductors.  History  Original patent drawing The Hartley oscillator was invented by Hartley while he was working for the Research Laboratory of the Western Electric Company. Hartley invented and patented the design in 1915 while overseeing Bell System's transatlantic radiotelephone tests; it was awarded patent number 1,356,763 on October 26, 1920. Note that the basic schematic shown below labeled \\"Common-drain Hartley circuit\\" is essentially the same as in the patent drawing, except that the tube is replaced by a J-FET, and that the battery for a negative grid bias is not needed. In 1946 Hartley was awarded the IRE medal of honor \\"For his early work on oscillating circuits employing triode tubes and likewise for his early recognition and clear exposition of the fundamental relationship between the total amount of information which may be transmitted over a transmission system of limited band-width and the time required.\\" Ralph V. L. Hartley, Legacies, IEEE History Center, updated January 23, 2003, http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Ralph_Hartley (The second half of the citation refers to Hartley's work in information theory which largely paralleled Harry Nyquist.) Operation Common-drain Hartley circuit The Hartley oscillator is distinguished by a tank circuit consisting of two series-connected coils (or, often, a tapped coil) in parallel with a capacitor, with an amplifier between the relatively high impedance across the entire LC tank and the relatively low voltage/high current point between the coils. The original 1915 version used a triode as the amplifying device in common plate (cathode follower) configuration, with three batteries, and separate adjustable coils. The simplified circuit shown to the right uses a JFET (in common-drain configuration), an LC tank circuit (here the single winding is tapped) and a single battery. The circuit illustrates the Hartley oscillator operation: * the output from the JFET's source (emitter, if a BJT had been used; cathode for a triode) has the same phase as the signal at its gate (or base) and roughly the same voltage as its input (which is the voltage across the entire tank circuit), but the current is amplified, i.e. it is acting as a current buffer or voltage-controlled voltage-source. * this low impedance output is then fed into the coil tapping, effectively into an autotransformer that will step up the voltage, requiring a relatively high current (compared with that available at the top of the coil). * with the capacitor-coil resonance, all frequencies other than the tuned frequency will tend to be absorbed (the tank will appear as nearly 0Œ© near DC due to the inductor's low reactance at low frequencies, and low again at very high frequencies due to the capacitor); they will also shift the phase of the feedback from the 0¬∞ needed for oscillation at all but the tuned frequency. Variations on the simple circuit often include ways to automatically reduce the amplifier gain to maintain a constant output voltage at a level below overload; the simple circuit above will limit the output voltage due to the gate conducting on positive peaks, effectively damping oscillations but not before significant distortion (spurious harmonics) may result. Changing the tapped coil to two separate coils, as in the original patent schematic, still results in a working oscillator but now that the two coils are not magnetically coupled the inductance, and so frequency, calculation has to be modified (see below), and the explanation of the voltage increase mechanism is more complicated than the autotransformer scenario. A quite different implementation using a tapped coil in an LC tank feedback arrangement is to employ a common-grid (or common-gate or common-base) amplifier stage, which is still non-inverting but provides voltage gain instead of current gain; the coil tapping is still connected to the cathode (or source or emitter), but this is now the (low impedance) input to the amplifier; the split tank circuit is now dropping the impedance from the relatively high output impedance of the plate (or drain or collector). Comparison of Hartley and Colpitts oscillator The Hartley oscillator is the dual of the Colpitts oscillator which uses a voltage divider made of two capacitors rather than two inductors. Although there is no requirement for there to be mutual coupling between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented using a tapped coil, with the feedback taken from the tap, as shown here. The optimal tapping point (or ratio of coil inductances) depends on the amplifying device used, which may be a bipolar junction transistor, FET, triode, or amplifier of almost any type (non-inverting in this case, although variations of the circuit with an earthed centre-point and feedback from an inverting amplifier or the collector/drain of a transistor are also common), but a junction FET (shown) or triode is often employed as a good degree of amplitude stability (and thus distortion reduction) can be achieved with a simple grid leak resistor- capacitor combination in series with the gate or grid (see the Scott circuit below) thanks to diode conduction on signal peaks building up enough negative bias to limit amplification. Op-amp version of Hartley oscillator The frequency of oscillation is approximately the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. If the capacitance of the tank capacitor is C and the total inductance of the tapped coil is L then :f = {1 \\\\over 2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt {LC}} \\\\, If two uncoupled coils of inductance L1 and L2 are used then :L = L_1 + L_2 \\\\, However, if the two coils are magnetically coupled the total inductance will be greater because of mutual inductance kJim McLucas, Hartley oscillator requires no coupled inductors, EDN October 26, 2006 :L = L_1 + L_2 + k \\\\sqrt{L_1 L_2} \\\\, The actual oscillation frequency will be slightly lower than given above, because of parasitic capacitance in the coil and loading by the transistor. Advantages of the Hartley oscillator : * The frequency may be adjusted using a single variable capacitor, one side of which can be earthed * The output amplitude remains constant over the frequency range * Either a tapped coil or two fixed inductors are needed, and very few other components * Easy to create an accurate fixed-frequency crystal oscillator variation by replacing the capacitor with a (parallel-resonant) quartz crystal or replacing the top half of the tank circuit with a crystal and grid-leak resistor (as in the Tri-tet oscillator). Disadvantages: * Harmonic-rich output if taken from the amplifier and not directly from the LC circuit (unless amplitude- stabilisation circuitry is employed).

The Jefferson Highway was replaced with the new numbered US Highway system in the late 1920s. Portions of the highway are still named Jefferson Highway, for example: the portions that run through Jefferson Parish, Louisiana; East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana; Lee's Summit, Missouri; Osseo, Minnesota; and Wadena, Minnesota. It was built in the 1910s as part of the National Auto Trail system. Named for President Thomas Jefferson, inspired by the east-west Lincoln Highway, it was nicknamed the \\"Palm to Pine Highway\\", for the varying types of trees found at either end. History 1917 Obelisk marking southern end of Jefferson Highway, on the corner of St. Charles & Common Streets in the New Orleans Central Business District The southern terminus of the Jefferson Highway was in New Orleans, Louisiana at the intersection of St. Charles Avenue and Common Street.[The Times-Picayune, 17 December 1916] It is marked by a six-foot tall Georgia granite obelisk donated by the New Orleans chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The obelisk was installed on April 15, 1918,[The New Orleans Item, 16 April 1918] and it was formally dedicated the following January.[The Times-Picayune, 15 January 1919] The original route (finalized in December 1916)[The Times-Picayune, 17 December 1916] on today's roads is as follows: *Louisiana **New Orleans to Kenner: ***From the southern terminus at Common Street, the Jefferson Highway followed St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street, City Park Avenue, and Metairie Road into Jefferson Parish. ***Leaving New Orleans, the Jefferson Highway followed Metairie Road, Shrewsbury Road, and Jefferson Highway to Kenner. This route is covered by LA 611-9, LA 3261, LA 611-3, US 90, and LA 48. (The section of road that is called \\"Jefferson Highway\\" between Shrewsbury Road and the New Orleans city limits at South Claiborne Avenue was not part of the original route, as it did not exist until 1928.)[The Times-Picayune, 30 July 1928] **Kenner to Geismar: ***From Kenner to Geismar, the Jefferson Highway followed alongside the east bank levee of the Mississippi River which, due to various sections of levee being relocated during the 1920s and 1930s, is often a significant distance removed from the modern River Road.

Scott-Taggart, The Manual of Modern Radio, London: The Amalgamated Press LTD., 1933, p. 94 The regenerative receiver was invented in 1912 and patented in 1914US Patent 1113149A, Edwin H. Armstrong, Wireless receiving system, filed October 29, 1913, granted October 6, 1914 by American electrical engineer Edwin Armstrong when he was an undergraduate at Columbia University. It was widely used between 1915 and World War II. Advantages of regenerative receivers include increased sensitivity with modest hardware requirements, and increased selectivity because the Q of the tuned circuit will be increased when the amplifying vacuum tube or transistor has its feedback loop around the tuned circuit (via a \\"tickler\\" winding or a tapping on the coil) because it introduces some negative resistance. Due partly to its tendency to radiate interference when oscillating, by the 1930s the regenerative receiver was largely superseded by other TRF receiver designs (for example \\"reflex\\" receivers) and especially by another Armstrong invention - superheterodyne receivers and is largely considered obsolete. Regeneration (now called positive feedback) is still widely used in other areas of electronics, such as in oscillators, active filters, and bootstrapped amplifiers. A receiver circuit that used larger amounts of regeneration in a more complicated way to achieve even higher amplification, the superregenerative receiver, was also invented by Armstrong in 1922. It was never widely used in general commercial receivers, but due to its small parts count it was used in specialized applications. One widespread use during WWII was IFF transceivers, where single tuned circuit completed the entire electronics system. It is still used in a few specialized low data rate applications, such as garage door openers, wireless networking devices, walkie-talkies and toys. Regenerative receiver Armstrong circuit, in which the feedback was applied to the input (grid) of the tube with a \\"tickler coil\\" winding on the tuning inductor. The gain of any amplifying device, such as a vacuum tube, transistor, or op amp, can be increased by feeding some of the energy from its output back into its input in phase with the original input signal. This is called positive feedback or regenerationK. R. Sturley, Radio Receiver Design (Part I), New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1943, p. 392. Because of the large amplification possible with regeneration, regenerative receivers often use only a single amplifying element (tube or transistor) E. Williams, 1961, pp. 156-158. In a regenerative receiver the output of the tube or transistor is connected back to its own input through a tuned circuit (LC circuit)Cruft Electronics Staff, Electronic Circuits and Tubes, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1947, pp. 741-744 H. A. Robinson, \\"Regenerative Detectors\\", QST, vol. XVII, no. 2, p. 26, Feb. 1933. The tuned circuit allows positive feedback only at its resonant frequency. In regenerative receivers using only one active device, the same tuned circuit is coupled to the antenna and also serves to select the radio frequency to be received, usually by means of variable capacitance. In the regenerative circuit discussed here, the active device also functions as a detector; this circuit is also known as a regenerative detector. A regeneration control is usually provided for adjusting the amount of feedback (the loop gain). It is desirable for the circuit design to provide regeneration control that can gradually increase feedback to the point of oscillation and that provides control of the oscillation from small to larger amplitude and back to no oscillation without jumps of amplitude or hysteresis in controlK. R. Sturley, 1943, pp. 394-395E. E. Zepler, \\"Oscillation Hysteresis in Grid Detectors\\", Wireless Engineer, vol. XXIII, no. 275, Aug. 1946, p. 222Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 743E. E. Zepler, The Technique of Radio Design, 2nd ed., New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1951, p. 168. Two important attributes of a radio receiver are sensitivity and selectivityCruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 741. The regenerative detector provides sensitivity and selectivity due to voltage amplification and the characteristics of a resonant circuit consisting of inductance and capacitance. The regenerative voltage amplification u_{\\\\mathrm{o}} is u_{\\\\mathrm{o}} = u / (1-ua) where u is the non-regenerative amplification and a is the portion of the output signal fed back to the L2 C2 circuit. As 1-ua becomes smaller the amplification increasesW. L. Everitt, 1937, p. 464. The Q of the tuned circuit (L2 C2) without regeneration is Q=X_{\\\\mathrm{L}}/R where X_{\\\\mathrm{L}} is the reactance of the coil and R represents the total dissipative loss of the tuned circuit. The positive feedback compensates the energy loss caused by R, so it may be viewed as introducing a negative resistance R_{\\\\mathrm{r}} to the tuned circuitCruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 743. The Q of the tuned circuit with regeneration is Q_{\\\\mathrm{reg}} = X_{\\\\mathrm{L}}/(R-R_{\\\\mathrm{r}})Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 743. The regeneration increases the Q. Oscillation begins when R_{\\\\mathrm{r}}=R. Regeneration can increase the detection gain of a detector by a factor of 1,700 or more. This is quite an improvement, especially for the low-gain vacuum tubes of the 1920s and early 1930s. The type 36 screen-grid tube (obsolete since the mid-1930s) had a non-regenerative detection gain (audio frequency plate voltage divided by radio frequency input voltage) of only 9.2 at 7.2 MHz, but in a regenerative detector, had detection gain as high as 7,900 at critical regeneration (non-oscillating) and as high as 15,800 with regeneration just above critical. The \\"... non-oscillating regenerative amplification is limited by the stability of the circuit elements, tube [or device] characteristics and [stability of] supply voltages which determine the maximum value of regeneration obtainable without self-oscillation\\". Intrinsically, there is little or no difference in the gain and stability available from vacuum tubes, JFETs, MOSFETs or bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). A major improvement in stability and a small improvement in available gain for reception of CW radiotelegraphy is provided by the use of a separate oscillator, known as a heterodyne oscillator or beat oscillatorR. J. Talbert, \\"The Simple Regenerative Receiver with Separate Beat Oscillator\\", QST, vol. XX, no. 2, p. 15, Feb. 1936. Providing the oscillation separately from the detector allows the regenerative detector to be set for maximum gain and selectivity - which is always in the non-oscillating condition. Interaction between the detector and the beat oscillator can be minimized by operating the beat oscillator at half of the receiver operating frequency, using the second harmonic of the beat oscillator in the detector. =AM reception= For AM reception, the gain of the loop is adjusted so it is just below the level required for oscillation (a loop gain of just less than one). The result of this is to greatly increase the gain of the amplifier at the bandpass frequency (resonant frequency), while not increasing it at other frequencies. So the incoming radio signal is amplified by a large factor, 103 \\\\- 105, increasing the receiver's sensitivity to weak signals. The high gain also has the effect of reducing the circuit's bandwidth (increasing the Q) by an equal factor, increasing the selectivity of the receiver. =CW reception (autodyne mode)= For the reception of CW radiotelegraphy (Morse code), the feedback is increased just to the point of oscillation. The tuned circuit is adjusted to provide typically 400 to 1000 Hertz difference between the receiver oscillation frequency and the desired transmitting station's signal frequency. The two frequencies beat in the nonlinear amplifier, generating heterodyne or beat frequenciesSignal Corps U.S. Army, The Principles Underlying Radio Communication, 2nd ed. Washington, DC: U.S.G.P.O., 1922, p. 501. The difference frequency, typically 400 to 1000 Hertz, is in the audio range; so it is heard as a tone in the receiver's speaker whenever the station's signal is present. Demodulation of a signal in this manner, by use of a single amplifying device as oscillator and mixer simultaneously, is known as autodyne receptionSignal Corps U.S. Army, 1922, p. 503. The term autodyne predates multigrid tubes and is not applied to use of tubes specifically designed for frequency conversion. =SSB reception= For the reception of single-sideband (SSB) signals, the circuit is also adjusted to oscillate as in CW reception. The tuning is adjusted until the demodulated voice is intelligible. = Advantages and disadvantages = Regenerative receivers require fewer components than other types of receiver circuit, such as the TRF and superheterodyne. The circuit's advantage was that it got much more amplification (gain) out of the expensive vacuum tubes, thus reducing the number of tubes required and therefore the cost of a receiver. Early vacuum tubes had low gain and tended to oscillate at radio frequencies (RF). TRF receivers often required 5 or 6 tubes; each stage requiring tuning and neutralization, making the receiver cumbersome, power hungry, and hard to adjust. A regenerative receiver, by contrast, could often provide adequate reception with the use of only one tube. In the 1930s the regenerative receiver was replaced by the superheterodyne circuit in commercial receivers due to the superheterodyne's superior performance and the falling cost of tubes. Since the advent of the transistor in 1946, the low cost of active devices has removed most of the advantage of the circuit. However, in recent years the regenerative circuit has seen a modest comeback in receivers for low cost digital radio applications such as garage door openers, keyless locks, RFID readers and some cell phone receivers. A disadvantage of this receiver, especially in designs that couple the detector tuned circuit to the antenna, is that the regeneration (feedback) level must be adjusted when the receiver is tuned to a different frequency. The antenna impedance varies with frequency, changing the loading of the input tuned circuit by the antenna, requiring the regeneration to be adjusted. In addition, the Q of the detector tuned circuit components vary with frequency, requiring adjustment of the regeneration control. A disadvantage of the single active device regenerative detector in autodyne operation is that the local oscillation causes the operating point to move significantly away from the ideal operating point, resulting in the detection gain being reduced.R. De Cola, \\"Increased Sensitivity With the Regenerative Detector\\", QST, vol. XVIII, no. 12, p. 24, Dec. 1934. Another drawback is that when the circuit is adjusted to oscillate it can radiate a signal from its antenna, so it can cause interference to other nearby receivers. Adding an RF amplifier stage between the antenna and the regenerative detector can reduce unwanted radiation, but would add expense and complexity. Other shortcomings of regenerative receivers are the sensitive and unstable tuning. These problems have the same cause: a regenerative receiver‚Äôs gain is greatest when it operates on the verge of oscillation, and in that condition, the circuit behaves chaotically.Domine M.W.

From p. 252: \\" ‚Ä¶ a free oscillation starts every time the resistance of the circuit becomes negative. ‚Ä¶ The free oscillations produced in the system when no signaling emf. is impressed, must be initiated by some irregularity of operation of the vacuum tubes, ‚Ä¶ .\\" Simple regenerative receivers electrically couple the antenna to the detector tuned circuit, resulting in the electrical characteristics of the antenna influencing the resonant frequency of the detector tuned circuit. Any movement of the antenna or large objects near the antenna can change the tuning of the detector. =History= The inventor of FM radio, Edwin Armstrong, invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college, in 1914. He patented the superregenerative circuit in 1922, and the superheterodyne receiver in 1918. Lee De Forest filed a patent in 1916 that became the cause of a contentious lawsuit with the prolific inventor Armstrong, whose patent for the regenerative circuit had been issued in 1914. The lawsuit lasted twelve years, winding its way through the appeals process and ending up at the Supreme Court. Armstrong won the first case, lost the second, stalemated at the third, and then lost the final round at the Supreme Court. At the time the regenerative receiver was introduced, vacuum tubes were expensive and consumed much power, with the added expense and encumbrance of heavy batteries. So this design, getting most gain out of one tube, filled the needs of the growing radio community and immediately thrived. Although the superheterodyne receiver is the most common receiver in use today, the regenerative radio made the most out of very few parts. In World War II the regenerative circuit was used in some military equipment. An example is the German field radio \\"Torn.E.b\\". = Manpack radio Regenerative receivers needed far fewer tubes and less power consumption for nearly equivalent performance. A related circuit, the superregenerative detector, found several highly important military uses in World War II in Friend or Foe identification equipment and in the top-secret proximity fuze. An example here is the miniature RK61 thyratron marketed in 1938, which was designed specifically to operate like a vacuum triode below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in radio control receivers, and was the major technical development which led to the wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of radio controlled modelling as a hobby.George Honnest-Redlich Radio Control for Models (1950) p. 7 In the 1930s, the superheterodyne design began to gradually supplant the regenerative receiver, as tubes became far less expensive. In Germany the design was still used in the millions of mass- produced German \\"peoples receivers\\" (Volksempf√§nger) and \\"German small receivers\\" (DKE, Deutscher Kleinempf√§nger). Even after WWII, the regenerative design was still present in early after-war German minimal designs along the lines of the \\"peoples receivers\\" and \\"small receivers\\", dictated by lack of materials. Frequently German military tubes like the \\"RV12P2000\\" were employed in such designs. There were even superheterodyne designs, which used the regenerative receiver as a combined IF and demodulator with fixed regeneration. The superregenerative design was also present in early FM broadcast receivers around 1950. Later it was almost completely phased out of mass production, remaining only in hobby kits, and some special applications, like gate openers. Superregenerative receiver Edwin Armstrong presenting the superregenerative receiver at the June 28, 1922 meeting of the Radio Club of America in Havemeyer Hall, Columbia University, New York. His prototype 3 tube receiver was as sensitive as conventional receivers with 9 tubes. The superregenerative receiver uses a second lower-frequency oscillation (within the same stage or by using a second oscillator stage) to provide single-device circuit gains of around one million. This second oscillation periodically interrupts or \\"quenches\\" the main RF oscillation.Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 744 Ultrasonic quench rates between 30 and 100 kHz are typical. After each quenching, RF oscillation grows exponentially, starting from the tiny energy picked up by the antenna plus circuit noise. The amplitude reached at the end of the quench cycle (linear mode) or the time taken to reach limiting amplitude (log mode) depends on the strength of the received signal from which exponential growth started. A low-pass filter in the audio amplifier filters the quench and RF frequencies from the output, leaving the AM modulation. This provides a crude but very effective automatic gain control (AGC). =Advantages and applications= Superregenerative detectors work well for wide-band signals such as FM, where they perform \\"slope detection\\". Regenerative detectors work well for narrow-band signals, especially for CW and SSB which need a heterodyne oscillator or BFO. A superregenerative detector does not have a usable heterodyne oscillator ‚Äì even though the superregen always self-oscillates, so CW (Morse code)and SSB (single side band) signals can't be received properly. Superregeneration is most valuable above 27 MHz, and for signals where broad tuning is desirable. The superregen uses many fewer components for nearly the same sensitivity as more complex designs. It is easily possible to build superregen receivers which operate at microwatt power levels, in the 30 to 6,000 MHz range. It removes the need for the operator to manually adjust regeneration level to just below the point of oscillation - the circuit automatically is taken out of oscillation periodically, but with the disadvantage that small amounts of interference may be a problem for others. These are ideal for remote-sensing applications or where long battery life is important. For many years, superregenerative circuits have been used for commercial products such as garage-door openers, radar detectors, microwatt RF data links, and very low cost walkie-talkies. Because the superregenerative detectors tend to receive the strongest signal and ignore other signals in the nearby spectrum, the superregen works best with bands that are relatively free of interfering signals. Due to Nyquist's theorem, its quenching frequency must be at least twice the signal bandwidth. But quenching with overtones acts further as a heterodyne receiver mixing additional unneeded signals from those bands into the working frequency. Thus the overall bandwidth of superregenerator cannot be less than 4 times that of the quench frequency, assuming the quenching oscillator produces an ideal sine wave. Patents  * 1940.

He ruled over parts of China at first, and through suppression and conquest of regional warlords, the whole of China was consolidated by the time of his death in AD 57. Liu Xiu was one of the many descendants of the Han imperial family. Following the usurpation of the Han throne by Wang Mang and the ensuing civil war during the disintegration of Wang's short-lived Xin dynasty, he emerged as one of several descendants of the fallen dynasty claiming the imperial throne. After assembling forces and proclaiming himself emperor in the face of competitors, he was able to defeat his rivals, destroy the peasant army of the Chimei, known for their disorganization and marauding, and finally reunify China in AD 36. He established his capital in Luoyang, east of the former capital Chang'an, ushering in the Later/Eastern Han dynasty. He implemented some reforms (notably land reform, albeit not very successfully) aimed at correcting some of the structural imbalances responsible for the downfall of the Former/Western Han. His reforms gave a new 200-year lease of life to the Han Dynasty. Emperor Guangwu's campaigns featured many able generals, but curiously, he lacked major strategists. That may very well be because he himself appeared to be a brilliant strategist; he often instructed his generals on strategy from afar, and his predictions generally would be accurate. This was often emulated by later emperors who fancied themselves great strategists but who actually lacked Emperor Guangwu's brilliance‚Äîusually to great disastrous results. Also unique among emperors in Chinese history was Emperor Guangwu's combination of decisiveness and mercy. He often sought out peaceful means rather than bellicose means of putting areas under his control. He was, in particular, one rare example of a founding emperor of a dynasty who did not kill, out of jealousy or paranoia, any of the generals or officials who contributed to his victories after his rule was secure. Family background Liu Xiu was the sixth generation descendant of Emperor Jing of the Western Han dynasty. He was the son of Liu Qin (ÂäâÊ¨Ω), magistrate (i.e., head official) of Nandun county (ÂçóÈ†ì‰ª§). Liu Qin was the son of Liu Hui (ÂäâÂõû), vice governor in charge of military affairs for Julu Commandery (ÈâÖÈπøÈÉΩÂ∞â). Liu Hui was the son of Liu Wai (ÂäâÂ§ñ), governor of Yulin commandery (È¨±ÊûóÂ§™ÂÆà). Liu Wai was the son of Liu Mai (ÂäâË≤∑), known posthumously as Marquess Jie of Chongling (ËàÇÈôµÁØÄ‰æØ). Liu Mai was the son of Liu Fa (ÂäâÁôº), known posthumously as Prince Ding of Changsha (Èï∑Ê≤ôÂÆöÁéã). The Prince of Changsha was a brother of Emperor Wu, a famous emperor of the Former Han and the son of Emperor Jing and Lady Tang. As a descendant of Liu Fa, this also made Liu Xiu third cousin to the Gengshi Emperor. Liu Qin was married to the daughter of one Fan Chong (Ê®äÈáç), and he and his wife had three sons ‚Äì Liu Yan, Liu Zhong (Âäâ‰ª≤), and Liu Xiu. Liu Qin died early, and the brothers were raised by their uncle Liu Liang (ÂäâËâØ). Liu Yan was ambitious, and ever since Wang Mang usurped the Han throne in AD 8 and established the Xin dynasty, Liu Yan was constantly considering starting a rebellion to restore the Han Dynasty. Liu Xiu, in contrast, was a careful man who was content to be a farmer. However, his brother-in-law Deng Chen (ÈÑßÊô®), the husband of his sister Liu Yuan (ÂäâÂÖÉ), who believed in a prophecy that a man named Liu Xiu would be emperor, constantly encouraged him to be more ambitious. Participation in his brother's rebellion In AD 22, with virtually the entire empire rebelling against Wang Mang's incompetent rule, Liu Yan prepared his rebellion. He planned, along with his brothers, and Li Tong (ÊùéÈÄö) and his cousin Li Yi (ÊùéËªº), to kidnap the governor for Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern Nanyang, Henan) and call for the people of the commandery to join him. When the young men of their home territory of Chongling heard about the rebellion, they were all scared to join‚Äîuntil they saw that Liu Xiu was part of the rebellion as well, figuring that if even a careful man like Liu Xiu was part of the rebellion, the rebellion was carefully planned. However, the news of the plan leaked out, and Li Tong and Li Yi barely escaped with their lives (but their family was slaughtered). Liu Yan changed his plan and persuaded two branches of the L√ºlin ‚Äì the Xinshi Force (Êñ∞Â∏ÇÂÖµ) and Pinglin Force (Âπ≥ÊûóÂÖµ) to join forces with him, and they had some military success. Encouraged, Liu Yan made a frontal assault against Wancheng (ÂÆõÂüé), the capital of Nanyang Commandery‚Äîand suffered a major loss. Liu Yan and Liu Xiu, along with their sister Liu Boji (Âäâ‰ºØÂß¨), survived, but their brother Liu Zhong and sister Liu Yuan died in the battle. Liu Yan's allies, seeing his defeat, considered leaving him, but Liu Yan was able to persuade them, along with another branch of the L√ºlin, the Xiajiang Force (‰∏ãÊ±üÂÖµ), to join him. In AD 23, they had a major victory against Xin forces, killing Zhen Fu (ÁîÑÈòú), the governor of Nanyang Commandery. As official under Gengshi Emperor =The ascension of Gengshi Emperor= By this point, many other rebel leaders had become jealous of Liu Yan's capabilities, and while a good number of their men admired Liu Yan and wanted him to become the emperor of a newly declared Han Dynasty, they had other ideas. They found another local rebel leader, Liu Xuan, a third cousin of Liu Yan, who was claiming the title of General Gengshi (Êõ¥ÂßãÂ∞áËªç) at the time and who was considered a weak personality, and requested that he be made emperor. Liu Yan initially opposed this move and instead suggested that Liu Xuan carry the title \\"Prince of Han\\" first (echoing the founder of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu). The other rebel leaders refused, and in early AD 23, Liu Xuan was proclaimed emperor. Liu Yan became prime minister. Liu Xiu, along with many other rebel leaders, carried the title \\"general\\". =The Battle of Kunyang= Liu Xiu would be instrumental in the key victory that sealed Wang Mang's fate. Wang, aware that Gengshi Emperor was becoming a major threat, sent his cousin Wang Yi (ÁéãÈÇë) and his prime minister Wang Xun (ÁéãÂ∞ã) with what he considered to be overwhelming force, some 430,000 men, intending to crush the newly constituted Han regime. The Han forces were at this point in two groups‚Äîone led by Wang Feng (ÁéãÈ≥≥), Wang Chang (ÁéãÂ∏∏), and Liu Xiu, which, in response to the arrival of the Xin forces, withdrew to the small town of Kunyang (ÊòÜÈôΩ, in modern Ye County, Henan) and one led by Liu Yan, which was still besieging Wancheng. The rebels in Kunyang initially wanted to scatter, but Liu Xiu opposed it; rather, he advocated that they guard Kunyang securely, while he would gather all other available troops in surrounding areas and attack the Xin forces from the outside. After initially rejecting Liu Xiu's idea, the Kunyang rebels eventually agreed. Liu Xiu carried out his action, and when he returned to Kunyang, he began harassing the sieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun, annoyed, led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. Once that happened, the Han forces inside Kunyang burst out of the city and attacked the other Xin units, and the much larger Xin forces suffered a total collapse. The soldiers largely deserted and went home, unable to be gathered again. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to Luoyang. This was a major blow to Xin, psychologically; after this point on, there would be no hope for it. =Liu Yan's death and Liu Xiu's bare survival= The very first major incident of infighting in Gengshi Emperor's regime would happen in this time, though. Gengshi Emperor was fearful of Liu Yan's capabilities and keenly aware that many of Liu Yan's followers were angry that he was not made emperor. One, Liu Ji (ÂäâÁ®∑), was particularly critical of Gengshi Emperor. Gengshi Emperor arrested Liu Ji and wanted to execute him, but Liu Yan tried to intercede. Gengshi Emperor, encouraged by Li Yi (who had by that point turned against Liu Yan) and Zhu Wei (Êú±ÈÆ™), took this opportunity to execute Liu Yan as well. At this time, Liu Xiu was fighting on the frontlines. When he heard about his brother's death, he quickly left his army and went back to the temporary capital Wancheng to beg forgiveness. When Liu Yan's followers greeted him, he only thanked them but did not speak of his feelings, but rather blamed himself and did not mention of his achievements at Kunyang. He did not dare to mourn his brother. Gengshi Emperor, ashamed of what he had done, spared Liu Xiu and created him the Marquess of Wuxin (Ê≠¶‰ø°‰æØ). Around this time, Liu Xiu married his childhood sweetheart, the famed beauty Yin Lihua. (According to Hou Han Shu, while much younger, when Liu Xiu was visiting the capital Chang'an, he became impressed with the mayor of the capital (zhijinyu, Âü∑ÈáëÂêæ) and, already impressed by Yin's beauty, he made the remarks: \\"If I were to be an official, I want to be zhijinyu; if I were to marry, I want to marry Yin Lihua\\". He eventually was able to accomplish both of these things and more.) =Role in reorganization of Gengshi Emperor's regime and dispatch to northern China= First Days under the new Emperor Eastern Han bronze chariot and cavalry figurines excavated from a tomb Soon, Wang Mang's Xin Dynasty and its capital Chang'an fell to the Gengshi Emperor's forces, and Gengshi Emperor was acknowledged by virtually the entire empire as the emperor of the restored Han Dynasty. He initially planned to set his capital at Luoyang, and he made Liu Xiu governor of the capital region. Liu Xiu was commissioned to repair the palaces and governmental offices at Luoyang. Of all of the major Han officials following the restoration, Liu Xiu alone quickly showed his talent for organization, and his agency quickly grew to resemble its pre-Wang Mang counterpart. In any case, Gengshi Emperor's regime was only able to obtain nominal submission from many regions of the empire, and one of the troublesome regions was north of the Yellow River. The Emperor considered dispatching a general to try to pacify the region, and his cousin Liu Ci (ÂäâË≥ú), who had succeeded Liu Yan as prime minister, endorsed Liu Xiu for that task. Liu Yan's political enemies, including Li and Zhu, opposed, but after Liu Ci repeatedly endorsed Liu Xiu, the Gengshi Emperor relented and, in autumn of AD 23, he sent Liu Xiu to the region north of the Yellow River. Liu Xiu was initially met with great gladness by the people north of the Yellow River. It was around this time that Deng Yu joined him (later to be his prime minister); other later important figures who joined him around this time included Feng Yi and Geng Chun (ËÄøÁ¥î). Deng, seeing that Gengshi Emperor lacked the ability to rule, persuaded Liu Xiu to keep his sights broad and consider eventual independence. Northern expedition An Eastern Han (25 AD-220 AD) mural showing a procession of chariots and cavalry, from the Dahuting Tomb of Zhengzhou, Henan province, China Liu Xiu would soon have a major problem on his hand, however, in winter 23, as he faced a pretender for the Han throne. A fortune teller in Handan named Wang Lang claimed to be actually named Liu Ziyu (ÂäâÂ≠êËºø) and a son of Emperor Cheng. He claimed that his mother was a singer in Emperor Cheng's service, and that Empress Zhao Feiyan had tried to kill him after his birth, but that a substitute child was killed indeed. After he spread these rumors among the people, the people of Handan began to believe that he was a genuine son of Emperor Cheng, and the commanderies north of the Yellow River quickly pledged allegiance to him as emperor. In the spring of AD 24, Liu Xiu was forced to withdraw to the northern city of Jicheng (modern Beijing). Not long after, he faced rebellions in his immediate vicinity, and was nearly killed by rebels who pledged allegiance to Wang. He reached two commanderies in modern central Hebei that were still loyal to Gengshi Emperor‚ÄîXindu (‰ø°ÈÉΩ, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei), whose governor was Ren Guang (‰ªªÂÖâ), and Herong, (ÂíåÊàé, roughly part of modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), whose governor was Pi Tong (ÈÇ≥ÂΩ§). Ren's deputy Li Chong (ÊùéÂø†), Wan Xiu (Ëê¨ËÑ©) and Liu Zhi (ÂäâÊ§ç), who was powerful clan in the region, also joined him. Additionally, he began to make Liu Zhi persuade Liu Yang (ÂäâÊ•ä) the Prince of Zhending, who held 100,000 troops, to join him. He entered into a political marriage with Guo Shengtong, the niece of Liu Yang, and combined his forces. He mobilized their forces and won some major battles against Wang's generals. Meanwhile, a follower of Liu Xiu, Geng Yan, the son of the governor of Shanggu Commandery (‰∏äË∞∑, roughly modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), had fled back to his father's commandery, and persuaded both his father Geng Kuang (ËÄøÊ≥Å) and the governor of the neighboring Yuyang Commandery (ÊºÅÈôΩ, roughly modern Beijing), Peng Chong (ÂΩ≠ÂØµ), to support Liu Xiu. Geng Yan, being supported by Gen Kuang's deputy Kou Xun (ÂØáÊÅÇ) and Jing Dan (ÊôØ‰∏π), and Peng's deputy, Wu Han, led the two commanderies' cavalry and infantry forces south to join Liu Xiu. The combined forces gave Liu Xiu enough strength to make a direct assault against Handan, trapping and killing Wang Lang. After Wang's death, Gengshi Emperor created Liu Xiu the Prince of Xiao and summoned him back to the capital (then moved to Chang'an). Liu Xiu, persuaded by Geng Yan that he should be ready to set out his own course because the people were badly shaken by Gengshi Emperor and his officials' misrule, declined and claimed that the region still needed to be pacified. Independence from Gengshi Emperor In the autumn of AD 24, Liu Xiu, still ostensibly an official under Gengshi Emperor, successfully pacified some of the larger agrarian rebel groups and merged them into his own forces. He also started replacing officials loyal to Gengshi Emperor with those loyal to himself. He consolidated his power north of the Yellow River and, as he predicted that the powerful Chimei would destroy Gengshi Emperor's government for him, he waited by for that to happen, not intervening on either side as that conflict was developing. He put Kou Xun in charge of the Henei (modern northern Henan, north of the Yellow River) region and made it the base for food and manpower supplies, while commissioning Deng with an expedition force to the modern Shaanxi region, waiting for the confrontation between Gengshi Emperor and Chimei. In early AD 25, Deng, on his way west, seized the modern Shanxi region and put it under Liu Xiu's control, before crossing the Yellow River into modern Shaanxi. At this point, territories that Liu Xiu controlled were already impressive, compared to any other regional power in the empire broken apart by civil war‚Äîbut he still carried just the title Prince of Xiao (which Gengshi Emperor had created him) and still ostensibly was controlling those territories as Gengshi Emperor's deputy, even as he was already engaging militarily against some generals (e.g. Xie Gong ‚Äì Ë¨ùË∫¨) loyal to Gengshi Emperor (During this incident, Liu Xiu succeeded to persuade Ma Wu (È¶¨Ê≠¶), who was the deputy of Xie Gong, to join him.). In the summer of AD 25, after repeated urging by his followers, he finally claimed the title of emperor and the right to succeed to the Han throne‚Äîas Emperor Guangwu. Campaign to unify the empire =Victory over the Chimei= Situation of warlords and peasant forces at the beginning of Eastern Han dynasty An Eastern Han (25 AD-220 AD) Chinese ceramic figurine of a soldier with a missing spear Soon after Emperor Guangwu's ascension, his former liege Gengshi Emperor's regime was destroyed by the Chimei, who supported their own pretender to the Han throne, Emperor Liu Penzi. The Chimei leaders, despite being militarily powerful, were however even less capable at ruling than Gengshi Emperor, and they soon alienated the people of the Guanzhong (Èóú‰∏≠, modern central Shaanxi) region, which they had taken over when they overthrew Gengshi Emperor. They pillaged the Guanzhong region for supplies, but as eventually the supplies ran out, they were forced to withdraw east in an attempt to return home (modern Shandong and northern Jiangsu). Emperor Guangwu, anticipating this, set up his forces to harass and tire the Chimei out, and then block them off at Yiyang (ÂÆúÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang, Henan). With their path blocked and their troops exhausted, the Chimei leaders surrendered. Emperor Guangwu spared them, including their puppet pretender Emperor Penzi. =Gradual victories over other regional powers= Chimei was the largest of the enemy force that Emperor Guangwu had to deal with in his campaign to reunify the empire under the rule of his Eastern Han Dynasty, but there were a number of regional powers that he had to deal with. These included: * Liu Yong (ÂäâÊ∞∏), also claiming to be the proper emperor of Han, based on his lineage‚Äîas the son of Liu Li (ÂäâÁ´ã), the Prince of Liang under the reigns of Emperor Cheng, Emperor Ai, and Emperor Ping who had been forced by Wang Mang to commit suicide; he controlled the modern eastern Henan and northern Jiangsu region. * Peng Chong, who had been by this point aggravated by Emperor Guangwu's official Zhu Fu (Êú±ÊµÆ) into rebellion (in a rare case of a succession of wrong decisions by Emperor Guangwu‚Äîmistakes that he learned from and would not repeat); he claimed the title of the Prince of Yan and controlled the modern Beijing region. * Zhang Bu (ÂºµÊ≠•), nominally the Prince of Qi under Liu Yong, but who independently controlled the modern Shandong region. * Wei Xiao (ÈöóÂõÇ), nominally the commander of the Xizhou (Ë•øÂ∑û) region paying allegiance to Emperor Guangwu, but who independently controlled the modern eastern Gansu region, east of the Yellow River. * Dou Rong (Á´áËûç), nominally the governor of Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û) paying allegiance to Emperor Guangwu, but who independently controlled the modern western Gansu and northern Qinghai region, west of the Yellow River. * Lu Fang (ÁõßËä≥), who also claimed the name Liu Wenbo (ÂäâÊñá‰ºØ) and claimed to be a descendant of Emperor Wu and the proper Han emperor. He, supported by Xiongnu's Chanyu Yu (Ëºø), controlled the modern central and western Inner Mongolia region. Some Russian archaeologists have identified a Han-era Chinese-style palace unearthed near Abakan (in Southern Siberia) in 1941‚Äì45 as Lu Fang's residence after he had left China for the lands of the Xiongnu.A.A.

Irkutsk, 2007, pp. 145‚Äì148. * Gongsun Shu, who proclaimed himself emperor of Chengjia, who controlled the Yi Province, modern Sichuan, Chongqing and parts of Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Of these powers, Gongsun Shu's Chengjia was wealthy and powerful, but Gongsun was content to maintain his regional empire and not carry out any military expeditions outside his empire. Instead, he sat by as Emperor Guangwu carried out his unification campaign. Emperor Guangwu, hesitant to carry out annihilation campaigns, largely preferred first trying to persuade the regional warlords to submit to him. Wei and Dou did in AD 29, and as they were assisting Eastern Han forces to the north of Chengjia, Gongsun was further discouraged from trying to expand his empire. Also in AD 29, Liu Yong's son and heir Liu Yu (ÂäâÁ¥Ü) was defeated by Eastern Han forces and killed. Also in AD 29, Peng's slaves assassinated him, leading to a collapse of his regime. Zhang, seeing the futility of resistance, surrendered and was created a marquess. By AD 30, all of eastern China was under Emperor Guangwu's rule. Wei, seeing that Eastern Han was gradually unifying the empire, inexplicably began considering independence. He tried to persuade Dou to enter into an alliance with him to resist Eastern Han; Dou refused. When Eastern Han started considering conquering Chengjia, Wei, apprehensive of the implications of Chengjia's fall, tried to persuade Emperor Guangwu not to carry out a campaign against Chengjia, and later refused to lead his forces south against Chengjia. Emperor Guangwu, who in any case preferred peaceful resolution, repeatedly wrote both Wei and Gongsun with humble terms, trying to get them to submit to him, promising them titles and honors. Wei continued to nominally submit but act as an independent power, while Gongsun refused outright‚Äîbut continued to be indecisive and took no actions while Eastern Han's rule was being confirmed throughout the land. Realizing that neither Wei nor Gongsun would voluntarily submit, Emperor Guangwu started a campaign against Wei in the summer of AD 30‚Äîassisted by Wei's friend Ma Yuan, who had served as Wei's liaison officer to Emperor Guangwu and had tried in vain to persuade him not to take the course of independence. In response, Wei formally submitted to Gongsun and accepted a princely title‚ÄîPrince of Shuoning‚Äîfrom him, and also tried to persuade Dou to join him. Dou refused, and attacked Wei in coordination with Emperor Guangwu's forces. After some initial successes, Wei's small independent regime eventually collapsed under overwhelming force and was reduced severely. In AD 33, Wei died and was succeeded by his son Wei Chun (ÈöóÁ¥î). In the winter of AD 34, Shuoning's capital Luomen (ËêΩÈñÄ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu) fell, and Wei Chun surrendered. Emperor Guangwu then turned his attention to Chengjia. He commissioned his generals Wu Han, Cen Peng (Â≤ëÂΩ≠), Lai She (‰æÜÊ≠ô), and Gai Yan (ËìãÂª∂) to go on a two-pronged attack on Chengjia‚ÄîWu and Cen leading an army and a navy up the Yangtze river from modern Hubei, while Lai and Gai led an army south from modern Shaanxi. Instead of fighting the Eastern Han expedition on the battlefield, Gongsun tried to repel them by assassinating their generals‚Äîand he was initially successful, assassinating Cen and Lai and temporarily causing the Eastern Han forces to halt. However, Eastern Han forces regrouped, and in 36 they had Gongsun surrounded in his capital Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩ, modern Chengdu, Sichuan). However, initial attempts to siege the city was unsuccessful, and Wu, then in command of the expeditory force, considered withdrawing. Persuaded by his lieutenant Zhang Kan (ÂºµÂ†™) that Gongsun was in desperate straits, however, Wu tricked Gongsun into believing that the Eastern Han forces were collapsing from fatigue, drawing him out of the city and engaging in battle. Gongsun was mortally wounded in battle, and Chengdu surrendered in the winter of AD 36. Liu's general Wu Han then killed more than 10,000 people.Houhanshu, vol. 13 After Chengjia's fall, Dou turned over the lands under his control to Emperor Guangwu in AD 36, and was made prime controller. Lu, after initially submitting to Emperor Guangwu and made the Prince of Dai (as Emperor Guangwu maintained the fiction that Lu was actually from imperial lineage), eventually rebelled again, but, unable to succeed, eventually fled to Xiongnu in AD 42. The empire was entirely under Emperor Guangwu's rule. During the wartime, Liu's general Geng Yan massacred 300 cities.Houhanshu, vol.19Ëµ´ÈÅúÊ≤≥ÁïîË´á‰∏≠ÂúãÊ≠∑Âè≤ by Ray Huang, 10.ÂÖâÊ≠¶‰∏≠Ëàà Reign over unified empire Tang artist Yan Liben (600 AD‚Äì673 AD) Although Emperor Guangwu had already created many of his generals and officials marquesses, in AD 37, after the conquest of the empire was largely complete, he readjusted their marches in accordance with their accomplishments. He also considered what would be the best way to preserve the relationships between him and his generals and to protect their title and position so he therefore resolved to give the generals large marches but not give them official positions in his government. He rewarded them with great wealth and often listened to their advice, but rarely put them in positions of authority. He thereby reduced friction between him and his generals, thus allowing for their relationships to be preserved. In this, he was matched perhaps only by Emperor Taizu of Song (Zhao Kuangyin). As the emperor of the unified empire, Emperor Guangwu's reign was marked by thriftiness, efficiency, and laxity of laws. For example, in AD 38, his official Liang Tong (Ê¢ÅÁµ±) submitted a petition to restore the criminal laws of late Western Han Dynasty‚Äîwhich were far more severe. After discussion with other officials, Emperor Guangwu tabled Liang's suggestion. But he originated the order that servants in the inner palace must be eunuchs.Â§™ÁõëÂéü‰∏∫ÁöáÂ∏ùÁöÑÈó®ÂÆ¢‰∏çÂøÖÈòâÂâ≤ ÂÖâÊ≠¶Â∏ù‰πãÂêéÊÇâÁî®Èòâ‰∫∫ Emperor Guangwu, however, had to deal with two campaigns against non-Chinese peoples. In AD 40, a Vietnamese woman named Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc (Chinese: Zheng Ce (ÂæµÂÅ¥)) and her sister Tr∆∞ng Nh·ªã (Chinese: Zheng Er (ÂæµË≤≥)) rebelled. Tr∆∞ng Tr·∫Øc claimed the title of queen, and she ruled over an independent kingdom for several years. In AD 41, Emperor Guangwu sent Ma Yuan against the Tr∆∞ng sisters. In AD 43, he defeated the Tr∆∞ng sisters and killed them. (According to Vietnamese historians, they committed suicide by drowning.) Emperor Guangwu also had to deal with periodic minor battles against the Xiongnu to the north. However, throughout his reign, there were no major wars with Xiongnu. Nevertheless, because of raids by Xiongnu, Wuhuan, and Xianbei, the northern commanderies became largely unpopulated, as the people suffered great casualties and also fled to more southerly lands. With these engagements, Emperor Guangwu declined yet another foreign engagement. In AD 46, many Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) kingdoms were suffering under the hegemony of one of the kingdoms, Shache (Yarkand). They petitioned Emperor Guangwu to again reestablish the Western Han post of the governor of Xiyu. Emperor Guangwu declined, stating that his empire was so lacking in strength at the time that he could not expend efforts to protect Xiyu kingdoms. In response, the Xiyu kingdoms submitted to Xiongnu. Marital and succession issues As alluded to above, while still under Gengshi Emperor, Emperor Guangwu married his childhood sweetheart Yin Lihua. Later, in AD 24, while he was on his expedition north of the Yellow River, he entered a political marriage with Guo Shengtong (ÈÉ≠ËÅñÈÄö), the niece of a regional warlord, Liu Yang (ÂäâÊ•ä) the Prince of Zhending. In AD 25, Guo bore him a son, Liu Jiang (ÂäâÁñÜ). In AD 26, Emperor Guangwu was prepared to create an empress, and he favored his first love, Yin. However, Yin had not yet had a son by that point, and she declined the empress position and endorsed Guo. Emperor Guangwu therefore made Guo empress and her son Prince Jiang crown prince. By AD 41, however, Empress Guo had long lost the emperor's favor. She continuously complained about that fact, and this angered Emperor Guangwu. In AD 41, he deposed her and made Yin empress instead. Rather than imprisoning Guo (as is often the fate of deposed empresses), however, he created her son Liu Fu (ÂäâËºî) the Prince of Zhongshan and made her the Princess Dowager of Zhongshan. He made her brother Guo Kuang (ÈÉ≠Ê≥Å) an important official and, perhaps as a form of alimony, rewarded him with great wealth. Not having the heart to depose mother and son, Emperor Guangwu initially left Guo's son, Jiang, as crown prince. However, Crown Prince Jiang, realizing that his position was precarious, repeatedly offered to step down. In AD 43, Emperor Guangwu agreed and made Liu Yang (ÂäâÈôΩ), the oldest son of Empress Yin, crown prince instead. Former Crown Prince Jiang was made the Prince of Donghai. He also changed Prince Yang's name to Zhuang (Ëéä). Late reign In AD 47, an opportunity arose with regard to Xiongnu. Xiongnu had a succession dispute, pitting the current chanyu, Punu (Ëí≤Â•¥) against his cousin Bi (ÊØî), the son of a former chanyu. In AD 48, Bi also claimed the title of chanyu, and submitted to Emperor Guangwu's authority. Punu also submitted, in response, and the divided Xiongnu stopped waging war against Han. In AD 49, a rare blot on Emperor Guangwu's rule occurred. He had once again commissioned Ma Yuan to go on an expedition‚Äîagainst the indigenous people of the Wulin Commandery (modern northwestern Hunan and eastern Guizhou), who had rebelled. While Ma was on the expedition, however, a number of Ma's political enemies made false accusations against Ma. Emperor Guangwu, believing these accusations, began investigating Ma, who happened to die of illness while on the campaign. With Ma dead and unable to defend himself, Emperor Guangwu stripped Ma of his marquess title and denounced him posthumously. (Ma's reputation was not restored until his daughter later became empress to Emperor Guangwu's son Emperor Ming.) In AD 57, Emperor Guangwu died. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Zhuang, who ascended the throne as Emperor Ming.

Life and work Keir was born in Stirlingshire, Scotland, in 1735 as the eighteenth child of John and Magdaline Keir. James attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he met and formed a lasting friendship with Erasmus Darwin. Much of this article is taken from there. At the age of 22, Keir joined the army and was commissioned into the 61st Regiment (now the Gloucestershire Regiment). During the seven years' war he was stationed with his regiment in the West Indies. He became lieutenant on, 31 March 1759, captain-lieutenant on 16 May 1766, and captain on 23 June of the same year. In the spring of 1768 he resigned his commission, being disappointed at not meeting with more sympathy in his studies from his brother-officers. He found, however, one congenial friend in Alexander Blair, afterwards a captain in the 69th regiment of foot. While in the army Keir wrote a treatise on the art of war, which was accidentally burnt at his publishers, and a pamphlet addressed to the Marquis of Granby in favour of the sale of commissions. At this same period he used to rise at four o'clock in the morning to read the classics and military writers, and he translated many chapters of Polybius. Keir ultimately settled at Hill Top, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, and devoted himself to chemistry and geology. In 1772, with others, Keir leased a long-established glassworks at Amblecote near Stourbridge, which he managed. Partners included Samuel Skey (who manufactured vitriol near Bewdley) and John Taylor (a leading Birmingham manufacturer). While there, Keir continued his chemical experiments, particularly into the properties of alkalis. A paper by him \\"On the Crystallisations observed on Glass\\" was communicated to the Royal Society by his friend George Fordyce and printed in the Society's Philosophical Transactions in 1776. Early in the same year Keir completed his translation of Macquer's Dictionnaire de Chymie, with additions and notes, published at London in two quarto volumes. In 1777 he issued a Treatise on the Different kinds of Elastic Fluids or Gases (new edition, 1779). Keir had become friends with Matthew Boulton, and in the autumn of 1768 he first met James Watt at Boulton's house. In 1778 Keir gave up his glass business to undertake, in the absence of Boulton and Watt, the sole charge of their engineering works at Soho, Birmingham near Handsworth.J. Ellis, Glassmakers of Stourbridge and Dudley 1612‚Äì2002 (2002), 78‚Äì82 90‚Äì1 94. He declined, however, the offer of a partnership on account of the financial risk, and limited his connection with the firm to the letter-copying machine department. In 1779 he invented and took out a patent for an alloy of copper, zinc, and iron, which could be forged hot or cold. It has been said to be almost identical with what later became known as Muntz metal.Window frames made from Keir's metal may still be found at Boulton's home, Soho House (now a museum). In 1780 Keir, in conjunction with Alexander Blair (then retired from the army), established a chemical works at Tipton, near Dudley, for the manufacture of alkali from the sulfates of potash and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. A nearby road was called Soap Factory Road, though it is now called Factory Road. Joseph Priestley When Joseph Priestley came to Birmingham in 1780, he found an able assistant in Keir, who had discovered the distinction between carbon dioxide gas and atmospheric air. Keir worked closely with Priestley to investigate the properties of gases. On 3 May 1787 Keir communicated to the Royal Society some \\"Experiments on the Congelation of the Vitriolic Acid\\", and on 1 May 1788 \\"Remarks on the Principle of Acidity, Decomposition of Water, and Phlogiston\\". Another paper, on \\"Fossil Alkali\\", appeared in 1788 in the \\"Transactions of the Society of Arts\\". Keir published the first part of his \\"Dictionary of Chemistry\\" in 1789.For an electronic copy of volume 3, see He discontinued it upon becoming convinced of the weakness of his theory of phlogiston. On 20 May 1790, Keir communicated to the Royal Society \\"Experiments and Observations on the Dissolution of Metals in Acids, and their Precipitations, with an Account of a new compound Acid Menstruum, useful in some technical operations of parting metals\\". This paper contains suggestions which may have contributed to the discovery of the electro-plate process. It was translated into German later the same year by Augustin Gottfried Ludwig Lentin as Versuche und Beobachtungen √ºber die Aufl√∂sung der Metalle in S√§uren ... About 1794, Keir and Blair purchased land in the Tividale area, on the borders of Dudley and Tipton, on which they established the Tividale colliery. Keir studied the mineralogy of Staffordshire, and in 1798 wrote an article on it for Stebbing Shaw's History of Staffordshire. He also gave Shaw information on Staffordshire manufacturing. Sir Humphry Davy, while visiting Gregory Watt at Birmingham in 1800, was introduced to Keir. In February 1811 Keir forwarded to the Geological Society \\"An Account of the Strata in sinking a Pit in Tividale Colliery\\", accompanied by a number of specimens. On 19 December 1807, while Keir was staying with Blair at Hilton Park, his house at West Bromwich was burnt, though most of his books and papers were saved. For a time he lived at a small farmhouse in the neighbourhood. Keir died at West Bromwich on 11 October 1820, and was buried there at All Saints Church, Charlemont. By his marriage in 1770 to Susanna Harvey (1747‚Äì1802) he had an only child, Amelia (1780‚Äì1857), who in 1801 married John Lewis Moilliet of Geneva and later Abberley, afterwards merchant and banker of Birmingham. Selected non- scientific writings In 1791 Keir wrote, at the special desire of the widow, a memoir of his friend Thomas Day,See author of \\"Sandford and Merton\\". During the same year Keir's avowal of sympathy with the French revolution at a public dinner on 14 July exposed him to much virulent abuse. He defended himself and Priestley in various pamphlets, such as the \\"Extinguisher Maker\\", \\"T. Sobersides\\", and \\"High Church Politics\\". In 1793 Keir published a pamphlet entitled 'The Martial Character of Nations,' arguing that the French were not likely to become so pacific as to make national defence less necessary. Ten years later he wrote Reflections on the Invasion of Great Britain by the French Armies; on the Mode of Defence; and on the useful application of the National Levies (1803). Keir, who frequently amused himself by writing poetry, suggested to Darwin many improvements (afterwards adopted) for the second part of the Botanic Garden. The most valuable portion of his correspondence was destroyed by the fire at his daughter's residence, Abberley Hall, Worcestershire, on 25 December 1845. A selection from what was saved, with a sketch of his life, was printed for private circulation in 1859.See Honours and memorials * Keir was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 8 December 1785. * Keir is remembered by the Lunar Society Moonstones in Birmingham.

He was born as Ignacij Gruden in the small fishing village of Aurisina near Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian County of Gorizia and Gradisca (now in Italy) as first of ten children of Franc Gruden and Justina Ko≈°uta. He attended high schools in Trieste and Gorizia, and then studied law in Vienna and Graz. During World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and fought in the Battles of the Isonzo, where he was seriously injured. After the war, he continued his studies in Prague, graduating in 1921. The same year, he moved to Ljubljana, then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where he practiced law. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was active in spreading the anti-Fascist sentiment among Slovene intellectuals. In 1922, he was arrested by the Italian authorities while visiting his native village, which was then under Italian jurisdiction. He was released after the intervention of the Yugoslav authorities. In Ljubljana, Gruden soon became part of the local left liberal intellectual circles. He collaborated with renowned journals such as Ljubljanski zvon and Sodobnost, and frequented authors such as Josip Vidmar, Ju≈° Kozak, Ferdo Kozak, Fran Albreht, Stanko Leben, Lojze Ude and Anton Vodnik. During World War II, he collaborated with the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, and was interned by the Italian occupation forces to the Rab concentration camp. After the Italian armistice, he joined the Partisan resistance. After the war, he worked at the Slovenian section of the Yugoslav Radio in Belgrade, together with Matej Bor and Anton Ingoliƒç. He died in Ljubljana and was buried in the ≈Ωale cemetery. Gruden's poetry was influenced mostly by the Slovene Modern (), particularly Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç and Dragotin Kette. He was also heavily influenced by Gabriele D'Annunzio and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. Initially, he followed the vitalist trend, but later moved to more reflexive poetry. During World War II, he published many poems describing the daily life in concentration camps.

His most famous work is a pastoral prose romance, the Diana (1559). Biography He was born at Montemor-o-Velho (near Coimbra), whence he derived his name, the Spanish form of which is Montemayor. He seems to have studied music in his youth, and to have gone to Spain in 1543 as chorister in the suite of the Portuguese Infanta Maria, first wife of Philip II. In 1552 he went back to Portugal in the suite of the Infanta Juana, wife of Jo√£o Manuel, Prince of Portugal, and on the death of this prince in 1554 returned to Spain. He is said to have served in the army, to have accompanied Philip II to England in 1555, and to have travelled in Italy and the Low Countries; but it is certain that his poetical works were published at Antwerp in 1554, and again in 1558. His reputation is based on a prose work, the Diana, a pastoral romance published about 1559. Shortly afterwards Montemor was killed in Piedmont, apparently in a love affair; a late edition of the Diana gives the exact date of his death. The Diana is generally stated to have been printed at Valencia in 1542; but, as the Canto de Orfeo refers to the widowhood of the Infanta Juana in 1554, the book must be of later date. It is important as the first pastoral novel published in Spain; as the starting-point of a widespread literary fashion; and as the indirect source, through the translation included in Googe's Eglogs, epytaphes and sonnets (1563), of an episode in The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Though Portuguese was Montemor's native language, he only used it for two songs and a short prose passage in the sixth book of the Diana. His mastery of Spanish is amazing, and even Miguel de Cervantes, who judges the verses in the Diana with unaccustomed severity, recognizes the remarkable merit of Montemor's prose style. That he pleased his own generation is proved by the seventeen editions and two continuations of the Diana published in the 16th century, by parodies, imitations and renderings in French and English.

In 1903, it became part of the city of Bellingham. Description The Fairhaven area is situated on the south side of Bellingham, and borders Bellingham Bay on the west and Western Washington University on the northeast. Since 1989 Fairhaven has been the southernmost terminus of the Alaska Marine Highway System, Alaska's state run ferry system. The Bellingham Cruise Terminal is also the departure point for summer passenger ferry service to the San Juan Islands and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada operated by Victoria/San Juan Cruises. Nearby is Fairhaven Station, a small transportation hub which serves as Bellingham's Amtrak Cascades station stop as well as the Greyhound bus depot. Connections can be made to local taxis or local transit. Whatcom Transportation Authority recently upgraded Fairhaven's bus service to every 15 minutes as part of its Red Line. Fairhaven also plays outdoor movies every weekend during the summer at the Pickford Outdoor Cinema in Fairhaven's historical district. =Historical district= In the center of the Fairhaven area is the Fairhaven Historical District, which features a seasonal farmer's market as well as numerous restaurants and shops. The district is a popular tourist destination. All newly constructed buildings are required to conform in outward appearance to the community's traditional 19th-century style as defined by Bellingham Municipal Code, Design Review District, section 20.26. History Fairhaven in 1890 Daniel Jefferson Harris (aka Dirty Dan) arrived in the Bellingham Bay area in 1853 or 1854, and befriended John Thomas, who had filed a land claim along Padden Creek. He helped Thomas start a cabin there, but Thomas died before the cabin was finished. Dan finished the claim on the land and the patented was issued in 1871. He also acquired several surrounding properties and named this area Fairhaven, from the native name see-see-lich-em, meaning safe port or fair haven (possibly also from a town in Maine that may or may not have been his birthplace). He platted the town in 1883, and started selling lots. As his fortune improved so did his appears and reputation, allowing him to marry in 1885. In 1888, he sold most of his property in Fairhaven to Nelson Bennett and left for California. Nelson Bennett, along with Charles Larrabee, who arrived in 1890, formed the Fairhaven Land Company, mostly financed by Larrabee, determined to grow Fairhaven into a major city. They promoted the land rich in natural resources, good weather, and endless possibilities, causing the population to grow from around 150 in 1889 to 8000 at the end of 1890. Part of that increase was due to the purchase by the Fairhaven Land Company of a tiny settlement called Bellingham, tucked between Sehome and Fairhaven, which had a post office starting in 1883.\\"Whatcom County, Volume 58, ca. 1885-91\\", Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832-1971. NARA Microfilm Publication, M841, 145 rolls. Records of the Post Office Department, Record Group Number 28. Washington, D.C.: National Archives. Fairhaven, like many other coastal Washington cities, competed with other Washington cities for the position of terminal city of the Great Northern Railroad, but that title ultimately fell on Seattle. During this period of competitiveness, which lasted from the late 1870s through mid-1880s, Fairhaven adopted its iconic 19th century style and took on an aesthetic appeal to architecture and design. Even after it was decided that Seattle would house the Great Northern Railroad terminal, population and aesthetically-minded construction continued to boom until the late 1890s. Fairhaven was officially incorporated on May 13, 1890. During the speculative frenzy of the 1890s, the grand Fairhaven Hotel was built to attract railroad tycoons to choose Fairhaven as the west coast terminus of transcontinental railways. The railways never came, but the imposing remnant of the old hotel stood until a fire and demolition in 1953. On October 27, 1903, citizens of Fairhaven and citizens of a neighboring city on Bellingham Bay, Whatcom City, voted to consolidate into one city named Bellingham. On December 28, 1903 the new city of Bellingham was officially established. In 1903, Fairhaven received a grant to build the area's first Carnegie-funded library on 12th Street. The library continues to operate as a branch of the Bellingham Public Library system. Fairhaven is also known for its historical ties to salmon canning, and from the late 1800s through to the 1940s was the home of numerous salmon canning operations, employing as many as 4,500 workers in the area. In the 1940s the Pacific American Fisheries was headquartered in Fairhaven, and was known as the largest salmon canning operation in the world.

William Small was born in Carmyllie, Angus, Scotland, the son of a Presbyterian minister, James Small and his wife Lillias Scott, and younger brother to Dr Robert Small. He attended Dundee Grammar School, and Marischal College, University of Aberdeen where he received an MA in 1755. In 1758, he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, then one of Britain‚Äôs American colonies. Small is known for being Thomas Jefferson's professor at William and Mary, and for having an influence on the young Jefferson. Small introduced him to members of Virginia society who were to have an important role in Jefferson's life, including George Wythe a leading jurist in the colonies and Francis Fauquier, the Governor of Virginia. Recalling his years as a student, Thomas Jefferson described Small as: > a man profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy > talent of communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, and a large and > liberal mind... from his conversation I got my first views of the expansion > of science and of the system of things in which we are placed. In 1764 Small returned to Britain, with a letter of introduction to Matthew Boulton from Benjamin Franklin. Through this connection Small was elected to the Lunar Society, a prestigious club of scientists and industrialists. In 1765 he received his MD and established a medical practice in Birmingham, and shared a house with the physician John Ash who was the chief campaigner for the Birmingham infirmary. Small was Boulton's physician and became a close friend of Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, James Keir, James Watt, Anna Seward and others connected with the Lunar Society. He was one of the best-liked members of the society and an active contributor to their debates. He helped to bring the Theatre Royal to Birmingham in 1774 and together with Ash was involved in planning and building a hospital that was not completed until 1779, as Birmingham General Hospital. Small died in Birmingham on 25 February 1775 from malaria contracted during his stay in Virginia. He is buried in St. Philip's church yard, Birmingham.

Nemerov was brother to photographer Diane Nemerov Arbus and father to art historian Alexander Nemerov, Professor of the History of Art and American Studies at Stanford University. Biography Nemerov was born on Leap Day in New York City; his parents were David Nemerov and Gertrude. The Nemerovs were a Russian Jewish couple who lived in New York City and owned Russeks, a Fifth Avenue department store. His younger sisters were the photographer Diane Arbus and sculptor/painter Renee Nemerov Sparkia Brown. The elder Nemerov's talents and interests extended to art connoisseurship, painting, philanthropy, and photography -- talents and interests undoubtedly influential upon his son. Young Howard was raised in a sophisticated New York City environment where he attended the Society for Ethical Culture's Fieldston School. Graduated in 1937 as an outstanding student and second string team football fullback, he commenced studies at Harvard University where, in 1940, he was Bowdoin Essayist and he received bachelor's degree at this university. Throughout World War II, he served as a pilot, first in the Royal Canadian Air Force and later the U.S. Army Air Forces. He married in 1944, and after the war, having earned the rank of first lieutenant, returned to New York with his wife to complete his first book. Nemerov then began teaching, first at Hamilton College and later at Bennington College, Brandeis University, and finally Washington University in St. Louis, where he was Edward Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor of English and Distinguished Poet in Residence from 1969 until his death in 1991. In 1999, Washington University dedicated a dormitory, The Howard Nemerov House, to him. Nemerov's numerous collections of poetry include Trying Conclusions: New and Selected Poems, 1961-1991 (University of Chicago Press, 1991); The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov (1977), which won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Prize; The Winter Lightning: Selected Poems (1968); Mirrors and Windows (1958); The Salt Garden (1955); and The Image and the Law (1947). His novels have also been commended; they include The Homecoming Game (1957), Federigo: Or the Power of Love (1954), and The Melodramatists (1949). Nemerov received many awards and honors, among them fellowships from The Academy of American Poets and The Guggenheim Foundation, a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the National Medal of Arts, the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates,Website of St. Louis Literary Award and the first Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry. Nemerov served as poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1963 and 1964, as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets beginning in 1976, and two terms as poet laureate of the United States from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Nemerov died of cancer in 1991 in University City, Missouri. The Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award was instituted in 1994 to honor him, and by 2008 about 3000 sonnets were entered annually in the associated competition.  Poetry  Nemerov's work is formalist. He wrote almost exclusively in fixed forms and meter. While he is known for his meticulousness and refined technique, his work also has a reputation for being witty and playful. He is compared to John Hollander and Philip Larkin. \\"A Primer of the Daily Round\\" is his most frequently anthologized poem, and highly representative of Nemerov's poetic style. It is an archetypal Elizabethan sonnet, demonstrative of the prosodic creativity for which Nemerov is famous. Another widely appreciated poem is \\"The War in the Air,\\" which draws on his wartime experience as a pilot.\\"'The War in the Air' By Howard Nemerov\\". Poetry Foundation. Nemerov's \\"Because You Asked about the Line between Prose and Poetry\\" is frequently taught as an example of an Ars Poetica as it describes the nearly imperceptible change between rain and snow while still maintaining the formal poetic elements of rhyme and meter. A critical review by Mary Kinzie said of it: \\"the poem imperceptibly thickens itself out of the stream of prose.\\" Nemerov also published a short story in the book Stories Selected from the Unexpected by Bennett Cerf under the pseudonym Joseph Cross called \\"Exchange of Men\\". http://www.philsp.com/homeville/anth/s194.htm Bibliography =Poetry collections= *The Image and the Law (1947) *Guide to the Ruins (1950) *The Vacuum (1955) *The Salt Garden (1955) *Mirrors and Windows (1958) *The Next Room of The Dream: Poems and Two Plays (1962) *The Blue Swallows (1967) *The Winter Lightning: Selected Poems (1968) *Gnomes & Occasions: Poems (1973) University of Chicago Press *The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov (1977) ‚Äîwinner of the National Book Award, Pulitzer Prize, and Bollingen Prize *Sentences (1980) *Inside the Onion (1984) *War Stories: Poems about Long Ago and Now (1987) *Trying Conclusions: New and Selected Poems, 1961-1991 (1992) *Grace to be Said at the Supermarket *The War in the Air =Prose= *The Melodramatists (1949) *Federigo: Or the Power of Love (1954) *The Homecoming Game (1957) *The Commodity of Dreams and Other Stories (1959) *Journal of the Fictive Life (1965) *Stories, Fables and Other Diversions (1971) =Literary scholarship= *The Oak in the Acorn: On Remembrance of Things Past and on Teaching Proust, Who Will Never Learn (1987) References External links Academy of American Poets - Biographical Sketch and Links to Poetry * Poet Laureate Timeline: 1961-1970 * Poetry Foundation - Biography and Links to Poetry *The Howard Nemerov Papers at Washington University in St. Louis * St. Louis Walk of Fame * Howard Nemerov \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Skylark\\" The Baltimore Museum of Art: Baltimore, Maryland, 1964 Accessed June 26, 2012 Category:American Poets Laureate Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Jewish American poets Category:Formalist poets Category:Pulitzer Prize for Poetry winners Category:Bollingen Prize recipients Category:National Book Award winners Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients Category:Washington University in St. Louis faculty Category:Ethical Culture Fieldston School alumni Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Poets from Missouri Category:Writers from New York City Category:People from St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Deaths from cancer in Missouri Category:1920 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century American poets Category:Russek family ","title":"Howard Nemerov"},{"id":"343294","title":"Bridget Fonda"},{"id":"343299","text":"Barnabe Googe or Goche (11 June 15407 February 1594) (also spelled Barnaby Goodge) was a poet and translator, one of the earliest English pastoral poets.

He became a ward of the Queen, and it appears his wardship remained unsold until January 1561, when his kinsman, William Cecil, became Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Googe was allowed to purchase his own wardship for ¬£80, payable over an eight-year term. On 26 June 1563 he was granted licence to enter on his lands. In his will Googe's father had requested his executors to have Googe educated at the Inns of Court, and by 29 March 1560 he was a member of Staple Inn, at the time associated with Gray's Inn,History of Staple Inn Retrieved 3 September 2013. where his cousin, William Lovelace, held the position of Reader in 1562 and 1567. Another of Googe's associates at the Inns of Court was his cousin, Alexander Neville, of Gray's Inn.Neville, Alexander (1544‚Äì1614), of Canterbury and St. Mary-without- Bishopsgate, Middlesex, History of Parliament Retrieved 3 September 2013. In a letter dated 1 October 1563, Cecil referred to Googe as his 'servant' and 'near kinsman'. According to Barrett, there is no record of the position he occupied in Cecil's household apart from reference to him as a retainer and the fact that he was present on special occasions such as the Queen's visit to Theobalds in 1572, when he was 'placed high on the list of servants' and referred to as the first server for the first meal'. Previous authorities claimed that he became a gentleman pensioner to Queen Elizabeth, but this has been disproved. Nonetheless Googe did have close associations with the court through his relationship to Cecil. He exploited this important connection in the years that followed, and Cecil extended patronage towards his young prot√©g√©. It may have been due to Cecil's encouragement that Googe accompanied the Elizabethan humanist scholar Sir Thomas Challoner on a diplomatic embassy to Spain in 1562. Googe had begun writing poetry, and found himself in an exciting creative coterie with other young writers, such as Jasper Heywood and George Turberville. During his absence in Spain, Googe's juvenile poems were sent to the printer by a friend, Laurence Blundeston. On his return, Googe learned of Blundeston's actions and reluctantly gave his consent to their publication when he discovered that the printer had already paid for the paper for the print run and the composition was underway. The book appeared in 1563 as Eglogs, Epytaphes, and Sonettes, with a dedication to William Lovelace. Before the appearance of his book, no writer in England had ever published his own poetry under his own name; in this, Googe was an accidental pioneer. Tudor revival house at Scotney Castle which replaced the home of Googe's wife, Mary Darrell Burial place of Barnabe Googe, St Adelwold church and St Mary's Church, North Cockerington, with their shared churchyard Marriage and later life Googe married Mary Darrell, one of the nine children of Thomas Darrell, esquire, of Scotney Castle, Kent, by his second wife, Mary Roydon, daughter of Thomas Roydon, esquire, of Roydon Hall (or Fortune) in East Peckham, Kent. Correspondence survives on the subject of Googe's marriage with Mary Darrell, whose father, Thomas Darrell, refused Googe's suit on the ground that she was bound by a previous contract to Sampson Lennard (154520 September 1615), son of John Lennard of Chevening, Kent. More to the point, recent research has shown that Thomas Darrell was a recusant who harboured Jesuit priests in his manor house of Scotney, near Lamberhurst in Kent. When Googe found his suit discouraged by Thomas Darrell, he appealed to his powerful contacts, and after intervention by his 'near kinsman', Sir William Cecil, the marriage duly took place in 1564 or 1565; Googe took his wife to live in Lamberhurst at the manor house of Chingley. They had seven sons, Matthew (c.1566-c.1624), Thomas (b.c.1568), Barnabe, William, Henry, Robert and Francis, and a daughter, Mary.Mary Darrell (c.1545-1594+), A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: D, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 3 September 2013. In 1569 Googe dedicated a long allegorical poem with a moralistic marine topic, The Shippe of Safegarde, to his sisters-in-law. By this time, Googe had served Cecil on a military expedition to Ireland, where he had contracted dysentery and nearly died. In 1571 he was returned as MP for Aldborough, Yorkshire. Further service in Ireland awaited him in 1582 when Googe was appointed to the position of provost-marshal of the court of Connaught;It is often said, on scant evidence, that Googe knew other poets in Irish service, notably Edmund Spenser. some twenty letters of his in this capacity are preserved in the Public Record Office. Googe considered the post a hardship. He wrote to Burghley that \\"I here live amongst a sort of Scythians, wanting the comfort of my country, my poor wife and children\\". Googe repeatedly petitioned the political masters in London to be allowed to come home. On the death of his stepmother, Ellen (n√©e Gadbury) in 1587 he received his inheritance. He finally succeeded in selling his office in the late 1580s. Googe's last known letter, dated 19 June 1587, was written from Lord Burghley's chamber at court. In it Googe mentioned his new home at Alvingham. He is thought to have retired there for the remainder of his life. He died at Alvingham about 7 February 1594, and was buried in Cockerington church. Poetry Googe's poems are written in the plain or native style which preceded and subsequently competed with the Petrarchan style. Petrarchan love poetry (much of the work of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, Sir Philip Sidney, Thomas Campion...) was decorative, metaphorical and often exaggerated; it also involved a more fluid mastery of iambic English poetry than the alliterative Native Style: Googe's tonic accents are heavy, the unaccents light; the result is sometimes deliberately blunt and plodding. The poems of George Turberville, Thomas More, George Gascoigne and Walter Raleigh are examples of a similar style. Plain Style dealt with serious subjects in a serious way: its goal was not ornamental beauty, but truth. Googe's poem Of Money (\\"Give money me, take friendship whoso list / For friends are gone come once adversity...\\") is a well-known example of the tradition. Googe was an ardent Protestant, and his poetry is coloured by his religious and political views. In the third \\"Eglog\\", for instance, he laments the decay of the old nobility and the rise of a new aristocracy of wealth, and he gives an indignant account of the sufferings of his co-religionists under Mary I of England. The other eclogues deal with the sorrows of earthly love, leading up to a dialogue between Corydon and Cornix, in which the heavenly love is extolled. The volume includes epitaphs on Nicholas Grimald, John Bale and on Thomas Phaer, whose translation of Virgil Googe esteemed. The English pastoral poem \\"Phyllida was a fayer maid\\" (from Tottel's Miscellany of 1558) has been doubtfully ascribed to Googe, despite showing little stylistic rapport with his acknowledged works. But Googe's important contribution to pastoral poetry in English rests with his cycle of eclogues that synthesise trends from classical pastoral, the work of Mantuan, and the pastoral elements of Spanish romance, and he was the first English writer to reflect the influence of the Diana Enamorada of Montemayor. His other works include: a translation from Marcellus Palingenius (said to be an anagram for Pier Angelo Manzolli) of a satirical Latin poem, Zodiacus vitae (Venice, 1531?), in twelve books, under the title of The Zodyake of Life (1560); The Popish Kingdome, or reign of Antichrist (1570), translated from Thomas Kirchmeyer or Naogeorgus; The Spiritual Husbandrie from the same author, printed with the last Foure Bookes of Husbandrie (1577), collected by Conradus Heresbachius; The Overthrow of the Gout (1577), a translation from Christopher Ballista (Christophe Arbaleste), and The Proverbes of Lopes de Mendoza (1579). The Zodyake of Life was a significant translation, being adopted as a textbook for English grammar schools. As such, its ideas colour many of the works of English writers of the latter part of the sixteenth and the first part of the seventeenth centuries. Part of the book's appeal, in addition to its poetical astronomy, was its notoriety as a Reformist text: Palingenius was placed on the Index of Prohibited Books by the Inquisition and consequently enjoyed popularity in Protestant regions across Europe.

He was the fourth son and second crown prince of Emperor Guangwu. It was during Emperor Ming's reign that Buddhism began to spread into China. Emperor Ming was a hard-working, able administrator of the empire who showed integrity and demanded integrity from his officials. He also established the control of the Chinese Empire on the Tarim Basin and eradicated the Xiongnu influence there, through the conquests of his general Ban Chao. The reigns of Emperor Ming and his son Emperor Zhang were typically considered the golden age of the Eastern Han Empire and known as the Rule of Ming and Zhang. Family background Liu Yang was born in 28 to Emperor Guangwu and his first love, Consort Yin Lihua. Emperor Guangwu, then still an official under Gengshi Emperor, had married Yin in 23 and, after he became emperor in 25, had wanted to create her empress, but she declined because she had no sons at that point. Instead, she endorsed Consort Guo, who had already had a son (Liu Jiang ()), and Emperor Guangwu created Consort Guo empress and Prince Jiang crown prince in 26. However, Prince Yang's birth in 28 was still considered a major event. As Duke/Prince of Donghai and crown prince In 39, Emperor Guangwu created all of his sons, other than Crown Prince Jiang, dukes, and Prince Yang was created the Duke of Donghai. He quickly became known for his intelligence even in his young age, and he often made quick judgments of situations that turned out to be correct. Emperor Guangwu became very impressed with him. At the age of 41, Empress Guo had lost favor, and her constant complaints angered Emperor Guangwu. In 41, he deposed her and made Duke Yang's mother Consort Yin empress instead. All of the imperial dukes were promoted to princes to accommodate Emperor Guangwu's new title for Empress Guo‚ÄîPrincess Dowager of Zhongshan (after appointing her son Liu Fu () the Prince of Zhongshan); Duke Yang was created the Prince of Donghai. After Empress Guo was deposed, her son, Crown Prince Jiang, became apprehensive about remaining crown prince, and repeatedly requested to be replaced. Emperor Guangwu was initially hesitant to depose both mother and son, but in 43, he resolved to swap Princes Jiang's and Yang's positions. He created Prince Jiang the Prince of Donghai, and created Prince Yang crown prince. At this time, he also changed Prince Yang's name to Zhuang, perhaps because Yang (which means \\"sun\\") is such a commonly used character that the law of naming taboo would cause the people too much trouble. The new name was not without its own problems, and many members of the Zhuang clan were forced to change their names.People's Daily Online. \\"Chinese Zhuang surname history\\". 7 Jul 2005. Accessed 16 Apr 2012. In 51, the woman who would eventually become his empress ‚Äì Consort Ma, the youngest daughter of famed general Ma Yuan ‚Äì would become a consort of his. She was 12, and he was 23. She would become a favorite of his, but never bore a son. Her niece (the daughter of her older sister), Consort Jia, also a consort of Crown Prince Zhuang, did give birth to a child‚ÄîLiu Da (). At Crown Prince Zhuang's direction, Consort Ma adopted Consort Jia's son as her own. As crown prince, Crown Prince Zhuang was often requested by Emperor Guangwu to render opinions in important matters. In 51, he was involved in making a major correct decision in Han's relationship with Xiongnu. By that point, Xiongnu had a civil war and divided into two‚Äîwith North Xiongnu ruled by Chanyu Punu () and South Xiongnu ruled by Chanyu Bi (). Han had become allied with South Xiongnu, and in response, Chanyu Punu, also wanting peace with Han, requested a heqin marriage. Prince Zhuang suggested that Emperor Guangwu refuse the proposal, reasoning that North Xiongnu had only made the proposal to alienate South Xiongnu from Han. Emperor Guangwu agreed. In 57, Emperor Guangwu died, and Crown Prince Zhuang succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming. Early reign Due to a naming taboo, people with the surname Zhuang (Ëéä) were forced by to changed their surname to Yan (Âö¥).Patrick Hanks, Peter McClure, and Richard Coates, The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland Emperor Ming quickly established himself as a diligent and capable administrator of the empire. He did many things to try to stamp out corrupt officials, often putting them to death if they were discovered. One thing traditional historians praised him for was his fair treatment of his brothers by the deposed Empress Guo, treating them as if they were also born of his mother Empress Dowager Yin. In 58, when his older brother, Prince Jiang of Donghai (the former crown prince) died, he ordered that the princes and major officials to attend Prince Jiang's funeral‚Äîa highly unusual honor‚Äîat Lucheng (È≠ØÂüé, in modern Jining, Shandong), the capital of Donghai. In 59, at the suggestion of his brother Liu Cang () the Prince of Dongping, Emperor Ming instituted a number of Confucian rituals, in which the emperor personally honored the officials who had helped him, to show humility. In 60, he created his favorite Consort Ma (who was also a favorite of his mother Empress Dowager Yin) empress, and created her adopted son Prince Da crown prince. The same year, to honour the generals and officials who had assisted his father Emperor Guangwu in reestablishing the Han Dynasty, Emperor Ming, perhaps echoing what Emperor Xuan had done, had the portraits of 28 of them drawn on a palace tower (known as \\"Yuntai 28 Generals\\"). Later, four more portraits were added. However, Ma Yuan, because he was the father of the empress, did not receive this honor. During the early part of his reign, North Xiongnu continued to be a constant threat to both Han and her ally South Xiongnu. Emperor Ming engaged in a variety of military and economic tactics to try to maintain peace with North Xiongnu and was largely successful. In 65, he established a permanent border defense force, known as the Duliao Army (), in charge of protecting the northern boundaries and South Xiongnu, and also to prevent the people of South Xiongnu from defecting to North Xiongnu. In 66, in what would eventually evolve into the first imperial university in Chinese history, Emperor Ming built a Confucian school at the capital Luoyang, for the children of high officials and marquesses. South Xiongnu nobles' children also attended. Late reign = The Chu and Huaiyang-related mass executions = Emperor Ming was, early in his reign, known for his generosity and affection for his brothers. This, however, apparently caused some of them to engage in behavior that were considered taboo at the time and caused them to be severely punished by Emperor Ming, leading also to two major mass executions that blotted Emperor Ming's reign. The first of these incidents happened in 66‚Äì67 and was relatively bloodless. The ambitious Prince Jing of Guanglin wanted to be emperor, and he plotted with people under him to rebel. When he was informed, he confessed, and Emperor Ming initially spared him and permitted him to remain the Prince of Guanglin but stripped his political powers. However, later Prince Jing hired warlocks to curse Emperor Ming. After he was discovered, Emperor Ming initially took no action, but in 67 forced Prince Jing to commit suicide. The next incident would not be so bloodless. In 70, Prince Ying of Chu‚Äîincidentally, the only son of Emperor Guangwu not born of either of his empresses but of Consort Xu‚Äîhired warlocks to create golden turtles and jade cranes, and carved characters calling for unusual blessings on them‚Äîa major taboo at the time. Further, he was discovered to have written revolutionary writings. Emperor Ming did not put him to death, but deposed him from his principality, exiled him, and made him a commoner (but with a small fief of 500 households). In 71, Prince Ying committed suicide in exile. However, the investigation did not end. By Emperor Ming's orders, Prince Ying's associates (but not his family) were harshly tortured and interrogated, and anyone that they named as a coconspirator was arrested and further tortured and interrogated. The interrogators themselves used this opportunity to falsely accuse many others of conspiracy. Tens of thousands of people died, either of torture or execution, during the investigation. Only after Empress Ma's intercession and persuasive petitions by one of the interrogators, Han Lang (), did the interrogations taper off. A similar incident happened in 73, when Prince Yan of Huaiyang was informed to have hired warlocks to curse Emperor Ming. Several of Prince Yan's associates were executed, and there were also many others who were executed or exiled after Chu-style interrogations were carried out. Prince Yan himself was not executed, but was demoted from his commandery-level principality to be the Prince of Fulin, with only two counties in his principality. =Campaigns against North Xiongnu and reassertion of suzerainty over Xiyu= In 73, annoyed at North Xiongnu's constant incursions against Han, Emperor Ming commissioned his generals Geng Bing () and Dou Gu () to lead a major expedition against North Xiongnu. They only had minor successes, but it demonstrated to North Xiongnu that Han was now in a position to strike back. Dou, as part of his campaign, sent his assistant Ban Chao to visit the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) kingdom of Shanshan (on the eastern edge of the Taklamakan Desert. (Xiyu kingdoms had long submitted to North Xiongnu's authority, and unable to bear the heavy taxes, had often requested that Han step in and reassert suzerainty that had been established during the Western Han Dynasty, starting with Emperor Wu's reign. However, they had been constantly rebuffed by Emperors Guangwu and Ming, who judged Han to be not sufficiently strong to engage in a Xiyu campaign.) Initially, the king of Shanshan was very pleased and welcomed the Han ambassadors as honored guests, but eventually the welcome faded. Ban realized that North Xiongnu ambassadors must have arrived. He found out where the North Xiongnu ambassadors were, and, in a night raid, massacred the Xiongnu ambassadors. The king of Shanshan was shocked but somewhat pleased, and submitted to Han suzerainty once again. Emperor Ming promoted Ban and commissioned him to next visit Yutian (\\"Khotan\\"), then the strongest kingdom in southern Xiyu, which had a strong alliance with North Xiongnu. Guangde (), the King of Yutian, trusted his chief warlock, who demanded Ban's horse. Ban agreed to give him the horse, and then, when the warlock arrived to pick up the horse, immediately executed him, and sent his head back to Guangde. Guangde was impressed and submitted to Han's suzerainty. With Yutian having submitted, the Xiyu kingdoms largely all submitted as well. In 74, Dou and Geng led a major military expedition against a major remaining ally of North Xiongnu, Cheshi (ËªäÂ∏´, roughly modern Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang). Cheshi submitted, and at Dou's suggestion, the office of the Protector General of Xiyu () was reinstituted. A North Xiongnu expedition in 75 to recapture Cheshi was repelled by Geng Gong (), one of the deputies of the protector general. =Death= In 75, Emperor Ming died. His will ordered that no temple be built for him, and that he only be worshipped as part of the worship of his mother Empress Dowager Yin. (This became a systematic reform that the rest of the Eastern Han Dynasty emperors largely followed; they did not have separate temples built for themselves, but instead were worshipped along with Emperor Guangwu. This was a major saving compared to the Western Han system of building a separate temple for each emperor.) His son Crown Prince Da succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhang.

Bayeux is the home of the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England. It is also known as the first major town secured by the Allies during Operation Overlord. Charles de Gaulle made two famous speeches in this town. Administration Bayeux is a sub- prefecture of Calvados. It is the seat of the arrondissement of Bayeux and of the canton of Bayeux. Location Bayeux is located from the coast of the English Channel and north-west of Caen. The city, with elevations varying from above sea level ‚Äì with an average of ‚Äì is bisected by the River Aure. Bayeux is located at the crossroads of RN 13 and the train route Paris-Caen- Cherbourg. The city is the capital of the Bessin, which extends north-west of Calvados. Etymology The city was known as Augustodurum in the Roman Empire. It means the durum (Celtic word duro- 'door', 'gate', Welsh ', Breton ' 'door', 'gate') dedicated to Augustus, Roman Emperor. The Celtic word duron, Latinised as durum, was probably used to translate the Latin word forum (Compare Fr√©jus Forum Julii, dedicated to Julius (Caesar)).:fr:Pierre-Yves Lambert, La langue gauloise, √©ditions errance 1994. In the Late Empire it took the name of the Celtic tribe who lived here: the Bodiocassi, Latinized in Bajocassi, Bajocasses, and this word explains the place-names Bayeux and Bessin. Bodiocassi has been compared with Old Irish ' 'with blond locks'.Xavier Delamarre, Dictionnaire de la langue Gauloise, √©ditions errance 2003. History = Origins= Founded as a Gallo-Roman settlement in the 1st century BC under the name Augustodurum, Bayeux is the capital of the former territory of the Baiocasses people of Gaul, whose name appears in Pliny's Natural History (iv.107). Evidence of earlier human occupation of the territory comes from fortified Celtic camps, but there is no evidence of any major pre-existing Celtic town before the organization of Gaul in Roman civitates. Any settlement was more likely confined to scattered Druid huts along the banks of the Aure and Drome rivers or on Mount Phaunus where they worshiped. Cemeteries have been found on the nearby Mount Phaunus indicating the area as a Druid centre. Titus Sabinus, a lieutenant of Julius Caesar, subjected the Bessin region to Roman domination. The 5th-century Notitia provinciarum et civitatum Galliae mentions Suevi that had been officially settled here (laeti). Laeti Suevorum, noted in Jean Roemer, Origins of the English People and the English Language, p. 207 note 2. The town is mentioned by Ptolemy, writing in the reign of Antoninus Pius, under the name Noemagus Biducassium (for *Noviomagus Badiocassium 'New market of the Badiocassi') and remained so until the time of the Roman Empire. The main street was already the heart of the city. Two baths, under the Church of St. Lawrence and the post office in rue Laiti√®re, and a sculpted head of the goddess Minerva have been found, attesting to the adoption of Roman culture. In 1990 a closer examination of huge blocks discovered in the cathedral in the 19th century indicated the presence of an old Roman building. Bayeux was built on a crossroads between Lisieux and Valognes, developing first on the west bank of the river. By the end of the 3rd century a walled enclosure surrounded the city and remained until it was removed in the 18th century. Its layout is still visible and can be followed today. The citadel of the city was located in the southwest corner and the cathedral the southeast. An important city in Normandy, Bayeux was part of the coastal defence of the Roman Empire against the pirates of the region, and a Roman legion was stationed there. =Middle Ages= scene 22 of the Bayeux Tapestry The city was largely destroyed during the Viking raids of the late 9th century but was rebuilt in the early 10th century under the reign of Bothon. In the middle of the 10th century Bayeux was controlled by Hagrold, a pagan Viking who defended the city against the Franks. The 12th-century poet Beno√Æt de Saint-Maure, in his verse history of the dukes of Normandy, remarked on the \\"Danish\\" commonly spoken at Bayeux. Beno√Æt, Chronique: \\"Mais a Baiues en a tanz/ Qui ne sevent si daneis non.\\" The 11th century saw the creation of five villages beyond the walls to the north east evidence of its growth during Ducal Normandy. William the Conqueror's half brother Odo, Earl of Kent completed the cathedral in the city and it was dedicated in 1077. However the city began to lose prominence when William placed his capital at Caen. When King Henry I of England defeated his brother Robert Curthose for the rule of Normandy, the city was burned to set an example to the rest of the duchy. Under Richard the Lionheart, Bayeux was wealthy enough to purchase a municipal charter. From the end of Richard's reign to the end of the Hundred Years' War, Bayeux was repeatedly pillaged until Henry V of England captured the city in 1417. After the Battle of Formigny, Charles VII of France recaptured the city and granted a general amnesty to its populace in 1450. The capture of Bayeux heralded a return to prosperity as new families replaced those decimated by war and these built some 60 mansions scattered throughout the city, with stone supplanting wood. =Post-medieval= Bayeux city centre (2011) The area around Bayeux is called the Bessin, which was the bailiwick of the province Normandy until the French Revolution. During the Second World War, Bayeux was the first city of the Battle of Normandy to be liberated, and on 16 June 1944 General Charles de Gaulle made the first of two major speeches in Bayeux in which he made clear that France sided with the Allies. The buildings in Bayeux were virtually untouched during the Battle of Normandy, the German forces being fully involved in defending Caen from the Allies. The Bayeux War Cemetery with its memorial includes the largest British cemetery dating from the Second World War in France. There are 4,648 graves, including 3,935 British and 466 Germans. Most of those buried there were killed in the invasion of Normandy. Royal British Legion National, every 5 June at 1530 hrs, attends the 3rd Division Cean Memorial Service and beating retreat ceremony. On the 6th of June, it holds a remembrance service in Bayeux Cathedral starting at 1015 hrs, and later at 1200 hrs, the Royal British Legion National holds a service of remembrance at the Bayeux Cemetery. All services are open to the public, all Standards RBL, NVA, RN, ARMY, and RAF service and Regimental Associations are welcome to attend and parade. Details can be found at www.rblsomme.org The French town of Bayeux is also the home of a memorial to all of the journalists who have lost their lives while reporting. The memorial was designed by Samuel Craquelin, who is a French architect. The memorial lists the names of 1,889 journalists killed between 1944 and 2007. The memorial was established in Bayeux because of its historic liberation on 7 June 1944. Natural features The river Aure flows through Bayeux, offering panoramic views from a number of locations. The Aure has a relatively high level of turbidity and the speed of its brownish water is moderate because of the slight slope of the watercourse, although where it is narrow in places like the centre of Bayeux, higher surface speeds are generated. In the centre of Bayeux near the Bayeux Tapestry Museum, pH levels were measured at 8.35 and the electrical conductivity of water was tested at 37 microsiemens per centimetre. Turbidity was measured at 13 centimetres by the Secchi disk method.

Sights Bayeux Cathedral Bayeux is a major tourist attraction, best known to British and French visitors for the Bayeux tapestry, made to commemorate events in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. According to tradition, the tapestry was made by the attendants of Matilda of Flanders, wife of William the Conqueror. In fact, it may have been designed and stitched in England.World Book Encyclopedia, p. 177, World Book Inc. It is displayed in a museum in the town centre.

Life Nicholas Grimald was born to a modest yeoman family of farmers in 1519‚Äì20. His parents are unknown, despite the popular belief that his father was Giovanni Baptista Grimaldi. The poem A funeral song, upon the death of Annes his moother, accounts for his mother's death. Grimald's mother has been speculated to be Agnes Gyrmbold, who dies in 1555. The poem mentions his hardworking father, but focuses upon the fondness that he had for his mother. Grimald saw his parents love and devotion for each other and expressed that in the poem. He was the only boy out of many girls. Maps found of Huntingdonshire in the 16th century do not show a place that could be Brownshold. What was found was an estate named Leighton Bromswold. This is the closest match to how Grimald describes his home in the poem A funeral song, upon the death of Annes his moother. The Grimald family was seen to be living in Leighton Bromswold for close to four hundred years. Their last name had gone through variations as shown by legal documents kept by the town. Variations include: Grymbaud, Grymbold, Grymbolde, Grimbold, Grimald, Grimbald, and Grymbalde.. There has been no evidence of Grimald ever being married or having children. Some of his contributed verses in Tottle's Songes and Sonnettes refer to two women Grimald my have admired, Carie Day and Mistress Damascene Awdley. These verses show a debate on if marriage has the desired result that is wanted. Grimald's connection to Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, brought him under suspicion, and he was imprisoned in the Marshalsea. It is said that he escaped the penalties of heresy by recanting his errors, and was despised accordingly by his Protestant contemporaries. The exact date, cause, and location of his death are unknown. Barnabe Googe, in his Eglogs, Epythaphes, and Sonettes(1563), included An Epytaphes on the Death of Nicholas Grimaold, which was written before Googe's departure abroad in 1562. Education and early career When Nicholas Grimald was fifteen years old, he started showing signs of poetic talent. His mother, who placed an emphasis on education, sent him to continue his education at Cambridge. This separation was hard for Grimald's mother, as he was the only boy in the family. In 1539‚Äì40, Grimald graduated from Christ's College with a B.A.. Grimald travelled to Oxford a year later, when the prebendary of Leighton Bromswold Gilbert Smith, a family friend, was impressed by his work. In his first few years in Oxford, Grimald attended Brasenose College. When Grimald was unable to continue his school work because he lacked his books, his first drama was written. Grimald received encouragement from the Matthew Smith, the president of the school, along with other teachers and students who were eager to participate in the arts. The play was the Latin resurrection play Christus Redivivus. Grimald dedicated his work to Smith. It was written in 1541, but was published two years later in Germany in 1543. At twenty-three years old in 1542, Grimald was able to acquire his B.A. at Oxford. This degree allowed his admission into Merton College, where he received his M.A. in 1544. In that same year, Grimald travelled back to Cambridge to get his M.A. at Christ's College. Grimald chose to stay in Oxford after his degrees in 1544. His next work was another Latin tragedy based on the life and death of John the Baptist called Archipropheta in 1548. Grimald was licensed as a lecturer in 1552 by Richard Sampson, this allowed him to preach at Eccles. The next year he was appointed chaplain to Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London. Ridely's high opinion of Grimald was shown when the bishop chose him to deliver a Latin address in April 1553, Oratio ad pontifices. Involvement with Nicholas Ridley Nicholas Grimald was appointed chaplain to Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, in 1552. Previously, in a letter written to Sir John Gates and Sir William Cecil, Ridley praised Grimald for his preferment and commended him for his 'eloquence in both English and Latin' (Matthew; Harrison 13). Ridley's high opinion was later confirmed when the Bishop appointed Grimald to deliver the Latin address in April 1553, at an assembled bishops' meeting on absentee clergy. The possible apostasy under Mary I put considerable strife on their relationship, and ultimately lead to its demise. Following Ridley's successful recommendation for Grimald to be appointed chantership of St.Paul's Cathedral, Queen Mary acquired the throne. Queen Mary's brutal prosecution of Protestants led to Ridley's imprisonment. While in prison, Ridley wrote to Grimald and potentially sent him Laurentius Valla's De falso credia et ementita Constantini Donatione declmatio, a text denouncing the pope's claim to dominion (13). The correspondence caught the attention of the Catholic authority and consequently led to Grimald's imprisonment at Marshalsea in 1555.(Stephen;Lee 1917). Grimald's imprisonment was brief, and many speculated the poet's apostate to Catholicism. Originally, Grimald quelled the accusations. In response to rumours of Grimald's collusion with the Catholic Church, Ridley said, 'it will not sink into my head to think that Grimbol would ever play me such a Judas's part' (Matthew;Harrison 13). Ridley later confirmed Grimald's betrayal, and said, in response Grimald's imprisonment and apostate to Catholicism, that 'he (Grimald) escaped not without some becking and bowing (alas) of is knee uno Baal' (13). It is unclear whether or not there was reconciliation prior to Ridley's execution. Works Upon arriving at Oxford, Grimald began his first major work; the Latin resurrection and tragicomedy Christus Redivus or The Resurrection of Christ. His motivation for starting the play was to redeem not being able to perform his studies because his books had come late. When proposing the idea of writing a play, Grimald received support from his peers, teachers, and even the schools president. The story of the play consisted of the resurrection of Christ and is thought to have been made for an Easter time performance. It is believed Grimald wrote a companion play later in his life called \\"Christus nascens\\", a nativity play made to be performed for Christmas. Christus Redivus was dedicated to the Archdeacon of Peterborough; Gilbert Smith and eventually published in 1543 at Cologne. It cannot be determined whether Grimald was familiar with George Buchanan's Baptistes (1543), or with Jakob Sch√∂pper's Johannes decollatus vel Ectrachelistes (1546). Grimald provides a purely romantic motive for the catastrophe in the passionate attachment of Herodias to Herod Antipas, and constantly resorts to lyrical methods. As a poet Grimald is memorable as the earliest follower of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in the production of blank verse. He writes sometimes simply enough, as in the lines on his own childhood addressed to his mother, but in general his style is more artificial, and his metaphors more studied than is the case with the other contributors to the Miscellany. His classical reading shows itself in the comparative terseness and smartness of his verses. Archipropheta or The Archprophet published in 1548, was a Latin drama that depicted the life of John the Bapist. Grimald submitted the play with his application for a fellowship with the new Dean of Christ Church, Dr. Richard Cox. The application got him a job at the school as \\"a senior or theologist\\" where he would do lectures on rhetoric. Archipropheta is one of the first tragedies to be penned by an Englishman. Grimald's name is attributed to the work Vox Populi, or The People's Complaint, published in 1549. The piece of writing criticised Church officials for failing to carry out their jobs correctly According to Merrill, the work revolves around \\"those rectors, vicars, archdeacons, deans, prebendaries, etc., who spend their lives far from their flocks, or do not perform their sacred duties.\\" He translated Cicero's De Officiis as Marcus Tullius Ciceroes thre bokes of duties (1556); a Latin paraphrase of Virgil's Georgics (printed 1591) is attributed to him, but most of the works assigned to him by John Bale are lost. Two Latin tragedies are extant; Archipropheta sive Johannes Baptista, printed at Cologne in 1548, probably performed at Oxford the year before, and Christus redivivus (Cologne, 1543), edited by JM Hart (for the Modern Language Association of America, 1886, separately issued 1899). Grimald contributed forty poems to the original edition (June 1557) of Songes and Sonettes (commonly known as Tottel's Miscellany). Two of Grimald's poems printed in Miscellany, The Death of Zoroas and Marcus Tullius Ciceroes Death, are regarded as some of the first examples of English blank verse ever published. It is also possible that Grimald was an editor of the first edition of Miscellany. It is speculated that most of Grimald's work was removed from the second edition due to his recantation of Protestantism. Tottel feared that Grimald's recantation would cause book sales to decline, and thus decided to omit many of Grimald's original works from the updated version. All of Grimald's more personal works were left out of the second edition, and only his initials were used to signify his authorship of the nine remaining poems.

He was the third emperor of the Eastern Han. Emperor Zhang was a hardworking and diligent emperor. He reduced taxes and paid close attention to all affairs of state. Zhang also reduced government spending as well as promoted Confucianism. As a result, Han society prospered and its culture flourished during this period. Along with his father Emperor Ming, Emperor Zhang's reign has been highly praised and was regarded as the golden age of the Eastern Han period, and their reigns are collectively known as the Rule of Ming and Zhang. During his reign, Chinese troops under the leadership of General Ban Chao, progressed far west while in pursuit of Xiongnu insurgents harassing the trade routes now collectively known as the Silk Road. The Eastern Han dynasty, after Emperor Zhang, would be plagued with internal strife between royal factions and eunuchs struggling for power. The people for the coming century and a half would yearn for the good days of Emperors Ming and Zhang. (However, part of the strife came from the power obtained by consort clans ‚Äì and the precedent was set by Emperor Zhang's bestowing of power on both his adoptive mother Empress Dowager Ma's clan and his wife Empress Dou's clan.)  Family background  Then-Prince Da was born to then-Crown Prince Liu Zhuang and one of his consorts, Consort Jia, in 56. As Crown Prince Zhang's favorite, Consort Ma ‚Äì Consort Jia's aunt (her mother's sister) ‚Äì had no sons, at Crown Prince Zhang's instruction, Consort Ma adopted Prince Da as her own son. Prince Da therefore grew up considering Consort Ma as his mother, and while he clearly knew that Consort Jia was his birth mother, he never treated her as mother. In 57, Prince Da's grandfather Emperor Guangwu died, and his father Crown Prince Zhuang succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming. In 60, at the behest of his mother Empress Dowager Yin Lihua, Emperor Ming created Consort Ma empress, and Prince Da, as her son, was created crown prince, even though he had four brothers older than he was.  As crown prince  Not much was recorded about Crown Prince Da's career as crown prince, other than he was taught of the Confucian classics at a young age and was encouraged in his studies by his adoptive mother, Empress Ma, with whom he had a close relation. He was also close to his uncles of the Ma clan. In 75, Emperor Ming died, and Crown Prince Da succeeded to the throne as Emperor Zhang at the age of 18. Empress Ma received the title of empress dowager.  Early reign  Emperor Zhang continued his father's hardworking tendencies as emperor, but he was more lenient than his strict father. He sought out honest officials and promoted them, and he himself lived thriftily. He was generally humble and honored the senior officials who had served his grandfather and father faithfully in accordance. In 76, at the suggestion of his advisor Yang Zhong () and prime minister Diwu Lun (), Emperor Zhang ordered that his father's Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia) campaigns be abandoned. However, one of the Han generals in Xiyu, Ban Chao, seeing the importance of maintaining Han presence in Xiyu, refused to withdraw, and Emperor Zhang eventually relented and put Ban in charge of Han's operations in Xiyu. Being close to his Ma uncles, Emperor Zhang wanted to create them marquesses from the early start of his reign. This was initially rebuffed by Empress Dowager Ma, who found this inappropriate. In 79, however, he created them marquesses over her objection and over their requests to only be made acting marquesses. In 77, Emperor Zhang took a daughter of his cousin, the Princess Piyang (), and great-granddaughter of the statesman Dou Rong (), as consort. He greatly loved her, and in 78, he created Consort Dou empress. In 79, Empress Dowager Ma, who had given him much good counsel, died. Even after her death, Emperor Zhang did not honor his birth mother Consort Jia as his mother, but merely permitted her to take on the style of an imperial prince.  Palatial intrigue  After his mother's death, Emperor Zhang continued to be a diligent emperor, but within the palace, there was much struggle between Empress Dou and the other imperial consorts, which would create political instability down the road. While Empress Dowager Ma was alive, she selected two daughters of Song Yang () as consorts for Emperor Zhang. In 78, the elder Consort Song gave birth to a son named Liu Qing, and because Empress Dou was sonless, Prince Qing was created crown prince in 79. The Consorts Song were greatly favored by Empress Dowager Ma. Later in 79, however, Empress Dou would (perhaps remembering Empress Dowager Ma's example) adopt the son of another imperial consort, Consort Liang, Liu Zhao, as her own son, and she plotted, along with her mother Princess Piyang and her brothers, to have her adopted son made crown prince. After Empress Dowager Ma's death, she put her plan into action. She had her brothers collect dossiers on faults of the Song clan while bribing the servants and eunuchs of Consorts Song to gather their own faults. In 82, an opportunity came for Empress Dou. The elder Consort Song had become ill, and in her illness, she craved raw cuscuta, and she requested that her family bring them. Empress Dou seized the cuscuta and falsely accused Consort Song of using it for witchcraft. Emperor Zhang was enraged and expelled Crown Prince Qing from the palace. He had the Consorts Song arrested and interrogated by the eunuch Cai Lun. The Consorts Song saw that they were in deep straits, and they committed suicide by poison. Crown Prince Qing was deposed and created the Prince of Qinghe instead; he was replaced by Prince Zhao as crown prince. Prince Zhao, however, was friendly to his brother, and they often spent time together. The Song sisters would not be Empress Dou's only victims. After Prince Zhao was made crown prince, his birth mother's clan, the Liangs, did not dare to openly celebrate, but were secretly happy. When the Dou clan heard of this, they were displeased and fearful, and they felt that they had to destroy the Liangs. Empress Dou began to give false reports about Prince Zhao's birth mother, Consort Liang, and her sister, also an imperial consort, and they lost Emperor Zhang's favor. In 83, the Dous further submitted false anonymous accusations against the Consorts Liang's father Liang Song (), causing him to die in prison. The Consorts Liang died of sadness and fear. The Dous, having made these powerplay, would eventually gain their goals of becoming even more powerful than they were. Also in 83, Emperor Zhang, having seen that his Ma cousins were not following the law, stopped favoring his Ma uncles, and eventually sent them back to their marches. Empress Dou's brothers Dou Xian () and Dou Du () effectively took over in the power structure ‚Äì the first time in Han history that the empress' clan, rather than the empress dowager's clan, was the most powerful consort clan. This trend held sway for the rest of Eastern Han Dynasty and would prove to be a source of corruption.  Late reign  However, Emperor Zhang himself remained fairly diligent and open-minded. For example, in 84, when two university students, Kong Xi () and Cui Yin () were accused of improperly criticizing his ancestor Emperor Wu and, by criticizing Emperor Wu, making veiled criticism of Emperor Zhang, Emperor Zhang accepted the letter that Kong submitted in his own defense and made him an official in his administration. In 86, the first of the Qiang () rebellions began, and while the Qiang were pacified fairly quickly, this would be bad omen for the decades to come, as the Qiang, mistreated frequently by Han officials, would constantly rebel throughout the rest of the Eastern Han Dynasty and become a major factor in the decline of the Han Empire. In 88, Emperor Zhang died at the age of 32 and was succeeded by Crown Prince Zhao, who became Emperor He.

In the context of publication in print, copy editing is done before typesetting and again before proofreading, the final step in the editorial cycle. The Chicago Manual of Style prefers the term \\"manuscript editing\\". As described by Chicago, \\"manuscript editing encompasses any or all of the tasks along a continuum from simple mechanical corrections (mechanical editing) through sentence-level interventions (line, or stylistic, editing) to substantial remedial work on literary style and clarity, disorganized passages, baggy prose, muddled tables and figures, and the like (substantive editing). Several professional associations of editors further describe this continuum of manuscript editing in terms of levels of editing and characterize the degrees of intervention as light, medium, and heavy copy editing.\\" In the world beyond traditional book and journal publishing, the term copy editing is sometimes applied to an even more expansive range of tasks, or the work is incorrectly referred to as proofreading by authors despite their lofty expectations of the services to be provided. Besides performing the conventional copy editing duties, an editor in these nontraditional publishing environments may be expected to assess the suitability of a manuscript for publication (usually the role of an acquisitions editor or literary agent); to review content, evaluate and reshape a manuscript, or overhaul organization and literary style (the work of a development or substantive editor). Although copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages, they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line, nor do they prepare material on an author's behalf. Creating original content to be published under another person's name is called ghostwriting. Furthermore, copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems, but they are not expected to fix these problems. Helping an author develop an idea into a publishable manuscript, overhauling a rough draft, identifying gaps in subject coverage, devising strategies for more effective communication of content, and creating features to enhance the final product and make it more competitive in the marketplace‚Äîthese tasks describe developmental editing. In the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a copy editor. An organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the copy chief, copy desk chief, or news editor. In book publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world that follow British nomenclature, the term copy editor is used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is subeditor (or sub-editor), commonly shortened to sub. The senior subeditor of a publication is often called the chief subeditor. As the prefix sub suggests, copy editors typically have less authority than regular editors.Lozano, George A. Ethics of Using Language Editing Services in an Era of Digital Communication and Heavily Multi-Authored Papers. Retrieved 24 July 2014. In the context of the Internet, online copy refers to the textual content of web pages. Similar to print, online copy editing is the process of revising and preparing the raw or draft text of web pages for publication. Copy editing has three levels: light, medium, and heavy. Depending on the budget and scheduling of the publication, the publisher will let the copy editor know what level of editing to employ. The chosen type of editing will help the copy editor prioritize their efforts. Within copy editing, there is mechanical editing and substantive editing: mechanical editing is the process of aligning a document with editorial or house style, keeping the preferred style and grammar rules of publication consistent across all content. It refers to editing in terms of spelling, punctuation, and correct usage of grammatical symbols, along with reviewing special elements such as tables, charts, formatting footnotes, and endnotes. Content editing, also known as substantive editing, is the editing of the material, including its structure and organization, to ensure internal consistency. Content editing may require heavy editing or rewriting as compared to mechanical editing. In addition, copy editing may change punctuation, spelling, and usage for a different country. For a Commonwealth readership, the Oxford British and American spelling of \\"organize\\" may be changed to \\"organise\\", and \\"color\\" changed to \\"colour\\".  Practices  = Mechanical editing = Mechanical editing is the process of proofreading a piece of writing for consistency, either internally or in accordance with the publisher's house style. According to Einsohn, mechanical editors work with such things as the following: * Abbreviations and acronyms * Additional elements, such as charts, tables, and graphs * Capitalization * Footnotes and endnotes * Hyphenation * Italicization and boldfaced type * Numbers and numerals * Punctuation * Quotations * Spelling Gilad also mentions the following: * Initialisms * Page numbers, headers, and footers * Underscoring Proper spelling and punctuation are subjective in some cases, where they must be left to the discretion of the copyeditor or the publisher. Most publishing firms use a widely recognized style guide such as The Chicago Manual of Style or The Associated Press Stylebook. Companies that produce documents and reports but do not consider themselves publishers in the usual sense tend to rely on in-house style guides or on the judgment of the copyeditor. = Grammar and usage = The goal of the copy editor is to enforce inviolable rules while respecting personal stylistic preferences. This can be difficult, as some writers view grammatical corrections as a challenge to their intellectual ability or professional identity. Therefore, copy editors are encouraged to respect the author's preference if it is acceptable. This practice is complicated further by volatile language conventions as recorded by books on grammar and usage, the authors of which often disagree. = Content editing = Content editing consists of reorganizing or restructuring a document. This involves any inconsistent parts of the content as well as any variances. Copy editors can either fix the content by rewriting it or heavily editing it. However, the copy editor will often point out any difficult passages for the author to resolve on his or her own time. Although copy editors are not responsible for factual correctness of the document, they can provide comments for the author on any information that they know to be untrue, such as year discrepancies or misleading ideas. Such fact-checking is acceptable for copy editors who know the document's subject matter. The copy editor must also point out any biased language without infringing on the author's meaning. This includes material \\"that might form the basis for a lawsuit alleging libel, invasion of privacy, or obscenity\\". Some see censoring biased language as political correctness, so it is important that the copy editor distinguishes between the two. To do this, the copy editor will permit intentional \\"politically incorrect\\" views and censor only marginalized, offensive, or exclusive language. = Correlating parts, typecoding, and permissions = Most manuscripts will require the copyeditor to correlate the parts within it. Copyeditors must carry out the following tasks in this process: * Verify any cross-references that appear in the text * Check the numbering of footnotes, endnotes, tables, and illustrations * Specify the placement of tables and illustrations * Check the content of the illustrations against the captions and the text * Read the list of illustrations against the illustrations and captions * Read the table of contents against the manuscript * Read the footnotes/endnotes and in-text citations against the bibliography * Check the alphabetization of the bibliography or reference list Some manuscripts may require special cross-checking. For example, in a how-to text, a copyeditor might need to verify that the list of equipment or parts matches the instructions given within the text. Typecoding is the process of identifying which sections of the manuscript are not regular running text. These portions of text, known as elements, include the following: * Part and chapter numbers * Titles and subtitles * Headings and subheadings * Lists * Extracts * Displayed equations * Table numbers * Source lines * Footnotes * Figure numbers and captions It is the copyeditor's job to typecode (or make note of) all manuscript elements for the publication designer.Cyranoworks.com Hard copy copyeditors are usually asked to pencil in the typecodes in the left margin of the manuscript. On-screen copyeditors may be asked to insert typecodes at the beginning and end of each element. Finally, if the manuscript contains long quotations from a published work that is still under copyright, the copyeditor should remind the author to acquire permission to reprint said quotations. The same goes for the reprinting of tables, charts, graphs, and illustrations that have appeared in print. Rules vary for the reproduction of unpublished materials (letters, diaries, etc.)  Processes  There are basic procedures that every copyeditor must follow: copyeditors need a system for marking changes to the author's text (marking), a process for querying the author and the editorial coordinator (querying), a method for keeping track of editorial decisions (recordkeeping), and procedures for incorporating the author's review of the copyediting into a final document (cleanup). These systems were originally developed in an era before that of the computer, but over time these procedures were adapted for a digital on-screen space. Each medium (in print and on screen) has its own affordances, and although a copyeditor may prefer one editing process over the other, copyeditors are practically required to use both techniques. = Hard-copy editing = Traditional markup copy editing, or hard-copy editing, is still important because screening tests for employment may be administered in hard copy. Also, the author whose text the copy editor is editing may prefer hard-copy markup, and copy editors need to know traditional markup in case documents and materials cannot be exchanged electronically. When editing in hard-copy, all participating parties (the editor, author, typesetter, and proofreader) must understand the marks the copy editor makes, and therefore a universal marking system that signifies these changes exists. This is also why the copy editor should write legibly and neatly. Copy editors working hard-copy write their corrections in the text directly, leaving the margins for querying. Usually, the copy editor is asked to write in a bright color, so the author and other parties can easily recognize the editor's changes. = On-screen editing = Every year, more editing projects are being done on computers and fewer in print. Also, if there is a digital version of a text the copyeditor is editing, they can more easily search words, run spellcheckers, and generate clean copies of messy pages. The first thing copyeditors must do when editing on-screen is to copy the author's files, as the original document must be preserved. Each word processing program provides various options for how an editor's markups are shown on screen and on the printout. On-screen editing mainly differs from hard-copy editing in the fact that the copyeditor should edit more cleanly on-screen, refraining from saving parts of words, and be careful in maintaining proper line spacing. = Querying = Copyeditors often need to query their authors in order to address questions, comments, or explanations: most of these can be done in the margins of the text, or the comment section when on-screen. The copyeditor must consider when to query and the length and tone of their queries, as querying too often or seldom, cryptically, or sarcastically can result in a negative relationship between the copyeditor and the author.  Goals  A copyeditor's goals may change depending on the publication for which they work; however, there are a few constituencies which must always be served ‚Äì the author (the person who wrote or compiled the manuscript), the publisher (the person or company which pays for production), and the readers (the audience for whom the material is being produced). These parties (together with the copyeditor) work to achieve the same goal, which is to produce an error-free publication and improve the reader experience, by reducing extraneous cognitive load.http://www.jfpeditorial.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-editing/ The copyeditor strives to improve clarity, coherence, consistency, and correctness ‚Äì otherwise known as the \\"4 C's\\", each of which serves the copyeditor's \\"Cardinal C\\", which is communication.  History  The advent of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century opened the doors to the first printing houses in Europe. Even after the invention of the printing press and on to today, the editor's job is to correct perceived mistakes. Within these printing houses, there were a variety of employees, one type being correctors, or, as they are referred to today, editors. The biggest difference between monastic copyists and copyeditors is that copyeditors leave edits as suggestions that can be rejected by the writer. These printing houses established procedures for editing, preparing the text, and proofreading. Specialist correctors ensured that texts followed the standards of the time.Hellinga, Lotte (2009). The Gutenberg Revolutions A Companion to the History of the Book, p. 211.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. . Before the printing press, monastic copyists altered words or phrases they thought were odd, under the assumption that the copyist before them had made a mistake. This is what led to so much variety in standard texts like the Bible. After the globalization of the book from 1800 to 1970 came the rise of American writers and editors. One editor in particular, Maxwell Perkins, was sought out by writers such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Wolfe because he greatly improved the work of these prominent authors with his editorial eye. Perkins was known for editing, guiding, and befriending his writers ‚Äì but the times were changing.Luey, Beth (2009). Modernity and Print III: The United States 1890-1970 A Companion to the History of the Book, p. 369.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. . In the late 19th century, the role of an editor was to decide if a manuscript was good enough to be published. As time passed, the role of an editor and publisher became more distant. Although there was a newfound relationship between editors and authors, thoughtful editing did not end. Copyeditors were employed at various publishing houses, magazines, journals, and by private authors seeking revisions to their work. Some copyeditors were even employed by public relations and advertising firms who valued strong editing practices in their business. The symbols used by copyeditors today are based on those that have been used by proofreaders since the beginnings of publishing, though they have undergone some changes over time. However, the exact beginnings of the copyediting language used today are unclear. Despite its long history, copyediting as a practice has not experienced any extreme upheaval other than the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s. This phenomenon began as the result of a series of inventions that were released during the middle of this decade, and refers to the growth of technology usage in the field of copyediting. Namely, the development of the Macintosh computer, the desktop laser printer by Hewlett-Packard, and software for desktop publishing called PageMaker allowed the revolution to begin. By allowing both individuals and publishing agencies alike to cheaply and effectively begin to edit compositions entirely on-screen rather than by hand, desktop publishing revolution morphed copyediting into the practice it is today. Most copyeditors today rely on more modern WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) text processors such as Microsoft Word that are based on the original PageMaker to do their work. There were a few events that led to changes within copyediting as a career. One of these, the successful strike of the editorial department of the Newark Ledger from November 17, 1934, to March 28, 1935, was \\"the first major action of its kind by any local guild...[it] both confirmed the irreversibility of the guilds' movement away from the professional association idea and greatly accelerated that process\\". Paired with another string of strikes led by The New York Newspaper Guild against a number of smaller newspapers in the summer of 1934, these actions served to shift the image of the editorial worker as a \\"professional\\" to one as an average citizen. Another strike from the year 1934 was the strike at the Macaulay Company, reportedly the first-ever strike to occur at a publishing firm. At the conclusion of the second Macaulay strike, which occurred three months after the first, the nationwide drive towards unionization had entered the publishing industry and was \\"sweeping through all the major publishing houses\\". As these events seemed to have the secondary result of lowering the status of editors across the various publishing fields, it could be said that they sparked the decline of copyeditors, which can be seen across the publishing fields today. Owing to the rise of the Digital Age, the roles and responsibilities of a copyeditor have changed. For instance, beginning in 1990, copyeditors learned pagination electronically. They could now look at different pages of a text on multiple screens and easily edit on there, as opposed to pasting them by hand onto a board. This technological advance also required that copyeditors learn new software such as Pagemaker, Quark Xpress, and now Adobe InDesign. Modern copyeditors are often required to edit for digital as well as print versions of the text. Digital copyediting requires copyeditors to understand RSS feeds, social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and Hyper Text Markup Language. What should be accounted for is that in this digital age, information is constantly being released, which leads to the decline in the editing of the online versions. Editors of the website BuzzFeed commented that sometimes they \\"simply can't get every post before it's published\\". While copyeditors still do traditional tasks such as checking for facts, grammar, style, and writing headlines, some of their duties have been pushed aside to make way for technology. Some copyeditors now have to design page layouts and some even edit video content. Copyeditors are now sometimes referred to as \\"copy/layout editors\\" or \\"producers/designers\\".  Changes in the field  Example of non-professional copy editing in progress: the document finally published as Traditionally, the copy editor would read a printed or written manuscript, manually marking it with editor's \\"correction marks\\". At sizable newspapers, the main copy desk was often U-shaped; the copy desk chief sat in the \\"slot\\" (the center space of the U) and was known as the \\"slot man\\", while copy editors were arrayed around him or her on the outside of the U, known as the \\"rim\\". In the past, copy editors were sometimes known humorously as \\"rim rats\\". Chief copy editors are still sometimes called \\"the slot\\". But nowadays, the manuscript is more often read on a computer display and text corrections are entered directly. The nearly universal adoption of computerized systems for editing and layout in newspapers and magazines has also led copy editors to become more involved in the design and the technicalities of production. Technical knowledge is therefore sometimes considered as important as writing ability, though this is truer in journalism than it is in book publishing. Hank Glamann, the co-founder of the American Copy Editors Society, made the following observation about ads for copy editor positions at American newspapers: > We want them to be skilled grammarians and wordsmiths and write bright and > engaging headlines and must know Quark. But, often, when push comes to > shove, we will let every single one of those requirements slide except the > last one because you have to know that in order to push the button at the > appointed time. Traits, skills, and training Besides an outstanding command of the language, copy-editors need broad general knowledge for spotting factual errors; good critical thinking skills in order to recognize inconsistencies or vagueness; interpersonal skills for dealing with writers, other editors and designers; attention to detail; and a sense of style. They must also set priorities and balance a desire for perfection with the need to meet deadlines. Many copy editors have a college degree, often in journalism, communications, or the language of the writing that they edit. In the United States, copy editing is often taught as a college journalism course, though its name varies. The courses often include news design and pagination. In the United States, The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund sponsors internships that include two weeks of training. Also, the American Press Institute, the Poynter Institute, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, UC San Diego Extension and conferences of the American Copy Editors Society offer mid- career training for newspaper copy editors and news editors (news copy desk supervisors). Most US newspapers and publishers give copy-editing job candidates an editing test or a tryout. These vary widely and can include general items such as acronyms, current events, math, punctuation, and skills such as the use of Associated Press style, headline writing, infographics editing, and journalism ethics. In both the US and the UK, there are no official bodies offering a single recognized qualification. In the UK, there is a range of courses that are unofficially recognized within the industry. Training may be on the job or through publishing courses, privately run seminars, or correspondence courses of the Society for Editors and Proofreaders. The National Council for the Training of Journalists also has a qualification for subeditors.  Contemporary  Before the digital era, copy- editors would mark errors and inconsistencies with a red pen, using a markup language of symbols which were universally known by copy-editors. The traditional copy editor was once defined as editing for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of style. Copy-editing symbols can not be used in digital editing because they are not supported on digital platforms such as track changes. With more posting online and less printing on paper, hard-copy can no longer keep pace with digital publishing. For a publisher to hire copy editors to print a hard copy, make edits, and then make changes is no longer the most efficient process. The position of copy editors is at risk because time demands quicker results which can be automated by software that catches grammatical errors. Transferring the responsibility from human copy editors to digital software has been adopted by some publishing companies because it is available free of cost. Professionals feared that the introduction of digital editing software would end copyediting careers. Copy editors are still employed and needed for heavy editings, such as fact- checking and content organization, which is beyond the abilities of the software. With grammar software and journalists who can edit, copy editors are seen as a luxury in publishing. The potential for a company to use editing software may also require the copy editor to only perform heavy editing and querying. Though the steps for copyediting are the same, the execution has been adapted for digital environments. The technological development of cloud storage allows contemporary copy editors and writers to upload and share files across multiple devices. Online word processors such as Google Docs, Dropbox, Zoho, OpenGoo and Buzzword allow users to perform a number of tasks. Each processor has its advantages and disadvantages based on the users' preferences, but primarily allows users to share, edit and collaborate on documents. Recently, OpenGoo has been rebranded as Feng Office https://www.fengoffice.com/web/blogen/opengoo-is-now-feng-office/On Google Docs users can invite others via email to view, comment, and edit any file of their choosing. Those invited can view and edit the document together in real time. Unlike Google Docs whose files can only be shared through the web app, Dropbox shares from a desktop app. Dropbox users can share documents as links or as shared folders. Users can create shared folders and add others to the folder. Files in a shared folder will appear in the other user's Dropbox and all involved users receive notifications when edits are made to a file in the folder. Adobe's Buzzword allows users to share files, with the user's choice from varying levels of editing access and includes a version history feature which tracks changes made to documents and lets users revert to earlier versions. Useful in many word processors, a track changes feature allows users to make changes to a document and view them separately from the original document. In Microsoft Word, users can choose whether to show or hide changes by clicking track changes under the Review ribbon. Those editing documents can leave comments by clicking wherever the user desires to leave a comment and clicking New Comment under the review ribbon or by highlighting text and clicking New Comment. Users can apply revisions and choose which level of markups to view under the Show Markup dropdown menu in the Review ribbon. Users can also choose to accept or reject changes by clicking either Accept or Reject in the Review Ribbon. = Contemporary copy-editor = The field of copy-editing is not obsolete. Teresa Schmedding, president of the American Copy Editors Society (ACES) and a deputy managing editor at the Daily Herald in Chicago, thinks that copyeditors are \\"a natural fit\\" for digital journalism and social media because, though publishing has been made available to almost anyone, quality and credibility is brought to content only by copy editors. Copy editors must now consider multimedia aspects of the story, such as video, images, audio, and search engine optimization, which may be included in digital publications. Digital editing now requires copy editors to understand SEO, HTML, CSS, and RSS feeds, as well as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Dreamweaver. = Issues = One of the problems with copy-editing is that it may slow the publication of the text. With the digital publishing era came an increased demand for a fast turnover of information. Additional details such as color printing, page size, and layout are determined by the allotted budget. Web-based publications, such as BuzzFeed and Slate, do not have enough room in their budgets to keep sufficient staff to edit their massive, daily rushes of content. Therefore copy chief Emmy Favila says lower-priority posts are published without copyedits at Buzzfeed. Slate does not edit its blog posts before publication, but all of its news articles are copy edited before publication, say Slate copy chief Lowen Liu and deputy editor Julia Turner. In response to such high demands for fast-produced content, some online publications have started publishing articles first and then editing later, a process known as back-editing. Editors prioritize stories to edit based on traffic and whether the content was originally reported for needing edits. Reading material has become increasingly accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. Carolyn Rude exemplifies such cases in alternatively replacing illustrations with text and audio translations for the visually impaired. Rude also suggests that web developers attempt to stick to print guidelines, such as \\"clear and simple language and consistent terms and navigation devices\\", especially when readers are looking at text in a second language.  Effects of the Internet As online resources rise in popularity, copy editors endeavor to meet the increase of digital consumerism to the best of their abilities, and such high competition has resulted in a gradually \\"declining of quality in editing\\", such as proofreading or fact-checking. However, this doesn't mean that the Internet has limited the scope of a copy editor's responsibilities or job opportunities. One of the most important advancements of the digital age is the advent of pagination, which gives copy editors more control over the construction and revisions of their content. Pagination is a convenient feature in programs such as \\"Pagemaker, the Quark Xpress, and AdobeIndesign\\". Despite the increasing number of programs, however, some copy editors believe their basic functions and duties haven't changed much. Other copy editors think that the Internet has simplified fact- checking and that websites such as Facebook or Twitter have aided information- gathering. Other digital skills, such as image selection and search engine optimization, increase the visibility of search results, especially when searching for keywords in headlines. In all likelihood, the Internet will continue to evolve, but this shouldn't hamper the overall importance of copy editing. Although it may be tempting to neglect proper revisions in favor of convenience, the credibility and quality of an editor's work should still be maintained, as there will always be updates in software and technology. As formats evolve, so too will the opportunities for journalists and other writers.

Edison, Inc. on their Edison Record label from 1912 to 1929. They were named Diamond Discs because the matching Edison Disc Phonograph was fitted with a permanent conical diamond stylus for playing them. Diamond Discs were incompatible with lateral-groove disc record players, e.g. the Victor Victrola, the disposable steel needles of which would damage them while extracting hardly any sound. Uniquely, they are just under in () thick. Early Diamond Disc records, showing the thickness of each record and number stamped into side. Edison had previously made only phonograph cylinders but decided to add a disc format to the product line because of the increasingly dominant market share of the shellac disc records (later called 78s because of their typical rotational speed in revolutions per minute) made by competitors such as the Victor Talking Machine Company. Victor and most other makers recorded and played sound by a lateral or side-to-side motion of the stylus in the record groove, while in the Edison system the motion was vertical or up-and-down, known as vertical recording, as used for cylinder records. An Edison Disc Phonograph is distinguished by the diaphragm of the reproducer being parallel to the surface of the record. The diaphragm of a reproducer used for playing lateral records is at a right angle to the surface. In the late summer and early fall of 1929 Edison also briefly produced a high-quality series of thin electrically recorded lateral-cut \\"Needle Type\\" disc records for use on standard record players. Historical background 1915 newspaper ad for the product. The record industry began in 1889 with some very-small-scale production of professionally recorded wax cylinder records. At first, costly wet-cell-powered, electric-motor-driven machines were needed to play them, and the customer base consisted solely of entrepreneurs with money-making nickel-in-the-slot phonographs in arcades, taverns, and other public places. Soon, some affluent individuals who could afford expensive toys were customers, too. By the late 1890s, relatively inexpensive spring-motor-driven phonographs were available and becoming a fixture in middle-class homes. The record industry boomed. At the same time, the Berliner Gramophone Company was marketing the first crude disc records, which were simpler and cheaper to manufacture, less bulky to store, much less fragile, and could play louder than contemporary wax cylinders, although they were of markedly inferior sound quality. Their quality was soon greatly improved, and by about 1910 the cylinder was clearly losing this early format war. In 1912, Thomas Edison, who had previously made only cylinders, entered the disc market with his Diamond Disc Phonograph system, which was incompatible with other makers' disc records and players. Unusual characteristics Like cylinder records, the sound in a Diamond Disc's groove was recorded by the vertical method, as variations in the depth of the groove cut. At that time, with the notable exception of Path√© Records, which used yet another incompatible format, a disc's groove was normally of constant depth and modulated laterally, side-to-side. The vertical format demanded a perfectly flat surface for best results, so Edison made his Diamond Discs almost one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) thick. They consisted of a thin coating of a phenolic resin virtually identical to Bakelite on a core of compressed wood flour, later also china clay, lampblack for color, all in a rabbit-hide glue binder. With very rare exceptions, all were about ten inches in diameter, but they used a finer groove pitch (150 threads per inch, or \\"TPI\\") and could play longer than lateral ten-inch records‚Äîup to minutes per side. Among their advantages over the competition, they were played with a permanent conical diamond stylus, while lateral-cut records were played with a ten-for-a-penny steel needle that quickly wore to fit the groove contour and was meant to be replaced after one use. A feed screw mechanism inside the Phonograph moved the reproducer across the record at the required rate, relieving the groove of that work and thus reducing record wear. This design was in response to the patent held by the Victor Talking Machine Company that states that the groove of the record itself is what propelled the reproducer across the surface of the record via the needle. The playing speed for Diamond Discs was specified at exactly 80 revolutions per minute, at a time when other makers' recording speeds had not been standardized and could be as slow as 70 rpm or even faster than 80 rpm, but were typically somewhere around 76 rpm, leaving users who cared about correct pitch to adjust the playback speed for each record until it sounded right. Above all, there was, and still is, general agreement that the Diamond Disc system produced the clearest, most 'present' sound of any non-electronic disc recording technology. Although Victor's Victrolas and similar record players could not play Diamond Discs (at best, only very faint sound would be heard, while the crude steel needle seriously damaged the groove) and Edison Diamond Disc Phonographs could not play Victor or other lateral-cut discs, third-party suppliers came up with adapters, such as the Kent adapter, to defeat this incompatibility, but typically with less than optimal sound quality. The Brunswick Ultona, the Sonora, and the expensive \\"Duo-Vox\\" phonograph made by the piano manufacturer Bush and Lane were the only non-Edison machines that came from the factory equipped to play Diamond Discs as well as Victor and other 'needle-type' records, along with Path√©'s sapphire ball stylus hill-and-dale format that used a vertical groove that was U-shaped in cross-section. Edison discouraged all such alternatives by cautioning on some of the record sleeves: \\"This Re-Creation should not be played on any instrument except the Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph and with the Edison Diamond Disc Reproducer, and we decline responsibility for any damage that may occur to it if this warning is ignored.\\" The very good reason for such discouragement was that Diamond Disc grooves were too narrow and fragile to propel a soundbox across a record surface, as lateral machines did; Edison's precise mechanical feed system on the Disc Phonograph for its weighted \\"floating\\" reproducer replaced that stress on its records. Edison Records \\"Diamond Disc\\" label, early 1920s, featuring the Happiness Boys, Billy Jones, and Ernest Hare Rise and fall Diamond Discs enjoyed their greatest commercial success from the mid-1910s to the early 1920s, with sales peaking in 1920. Although they arguably had better audio fidelity, they were more expensive than, and incompatible with, other makers' products and ultimately failed in the marketplace. Not least among the factors contributing to their downfall was Thomas Edison's insistence on imposing his own musical tastes on the catalog. As an elderly man who favored old-fashioned \\"heart\\" songs and had various idiosyncratic preferences about performance practices, he was increasingly out of touch with most of the record-buying public as the Jazz Age of the 1920s got underway. It was not until mid-decade that he reluctantly ceded control to his sons. In 1926, an attempt at reviving interest in Edison records was made by introducing a long-playing Diamond Disc which still rotated at 80 rpm but tripled the standard groove pitch to 450 threads per inch by using an ultra-fine groove, achieving a playing time of 24 minutes per 10-inch disc (12 on each side) and 40 minutes per 12-inch disc (these were the only 12-inch Diamond Discs ever sold to the public). A special reproducer and modified feed screw mechanism were required to play them. There were problems with skipping, groove wall breakdown, overall low volume (about 40% of that of the regular Diamond Discs), and a failure to exploit the format by releasing a limited number of discs. Only 14 different Edison Long Play discs were issued before they were discontinued. In August 1927, electrical recording began, making Edison the last major record company to adopt it, over two years after Victor Records, Columbia Records, and Brunswick Records had converted from acoustical recording. Sales continued to drop, however, and although Edison Diamond Discs were available from dealers until the company left the record business in late October 1929, the last vertically cut direct masters were recorded in the early summer of that year. Priority had been redirected to introducing a new line of Edison lateral or so-called Needle Type thin shellac records, compatible with ordinary record players, but although their audio quality was excellent this concession to commercial reality came too late to prevent the demise of the Edison Phonograph and Records Division just one day before the 1929 stock market crash. Recent comparisons of late popular-series Diamond Discs with the few released \\"Needle Type\\" lateral-cut versions of the same titles indicate that Edison had been splitting their electrical signal during recording to both vertical and lateral lathes since early 1929, as the performances time out identically - the last Diamond Discs are an average of over a minute shorter than 1927-28 releases, fitting the recording time capacity of the ten-inch diameter lateral issues - and have near-identical frequency ranges.

Being three times 20, it is called \\"three score\\" in older literature. In mathematics It is a composite number, with divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, making it a highly composite number. Because it is the sum of its unitary divisors (excluding itself), it is a unitary perfect number, and it is an abundant number with an abundance of 48. Being ten times a perfect number, it is a semiperfect number. It is the smallest number divisible by the numbers 1 to 6: there is no smaller number divisible by the numbers 1 to 5. It is the smallest number with exactly 12 divisors. It is one of seven integers that have more divisors than any number less than twice itself , one of six that are also lowest common multiple of a consecutive set of integers from 1, and one of six that are divisors of every highly composite number higher than itself. It is the sum of a pair of twin primes (29 + 31) and the sum of four consecutive primes (11 + 13 + 17 + 19). It is adjacent to two primes (59 and 61). It is the smallest number that is the sum of two odd primes in six ways.Wells, D. The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers London: Penguin Group. (1987): 109‚Äì110. The smallest non-solvable group (A5) has order 60. The icosidodecahedron has 60 edges, all equivalent. There are four Archimedean solids with 60 vertices: the truncated icosahedron, the rhombicosidodecahedron, the snub dodecahedron, and the truncated dodecahedron. The skeletons of these polyhedra form 60-node vertex-transitive graphs. There are also two Archimedean solids with 60 edges: the snub cube and the icosidodecahedron. The skeleton of the icosidodecahedron forms a 60-edge symmetric graph. There are 60 one-sided hexominoes, the polyominoes made from six squares. In geometry, it is the number of seconds in a minute, and the number of minutes in a degree. In normal space, the three interior angles of an equilateral triangle each measure 60 degrees, adding up to 180 degrees. Because it is divisible by the sum of its digits in base 10, it is a Harshad number. A number system with base 60 is called sexagesimal (the original meaning of sexagesimal is sixtieth). It is the smallest positive integer that is written with only the smallest and the largest digit of base 2 (binary), base 3 (ternary) and base 4 (quaternary). 60 is also the product of the side lengths of the smallest whole number right triangle: 3, 4, 5, a type of Pythagorean triple. In science and technology Buckminsterfullerene C60 has 60 carbon atoms in each molecule, arranged in a truncated icosahedron. The first fullerene to be discovered was buckminsterfullerene C60, an allotrope of carbon with 60 atoms in each molecule, arranged in a truncated icosahedron. This ball is known as a buckyball, and looks like a soccer ball. The atomic number of neodymium is 60, and cobalt-60 (60Co) is a radioactive isotope of cobalt. The electrical utility frequency in western Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and several other countries in the Americas is 60 Hz. An exbibyte (sometimes called exabyte) is 260 bytes. Cultural number systems Babylonian cuneiform numerals The Babylonian cuneiform numerals had a base of 60, inherited from the Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations, and possibly motivated by the large number of divisors that 60 has. The sexagesimal measurement of time and of geometric angles is a legacy of the Babylonian system. The number system in the Mali Empire was based on 60, reflected in the counting system of the Maasina Fulfulde, a variant of the Fula language spoken in contemporary Mali. The Ekagi of Western New Guinea used base 60, and the sexagenary cycle plays a role in Chinese calendar and numerology. In and in refer to 60 = 5 dozen = small gross. This quantity was used in international medieval treaties e.g. for ransom of captured Teutonic Knights. In religion 60 occurs several times in the Bible; for example, as the age of Isaac when Jacob and Esau were born,Biblegateway Genesis 25:26 and the number of warriors escorting King Solomon.Biblegateway Song of Solomon 3:7 In the laws of kashrut of Judaism, 60 is the proportion (60:1) of kosher to non-kosher ingredients that can render an admixture kosher post-facto.Talmud, Tractate Chullin 98b ; Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 98. In the Koran, 60 is mentioned once: \\"..he should feed sixty indigent ones..\\", but it is mentioned many times in the Hadith, most notably Muhammad being reported to say, \\"..Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, created Adam in His own image with His length of sixty cubits..\\"http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=040&translator;=2&start;=0&number;=6809#6809 In Hinduism, the 60th birthday of a man is called Sashti poorthi.

He is known for hosting CBS's The Price Is Right from 1972 to 2007, making it the longest-running daytime game show in North American television history. He is also known for hosting Truth or Consequences from 1956 to 1974. Born in Darrington, Washington in modest circumstances, Barker enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. He worked part-time in radio while he attended college. In 1950, he moved to California in order to pursue a career in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for six years. Barker began his game show career in 1956, hosting Truth or Consequences. From there, he hosted various game shows, and the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants from 1967 to 1987, giving him the distinction of being the longest-serving host of these pageants. He began hosting The Price Is Right in 1972. When his wife Dorothy Jo died of lung cancer at age 57 in 1981, he became an advocate for animal rights and of animal rights activism, supporting groups such as the United Activists for Animal Rights and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. In 2007, he retired from hosting The Price Is Right after celebrating his 50-year career on television. Early life Recorded as Robert Barker in the Indian Census Roll, 1930 Barker was born on December 12, 1923, in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Mission, South Dakota. The U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885‚Äì1940, list Barker as an official member of the Sioux tribe. His mother, Matilda (\\"Tillie\\") Valandra ( Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a school teacher; his father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman on the electrical high line through the state of Washington. Barker is one-eighth Sioux. Barker met his future wife, Dorothy Jo Gideon, at an Ella Fitzgerald concert while he was attending high school in Missouri, and they began dating when he was 15. Barker attended Drury College (now Drury University) in Springfield, Missouri, on a basketball athletic scholarship. He was a member of the Epsilon Beta chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity at Drury. Barker joined the United States Navy Reserve in 1943 during World War II to train as a fighter pilot, but did not serve on active duty. During his time on leave from the military, he married Dorothy Jo on January 12, 1945. After the war, he returned to Drury to finish his education, graduating summa cum laude with a degree in economics. Career =Broadcasting career= While attending college in Drury, Barker worked his first \\"media job\\", at KTTS-FM Radio, in Springfield. He and his wife left Springfield and moved to Lake Worth Beach, Florida, and he was news editor and announcer at nearby WWPG 1340 AM in Palm Beach (now WPBR in Lantana). In 1950, Barker moved to California in order to pursue a career in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for the next six years from Burbank. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles when game show producer Ralph Edwards happened to be listening and liked Barker's voice and style. =Game show career= Truth or Consequences (1956‚Äì1974) Bob Barker in Truth or Consequences, circa 1958 Barker started hosting Truth or Consequences on December 31, 1956, and continued with the program until 1974. Simon Says (1971) In 1971, Barker was tapped to host a pilot for NBC entitled Simon Says, which required him to interact with a giant computer called \\"Simon\\" in Let's Make A Deal-style \\"trades\\". The pilot was produced by Wesley J. Cox of DUNDAS Productions, and its theme was \\"The Savers\\" (the theme used on The Joker's Wild, which has led some to believe that Cox or DUNDAS was an alias for Jack Barry or Dan Enright, since Joker used the theme in its original 1968 pilot). There is at least one (somewhat low-quality) clip of the pilot on the video sharing website YouTube. The Price Is Right (1972‚Äì2007) Bob Barker in 1975 In early 1972, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman began shopping a modernized revival of The Price Is Right to stations, with Dennis James as host. CBS expressed interest in the series, on one condition: instead of James, Barker would be installed as host. After some initial resistance, Barker instead offered to host another upcoming CBS game show, Jack Barry's The Joker's Wild (which had difficulty finding a host and was scheduled to debut the same day as Price) to allow James to host Price, but CBS rejected this proposal. On September 4, 1972, Barker began hosting the CBS revival of The Price Is Right.McNeil, p. 671 On October 15, 1987, Barker did what other MCs almost never did then: renounced hair dye and began wearing his hair gray, which was its natural color by that time. On October 31, 2006, Barker made his announcement that he would retire from The Price Is Right in June 2007. He taped his final episode on June 6, 2007, with the show airing twice on June 15. After his retirement, Barker made three return appearances to The Price is Right. He first appeared on the episode that aired on April 16, 2009 to promote his new autobiography, Priceless Memories. He appeared in the Showcase round at the end of the show. Barker made another guest appearance on the show to celebrate his 90th birthday celebration, which aired on December 12, 2013. He announced a contestant for the first time ever on the show, along with one showcase. Barker also made a surprise appearance on April 1, 2015, for an April Fools' Day switch where he took Drew Carey's place at the show's intro. He hosted the first one bid and pricing game of that day before handing the hosting duties back to Drew. Personal life =Health= On September 16, 1999, Barker was in Washington, D.C., to testify before Congress regarding captive elephants, the proposed legislation that would ban elephant from traveling shows (i.e., circus). While preparing for the presentation, Barker experienced what he called \\"clumsiness\\" in his right hand. He was admitted to George Washington University Hospital and diagnosed with a partially blocked left carotid artery. Barker underwent carotid endarterectomy to remove the blockage. The procedure went well enough that he was able to return to work within the month. Three years later, Barker had two additional health crises after taping the 30th-season finale of The Price is Right. While lying in the sun on May 30, 2002, he experienced a stroke and was hospitalized; six weeks later, on July 11, Barker underwent prostate surgery. Both hospitalizations occurred at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. Both surgeries were successful. Barker has had several mild bouts with skin cancer, a result of his frequent tanning. He consults a dermatologist regularly to make sure any cancers are caught and removed before they spread; they do not currently pose a threat to his life. During a televised interview, Barker told viewers, \\"I urge anyone who has spent some time in the sun, whether you're doing it now or not, go to a dermatologist once a year.\\" On October 20, 2015, two police officers passing Barker's Los Angeles-area home saw him trip and fall on a sidewalk. They called an ambulance that brought him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he received stitches for an injured forehead and was released; he also hurt his left knee. Barker slipped and hit his head at home on June 19, 2017. His maid drove him to the emergency room, where he was checked and released. His representative said it was not as serious as his earlier fall. In October and November 2018, he was rushed to the hospital for severe back pain. =Lawsuits= In 1994, former model Dian Parkinson filed a lawsuit against Barker alleging sexual harassment following a three-year affair while working on The Price Is Right. Parkinson, who alleged that she was extorted by threats of firing, later dropped her lawsuit, claiming the stress from the ordeal was damaging her health.Dian Parkinson Bio In 1995, model Holly Hallstrom left The Price Is Right and later filed suit against Barker for wrongful termination and malicious persecution claiming Barker had launched a media attack against her, allegedly stating that she was disruptive to the working atmosphere of the show. Barker dropped his case, but Hallstrom did not, finally ending in settlement in 2005. In October 2007, Deborah Curling, a CBS employee assigned to The Price Is Right, filed a lawsuit against CBS, Bob Barker and The Price Is Right producers, claiming that she was forced to quit her job after testifying against Barker in a wrongful-termination lawsuit brought by a previous show producer. Curling claimed that she was demoted to an \\"intolerable work environment\\" backstage which caused her to leave the job. Curling, who is black, also alleged that the show's producers, including Barker, created a hostile work environment in which black employees and contestants were discriminated against. A few months later, Barker was removed from the lawsuit, and in September 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed. Curling's attorney stated that he planned to appeal the dismissal of the lawsuit. In January 2012, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. =Animal rights= Barker has been a vegetarian for over three decades. He has also been an outspoken advocate for a variety of animal rights issues: In 1979, Barker began ending The Price Is Right episodes with the phrase: \\"This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet population ‚Äî have your pets spayed or neutered.\\" In 1987, Barker requested the removal of fur prizes for the Miss USA pageant, and stepped down as host when the producers refused. In 1989, Barker and United Activists for Animal Rights publicly accused several media projects and the American Humane Association of animal mistreatment and condoning animal mistreatment, a tactic which resulted in a $10 million suit against him and the UAAR for libel, slander and invasion of privacy.Speaking Up for 'Abused' Animals, Bob Barker Is Hit with a Lawsuit ‚Äì People, September 18, 1989, Vol. 32, No. 12.

In 2004, Barker donated $1 million to Columbia Law School to support the study of animal rights. In 2009, Barker wrote a letter about three businesses in Cherokee, North Carolina, asking them to close their bear exhibits. In 2009, Barker threatened to not attend the 2009 Game Show Awards, where he was to receive a lifetime achievement award, because Betty White would be attending. Previously working with White, the reason for this conflict was over the treatment of an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo. White instead did not attend and pre-recorded her comments that she was scheduled to make about another awardee, Mark Goodson. In 2010, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society announced that it had secretly purchased and outfitted a ship to interdict Japanese whaling operations in the Southern Ocean using $5,000,000 provided by Barker. The ship was then named the MY Bob Barker, and its existence was first revealed when it helped discover the location of the whaling in Japan. In 2010, Barker donated $2.5 million to renovate a building for PETA's new office in Los Angeles. The building was opened in 2012. Film and other TV appearances *In 1996, Barker played himself in the Adam Sandler comedy Happy Gilmore.

Background and education A member of the Somerset family headed by the Duke of Beaufort, Somerset was the son of Richard Somerset, 2nd Baron Raglan, by his first wife Lady Georgina Lygon, third daughter of Henry Lygon, 4th Earl Beauchamp. He was a godchild of George V of Hanover, Somerset became a Page of Honour to Queen Victoria in 1868, which he remained until 1874. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

He arrived on the island on 18 October and was sworn in at Castletown on 21 October. During his tenure as Lieutenant Governor he became the Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons in the Isle of Man from 1912 to 1919 and had the Lord Raglan Lodge No 3685 named in his honour. Described as \\"autocratic\\" and \\"unpopular\\", he opposed campaigns by Manx trade unions for direct taxation to fund an old-age pension and in 1918 ordered the removal of flour subsidies which increased the price of bread 15% above that in England. These actions had a direct effect in generating the July 1918 general strike on the island, which resulted in the passing of an act on direct taxation, reduction in bread prices and the introduction of pensions. Lord Raglan resigned as Governor on 17 December 1918, citing ill-health.

It extends north-westward into the English Channel, towards Great Britain. To its west lie the Channel Islands and to the southwest lies the peninsula of Brittany. The peninsula lies wholly within the department of Manche, in the region of Normandy. Geography The Cotentin peninsula is part of the Armorican Massif (with the exception of the Plain lying in the Paris Basin) and lies between the estuary of the Vire river and Mont Saint-Michel Bay. It is divided into three areas: the headland of Cap de la Hague, the Cotentin Pass (the Plain), and the valley of the Saire River (Val de Saire). It forms the bulk of the department of Manche. Its southern part, known as \\"le Marais\\" (the Marshlands), crosses from east to west from just north west of Saint Lo and east of Lessay and marks a natural border with the rest of Manche. The largest town in the peninsula is Cherbourg-en-Cotentin, a major cross-channel port on the north coast, with a population of approximately 120,000. The population of the peninsula is about 250,000. The western coast of the peninsula, known as the C√¥te des √éles (\\"Islands Coast\\"), faces the Channel Islands. Ferry links serve Carteret and the islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney from Dielette. Off the east coast of the peninsula lies the island of Tatihou and the √éles Saint-Marcouf. The oldest stone in France is found in outcroppings on the coast of Cap de la Hague, at the tip of the peninsula.Bay of √âcalgrain and Bay of Cul-Rond Website \\"Lithoth√®que de Normandie\\" Cotentin was almost an island at one time. Only a small strip of land in the heath of Lessay connected the peninsula with the mainland.Les Parcs Naturels R√©gionaux. Editions Gallimard. Page 176. Thanks to the so-called portes √† flot (fr), which close at flood and open at ebbhydraulic heritage : les portes √† flot (franz√∂sisch) and which were built in the west coast and in the Baie des Veys, on the east coast, the Cotentin has become a peninsula. The C√¥te des Havres lies between the Cape of Carteret and the Cape of Granville. To the northwest, there are two sand dune systems: one stretching between Siouville-Hague and Vauville, the other one stretching between Cap of Carteret and Baubigny. History Roman Armorica =Roman Armorica= The peninsula formed part of the Roman geographical area of Armorica. The town known today as Coutances, capital of the Unelli, a Gaulish tribe, acquired the name of Constantia in 298 during the reign of Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus. The base of the peninsula, called in Latin the pagus Constantinus, joined together with the pagus Coriovallensis centred upon Cherbourg to the north, subsequently became known as the Cotentin. Under the Carolingians it was administered by viscounts drawn successively from members of the Saint-Sauveur family, at their seat Saint-Sauveur on the Douve.P. Chesnel, Le Cotentin et l'Avranchin sous les ducs de Normandie, 911-1204, 1912, noted in C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:51ff and map, xviii; there were two brief interludes when it was declared a countship. =Medieval history= King Alan the Great of Brittany (d. 907) waged war successfully on the Norsemen. As the result of his conquests, the Cotentin Peninsula was included theoretically in the territory of the Duchy of Brittany, after the Treaty of Compi√®gne (867) with the king of the Franks. The Dukes of Brittany suffered continuing Norse invasions and Norman raids, and Brittany lost the Cotentin Peninsula (and Avranchin nearby) after only 70 years of political domination. Meanwhile, Vikings settled on the Cotentin in the ninth and tenth centuries. There are indications of a whaling industry there dating to the ninth century, possibly introduced by Norsemen. They were followed by Anglo-Norse and Anglo-Danish people, who established themselves as farmers. The Cotentin became part of Normandy in the early tenth century. Many placenames there are derived from the Norse language. Examples include La Hague, from hagi (\\"meadow\\" or \\"enclosure\\"), and La Hougue, from haugr (\\"hill\\" or \\"mound\\").Twelve essential old Scandinavian words (old Norse) in placenames of Normandy (R. Lepelley. Caen University) Other names are typical: all those ending with -tot (Quettetot..) from topt \\"site of a house\\" (modern -toft), -bec (Bricquebec, Houlbec..) from bekkr \\"brook\\", \\"stream\\", etc. In 1088 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, enfeoffed the Cotentin to his brother Henry, who later became king of England. Henry, as count of the Cotentin, established his first power base there and in the adjoining Avranchin, which lay to the south, beyond the River Thar.Hollister 2001: ff. During the Hundred Years War, King Edward III of England landed in the bay of La Hougue, and then went to the Church of Quettehou in Val de Saire. It was there that Edward III knighted his son Edward, the Black Prince. A remembrance plaque can be seen next to the altar. =Modern history= D-Day assault map of Normandy and northwest coastal France The naval Battle of La Hogue in 1692 was fought off Saint-Vaast-la- Hougue near Barfleur. The town of Valognes was, until the French Revolution, a provincial social resort for the aristocracy, nicknamed the Versailles of Normandy. The social scene was described in the novels of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly (himself from the Cotentin). Little now remains of the grand houses and ch√¢teaus; they were destroyed by combat there during the Battle of Normandy in World War II. During World War II, part of the 1944 Battle of Normandy was fought in the Cotentin. The westernmost part of the D-Day landings was at Utah Beach, on the southeastern coast of the peninsula, and was followed by a campaign to occupy the peninsula and take Cherbourg. The genetic history of the modern inhabitants of Cotentin Peninsula is being studied by the University of Leicester to determine the extent of Scandinavian ancestry in Normandy. Economy The peninsula's main economic resource is agriculture. Dairy and vegetable farming are prominent activities, as well as aquaculture of oysters and mussels along the coast. Cider and calvados are produced from locally grown apples and pears. The region hosts two important nuclear power facilities. At Flamanville there is a nuclear power plant, and the La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant is located a few miles to the north, at Beaumont-Hague. The facility stores all high-level waste from the French nuclear power program in one large vault. Nuclear industry provides a substantial portion of jobs in the region. The roads used for transport of nuclear waste have been blocked many times in the past by environmental action group Greenpeace. Local environmental groups have voiced concerns about the radioactivity levels of the cooling water of both these nuclear sites, which is being flushed into the bay of Vauville; however, the emitted radioactivity is several orders of magnitude below natural background levels and does not pose any hazard. There are two important naval shipyards in Cherbourg. The state-owned shipyard Naval Group has built French nuclear submarines since the 1960s. Privately owned CMN builds frigates and patrol vessels for various states, mostly from the Middle East. Tourism is also an important economic activity in this region. Many tourists visit the D-Day invasion beaches, including Utah Beach in the Cotentin. At Sainte-M√®re-√âglise a few miles away from the beach, there is a museum commemorating the action of the 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division. The Cit√© de la Mer in Cherbourg is a museum of oceanic and underseas subjects. The main attraction is Redoutable, the first French nuclear submarine, launched in 1967. Culture After quitting political life, the political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859) retreated to the family estate of Tocqueville where he wrote much of his work. Due to its comparative isolation, the peninsula is one of the remaining strongholds of the Norman language, and the local dialect is known as Cotentinais. The Norman language poet C√¥tis-Capel (1915-1986) described the environment of the peninsula, while French language poet Jacques Pr√©vert made his home at Omonville-la-Petite. The painter Jean-Fran√ßois Millet (1814-1875) was also born on the peninsula. The Norman language writer Alfred Rossel, native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel's song Sus la m√© (\\"on the sea\\") is often sung as a regional patriotic song.

It was introduced by Kurt G√∂del in his 1938 paper \\"The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum- Hypothesis\\".G√∂del 1938. In this, he proved that the constructible universe is an inner model of ZF set theory, and also that the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis are true in the constructible universe. This shows that both propositions are consistent with the basic axioms of set theory, if ZF itself is consistent. Since many other theorems only hold in systems in which one or both of the propositions is true, their consistency is an important result. What is can be thought of as being built in \\"stages\\" resembling the von Neumann universe, . The stages are indexed by ordinals. In von Neumann's universe, at a successor stage, one takes to be the set of all subsets of the previous stage, . By contrast, in G√∂del's constructible universe , one uses only those subsets of the previous stage that are: *definable by a formula in the formal language of set theory, *with parameters from the previous stage and, *with the quantifiers interpreted to range over the previous stage. By limiting oneself to sets defined only in terms of what has already been constructed, one ensures that the resulting sets will be constructed in a way that is independent of the peculiarities of the surrounding model of set theory and contained in any such model. Define L is defined by transfinite recursion as follows: * L_{0} := \\\\varnothing. * L_{\\\\alpha + 1} := \\\\operatorname{Def}(L_\\\\alpha). * If \\\\lambda is a limit ordinal, then L_{\\\\lambda} := \\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha < \\\\lambda} L_{\\\\alpha}. Here < means precedes . * L := \\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Ord}} L_{\\\\alpha}. Here Ord denotes the class of all ordinals. If is an element of , then = {  ‚àà and ‚àà } ‚àà Def () = . So is a subset of , which is a subset of the power set of . Consequently, this is a tower of nested transitive sets. But itself is a proper class. The elements of are called \\"constructible\\" sets; and itself is the \\"constructible universe\\". The \\"axiom of constructibility\\", aka \\" = \\", says that every set (of ) is constructible, i.e. in . Additional facts about the sets  An equivalent definition for is: For any finite ordinal , the sets and are the same (whether equals or not), and thus = : their elements are exactly the hereditarily finite sets. Equality beyond this point does not hold. Even in models of ZFC in which equals , is a proper subset of , and thereafter is a proper subset of the power set of for all > . On the other hand, = does imply that equals if = , for example if is inaccessible. More generally, = implies = for all infinite cardinals . If is an infinite ordinal then there is a bijection between and , and the bijection is constructible. So these sets are equinumerous in any model of set theory that includes them. As defined above, Def() is the set of subsets of defined by Œî formulas (that is, formulas of set theory containing only bounded quantifiers) that use as parameters only and its elements. Another definition, due to G√∂del, characterizes each as the intersection of the power set of with the closure of L_\\\\alpha\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{L_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} under a collection of nine explicit functions, similar to G√∂del operations. This definition makes no reference to definability. All arithmetical subsets of and relations on belong to (because the arithmetic definition gives one in ). Conversely, any subset of belonging to is arithmetical (because elements of can be coded by natural numbers in such a way that ‚àà is definable, i.e., arithmetic). On the other hand, already contains certain non-arithmetical subsets of , such as the set of (natural numbers coding) true arithmetical statements (this can be defined from so it is in ). All hyperarithmetical subsets of and relations on belong to L_{\\\\omega_1^{\\\\mathrm{CK}}} (where \\\\omega_1^{\\\\mathrm{CK}} stands for the Church‚ÄìKleene ordinal), and conversely any subset of that belongs to L_{\\\\omega_1^{\\\\mathrm{CK}}} is hyperarithmetical.Barwise 1975, page 60 (comment following proof of theorem 5.9)  is a standard inner model of ZFC  is a standard model, i.e. it is a transitive class and it uses the real element relationship, so it is well-founded. is an inner model, i.e. it contains all the ordinal numbers of and it has no \\"extra\\" sets beyond those in , but it might be a proper subclass of . is a model of ZFC, which means that it satisfies the following axioms: * Axiom of regularity: Every non-empty set contains some element such that and are disjoint sets. : (,‚àà) is a substructure of (,‚àà), which is well founded, so is well founded. In particular, if ‚àà ‚àà , then by the transitivity of , ‚àà . If we use this same as in , then it is still disjoint from because we are using the same element relation and no new sets were added. * Axiom of extensionality: Two sets are the same if they have the same elements. : If and are in and they have the same elements in , then by 's transitivity, they have the same elements (in ). So they are equal (in and thus in ). * Axiom of empty set: {} is a set. : {} = = {  ‚àà and =} ‚àà . So {} ‚àà . Since the element relation is the same and no new elements were added, this is the empty set of . * Axiom of pairing: If , are sets, then {,} is a set. : If ‚àà and ‚àà , then there is some ordinal such that ‚àà and ‚àà. Then {,} = {  ‚àà and ( = or = )} ‚àà . Thus {,} ‚àà and it has the same meaning for as for . * Axiom of union: For any set there is a set whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of . : If ‚àà , then its elements are in and their elements are also in . So is a subset of . = {  ‚àà and there exists ‚àà such that ‚àà } ‚àà . Thus ‚àà . * Axiom of infinity: There exists a set such that {} is in and whenever is in , so is the union y \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ y \\\\\\\\}. : From transfinite induction, we get that each ordinal ‚àà . In particular, ‚àà and thus ‚àà . * Axiom of separation: Given any set and any proposition (,,...,), {  ‚àà and (,,...,)} is a set. : By induction on subformulas of , one can show that there is an such that contains and ,..., and ( is true in if and only if is true in (this is called the \\"reflection principle\\")). So {  ‚àà and (,,...,) holds in } = {  ‚àà and ‚àà and (,,...,) holds in } ‚àà . Thus the subset is in . * Axiom of replacement: Given any set and any mapping (formally defined as a proposition (,) where (,) and P(,) implies = ), {  there exists ‚àà such that (,)} is a set. : Let (,) be the formula that relativizes to , i.e. all quantifiers in are restricted to . is a much more complex formula than , but it is still a finite formula, and since was a mapping over , must be a mapping over ; thus we can apply replacement in to . So {  ‚àà and there exists ‚àà such that (,) holds in } = {  there exists ‚àà such that (,)} is a set in and a subclass of . Again using the axiom of replacement in , we can show that there must be an such that this set is a subset of ‚àà . Then one can use the axiom of separation in to finish showing that it is an element of . * Axiom of power set: For any set there exists a set , such that the elements of are precisely the subsets of . : In general, some subsets of a set in will not be in . So the whole power set of a set in will usually not be in . What we need here is to show that the intersection of the power set with is in . Use replacement in to show that there is an Œ± such that the intersection is a subset of . Then the intersection is {  ‚àà and is a subset of } ‚àà . Thus the required set is in . * Axiom of choice: Given a set of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, there is a set (a choice set for ) containing exactly one element from each member of . : One can show that there is a definable well-ordering of which definition works the same way in itself. So one chooses the least element of each member of to form using the axioms of union and separation in . Notice that the proof that is a model of ZFC only requires that be a model of ZF, i.e. we do not assume that the axiom of choice holds in .  is absolute and minimal  If is any standard model of ZF sharing the same ordinals as , then the defined in is the same as the defined in . In particular, is the same in and , for any ordinal . And the same formulas and parameters in Def () produce the same constructible sets in . Furthermore, since is a subclass of and, similarly, is a subclass of , is the smallest class containing all the ordinals that is a standard model of ZF. Indeed, is the intersection of all such classes. If there is a set in that is a standard model of ZF, and the ordinal is the set of ordinals that occur in , then is the of . If there is a set that is a standard model of ZF, then the smallest such set is such a . This set is called the minimal model of ZFC. Using the downward L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem, one can show that the minimal model (if it exists) is a countable set. Of course, any consistent theory must have a model, so even within the minimal model of set theory there are sets that are models of ZF (assuming ZF is consistent). However, those set models are non-standard. In particular, they do not use the normal element relation and they are not well founded. Because both the of and the of are the real and both the of and the of are the real , we get that = is true in and in any that is a model of ZF. However, = does not hold in any other standard model of ZF. = and large cardinals = Since Ord ‚äÇ ‚äÜ , properties of ordinals that depend on the absence of a function or other structure (i.e. Œ† formulas) are preserved when going down from to . Hence initial ordinals of cardinals remain initial in . Regular ordinals remain regular in . Weak limit cardinals become strong limit cardinals in because the generalized continuum hypothesis holds in . Weakly inaccessible cardinals become strongly inaccessible. Weakly Mahlo cardinals become strongly Mahlo. And more generally, any large cardinal property weaker than 0 (see the list of large cardinal properties) will be retained in . However, 0 is false in even if true in . So all the large cardinals whose existence implies 0 cease to have those large cardinal properties, but retain the properties weaker than 0 which they also possess. For example, measurable cardinals cease to be measurable but remain Mahlo in . If 0 holds in , then there is a closed unbounded class of ordinals that are indiscernible in . While some of these are not even initial ordinals in , they have all the large cardinal properties weaker than 0 in . Furthermore, any strictly increasing class function from the class of indiscernibles to itself can be extended in a unique way to an elementary embedding of into . This gives a nice structure of repeating segments.  can be well-ordered  There are various ways of well-ordering . Some of these involve the \\"fine structure\\" of , which was first described by Ronald Bjorn Jensen in his 1972 paper entitled \\"The fine structure of the constructible hierarchy\\". Instead of explaining the fine structure, we will give an outline of how could be well- ordered using only the definition given above. Suppose and are two different sets in and we wish to determine whether < or > . If first appears in and first appears in and is different from , then let < if and only if < . Henceforth, we suppose that = . The stage = Def () uses formulas with parameters from to define the sets and . If one discounts (for the moment) the parameters, the formulas can be given a standard G√∂del numbering by the natural numbers. If is the formula with the smallest G√∂del number that can be used to define , and is the formula with the smallest G√∂del number that can be used to define , and is different from , then let < if and only if < in the G√∂del numbering. Henceforth, we suppose that = . Suppose that uses parameters from . Suppose ,..., is the sequence of parameters that can be used with to define , and ,..., does the same for . Then let < if and only if either < or ( = and < ) or (zn=wn and = and < ) etc. This is called the reverse lexicographic ordering; if there are multiple sequences of parameters that define one of the sets, we choose the least one under this ordering. It being understood that each parameter's possible values are ordered according to the restriction of the ordering of to , so this definition involves transfinite recursion on . The well-ordering of the values of single parameters is provided by the inductive hypothesis of the transfinite induction. The values of -tuples of parameters are well-ordered by the product ordering. The formulas with parameters are well-ordered by the ordered sum (by G√∂del numbers) of well-orderings. And is well-ordered by the ordered sum (indexed by ) of the orderings on . Notice that this well-ordering can be defined within itself by a formula of set theory with no parameters, only the free-variables and . And this formula gives the same truth value regardless of whether it is evaluated in , , or (some other standard model of ZF with the same ordinals) and we will suppose that the formula is false if either or is not in . It is well known that the axiom of choice is equivalent to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class (as we have done here with ) is equivalent to the axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary axiom of choice because it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.  has a reflection principle Proving that the axiom of separation, axiom of replacement, and axiom of choice hold in requires (at least as shown above) the use of a reflection principle for . Here we describe such a principle. By induction on < , we can use ZF in to prove that for any ordinal , there is an ordinal > such that for any sentence (,...,) with ,..., in and containing fewer than symbols (counting a constant symbol for an element of as one symbol) we get that (,...,) holds in if and only if it holds in .  The generalized continuum hypothesis holds in  Let S \\\\in L_\\\\alpha , and let be any constructible subset of . Then there is some with T \\\\in L_{\\\\beta+1}, so for some formula and some z_i drawn from L_\\\\beta. By the downward L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem and Mostowski collapse, there must be some transitive set containing L_\\\\alpha and some w_i, and having the same first- order theory as L_\\\\beta with the w_i substituted for the z_i; and this will have the same cardinal as L_\\\\alpha. Since V = L is true in L_\\\\beta, it is also true in , so K = L_\\\\gamma for some having the same cardinal as . And T = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in L_\\\\beta : x \\\\in S \\\\wedge \\\\Phi(x, z_i)\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in L_\\\\gamma : x \\\\in S \\\\wedge \\\\Phi(x, w_i)\\\\\\\\} because L_\\\\beta and L_\\\\gamma have the same theory. So is in fact in L_{\\\\gamma+1}. So all the constructible subsets of an infinite set have ranks with (at most) the same cardinal as the rank of ; it follows that if is the initial ordinal for , then L \\\\cap \\\\mathcal{P}(S) \\\\subseteq L_\\\\delta serves as the \\"power set\\" of within . Thus this \\"power set\\" L \\\\cap \\\\mathcal{P}(S) \\\\in L_{\\\\delta+1}. And this in turn means that the \\"power set\\" of has cardinal at most . Assuming itself has cardinal , the \\"power set\\" must then have cardinal exactly . But this is precisely the generalized continuum hypothesis relativized to .  Constructible sets are definable from the ordinals  There is a formula of set theory that expresses the idea that = . It has only free variables for and . Using this we can expand the definition of each constructible set. If ‚àà , then = {  ‚àà and (,,...,) holds in (,‚àà)} for some formula and some ,..., in . This is equivalent to saying that: for all , ‚àà if and only if [there exists such that = and ‚àà and (,,,...,)] where (,...) is the result of restricting each quantifier in (...) to . Notice that each ‚àà for some < . Combine formulas for the 's with the formula for and apply existential quantifiers over the 's outside and one gets a formula that defines the constructible set using only the ordinals that appear in expressions like = as parameters. Example: The set {5,} is constructible. It is the unique set that satisfies the formula: where Ord (a) is short for: Actually, even this complex formula has been simplified from what the instructions given in the first paragraph would yield. But the point remains, there is a formula of set theory that is true only for the desired constructible set and that contains parameters only for ordinals. Relative constructibility Sometimes it is desirable to find a model of set theory that is narrow like , but that includes or is influenced by a set that is not constructible. This gives rise to the concept of relative constructibility, of which there are two flavors, denoted by () and []. The class () for a non- constructible set is the intersection of all classes that are standard models of set theory and contain and all the ordinals. () is defined by transfinite recursion as follows: *() = the smallest transitive set containing as an element, i.e. the transitive closure of . *() = Def (()) *If is a limit ordinal, then L_{\\\\lambda}(A) = \\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha < \\\\lambda} L_{\\\\alpha}(A) \\\\\\\\! . *L(A) = \\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha} L_{\\\\alpha}(A) \\\\\\\\! . If () contains a well-ordering of the transitive closure of {}, then this can be extended to a well-ordering of (). Otherwise, the axiom of choice will fail in (). A common example is L(\\\\mathbb{R}), the smallest model that contains all the real numbers, which is used extensively in modern descriptive set theory. The class [] is the class of sets whose construction is influenced by , where may be a (presumably non- constructible) set or a proper class. The definition of this class uses Def (), which is the same as Def () except instead of evaluating the truth of formulas in the model (,‚àà), one uses the model (,‚àà,) where is a unary predicate. The intended interpretation of () is ‚àà . Then the definition of [] is exactly that of only with Def replaced by Def. [] is always a model of the axiom of choice. Even if is a set, is not necessarily itself a member of [], although it always is if is a set of ordinals. The sets in () or [] are usually not actually constructible, and the properties of these models may be quite different from the properties of itself.

High- altitude military parachuting (or military free fall (MFF)) is a method of delivering military personnel, military equipment, and other military supplies from a transport aircraft at a high altitude via free-fall parachute insertion. Two techniques are used: HALO (high altitude ‚Äì low opening, often called a HALO jump) and HAHO (high altitude ‚Äì high opening). In the HALO technique, the parachutist opens the parachute at a low altitude after free- falling for a period of time, while in the HAHO technique, the parachutist opens the parachute at a high altitude just a few seconds after jumping from the aircraft. Although HALO techniques were first developed in the 1960s for military uses, in recent years HALO parachute designs have been more widely used in non-military applications, including as a form of skydiving. In military operations, HALO is also used for delivering equipment, supplies, or personnel, while HAHO is generally used exclusively for personnel. In typical HALO/HAHO insertions the troops jump from altitudes between and .  High Altitude Low Opening ‚Äì HALO  The origins of the HALO technique date back to 1960 when the United States Air Force began conducting experiments that followed earlier work by Colonel John Stapp in the late 1940s through early 1950s on survivability for pilots ejecting at high altitude. Stapp, a research biophysicist and medical doctor, used himself in rocket sled tests to study the effects of very high g-forces. Stapp also solved many of the problems of high-altitude flight in his earliest work for the Air Force and subjected himself to exposure to altitudes of up to . He later helped develop pressure suits and ejection seats, which have been used in jets ever since. As part of the experiments, on August 16, 1960, Colonel Joseph Kittinger performed the first high-altitude jump at above the Earth's surface. Kittinger's friend and United States Naval Parachute Test Jumper Joe Crotwell was also among the consultants and test jumpers of the original program. The first time the technique was used for combat was during the Vietnam War in Laos by members of MACV-SOG. SEAL Teams of the United States Navy expanded the HALO technique to include delivery of boats and other large items. The technique is used to airdrop supplies, equipment, or personnel at high altitudes, where aircraft can fly above surface-to-air missile (SAM) engagement levels through enemy skies without posing a threat to the transport or load. In the event that anti-aircraft cannons are active near the drop zone, the HALO technique also minimizes the parachutist's exposure to flak. For military cargo airdrops, the rigged load is cut free and rolls out of the plane as a result of gravity. The load then proceeds to fall under canopy to a designated drop zone. In a typical HALO exercise, the parachutist will jump from the aircraft, free-fall for a period of time at terminal velocity, and open his or her parachute at an altitude as low as 3,000 feet AGL depending on the mission. The combination of high downward speed, minimal forward airspeed, and the use of only small amounts of metal helps to defeat radar and reduces the amount of time a parachute might be visible to ground observers, enabling a stealthy insertion.  High Altitude High Opening ‚Äì HAHO  The HAHO technique is used to airdrop personnel at high altitudes when aircraft are unable to fly above enemy skies without posing a threat to the jumpers. In addition, HAHO parachute jumps are employed in the covert insertion of military personnel (generally special operations forces) into enemy territory, in circumstances where the covert nature of an operation may be compromised by the loud noise of parachutes opening at low altitude. HAHO jumps also allow a longer travel distance due to increased under-canopy time, allowing travelling distances of more than 40 miles (64 km). In a typical HAHO exercise, the jumper will jump from the aircraft and deploy the parachute at a high altitude, 10-15 seconds after the jump (typically at or so). The jumper will use a compass or GPS device for guidance while flying for 30 or more miles (48+ kilometres). The jumper must use way points and terrain features to navigate to their desired landing zone, and correct their course to account for changes in wind speed and direction. If deploying as a team, the team will form up in a stack while airborne with their parachutes. Usually, the jumper in the lowest position will set the travel course and act as a guide for the other team members. Whilst in the British Special Forces (22 SAS), due to his extensive skydiving background, Charles \\"Nish\\" Bruce was pivotal in the original trials and development of the HAHO tactic now routinely used as a conflict insert for special forces.John Geddes, Highway to Hell (An SAS Veteran's Bloody Account on the Private Army in Iraq) ‚Äì Arrow Books, Random House, 2007, page 180. .  Health risks  All types of parachuting techniques are dangerous, but HALO/HAHO carry special risks. At high altitudes (greater than 22,000 feet, or 6,700 m), the partial pressure of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere is low. Oxygen is required for human respiration and lack of pressure can lead to hypoxia. Also, rapid ascent in the jump aircraft without all nitrogen flushed from the bloodstream can lead to decompression sickness, also known as caisson disease or \\"the bends\\". A typical HALO exercise will require a pre-breathing period (30‚Äì45 minutes) prior to jump where the jumper breathes 100% oxygen in order to flush nitrogen from their bloodstream. Also, a HALO jumper will employ an oxygen bottle during the jump. Danger can come from medical conditions affecting the jumper. For example, cigarette smoking, alcohol and drug use (including antihistamines, sedatives, and analgesics), anemia, carbon monoxide, fatigue and anxiety can all lead to a jumper being more susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, problems with the oxygen bottle and during the changeover from the pre-breather to the oxygen bottle can result in the return of nitrogen to the jumper's bloodstream and, therefore, an increased likelihood of decompression sickness. A jumper suffering from hypoxia may lose consciousness and therefore be unable to open his parachute. A jumper suffering from decompression sickness may die or become permanently disabled from nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream, which causes inflammation of joints. Another risk is from the low ambient temperatures prevalent at higher altitudes. At an altitude of 35,000 feet, the jumper faces temperatures of ‚Äì45 ¬∞C (‚Äì50 ¬∞F), and can experience frostbite. However, HALO jumpers generally wear polypropylene knit undergarments and other warm clothing under a windproof shell to prevent this. HALO carries the additional risk that if the parachute fails to deploy or lines become tangled, there is less time to resort to the reserve (back-up parachute) or untangle the lines.  Example of use  * The first combat high-altitude jump took place during the Vietnam War, when a six-man team called SOG Recon Team Florida parachuted from 18,000 feet (5,500 m) into Laos. * In 1997, BJ Worth, a professional stuntman doubling as James Bond, is shown in the film Tomorrow Never Dies performing a HALO jump.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120347/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#casthttps://jamesbond007.se/eng/artiklar/stuntman- som-james-bondhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TAp1Wn782w * In November 2001, a small team of U.S. troops from the 75th Ranger Regiment Regimental Reconnaissance Company freefall parachuted into Afghanistan in order to establish a landing strip. * In 2002, United States Air Force Pararescue jumpers conducted a HALO jump in Afghanistan as a means of reaching a gravely wounded member of the Australian Special Air Service who was stranded in a minefield. * Free fall parachute insertions were utilized during Operation Iraqi Freedom, as a means of bypassing enemy early warning systems. * In 2009, during the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips off the coast of Somalia, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs carried out a nighttime HALO jump into the sea in order to reach the USS Bainbridge which was towing a lifeboat containing Philips' hostage takers. * In 2012, U.S. Navy SEALs used the technique to insert into Somalia to rescue two hostages being held by pirates near the town of Adow. * Tom Cruise became the first actor to perform a HALO jump on camera for the 2018 film Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout. *in April 2020, military personnel from the Russian Airborne Forces, by the order of the Minister of Defence, Sergey Shoygu, performed the world's first HALO paradrop from the lower border of the Arctic stratosphere. The Russian commando group used \\"next-generation special-purpose parachute system\\", military tested oxygen equipment, navigation devices, special equipment, and uniforms while jumping from a high- flying transport plane, the Il-76 over the island of Alexandra Land located in Franz Josef Land archipelago.

The Empress Dowager Deng placed him on the throne when he was barely over 100 days old, despite his having an older brother, Liu Sheng (), whose age was unknown but was likely to be young as well. Empress Dowager Deng also kept Liu Hu (), the twelve-year-old cousin of Shangdi and future Emperor An of Han in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the baby emperor's death. Liu Hu ascended to the throne when Emperor Shang died in 106; however, Dowager Deng still remained as the regent for the teenager Emperor An. A decree by Empress Dowager Deng during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency. Early life Then-Prince Long was born in autumn 105 to Emperor He and a concubine whose identity is unknown. Because Emperor He had, during his reign, frequently lost sons due to illnesses in childhood, according to the superstitions of the time, both Prince Long and his older brother Prince Sheng were given to foster parents outside the palace to nurture. When Emperor He died early 106, his wife, Empress Deng Sui, retrieved the young princes back to the palace. Prince Sheng was older but regarded as frequently ill and unfit for the throne, for Empress Deng first created the infant Prince Long crown prince. The same night, he was proclaimed emperor with Empress Deng as Empress Dowager. Reign After Emperor Shang was proclaimed emperor, his brother Prince Sheng was created the Prince of Pingyuan. Concerned that Emperor Shang might not live long, Empress Dowager Deng also kept Liu Hu, the twelve-year old cousin of Emperor Shang and the future Emperor An of Han in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the infant emperor's death. (Prince Hu was the son of Prince Qing of Qinghe‚Äîwho was once a crown prince under Emperor He's father Emperor Zhang but was deposed due to machinations of Emperor Zhang's wife Empress Dou. Therefore, he was viewed by some as the rightful heir.) As Emperor Shang was an infant, actual and formal power were in Empress Deng's hands. Her brother Deng Zhi () became the most powerful official in the imperial government. She issued a general pardon, which benefitted the people who had had rights stripped from them for associating with the family of Empress Dou. = Death = Late in 106, Emperor Shang died. The officials had by this time realized that Prince Sheng, his older brother, was not as ill as originally thought, and wanted to make him emperor. However, Empress Dowager Deng was concerned that he might bear a grudge at not being made emperor before his brother, and therefore insisted on making Emperor Shang's cousin Prince Hu emperor instead, and he took the throne as Emperor An. Emperor Shang, having died as a toddler, was not given a separate tomb, as is customary for emperors. Rather, in order to avoid unnecessary expenses, he was buried in the same tomb complex as his father Emperor He.

(video) Two shots of the gate followed by a shot of inside Tiananmen Square next to the gate, 2017. The Tiananmen (also Tian'anmen, Tienanmen, T‚Äôien-an Men) (), or the The Gate of Heavenly Peace, is a monumental gate in the city center of Beijing, China and the front gate of the Imperial City of Beijing, located near the city's Central Business District, and widely used as a national symbol. First built during the Ming dynasty in 1420, Tiananmen was the entrance to the Imperial City, within which the Forbidden City was located. Tiananmen is located to the north of Tiananmen Square, and is separated from the plaza by Chang'an Avenue.  Name  The Chinese name of the gate (/), is made up of the Chinese characters for \\"heaven\\", \\"peace\\" and \\"gate\\" respectively, which is why the name is conventionally translated as \\"Gate of Heavenly Peace\\". However, this translation is somewhat misleading, since the Chinese name is derived from the much longer phrase \\"receiving the mandate from heaven, and pacifying the dynasty\\". ().Lu Bingjie, Tian'anmen (Jinan: Shandong huabao chubanshe, 2004) p. 40. The Manchu translation, Abkai elhe obure duka, lies closer to the original meaning of the gate and can be literally translated as the \\"Gate of Heavenly Peacemaking\\".Cf. Erich Hauer. \\"Why the Sinologue Should Study Manchu.\\" Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society 61 (1930): 156-64. The gate had a counterpart in the northern end of the imperial city called the Di'anmen (, D√¨'ƒÅnm√©n; Manchu: Na i elhe obure duka), which may be roughly translated as the \\"Gate of Earthly Peace\\".  Gate  = History = The gate was originally named \\"Chengtianmen\\" (), or \\"Gate of Accepting Heavenly Mandate\\" in the Ming Dynasty. It has subsequently been destroyed and rebuilt several times. The original building was first constructed in 1420, and was based on an eponymous gate of an imperial building in Nanking. The gate was completely burned down by lightning in July 1457. In 1465, the Chenghua Emperor ordered Zigui (), the Minister of Works, to rebuild the gate. Thus, the design was changed from the original paifang form to the gatehouse that is seen today. It suffered another blow in the war at the end of the Ming dynasty, when in 1644 the gate was burnt down by rebels led by Li Zicheng. Following the establishment of the Qing dynasty and the Manchu conquest of China proper, the gate was once again rebuilt, beginning in 1645, and was given its present name upon completion in 1651. The gate was reconstructed again between 1969 and 1970. The gate as it stood was by then 300 years old, and had badly deteriorated, partly due to heavy usage in the 1950s and 1960s. As the gate was a national symbol, Zhou Enlai ordered that the rebuilding was to be kept secret. The whole gate was covered in scaffolding, and the project was officially called a \\"renovation\\". The rebuilding aimed to leave the gate's external appearance unchanged while both making it more resistant to earthquakes and installing modern facilities such as an elevator, water supply, and heating system.Xinhua News Agency, Secret reconstruction of Tiananmen 35 years ago, 04/21/05 = Description = Stone column (huabiao) with depiction of dragons and phoenixes decorates the surroundings of the Tiananmen gate. The building is long, wide and high. Like other official buildings of the empire, the gate itself has unique imperial roof decorations. Two lions stand in front of the gate, and two more guard the bridges. In Chinese culture, lions are believed to protect humans from evil spirits. Two stone columns, called huabiao, each with an animal (hou) on top of it, also stand in front of the gate. Originally, these installations were designed for commoners to address their grievances by either writing or sticking petitions on the columns. However, the examples in front of the Imperial City were purely decorative, and instead connoted the majesty of the imperial government. The western and eastern walls have giant placards; the left one reads \\"Long Live the People's Republic of China\\" (), while the right one reads \\"Long Live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples\\". The right placard used to read \\"Long Live the Central People's Government\\"Meng Zhaorui, , p. 133 () for the founding ceremony of the PRC, but after the ceremony it was changed to \\"Long Live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples\\" (). Both placards were changed to use simplified Chinese instead of traditional Chinese characters in 1964. The phrasing has significant symbolic meaning, as the phrase used for long live, like the Imperial City itself, was traditionally reserved for Emperors of China, but is now available to the common people. The reviewing stands in the foreground are used on International Workers Day (May Day) and on the National Day (October 1) of the People's Republic of China. In front of the stands is the Imperial City's moat, still filled with water but now containing decorative illuminated fountains. In ancient times, the Tiananmen was among the most important gates encountered when entering Beijing's Imperial City along with the Yongdingmen, Qianmen, the Gate of China. Proceeding further inward, the next gate is the 'Upright Gate', identical in design to the Tian'anmen; behind it is the southern entrance of the Forbidden City itself, known as the Meridian Gate.  Portrait  = History = Portrait of Chiang Kai-shek on Tiananmen in Beijing, Republic of China Portrait of Joseph Stalin put up after his death, 1953 Portrait of Mao Zedong at the Tiananmen gate made by Ge Xiaoguang Because of the gate's position at the front of the Imperial City, and the historical events that have taken place on Tiananmen Square, the gate has great political significance. In 1925, when China was ruled by the Nationalist government, a large portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung at the gate after his death. In 1945, to celebrate the victory over Japan, Chiang Kai-shek's portrait was hung.NYtimes. \\"NYtimes.com.\\" Chameleon Mao, the face of Tiananmen square. Retrieved on 2011-04-11. On July 7, 1949, portraits of Zhu De and Mao Zedong were hung to commemorate the Second Sino-Japanese War. Since the founding date of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, a singular portrait of Mao has been hung on the gate. The portrait is replaced annually before National Day. On only one occasion, on March 9, 1953, it was temporarily replaced by a portrait of Joseph Stalin to commemorate his death. In 2011, Alexander Pann Han-tang, chairman of the Asia Pacific Taiwan Federation of Industry and Commerce, and a close friend of Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, proposed that the picture of Sun Yat-sen be displayed at Tiananmen Square instead for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. However, this proposal was rejected. = Incidents = The portrait weighs , and is replaced by a spare whenever it is vandalized.Foster, Peter. Chinese protestor throws ink at portrait of Chairman Mao. The Daily Telegraph. 8 April 2010. In 1989, three dissidents, including Yu Dongyue, attacked the portrait with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Yu was sent to prison, and was not released until 17 years later in 2006. On May 12, 2007, the portrait of Mao caught fire. A 35-year-old unemployed man from Urumqi was arrested for the incident. About 15% of the portrait was damaged, and had to be repaired later. On April 5, 2010, a protester threw ink in a plastic bottle and hit a wall near the portrait. He was then arrested.  National symbol  Due to its historical significance, Tiananmen is featured on the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China. It has also been featured in the designs of stamps and coins issued by the People's Republic of China.

As the defining conception of the state, it was first described in sociology by Max Weber in his essay Politics as a Vocation (1919).Max Weber, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Books, 2015, pp. 129-198. Weber claims that the state is the \\"only human Gemeinschaft which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated use of physical force. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state.\\"Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. Palgrave Books 2015, p. 136 In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize physical force against residents of its territory. Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of legitimation. Max Weber's theory Max Weber wrote in Politics as a Vocation that a fundamental characteristic of statehood is the claim of such a monopoly. His expanded definition was that something is \\"a 'state' if and insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds a claim on the 'monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force' () in the enforcement of its order.\\"Weber, Max. Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (1921). p. 29 Weber's concept has been formalized to show that the exclusive policing power of the state benefits social welfare via private property, provided the state acts benevolently in the interest of its citizens.K. Grechenig, M. Kolmar, The State's Enforcement Monopoly and the Private Protection of Property, Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) 2014, vol. 170 (1), 5-23. According to Weber, the state is that \\"human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of violence within a given territory.\\" The public police and military are its main instruments, but private security might also be considered to have \\"the 'right' to use violence\\" so long as the sole source of this perceived right is state sanction. Weber applied several caveats to his discussion of the state's monopoly of violence: * He intended the statement as a contemporary observation, noting that the connection between the state and the use of physical force has not always been so close. He uses the examples of feudalism, where private warfare was permitted under certain conditions, and of religious courts, which had sole jurisdiction over some types of offenses, especially heresy and sex crimes (thus the nickname \\"bawdy courts\\"). Regardless, the state exists wherever a single authority can legitimately authorize violence. * For the same reasons, the \\"monopoly\\" does not mean that only the government may use physical force, but that the state is that human community that successfully claims for itself to be the only source of legitimacy for all physical coercion or adjudication of coercion. For example, the law might permit individuals to use force in defense of one's self or property, but this right derives from the state's authority. This conflicts directly with enlightenment principles of individual sovereignty that delegates power to the state by consent, and concepts of natural law that hold that individual rights deriving from sapient self-ownership preexist the state and are only recognised and guaranteed by the state which may be restricted from limiting them by constitutional law. = Criticisms of Weber = Robert Hinrichs Bates argues that the state itself has no violent power; rather, the people hold all the power of coercion to ensure that order and other equilibriums hold up. The implication of this is that there is a frontier of well-being in stateless societies, that can only be surpassed if some level of coercion or violence is used to elevate the complexity of the state. In other words, without investing in troops, police, or some sort of enforcement mechanism, early states cannot enjoy the law and order (or prosperity) of more developed states. Relation to state capacity  The capacity of a state is often measured in terms of its fiscal and legal capacity. Fiscal capacity meaning the state's ability to recover taxation to provide public goods, and legal capacity meaning the state's supremacy as sole arbiter of conflict resolution and contract enforcement. Without some sort of coercion, the state would not otherwise be able to enforce its legitimacy in its desired sphere of influence. In early and developing states, this role was often played by the \\"stationary bandit\\" who defended villagers from roving bandits, in the hope that the protection would incentivize villagers to invest in economic production, and the stationary bandit could eventually use its coercive power to expropriate some of that wealth. In regions where state presence is minimally felt, non-state actors can use their monopoly of violence to establish legitimacy and order. For example, the Sicilian Mafia originated as a protection racket providing buyers and sellers in the black market with protection. Without this type of enforcement, market participants would not be otherwise confident enough to trust their counter-parties for valid contract enforcement and the market would collapse. Even in illicit and underground markets (somewhat akin to stateless societies), violence is used to enforce contracts in the absence of accessible legal conflict resolution. Charles Tilly continues this comparison to say that warmaking and statemaking are actually the best representations of what organized crime can grow into.Tilly, Charles (1985). ‚ÄúWar making and state making as organized crime,‚Äù in Bringing the State Back In, eds P.B. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer, & T. Skocpol. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985. ‚Ä¢ Introduction and Chapt Other According to Raymond Aron, international relations are characterized by the absence of widely acknowledged legitimacy in the use of force between states.Raymond Aron. Paix et guerre entre les nations, Paris 1962; English: Peace and War, 1966. New edition 2003. Martha Lizabeth Phelps, writing in Politics & Policy, takes Weber's ideas on the legitimacy of private security a step further. Phelps claims that the use of private actors by the state remains legitimate if and only if military contractors are perceived as being controlled by the state.

It is celebrated on 15 August (28 August N.S. for those following the Julian Calendar) as the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on the Sunday nearest 15 August. The death or Dormition of Mary is not recorded in the Christian canonical scriptures. Hippolytus of Thebes, a 7th- or 8th- century author, claims in his partially preserved chronology to the New Testament that Mary lived for 11 years after the death of Jesus, dying in AD 41.. The term Dormition expresses the belief that the Virgin died without suffering, in a state of spiritual peace. This belief does not rest on any scriptural basis, but is affirmed by Orthodox Christian Holy Tradition. It is testified to in some old Apocryphal writings, but neither the Orthodox Church nor other Christians regard these as possessing scriptural authority. Dormition fast The Feast of the Dormition is preceded by a two-week fast, referred to as the Dormition Fast. From August 1 to August 14 (inclusive) Orthodox and Eastern Catholics fast from red meat, poultry, meat products, dairy products (eggs and milk products), fish, oil, and wine. The Dormition Fast is a stricter fast than either the Nativity Fast (Advent) or the Apostles' Fast, with only wine and oil (but no fish) allowed on weekends. As with the other Fasts of the Church year, there is a Great Feast that falls during the Fast; in this case, the Transfiguration (August 6), on which fish, wine and oil are allowed. In some places, the services on weekdays during the Dormition Fast are similar to the services during Great Lent (with some variations). Many churches and monasteries in the Russian tradition perform the lenten services on at least the first day of the Dormition Fast. In the Greek tradition, during the Fast either the Great Paraklesis (Supplicatory Canon) or the Small Paraklesis is celebrated every evening except Saturday evening and the Eves of the Transfiguration and the Dormition.Outside the Dormition Fast it is always the Small Supplicatory Canon (Paraklesis) which is chanted. During the Dormition Fast, however, the Typikon prescribes that the Small and Great Supplicatory Canons be chanted on alternate evenings: If August 1st falls on a Monday through Friday, the cycle begins with the Small Supplicatory Canon; if August 1st falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the cycle begins with the Great Supplicatory Canon. The first day of the Dormition Fast is a feast day called the Procession of the Cross (August 1), on which day it is customary to have an outdoor procession and perform the Lesser Blessing of Water. In Eastern Orthodoxy it is also the day of the Holy Seven Maccabees, Martyrs Abimus, Antonius, Gurias, Eleazar, Eusebonus, Alimus, and Marcellus, their mother Solomonia, and their teacher Eleazar. Therefore, the day is sometimes referred to as \\"Makovei\\". Finally it is also considered the First of the three \\"Feasts of the Saviour\\" in August, the Feast to the All-Merciful Saviour and the Most Holy Mother of God.Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church - Orthodox Calendar Significance of the feast In Orthodoxy and Catholicism, in the language of the scripture, death is often called a \\"sleeping\\" or \\"falling asleep\\" (Greek Œ∫ŒøŒØŒºŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ; whence Œ∫ŒøŒπŒºŒ∑œÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ > coemetƒìrium > cemetery, \\"a place of sleeping\\"). A prominent example of this is the name of this feast; another is the Dormition of Anna, Mary's mother. Origin and adoption of the tradition Icon of the Dormition by Theophan the Greek, 1392. The Theotokos is depicted lying on a bier, surrounded by the Twelve Apostles. At center, Jesus Christ is shown in a mandorla, swaddling the soul of the Virgin Mary (a red seraph is shown above his head). To either side of him are depicted the Hieromartyrs Dionysius the Areopagite and Ignatius the God-Bearer who, according to tradition, are responsible for transmitting the account of the dormition. =Related sites= The Dormition tradition is associated with various places, most notably with Jerusalem, which contains Mary's Tomb and the Basilica of the Dormition, and Ephesus, which contains the House of the Virgin Mary, and also with Constantinople where the Cincture of the Theotokos was enshrined from the 5th through 14th centuries. =1st‚Äì5th century= The first Christian centuries may be silent, but \\"The Dormition/Assumption of Mary\\" appears in a Greek document (attributed to John the Theologian) edited by Tischendorf published in The Ante-Nicene Fathers, dated by Tischendorf as no later than the 4th century.\\"Apocrypha of the New Testament\\", 'Intoductory Notice to the Apocrypha of the New Testament, Vol 8, The Ante-Nicene Fathers. Then there is the apocryphal literature such as the Protoevangelium of James, regarding the end of the Virgin Mary's life, though it is asserted, without surviving documentation, that the feast of the Dormition was being observed in Jerusalem shortly after the Council of Ephesus.A fairly representative example of mainstream Orthodox teaching is offered by Sophia Fotopoulou: \\"We have no historical data to indicate how long the Mother of God remained on earth after the ascension of Christ into heaven, nor when, where, or how she died, for the Gospels say nothing of this. The foundation for the feast of the Dormition is to be found in a sacred tradition of the Church dating from apostolic times, apocryphal writings, the constant faith of the People of God, and the unanimous opinion of the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church of the first thousand years of Christianity.\\" \\"The Dormition of the Theotokos\\" .

For this reason, Ambrose, for example, wrote: > Neither the letter of Scripture nor Tradition does not teach us that Mary > had left this life as a consequence of suffering from bodily ulcers.PL 15 > EXPOSITIO EVANG. SEC. LUC. LIB. II. 61. col. 1574 =Late 5th until 7th century= The earliest Dormition traditions surface in manuscripts at some point in the late 5th century, when three distinct narrative traditions describing the end of Mary's life suddenly appear.Stephen J. Shoemaker, 2003. Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption' (Oxford University Press) Stephen Shoemaker characterised them as the \\"Palm of the Tree of Life\\" narratives, the \\"Bethlehem\\" narratives, and the \\"Coptic\\" narratives‚Äîaside from a handful of atypical narratives. The events of the Dormition of the Virgin and her burial are dealt with in several known apocrypha: \\"The Dormition of the Virgin\\" by Pseudo-John the Theologian (emerged in the mid-5th century or later),–¢isch–µnd–ærf –°. Apocalypses apocryphae. Mosis, Esdrae, Pauli, Ioannis item Mariae Dormitio. Lipsiae, 1866, p. 95‚Äì112 \\"De transitu Virginis Mariae\\" by Pseudo-Melito of Sardis (5th century), p. 5, col. 1231 the composition of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, \\"According to John, Archbishop of Thessalonica.\\" One of these apocrypha is placed in the \\"History of the Church\\" by Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos.PG. 145. Col. 812‚Äî817 All listed apocrypha are quite late‚Äî5th and 6th century‚Äîand their content differs from each other. Therefore, the Church did not adopt all their content, but only the basic idea that the Virgin Mary blissfully rested and Her soul was adopted by her Son Jesus Christ at Dormition. According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos in his \\"History of the Church,\\" Emperor Maurice (582‚Äì602) issued an edict which set the date for the celebration of the Dormition on August 15.PG. 147. Col. 292 After that Christians in the empire began to celebrate the death of the Virgin Mary. Modestus, Patriarch of Jerusalem (630‚Äî632) said at this celebration, while preaching, that he regrets the lack of specific information about the death of the Virgin Mary. p. 86b, col. 3278-3312 In Rome the feast called Dormitio Beatae Virginis was established by Pope Sergius I (687‚Äì701), borrowed from Constantinople. =Narrative= According to later Catholic tradition, Mary, having spent her life after Pentecost supporting and serving the nascent Church, was living in the house of the Apostle John, in Jerusalem, when the Archangel Gabriel revealed to her that her death would occur three days later. The apostles, scattered throughout the world, are said to have been miraculously transported to be at her side when she died. The sole exception was Thomas, who was preaching in India. He is said to have arrived in a cloud above her tomb exactly three days after her death, and to have seen her body leaving to heaven. He asked her \\"Where are you going, O Holy One?\\", at which she took off her girdle and gave it to him saying \\"Receive this my friend\\", after which she disappeared. Thomas was taken to his fellow apostles, whom he asked to see her grave, so that he could bid her goodbye. Mary had been buried in Gethsemane, according to her request. When they arrived at the grave, her body was gone, leaving a sweet fragrance. An apparition is said to have confirmed that Christ had taken her body to heaven after three days to be reunited with her soul. Orthodox theology teaches that the Theotokos has already undergone the bodily resurrection, which all will experience at the second coming, and stands in heaven in that glorified state which the other righteous ones will only enjoy after the Last Judgment. Dormition versus Assumption The Dormition of the Theotokos is celebrated on August 15 (August 28, N.S. for those following the Julian Calendar), the same calendar day as the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption of Mary. The Dormition and the Assumption are the different names respectively in use by the Eastern and Catholic traditions for the end of Mary's life and departure from the earth, although the beliefs are not necessarily identical. Both views agree that she was taken up into heaven bodily. =Orthodox view= The Orthodox Church specifically holds one of the two Roman Catholic alternative beliefs, teaching that Mary died a natural death, like any human being; that her soul was received by Christ upon death; and that her body was resurrected on the third day after her repose, at which time she was taken up, bodily only, into heaven when the apostles, miraculously transported from the ends of the earth, found her tomb to be empty. \\"The Menaia - 15 August - Commemoration of the Falling Asleep of our Most Holy Lady, the Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary.\\" Retrieved 2013-08-12 The specific belief of the Orthodox is expressed in their liturgical texts used at the feast of the Dormition. The Eastern Catholic observance of the feast corresponds to that of their Orthodox counterparts, whether Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox. =Catholic view= The Catholic doctrine of the Assumption covers Mary's bodily movement to heaven, but the dogmatic definition avoids saying whether she was dead or alive at that point. The question had been in dispute in Catholic theology, and although she is normally shown in Catholic art as alive at the point of assumption, many Catholics believe she had died in the normal way. Pope Pius XII alludes to the fact of her death at least five times, but left open the question of whether or not Mary actually underwent death in connection with her departure, in his Apostolic constitution, Munificentissimus Deus (1950), which dogmatically defined ex cathedra (i.e., infallibly) the Assumption.Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus item 44 at the Vatican web site On 25 June 1997 during a General Audience Pope John Paul II stated that Mary experienced natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven, stating: > It is true that in Revelation death is presented as a punishment for sin. > However, the fact that the Church proclaims Mary free from original sin by a > unique divine privilege does not lead to the conclusion that she also > received physical immortality. The Mother is not superior to the Son who > underwent death, giving it a new meaning and changing it into a means of > salvation. Involved in Christ‚Äôs redemptive work and associated in his saving > sacrifice, Mary was able to share in his suffering and death for the sake of > humanity‚Äôs Redemption. What Severus of Antioch says about Christ also > applies to her: ‚ÄúWithout a preliminary death, how could the Resurrection > have taken place?‚Äù (Antijulianistica, Beirut 1931, 194f.). To share in > Christ‚Äôs Resurrection, Mary had first to share in his death. The New > Testament provides no information on the circumstances of Mary‚Äôs death. This > silence leads one to suppose that it happened naturally, with no detail > particularly worthy of mention. If this were not the case, how could the > information about it have remained hidden from her contemporaries and not > have been passed down to us in some way? As to the cause of Mary‚Äôs death, > the opinions that wish to exclude her from death by natural causes seem > groundless. It is more important to look for the Blessed Virgin‚Äôs spiritual > attitude at the moment of her departure from this world. In this regard, St > Francis de Sales maintains that Mary‚Äôs death was due to a transport of love. > He speaks of a dying ‚Äúin love, from love and through love‚Äù, going so far as > to say that the Mother of God died of love for her Son Jesus (Treatise on > the Love of God, bk. 7, ch. XIII‚ÄìXIV). Whatever from the physical point of > view was the organic, biological cause of the end of her bodily life, it can > be said that for Mary the passage from this life to the next was the full > development of grace in glory, so that no death can ever be so fittingly > described as a ‚Äúdormition‚Äù as hers.\\" Liturgical practices =Malankara Rite= The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, which is an Oriental Orthodox Church, celebrates the Feast of Dormition on August 15 with great importance, as that day is the national independence day of India. =Byzantine Rite= It is customary in many places to bless fragrant herbage on the Feast of the Dormition. The Feast of the Dormition has a one-day Forefeast and 8On Mount Athos, 16 days days of Afterfeast. The feast is framed and accentuated by three feasts in honour of Jesus Christ, known as the \\"Three Feasts of the Saviour in August\\". These are: the Procession of the Cross (August 1), the Transfiguration (August 6), and the Icon of Christ \\"Not Made by Hand\\" (August 16). Rite of Burial of the Theotokos In some places, the Rite of the \\"Burial of the Theotokos\\" is celebrated at the Dormition, during the All-Night Vigil. The order of the service is based on the service of the Burial of Christ on Great Saturday. An Epitaphios of the Theotokos, a richly embroidered cloth icon portraying her lying in state is used, together with specially composed hymns of lamentation which are sung with Psalm 118. Special Evlogitaria for the Dormition are chanted, echoing the Evlogitaria of the Resurrection chanted at matins on Sundays throughout the year as well as on Lazarus Saturday and Great Saturday. This Epitaphios is placed on a bier and carried in procession as is the Epitaphios of Christ on during Great Saturday. This practice began in Jerusalem, and from there it was carried to Russia, where it was followed in various Dormition Cathedrals, in particular that of Moscow. The practice slowly spread among the Russian Orthodox, though it is not by any means a standard service in all parishes, or even most cathedrals or monasteries. In Jerusalem, the service is chanted during the Vigil of the Dormition. In some Russian churches and monasteries, it is served on the third day after Dormition. =Maronite= The Maronite Church has a tradition that their Third Anaphora of the Apostle Peter or Sharrar (the Maronite redaction of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari) was originally composed for and used at the funeral of the Theotokos. This tradition probably developed because in its final form the anaphora has twelve paragraphs, i.e., one for each concelebrating apostle present at the funeral mass of the Theotokos. Depiction in art =Byzantine iconography= One might notice the similarities between the traditional depictions of the Dormition of the Theotokos in Byzantine iconography and the account of the death of the Egyptian Desert Father, Sisoes the Great. In both Christ is seen coming to receive the soul of the dying saint surrounded by an aureola or cloud of blinding light and accompanied by the angels and prophets. In Byzantine iconography the other Christs shown surrounded by such a cloud of light are those also seen in icons of the Transfiguration, the Resurrection and the Last Judgment. One might further note that in some icons of the Dormition the Theotokos is depicted at the top of the icon in a similar aureola before the opening gates of heaven. This suggests that contemporary accounts of the deaths of the Desert Fathers accompanied by sudden burst of light came to influence the development of the iconography of the Dormition. =Catholic art= The Dormition is known as the Death of the Virgin in Catholic art, where it is a reasonably common subject, mostly drawing on Byzantine models, until the end of the Middle Ages. The Death of the Virgin by Caravaggio, of 1606, is probably the last famous Western painting of the subject. =Gallery= Dormition de la Vierge.JPGThe Dormition: ivory plaque, late 10th to early 11th century (Mus√©e de Cluny).

It is often referred to as @Formula language (pronounced at-formula) because many language elements start with the @-character. Here is an example of a selection formula: SELECT @NoteId = \\"NT0050D26\\" It was created by Ray Ozzie during the early development of Lotus Notes. He borrowed the compiler and decompiler from the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, but unlike the spreadsheet language Formula Language was designed primarily for string and list processing, not numerical processing. It was originally a Functional programming language with unique text list-handling features inspired by Ray Ozzie's prior use of Icon and Lisp. The Formula language engine was rewritten by Damien Katz for Notes and Domino 6. New features were added to the language, such as looping and dynamic execution, and performance was improved. The Formula language has two parts: * @Functions for calculations and simple logic * @Commands for performing actions in the user interface @Functions can be used in several places throughout Lotus Notes. The most important uses are: * to select documents to show to the user in a view (a kind of index) or to select documents for further processing. In this case, the formula will evaluate to a 'true' (selected) or 'false' value (not selected) for each document. * to provide default values for fields, to transform the data entered by the user (like stripping off redundant spaces) and to validate this data. * to get a list of values from a Notes database or even from a relational database (using ODBC). This may be used to provide a user with a list of values to choose from. * to process a set of documents. The formula is placed in an agent, a program or macro that can be started by a user or by the Notes server according to a schedule. When the agent is triggered, the formula executes for each selected document (this a very limited form of a loop). This is an efficient way to change many documents, if the logic is not too complicated. In case of complicated changes, LotusScript is used. @Commands are like menu commands: they perform actions in the Lotus Notes client. Examples of actions are: * opening a Notes database * creating an e-mail * putting the cursor in a specific data-entry field * closing a window * starting an agent @Commands are primarily used in formulas that are triggered by user action, such as in button formulas. It is possible to combine them with @Functions, for example by making execution of an @command conditional on a field value.

Loosely based on Robinson's life in London in the late 1960s, the plot follows two unemployed actors, Withnail and \\"I\\" (portrayed by Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann, respectively) who share a flat in Camden Town in 1969. Needing a holiday, they obtain the key to a country cottage in the Lake District belonging to Withnail's eccentric uncle Monty and drive there. The weekend holiday proves less recuperative than they expected. Withnail and I was Grant's first film and established his profile. The film featured performances by Richard Griffiths as Withnail's Uncle Monty and Ralph Brown as Danny the drug dealer. The film has tragic and comic elements and is notable for its period music and many quotable lines. It has been described by the BBC as \\"one of Britain's biggest cult films\\". Plot In September 1969, two unemployed actors, flamboyant alcoholic Withnail and contemplative Marwood, live in a messy flat in Camden Town, London. Their only regular visitor is the drug dealer, Danny. One morning, the pair squabble about housekeeping and then leave to take a walk. In Regent's Park, they discuss the poor state of their acting careers and the desire for a holiday; they propose a trip to a rural cottage near Penrith owned by Withnail's wealthy uncle Monty. They visit Monty that evening at his luxurious Chelsea house. Monty is a melodramatic aesthete, who Marwood infers is homosexual; the three briefly drink together as Withnail casually lies to Monty about his acting career and claims that grammar school- educated Marwood studied at Eton. Withnail persuades his uncle to lend them the cottage key and they leave. Withnail and Marwood drive to the cottage the next day but find the weather cold and wet, the cottage without food, running water or power and the locals unwelcoming ‚Äì in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends in the pub. Marwood is anxious when he later sees Jake prowling around the cottage and suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed in the interest of safety but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail becomes paranoid that the poacher wants to harm them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has brought supplies. The next day, Marwood realises Monty's visit has ulterior motives when he makes aggressive sexual advances on him; Withnail seems oblivious to this. Monty drives them into town to buy wellington boots but they nip to the pub instead. Monty is hurt, though he puts it out of his mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what Monty might try to do and wants to leave immediately but after much argument Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood tries to avoid Monty's company but is eventually cornered in the guest bedroom as Monty insistently demands they have sex. Monty reveals that Withnail, during the visit in London, claimed that Marwood was a closet homosexual. Marwood lies that Withnail is the closeted one and that the two of them are in a committed relationship, which Withnail wishes to keep secret from his family and that this is the first night that they have not slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, believes this explanation and leaves after apologising for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail. The next morning, they find Monty has left for London, leaving a note wishing them happiness together. They continue to argue about their behaviour and Monty. A telegram arrives from Marwood's agent with a possible offer of work and he insists they return. As Marwood sleeps, Withnail drunkenly speeds most of the way back until pulled over by the police, who arrest and fine him for driving under the influence. The pair return to the flat to find Danny and a friend named Presuming Ed squatting. Marwood calls his agent and discovers that he is wanted for the lead part in a play but will need to move to Manchester to take it. The four get high smoking a huge cannabis joint but the celebration ends when Marwood learns they have received an eviction notice for unpaid rent, while Withnail is too high to care. Marwood packs a bag and leaves for the railway station, turning down Withnail's request for a goodbye drink. In Regent's Park, Marwood confesses that he will miss Withnail but insists that they part ways there. Bottle of wine in hand, Withnail performs \\"What a piece of work is a man!\\" from Hamlet, seen only by the wolves in a nearby zoo enclosure, then walks home alone in the rain. Cast * Richard E. Grant as Withnail * Paul McGann as \\"...& I\\" (Marwood) * Richard Griffiths as Monty (Montague H. Withnail) * Ralph Brown as Danny * Michael Elphick as Jake * Daragh O'Malley as Irishman * Michael Wardle as Isaac Parkin * Una Brandon- Jones as Mrs Parkin * Noel Johnson as General * Irene Sutcliffe as Waitress * Llewellyn Rees as Tea Shop Proprietor * Robert Oates as Policeman 1 * Anthony Wise as Policeman 2 * Eddie Tagoe as Presuming Ed Production =Development= Writing The film is an adaptation of an unpublished novel written by Robinson in 1969‚Äì1970 (an early draft of which sold at auction for ¬£8,125 in 2015). Actor friend Don Hawkins passed a copy of the manuscript to his friend Mordecai (Mody) Schreiber in 1980. Schreiber paid Robinson ¬£20,000 to adapt it into a screenplay, which Robinson did in the early 1980s. When meeting Schreiber in Los Angeles, Robinson expressed concern that he might not be able to continue because the writing broke basic screenplay rules and was hard to make work as a film. It used colloquial English to which few would connect (\\"Give me a tanner and I'll give him a bell.\\"); characters in dismal circumstances and a plot prodded by not cinematic voice-overs. Schreiber told him that is precisely what he wanted. On completing the script, producer Paul Heller urged Robinson to direct it and found funding for half the film. The script was then passed to HandMade Films and George Harrison agreed to fund the remainder of the film. Robinson's script is largely autobiographical. \\"Marwood\\" is Robinson; \\"Withnail\\" is based on Vivian MacKerrell, a friend with whom he shared a Camden house and \\"Uncle Monty\\" is loosely based on Franco Zeffirelli, from whom Robinson received unwanted amorous attentions when he was a young actor. He lived in the impoverished conditions seen in the film and wore plastic bags as Wellington boots. For the script, Robinson condensed two or three years of his life into two or three weeks. Robinson stated he named the character of Withnail after a childhood acquaintance named Jonathan Withnall, who was \\"the coolest guy I had ever met in my life\\". Early in the film, Withnail reads a newspaper headline \\"Boy Lands Plum Role for Top Italian Director\\" and suggests that the director is sexually abusing the boy. This is a reference to the sexual harassment that Robinson alleges he suffered at the hands of Zeffirelli when, at age 21, he won the role of Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet. Robinson attributed Uncle Monty's question to Marwood (\\"Are you a sponge or a stone?\\") as a direct quote from Zeffereli. The headline \\"NUDE AU PAIR'S SECRET LIFE\\" was an actual headline from News of the World on 16 November 1969. The end of the novel saw Withnail committing suicide by pouring a bottle of wine into the barrel of Monty's shotgun and then pulling the trigger as he drank from it. Robinson changed the ending, as he believed it was \\"too dark\\". Name of \\"I\\" \\"Marwood\\"? A telegram arrives at Crow Crag While the name of \\"I\\" is never spoken in the film, in the screenplay it is \\"Marwood\\". The name \\"Marwood\\" is used by Robinson in interviews and in writing as well as by Grant and McGann in the 1999 Channel 4 documentary short Withnail and Us. The name \\"Marwood\\" was known to film critic Vincent Canby of the New York Times in a March 27, 1987 review coinciding with the film's New York premiere at the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art. In the end credits and most media relating to the film, McGann's character is referred to solely as . In the supplemental material packaged with the Special Edition DVD in the UK, McGann's character is referred to as Peter Marwood in the cast credits. It has been suggested that it is possible that 'Marwood' can be heard near the beginning of the film: As the characters escape from the Irishman in the Mother Black Cap, Withnail shouts \\"Get out of my way!\\". Some hear this line as \\"Out of the way, Marwood!\\", although the script reads simply \\"Get out of my way!\\". Although the first name of \\"I\\" is not stated anywhere in the film, it is widely believed that it is \\"Peter\\". This myth arose as a result of a line of misheard dialogue.Hewitt-McManus, Thomas: \\"Twenty things you might want to know about Withnail & I\\", DVD insert. Anchor Bay, 2006. In the scene where Monty meets the two actors, Withnail asks him if he would like a drink. In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says \\"...you must tell me all the news, I haven't seen you since you finished your last film\\". While pouring another drink, and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been \\"Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff\\". Then pointing at Marwood he says \\"He's just had an audition for rep\\". Some fans hear this line as \\"Peter's had an audition for rep\\", although the original shooting script and all commercially published versions of the script read \\"he's\\". Towards the end of the film, a telegram arrives at Crow Crag on which the name \\"Marwood\\" is partially visible. =Pre- production= Peter Frampton worked as make-up artist and Andrea Galer worked as costume designer. Casting Mary Selway worked as casting director. Paul McGann was Robinson's first choice for \\"I\\" but he was fired during rehearsals because Robinson decided McGann's Scouse (Liverpool) accent was wrong for the character. Several other actors read for the role but McGann eventually persuaded Robinson to re-audition him, promising to affect a Home Counties accent and quickly won back the part. Actors Robinson considered for \\"Withnail\\" included Daniel Day-Lewis, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, and Edward Tudor-Pole. Robinson claims that Richard E. Grant was too fat to play Withnail and told him that \\"half of you has got to go\\". Grant has denied this. Though he played a raging alcoholic, Grant is a teetotaller with an allergy to alcohol. He had never been drunk prior to making the film. Robinson decided that it would be impossible for Grant to play the character without having ever experienced inebriation and a hangover, so he \\"forced\\" the actor on a drinking binge. Grant has stated that he was \\"violently sick\\" after each drink and found the experience deeply unpleasant. =Production= Sleddale Hall, the location used as Monty's cottage. This photo dates from 2007. The hall was restored in 2011‚Äì2012. According to Richard E. Grant's book, With Nails, filming started on 2 August 1986 in the Lake District and shooting took seven weeks. A rough cut was screened to the actors in a Wardour Street screening room on 8 December 1986.With Nails, Richard E. Grant, 1996, pp. 10-43 Denis O'Brien, who oversaw the filming on behalf of HandMade Films, nearly shut the film down on the first day of production. He thought that the film had no \\"discernible jokes\\" and was badly lit. During the filming of the scene in which Withnail drinks a can of lighter fluid, Robinson changed the contents of the can between takes from water to vinegar to get a better reaction from Grant. The film cost ¬£1.1 million to make. Robinson received ¬£80,000 to direct, ¬£30,000 of which he reinvested into the film to shoot additional scenes such as the journeys to and from Penrith, which HandMade Films would not fund. The money was never reimbursed after the film's success. Ringo Starr is credited as a \\"Special Production Consultant\\" under his legal name, Richard Starkey MBE. Cumbria The film was not shot entirely on location. There was no filming in the real Penrith; the locations used were in and around nearby Shap and Bampton, Cumbria. Monty's cottage, \\"Crow Crag\\", is Sleddale Hall, near the Wet Sleddale Reservoir just outside Shap, although the lake that \\"Crow Crag\\" apparently overlooks is Haweswater Reservoir. The bridge where Withnail and Marwood go fishing with a shotgun is over the River Lowther. The telephone box in which Withnail calls his agent is beside Wideworth Farm Road in Bampton. Sleddale Hall was offered for sale in January 2009 with a starting price of ¬£145,000. Sebastian Hindley, who owns the Mardale Inn in Bampton, won the auction at a price of ¬£265,000 but he failed to secure financing and the property was resold for an undisclosed sum to Tim Ellis, an architect from Kent, whose original bid failed at the auction. Hertfordshire Exterior and ground floor interior shots of Crow Crag were shot at Sleddale Hall and Stockers Farm in Rickmansworth, though the bedroom and stair scenes of Crow Crag were filmed in Hertfordshire. Stockers Farm was also the location for the \\"Crow and Crown\\" pub. Buckinghamshire \\"The King Henry\\" played by the Crown Inn. The great elm tree outside the pub and shown in the film subsequently died of alt=The Crown Inn The \\"King Henry\\" pub and the \\"Penrith Tea Rooms\\" scenes were filmed in the Market Square in Stony Stratford, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, at what is now The Crown Inn Stony Stratford and Cox & Robinson pharmacy, respectively. London Withnail and Marwood's flat was located at 57 Chepstow Place in Bayswater, W2. The shot of them leaving for Penrith as they turn left from the building being demolished was shot on Freston Road, W11. \\"The Mother Black Cap\\" pub was played by \\"The Frog and Firkin\\" pub at 41 Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Green, Notting Hill. For some time after the film, the pub was renamed \\"The Mother Black Cap\\", though it was sold and renamed several times before being demolished in 2010‚Äì2011. The cafe where Marwood has breakfast at the beginning of the film is located at the corner of 136 Lancaster Road, W11 near the corner with Ladbroke Grove. The scene where the police order Withnail and Marwood to \\"get in the back of the van\\" was filmed on the flyover near John Aird Court, Paddington. Uncle Monty's house is actually the West House, Glebe Place, Chelsea, SW3. Shepperton Studios The police station interior was shot at Shepperton Studios. Reception Bruce Robinson won the Best Screenplay award at the 1988 Evening Standard British Film Awards. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted Withnail and I the 29th greatest British film of all time. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for Time Out magazine, the film was ranked the 15th best British film ever. The line \\"We want the finest wines available to humanity, we want them here and we want them now\\", delivered by Richard E. Grant as Withnail, was voted the third favourite film one-liner in a 2003 poll of 1,000 film fans. In 2000, readers of Total Film voted Withnail and I the third greatest comedy film of all time. In 2004 the same magazine named it the 13th greatest British film of all time. In 2001, Withnail and I was 38th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Films poll. In a 2014 poll, readers of Empire voted Withnail and I the 92nd greatest film. The film holds a 94% \\"fresh\\" rating from 34 critics, and an average rating of 8.48 out of 10 from critic website Rotten Tomatoes. In August 2009 The Observer polled 60 eminent British film filmmakers and film critics who voted it the second best British film of the last 25 years. The film was also ranked number 118 in Empire's 500 Greatest Films of all Time list. In a four-star review, film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his \\"Great Movies\\" list, describing Grant's performance as a \\"tour de force\\" and Withnail as \\"one of the iconic figures in modern films\\". In 2007 a digitally remastered version of the film was released by the UK Film Council. It was shown at over fifty cinemas around the UK on 11 September, as part of the final week of the BBC's \\"Summer of British Film\\" season. In 2011, Time Out London named it the 7th-greatest comedy film of all time. Legacy The film is routinely regarded as being among the finest British movies ever made, and its influence has been cited by several filmmakers, including directly inspiring: Shane Black's The Nice Guys, James Ponsoldt's The End of the Tour, Todd Sklar's Awful Nice, Jay and Mark Duplass's Jeff, Who Lives at Home, John Bryant's The Overbrook Brothers, David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express, Alexander Payne's Sideways, and Tom DiCillo's Box of Moonlight. There is a drinking game associated with the film. The game consists of keeping up, drink for drink, with each alcoholic substance consumed by Withnail over the course of the film. All told, Withnail is shown drinking roughly glasses of red wine, of cider, one shot of lighter fluid (vinegar or overproof rum are common substitutes), measures of gin, six glasses of sherry, thirteen drams of Scotch whisky and pint of ale. In 1992, filmmaker David Fincher attempted to create an unofficial reunion of sorts, when he tried casting all three of the film's main characters in Alien 3. McGann and Brown appear, however Richard E. Grant turned down his role. It eventually went to Charles Dance, who played the character of Clemens in the \\"spirit of Withnail\\".{self-published sourcedate=May 2020}} In 1996, the Los Angeles Times reported the film (and the associated drinking game) had achieved cult status prior to its home video re-release in the United States. In 2010, McGann said that he sometimes meets viewers who believe the film was actually shot in the 1960s, saying \\"It comes from the mid-1980s, but it sticks out like a Smiths record. Its provenance is from a different era. None of the production values, none of the iconography, none of the style remotely has it down as an 80s picture.\\" Soundtrack Original music for the film was composed by David Dundas and Rick Wentworth. The film features a rare appearance of a recording by the Beatles, whose 1968 song \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" plays as Withnail and Marwood return to London and find Presuming Ed in the bath. The song, which was written and sung by George Harrison, was able to be included in the soundtrack due to Harrison's involvement in the film as one of the producers. There is a misconception among some fans of the film that King Curtis was murdered on the night his live performance of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" was recorded. Ralph Brown, in the audio commentary on some DVD issues, wrongly states that he was shot in the car park after the concert. Curtis was stabbed to death in August 1971, some five months after the recording was made in March 1971. The recording comes from Curtis's album Live at Fillmore West. =Tracklist= # \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" (live)King Curtis5:25 # \\"The Wolf\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth1:33 # \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (reduced tempo)The Jimi Hendrix Experience4:10 # \\"To the Crow\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth2:22 # \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\" (live)The Jimi Hendrix Experience4:28 # \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"The Beatles4:44 # \\"Marwood Walks\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth2:14 # \\"Monty Remembers\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth2:02 # \\"La Fite\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth1:10 # \\"Hang Out the Stars in Indiana\\"Al Bowlly and New Mayfair Dance Orchestra1:35 # \\"Crow Crag\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth0:56 # \\"Cheval Blanc\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth1:15 # \\"My Friend\\"Charlie Kunz1:28 # \\"Withnail's Theme\\"David Dundas and Rick Wentworth2:40 Notes References Further reading * Ali Catterall and Simon Wells, Your Face Here: British Cult Movies Since The Sixties (Fourth Estate, 2001) * Richard E.

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. The 20th Disney animated feature film, the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a butler has kidnapped them to gain his mistress's fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby. In 1962, The Aristocats project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, Walt Disney suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, and placed the project in turnaround as The Jungle Book advanced into production. When The Jungle Book was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on The Aristocats, making it the last film project to be approved by Disney personally before his death in December 1966. The Aristocats was released on December 24, 1970, to positive reception and was a box office success. Plot In Paris 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three kittens, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse, live with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. One day while preparing her will with lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares that her fortune will be left to her cats until their deaths, and thereafter to Edgar. Edgar hears this through a speaking tube and plots to eliminate the cats. He later sedates them by putting sleeping pills in a milk mixture intended for them, and drives them to the countryside to abandon them. There, he is ambushed by two hounds named Napoleon and Lafayette, losing his hat and umbrella, and the cats are stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence. In the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly hitchhikes in a milk truck before being chased out by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, but Marie falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley, who in turn has to be rescued by two English geese, Amelia and Abigail Gabble, who accompany the cats to Paris. Meanwhile, Edgar returns to the country to retrieve his possessions from Napoleon and Lafayette, after realising that they are the only evidence that could incriminate him. Travelling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the song \\"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\\". After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill, and Duchess' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's marriage proposal. The next day, Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion, but Edgar finds them before she does, places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to Timbuktu. Roquefort catches up with O'Malley at the cats‚Äô instruction, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, sending Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang; while he struggles to explain why he was sent to find them, Roquefort successfully brings them to the mansion. The alley cats and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself, never to be seen again. The cats return to Madame Adelaide, whose will is rewritten to exclude Edgar, with Madame remaining ignorant of the reason for his departure. After adopting O‚ÄôMalley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation housing Paris' stray cats (represented by Scat Cat and his band, who reprise their song).

By New Year's 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children's book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City. However, Tytle felt that a London location had added a significant element to One Hundred and One Dalmatians and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris. Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants‚Äîa butler and a maid‚Äîwho were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines. Boris Karloff and Francoise Rosay were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame. A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris, France. During the filming of Escapade in Florence, McGowan brought him the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris. Before his death in 1966, Walt Disney contacted Phil Harris (pictured here) to voice Thomas O'Malley. By August 1962, they sent the completed script to Burbank, where it was returned as \\"rejected\\" by an unknown executive at the Disney studios. Nevertheless, Tytle brought the script to Disney staying at the Connaught in London. Disney approved for the draft, but recommended additional cuts which were made by February 1963. Before filming was to commence, Rowe wrote a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept. However, by summer 1963, the project was shelved, where Tytle, in a discussion with Walt, recommended to produce The Aristocats as an animated feature. For that reason, Disney temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with The Jungle Book. Meanwhile, director Wolfgang Reitherman learned of the project and suggested it as a follow-up project to Jungle Book. Because of the production delays, Tytle was advised to centralize his efforts on live action projects and was replaced by Winston Hibler. In 1966, Disney assigned Ken Anderson to determine whether Aristocats would be suitable for an animated feature. With occasional guidance from Reitherman, Anderson worked from scratch and simplified the two stories into a story that focused more on the cats. Disney saw the preliminary sketches and approved the project shortly before his death. After The Jungle Book was completed, the animation department began work on Aristocats. Hibler was eventually replaced by Reitherman, who would abandon the more emotional story of Duchess's obsession to find adopters befitting of her kittens' talents initially favored by Disney suggesting instead the film be conceived as an adventure comedy in the vein of One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Furthermore, the character Elmira, the maid, who was intended to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester, was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central villain in order to better simplify the storyline. =Casting= As with The Jungle Book, the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors. In 1966, Walt Disney contacted Phil Harris to improvise the script, and shortly after, he was cast to voice Thomas O'Malley. To differentiate the character from Baloo, Reitherman noted O'Malley was \\"more based on Clark Gable than Wallace Beery, who was partly the model for Baloo.\\" Reitherman furthermore cast Eva Gabor as Duchess, remarking she had \\"the freshest femme voice we've ever had\\", and Sterling Holloway as Roquefort. Louis Armstrong was initially reported to voice Scat Cat, but he backed out of the project due to illness. Out of desperation, Scatman Crothers was hired to voice the character under the direction to imitate Armstrong. Pat Buttram and George Lindsey were cast as the farm dogs, which proved so popular with the filmmakers that another scene was included to have the dogs when Edgar returns to the farm to retrieve his displaced hat and umbrella. =Animation= Ken Anderson spent eighteen months developing the design of the characters. Five of Disney's legendary \\"Nine Old Men\\" worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average. Music The Aristocats was the last Disney animated feature Robert and Richard Sherman worked on as staff songwriters, growing frustrated by the management of the studio following Walt Disney's death. For the Disney studios, the Sherman Brothers completed their work before the release of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, but would return to the studio to compose songs for The Tigger Movie. Maurice Chevalier (pictured here) was brought out of retirement to sing the title song. The brothers composed multiple songs, but only the title song and \\"Scales and Arpeggios\\" were included in the film. Desiring to capture the essence of France, the Sherman Brothers composed the song \\"The Aristocats\\". Disney film producer Bill Anderson would ask Maurice Chevalier to participate in the film. Following the suggestion, Richard Sherman imitated Chevalier's voice as he performed a demo for the song. Chevalier received the demo and was brought out of retirement to sing the song. Deleted songs that were intended for the film included \\"Pourquoi?\\" sung by Hermione Baddeley as Madame Bonfamille, its reprise, and \\"She Never Felt Alone\\" sung by Robie Lester as Marie. For the show-stopping number, the Sherman Brothers composed \\"Le Jazz Hot\\", but \\"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\\", composed by Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker, was used instead. Lastly, a villainous song was envisioned to be sung by Edgar and his assistant Elmira as a romantic duet, but the song was dropped when Elmira was removed from the story. Another deleted song was for Thomas O'Malley titled \\"My Way's The Highway\\", but the filmmakers had Terry Gilkyson compose the eponymous song \\"Thomas O'Malley Cat\\". Gilkyson explained \\"It was the same song, but they orchestrated it twice. They used the simpler one, because they may have thought the other too elaborate or too hot. It was a jazz version with a full orchestra.\\" The instrumental music was composed by George Bruns, who drew from his background with jazz bands in the 1940s and decided to feature the accordion-like musette for French flavor. On Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic, this includes \\"Thomas O'Malley Cat\\" on the purple disc and \\"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\\" on the orange disc. On Disney's Greatest Hits, this includes \\"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\\" on the red disc. On August 21, 2015, in honor of the 45th anniversary of the film, a new soundtrack was released as part of Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection. The release includes the songs and score as used in the film, along with The Lost Chords of the Aristocats (featuring songs written for the film but not used), and previously released album versions of the songs as bonus tracks. Release The Aristocats was originally released to theaters on December 24, 1970. It was re-released in theaters in 1980 and 1987. =Home media= It was released on VHS in Europe on January 1, 1990 and in the UK in 1995. It was first released on VHS in North America on April 24, 1996 as part of the Masterpiece Collection. In January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection, and The Aristocats was released on VHS and DVD on April 4, 2000. The DVD contained the film in its 1.33:1 aspect ratio enhanced with Dolby 2.0 surround sound. The Gold Collection release was quietly discontinued in 2006. A new single-disc Special Edition DVD (previously announced as a 2-Disc set) was released on February 5, 2008. Disney released the film on Blu-ray for the first time on August 21, 2012. The 2-disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo (both in Blu-ray and DVD packaging) featured a new digital transfer and new bonus material. A single disc DVD edition was also released on the same day. Reception =Box office= The Aristocats was released in December 1970 where it earned $10.1 million in United States and Canadian rentals by the end of 1971. The film was the most popular \\"general release\\" movie at the British box office in 1971.The Times [London, England] December 30, 1971: p. 2; The Times Digital Archive; accessed July 11, 2012. The film was the most popular film in France in 1971 and had total admissions of 12.7 million. It is also ranked as the eighteenth highest-grossing of all time in France. The film is the most popular film released in Germany in 1971 with admissions of 11.3 million being the country's eleventh highest-grossing film. By the end of its initial theatrical run, the film had earned domestic rentals of $11 million and $17 million in foreign countries, for a worldwide rental of $28 million. The film was re-released to theaters in the United States on December 19, 1980 where it grossed an additional $18 million and again on April 10, 1987 where it grossed $17 million. The film grossed $32 million worldwide from an international re-release in 1994. The Aristocats has had a lifetime gross of $55.7 million in the United States and Canada, and its total lifetime worldwide box office gross is $191 million. =Critical reaction= Howard Thompson of The New York Times praised the film as \\"grand fun all the way, nicely flavored with tunes, and topped with one of the funniest jam sessions ever by a bunch of scraggly Bohemians headed by one Scat Cat.\\" Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film three stars out of four summarizing The Aristocats as \\"light and pleasant and funny, the characterization is strong, and the voices of Phil Harris (O'Malley the Alley Cat) and Eva Gabor (Duchess, the mother cat) are charming in their absolute rightness.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"has a gentle good-natured charm which will delight the small-fry and their elders alike.\\" He praised the animation, but remarked that the film \\"lacks a certain kind of vigor, boldness and dash, a kind of a hard-focused emphasis which you would say was a Disney trademark.\\"Champlin, Charles (December 24, 1970). \\"Cats Star in Disney Cartoon\\". Los Angeles Times. Section II, pp. 4, 11 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. Variety praised the film writing the film is \\"[h]elped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers and others, plus some outstanding animation, songs, sentiment, some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia.\\" Stefan Kanfer, reviewing for Time, noted that \\"The melodies in Disney's earlier efforts have been richer. But for integration of music, comedy and plot, The Aristocats has no rivals.\\" For its 1987 re-release, animation historian Charles Solomon expressed criticism for its episodic plot, anachronisms, and borrowed plot elements from earlier Disney animated features, but nevertheless wrote \\"[b]ut even at their least original, the Disney artists provide better animation--and more entertainment--than the recent animated features hawking The Care Bears, Rainbow Brite and Transformers.\\" Writing in his book The Disney Films, Disney historian and film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that \\"[t]he worst that one could say of The AristoCats is that it is unmemorable. It's smoothly executed, of course, and enjoyable, but neither its superficial story nor its characters have any resonance.\\" Additionally, in his book Of Mice and Magic, Maltin criticized the film for re-using Phil Harris to replicate The Jungle Books Baloo, dismissing the character Thomas O'Malley as \\"essentially the same character, dictated by the same voice personality.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received a 64% approval rating with an average rating of 5.86/10 based on 33 reviews. Its consensus states \\"Though The Aristocats is a mostly middling effort for Disney, it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes.\\" =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Animation Film Cancelled sequel In 2005, Disneytoon Studios originally planned to make a follow-up to the film, along with sequels to Chicken Little (2005) and Meet the Robinsons (2007). Originally intended to be a 2D animated feature, Disney executives decided to produce the film in computer animation in order to garner more interest. Additionally, the story was meant to center around Marie, Duchess's daughter, who becomes smitten by another kitten aboard a luxury cruise ship. However, she and her family must soon take on a jewel thief on the open seas. The project was canceled when John Lasseter was named Disney's new chief creative officer, in which he called off all future sequels Disneytoon had planned and instead make original productions or spin-offs.

In the greater Portland area, these companies have traditionally specialized in hardware ‚Äî specifically test-and-measurement equipment (Tektronix), computer chips (Intel and an array of smaller chip manufacturers), electronic displays (InFocus, Planar Systems and Pixelworks) and printers (Hewlett-Packard Co, Xerox and Epson).

Tektronix and ESI both started out in Portland proper, but moved to Washington County in 1951 and 1962, respectively, and developed sites designed to attract other high-tech companies. Floating Point Systems, co-founded by three former Tektronix employees in Beaverton in 1970, was the first spin-off company in Silicon Forest and the third (after Tek and ESI) to be traded on the NYSE.G.B. Dodds, C.E. Wollner & M.M. Lee, The Silicon Forest, Oregon Historical Society Press, 1990, p 46-55. These three companies, and later Intel, led to the creation of a number of other spin-offs and startups, some of which were remarkably successful. A 2003 dissertation on these spin-offs led to a poster depicting the genealogy of 894 Silicon Forest companies. High-tech employment in the state reached a peak of almost 73,000 in 2001, but has never recovered from the dot-com bust. Statewide, tech employment totaled 57,000 in the spring of 2012. Unlike other regions with a \\"silicon\\" appellation, semiconductors truly are the heart of Oregon's tech industry. Intel's headquarters remain in Santa Clara, California, but in the 1990s the company began moving its most advanced technical operations to Oregon. Its Ronler Acres campus eventually became its most advanced anywhere, and Oregon is now Intel's largest operating hub.

Stockton published by Scribner \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" is a much-anthologized short story written by Frank R. Stockton for publication in the magazine The Century in 1882. \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" has entered the English language as an allegorical expression, a shorthand indication or signifier, for a problem that is unsolvable. Plot summary The short story takes place in a land ruled by a semi-barbaric king. Some of the king's ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king's innovations is the use of a public trial by ordeal as an agent of poetic justice, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public arena and must choose one of two doors.VOA Learning English video Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by it. The king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens. The outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess's state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him to either death or marriage. She contemplates the pros and cons of each option, though notably considering the lady more. \\"And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door ‚Äì the lady, or the tiger?\\" Other works =By Stockton= Stockton later wrote \\"The Discourager of Hesitancy,\\"\\"The Discourager of Hesitancy\\" in the Century Magazine Archive a follow-up to \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" that begins with five travelers visiting the kingdom to discover what the accused man in that story found behind the door he chose. An official tells them a second story, of a prince who had come to the kingdom to find a wife. Instead of allowing him to see any available ladies, the king had him immediately taken to guest quarters and summoned attendants to prepare him for a wedding to be held the next day. One attendant introduced himself as the Discourager of Hesitancy and explained that his job was to ensure compliance with the king's will, through the subtle threat of the large \\"cimeter\\" (scimitar) he carried. At noon on the following day, the prince was blindfolded and brought before a priest, where a marriage ceremony was performed and he could feel and hear a lady standing next to him. Once the ceremony was complete, the blindfold was removed and he turned to find 40 ladies standing before him, one of whom was his new bride. If he did not correctly identify her, the Discourager would execute him on the spot. The prince narrowed the possibilities down to two, one lady smiling and one frowning, and made the correct choice. The kingdom official tells the five travelers that once they figure out which lady the prince had married, he will tell them the outcome of \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" The story ends with a comment that they still have not come to a decision. =By other artists= A play adaptation by Sydney Rosenfeld debuted at Wallack's Theatre in 1888 ran for seven weeks. In addition to stretching out the story as long as possible to make it a play, at the end the choice was revealed to the audience ‚Äì neither a lady or tiger, but an old hag.Smith, Cecil & Glenn Litton. Musical Comedy in America, p. 44 (1991 ed.) A radio dramatization of \\"The Lady, or the Tiger\\" by Elliott and Cathy Lewis aired on the show On Stage in 1953. Toyah Willcox and Robert Fripp released a recording of \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" and \\"The Discourager of Hesitancy\\" with Willcox reading the stories to electric guitar accompaniment by Fripp. \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" is one of three short stories that were adapted into the musical comedy The Apple Tree. The story was the inspiration for Raymond Smullyan's puzzle book by the same title, The Lady, or the Tiger?. The first set of logic puzzles in the book had a similar scenario to the short story in which a king gives each prisoner a choice between a number of doors; behind each one was either a lady or a tiger. However, the king bases the prisoner's fate on intelligence and not luck by posting a statement on each door that can be true or false. The Lady, or the Tiger? adapted to a short film by Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation on 1970. \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" is referenced in \\"Ennui\\", a sonnet written by Sylvia Plath and published 43 years after her death. Plath's sonnet, however, speaks of an age when the choice has become no longer relevant. Alternative rock band They Might Be Giants released the song \\"The Lady and the Tiger\\" on their 2011 album Join Us. Like the story, the song ends without a conclusion. The last line reads, \\"The hall remains, it still contains a pair of doors, a choice. Behind one door, a muffled roar, behind the other, a voice.\\" The Lady or the Tiger is a one-act play adapted from Stockton's short story and published by Lazy Bee Scripts in 2010. \\"The Purr- fect Crime\\", Season 1, Episode 19 of the U.S. television series Batman ends with a cliffhanger in which Catwoman has Batman locked in a room with two doors; one of which opens to her, and the other opens to a tiger. Over an intercom she taunts him with \\"Which will it be, Batman? The lady or the tiger?\\" Batman has no hint and chooses the door that has the tiger. In The Simpsons Season 17, Episode 17, Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore, Lenny and Carl are presented with two doors. A man informs them that Homer Simpson is behind one of the two doors, and behind the other, a ferocious tiger. When both doors reveal a tiger inside, they are informed that one of the tigers is named Homer Simpson. The story is most likely the basis of the choose which \\"door number\\" game from the popular game show Let's Make a Deal.

Early life Norwest was born in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, sometime in the early 1880s, the M√©tis son of Louis Northwest or Watson and Genevi√®ve Boucher, themselves both M√©tis. His father lived for a time with the Cree band led by Kiskaquin (Bobtail). Norwest worked as a ranch hand and rodeo performer, then for a short time he served with the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. In January 1915 he joined the Canadian army. Military career Henry Louis Norwest initially enlisted in Wetaskawin as Henry Louie, listing his trade as \\"Cow Puncher\\". However, he was discharged just three months later for \\"drunkenness\\", according to official records. He then re-enlisted in Calgary, under the name of Henry Norwest. In his nearly three years of service with the 50th Canadian Infantry Battalion, the lance corporal achieved a documented sniping record of 115 fatal shots. His true number of kills could be higher, because the military only recorded hits which had been witnessed by someone else. Norwest drew greatly upon his upbringing and experience as a hunter ‚Äì moving with stealth, and making use of camouflage and the natural foliage around him to hide. As a result of his exceptional abilities his superiors frequently sent him on reconnaissance missions into \\"No Man's Land\\" or behind enemy lines. In 1917, Norwest earned the Military Medal during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, in recognition of his contribution to the conquering of \\"the Pimple\\", which was a significant point along the ridge. In the three months preceding the battle, Norwest killed 59 enemy soldiers, and his award citation stated that he \\"saved a great number of our men's lives.\\" After his death, he was posthumously awarded the bar to his Military Medal. He was one of only 90 men in the Canadian Expeditionary force/Canadian Corps to earn the Military Medal with Bar.https://www.scribd.com/document/32383621/Norwest-Northwest-Henry-World- War-I-Sniper Only three months before the war ended, Norwest was on a mission to find a German sniper's lair when he was killed by the enemy sniper. His Ross Rifle is currently on display at The King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) Museum, part of The Military Museums in Calgary. It is the second of three rifles that he used and was brought back to Canada by his spotter. The last rifle that Norwest carried was rumoured to have been taken by the German sniper who killed him on 18 August 1918 near Fouquescourt, Somme, France. Henry Norwest's rifle on display at The Military Museums in Calgary. Personal life Nicknamed Ducky, Henry Norwest was M√©tis of Cree/French origins from the Hobbema reserve in Alberta. Henry reportedly earned his nickname during the war because he was very popular with women at dance halls, and would dance for hours before \\"ducking\\" out on the women at the end of the night. Henry was married with three children, who were all sent to a residential school in Ermineskin, Alberta, prior to his enlistment. His wife died in Alberta sometime before he was killed in action. His three daughters became orphans upon his death, and spent most of their childhoods in a residential school. Henry is buried in the Warvillers Churchyard Extension Cemetery, Warvillers, Somme, France.  Legacy  Fort Saskatchewan's cemetery features two large stones that each bear a plaque detailing his accomplishments during the war. His name was not added to the community's cenotaph until 2008.

Frank Baum's fourteen Land of Oz books. It was also adapted into a Canadian animated film in 1987. Originally published on July 20, 1910, it is the story of Dorothy Gale and her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em coming to live in Oz permanently. While they are toured through the Quadling Country, the Nome King is assembling allies for an invasion of Oz. This is the first time in the Oz series that Baum made use of double plots for one of the books.Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 160, Baum had intended to cease writing Oz stories with this book, but financial pressures prompted him to write and publish The Patchwork Girl of Oz, with seven other Oz books to follow.James Thurber, \\"The Wizard of Chitenango\\", p 66 Fantasists on Fantasy edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, The book was dedicated to \\"Her Royal Highness Cynthia II of Syracuse\\" ‚Äî actually the daughter (born in the previous year, 1909) of the author's younger brother, Henry Clay \\"Harry\\" Baum. Plot summary At the beginning of this story, it is made quite clear that Dorothy Gale (the primary protagonist of many of the previous Oz books), is in the habit of freely speaking of her many adventures in the Land of Oz to her only living relatives, her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. Neither of them believes a word of her stories, but consider her a dreamer, as her dead mother had been. She is undeterred. Later, it is revealed that the destruction of their farmhouse by the tornado back in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has left Uncle Henry in terrible debt. In order to pay it, he has taken out a mortgage on his farm. If he cannot repay his creditors, they will seize the farm, thus leaving Henry and his family homeless. He is not too afraid for himself, but both he and his wife, Aunt Em, fear very much for their niece's future. Upon learning this, Dorothy quickly arranges with Princess Ozma to let her bring her guardians to Oz where they will be very happier and forever safe. Using the Magic Belt (a tool captured from the jealous Nome King Roquat), Ozma transports them to her throne room. They are given rooms to live in and luxuries to enjoy, including a vast and complex wardrobe, and meet with many of Dorothy's old friends, including the Cowardly Lion and Billina the Yellow Hen. In the underground Nome Kingdom, the Nome King Roquat is plotting to conquer the Land of Oz and recover his magic belt, which Dorothy took from him in Ozma of Oz. After ordering the expulsion of his General (who will not agree to such an attack) and the death of his Colonel (who also refuses), King Roquat holds counsel with a veteran soldier called Guph. Guph believes that against the many magicians of Oz (the reputation of which has grown in the telling), the Nome Army has no chance alone. He therefore sets out personally to recruit allies. Dorothy, accompanied by the Wizard of Oz and several other friends, departs the Emerald City in a carriage drawn by the Wooden Sawhorse, intending to give her aunt and uncle a tour of the land. Many of the people encountered have never been seen in other books: * The living cut-out paper dolls created by an immortal called Miss Cuttenclip. * The anthropomorphic jigsaw puzzles known as the Fuddles. * The loquacious Rigmaroles. * The paranoid Flutterbudgets. * The living kitchen utensils of Utensia. * The anthropomorphic pastries of Bunbury. * The civilized rabbits of Bunnybury. * A zebra who holds geographical disputes with a soft-shell crab. Other figures, more familiar to readers of previous books, include the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow, as well as the four tribes of Oz (the Munchkins, the Quadlings, the Gillikins, and the Winkies). The Nome General Guph visits three nations: the Whimsies, the Growleywogs, and the Phanfasms: * The Whimsies are a large and hulking race, but possess disproportionately small heads the size of doorknobs. This causes other species to call them stupid, stripping them of any self-esteem. To deny this, the Whimsies wear enormous, luridly designed masks that cover all of their heads. Their Chief agrees to the deal and sends Guph on his way. The Chief of the Whimsies hopes that when the Nome King reclaims his Magic Belt, he can use its magic to make their heads the size of the masks they wear. * The Growleywogs are muscular giants, possessing no surplus flesh and no mercy. They are arrogant and cruel. Their Grand Gallipoot agrees to the deal in exchange that they grant them 20,000 slaves from the Land of Oz. As such, they are eager not only to help the Nomes conquer Oz, but also to secretly subjugate the Nomes as well. Of the latter plan, they say nothing and send Guph on his way. * Last of his meetings is that which is with the mysterious, diabolical Phanfasms of Phantastico. To Guph, the Phanfasms resemble hairy men, but having the heads of various carnivorous mammals, birds, and reptiles. Their true forms, number, standard of living, culture, and extent of influence remain unknown to both Guph and the reader, although both receive hints in the narrative. The first Phanfasm that Guph encountered was one with the head of an owl after getting passed the scarlet alligator on the bridge. Their bear- headed leader called the First and Foremost agrees to the deal so that they can make people unhappy. The Phanfasms tell him that they will conquer Oz alongside the other armies, but they have a secret plan to turn traitor and dominate their allies. Of the latter plan, they say nothing and send Guph on his way. Having learned of this through Ozma's omniscient Magic Picture, the people of Oz become worried. As the Nomes dig a tunnel for the combined armies to get under the Deadly Desert to the heart of the Emerald City, Ozma uses her Magic Belt to wish for a large amount of dust to appear in the tunnel. Upon emerging, the Nome King's allies therefore drink thirstily from the nearby Fountain of Oblivion, whose waters make them forget their evil plans. The Nome King himself avoids the drink, but is thrown into the fountain by the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, which erases his memory too. Ozma uses the magic belt to send the Nome King and his allies home. To forestall a future invasion of Oz, Glinda the Good Witch uses a magic charm to render Oz invisible and unreachable to everyone except those within the land itself. Commentary The Emerald City of Oz contains more material on the social organization of Oz than most of the earlier books, and as a consequence has attracted commentary on its Utopian aspects.Jack Zipes, When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition, pp. 178‚Äì9 The \\"explicitly socialist\\" economy of Oz has been contrasted to other \\"fantasy\\" projections of socialist societies, like Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888) and William Morris's News from Nowhere (1890). How far such analyses and comparisons should be pursued is, of course, open to debate; as Baum writes of the social structure of Oz in Chapter Three, p. 31, \\"I do not suppose such an arrangement would be practical with us....\\"Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum: Creator of Oz, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; pp. 168‚Äì72. Gregory Maguire, author of the revisionist Oz novels Wicked and Son of a Witch, has written that The Emerald City of Oz \\"is suffused with an elegiac quality\\" and compares its tone with that of The Last Battle, the final volume of C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.. The Forbidden Fountain that Baum introduces to Oz literature in this book recurs in ensuing Oz books, by Baum and by his various successors. The Fountain is an important feature in The Magic of Oz (1919), The Forbidden Fountain of Oz (1980), The Wicked Witch of Oz (1993), and Paradox in Oz (1999). Adaptations The 1986 Japanese animated series Oz no Mah≈çtsukai included the story. It was later shortened and edited into a single feature for US video and DVD release. In 1987, a straight-to-video animated adaptation was made in Canada.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092959/ In popular culture In the 2004 movie Blade: Trinity, Sommerfield is shown reading a Braille copy of the book to her daughter Zoe, including a short description of the Nome King and how he had \\"never tried to be good\\". Later in the movie, Zoe is confronted by the film's main antagonist, Drake, and initially guesses that he is the Nome King.

Morpheus, p. 296; LSJ s.v. ŒºŒøœÅœÜ-ŒÆ. is a god associated with sleep and dreams. In Ovid's Metamorphoses he is the son of Sleep, and he appears in dreams in human form. From the medieval period, the name began to stand more generally for the god of dreams, or of sleep.Kearns, s.v. Morpheus p. 968; Griffin, p. 248. Ovid In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Morpheus is one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep).Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534; Ovid, Metamorphoses 11.633-677. His name derives from the Greek word for form (ŒºŒøœÅœÜŒÆ), and his function was to appear in dreams in human guise. According to Ovid \\"no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents.\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses 11.633-638. Like other gods associated with sleep, Ovid makes Morpheus winged.Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; Griffin, p. 243; Ovid, Metamorphoses 11.652-653. Ovid called Morpheus and his brothers, the other sons of Somnus, the Somnia (\\"dream shapes\\"), saying that they appear in dreams \\"mimicking many forms\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 11.613. Ovid gives names to two more of these sons of Sleep. One called Icelos ('Like'), by the gods, but Phobetor ('Frightener') by men, \\"takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent\\", and Phantasos ('Fantasy'), who \\"puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things\\".Griffin, p. 249; Ovid, Metamorphoses 11.638-643. The three brothers' names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions.Griffin, p. 249. Tripp calls these three figures \\"literary, not mythical concepts\\".Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534. However Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Morpheus and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.Griffin, pp. 179, 249. In the Arts *Robert Burton, in his 1621 Anatomy of Melancholy, refers to a depiction of Morpheus, saying \\"Philostratus paints [Morpheus] in a white and black coat, with a horn and ivory box full of dreams, of the same colours, to signify good and bad\\".Burton, p. 326. *In Carl Michael Bellman's Fredman's Epistle No. 72, \\"Glimmande nymf\\", Morpheus is invoked as the \\"god of sleep\\".Britten Austin, pp. 87‚Äì88. * In Thomas Browne's short tract On Dreams (circa 1660),the physician-philosopher writes of, ' a readie way to read the characters of Morpheus'.

Various sources translate it into English as a caste, or alternatively as a social class. It is the lowest rank of the four varnas. varnas of the Hindu caste system. The word Shudra appears in the Rig veda and it is found in other Hindu texts such as the Manusmriti, Arthashastra and Dharmashastras. Theoretically, Shudras have constituted the hereditary labouring class serving others.; According to Gombrich's study of Buddhist texts, particularly relating to castes in Sri Lankan Buddhist and Tamil Hindu society, \\"The terms Vaisya and Sudra did not correspond to any clear-cut social units, even in the ancient period, but various groups were subsumed under each term (...); In medieval times (say AD 500‚Äì1500) though society was still said to consist of the four classes, this classification seems to have become irrelevant (...)\\" In some cases, they participated in the coronation of kings, or were ministers and kings according to early Indian texts. Origin and Etymology The etymology of the word have been derived from the Sanskrit word Shud meaning pure. Shudra was a common Sanskrit word as any person regardless of his or her JƒÅti could be addressed as Shudra. As mentioned in VƒÅyu-purƒÅ·πáa 70.68, ShudrƒÅ is the name of one of the ten wives of Rishi Atri; and is also the name of the daughter of BhadrƒÅ≈õva and G·∏•·πõtƒÅcƒ´ as per BrahmƒÅ·πá·∏ça-purƒÅ·πáa III. 8.75. As mentioned in Harivamsa, ShudrƒÅ is also the name of one of the ten daughters of RaudrƒÅ≈õva. The theoretical and the original varnas carried to its extreme in the ages following the Vajj Indian period. Many historians trace the advent of caste system post Vedic period and later the texts like Manu Smriti written during those times, codified such regressive social customs into rigid religious laws. It is during this period that concept of JƒÅti was originated and the concept of Varna system was overlapped with JƒÅti through the sanction of these religious texts. The mention of these overlaps of JƒÅti and Varna system is absent in Vedic literature. Texts =Vedas= The term Shudra appears in the Rigveda. This mention is found in a verse in the Purusha Sukta which is one of its 1,028 hymns. While the Rigveda was most likely compiled between c. 1500 BCE, John Muir in 1868 suggested that the verse that mentions the four varnas has \\"every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas\\". The Purusha Sukta verse is now generally considered to have been inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a charter myth. According to Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, \\"there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system\\", and \\"the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality\\". Historian R. S. Sharma states that \\"the Rig Vedic society was neither organized on the basis of social division of labour nor on that of differences in wealth... [it] was primarily organised on the basis of kin, tribe and lineage.\\" According to Romila Thapar, the Vedic text's mention of Shudra and other varnas has been seen as its origin, and that \\"in the varna ordering of society, notions of purity and pollution were central and activities were worked out in this context\\" and it is \\"formulaic and orderly, dividing society into four groups arranged in a hierarchy\\". The word Pusan appears in a Vedic era Upanishad, meaning \\"nourisher\\" and associates it with the creation of earth and production activities that nourishes the whole world, and the text calls this Pusan as Shudra. The term Pusan, in Hindu mythology, is the charioteer of the sun who knows the paths thereby bringing light, knowledge and life to all. The same word Pusan is, however, associated in a Brahmana text to Vaishya. According to Sharma, nowhere in the Vedic text collections \\"is there any evidence of restrictions regarding food and marriage either between the Dasa and Aryan, or between the Shudra and the higher varnas\\". Further, adds Sharma, in late Atharva Veda, \\"Shudra does not come in for notice, probably because his varna did not exist at that stage\\". =Arthashastra= The ancient Hindu text Arthashastra states, according to Sharma, that Aryas were free men and could not be subject to slavery under any circumstances. The text contrasts Aryas with Shudra, but neither as a hereditary slave nor as an economically closed social stratum in a manner that the term Shudra later was interpreted. According to Rangarajan, the law on labour and employment in Arthashastra has led to a variety of different interpretations by different translators and commentators, and \\"the accepted view is that slavery, in the form it was practised in contemporary Greece, did not exist in Kautilyan India\\". Kautilya argued for the rights of Shudras and all classes to participate as warriors. Roger Borsche says that this is so because it is in the self-interest of the ruler to \\"have a people's army fiercely loyal to him precisely because the people had been treated justly\\". =Manusmriti= The Manusmriti predominantly discusses the code of conduct (dharma rules) for the Brahmins (priestly class) and the Kshatriyas (king, administration and warrior class). The text mentions Shudras, as well as Vaishyas, but this part is its shortest section. Sections 9.326 ‚Äì 9.335 of the Manusmriti state eight rules for Vaishyas and two for Shudras. In section 10.43 - 10.44 Manu gives a list of Kshatriya tribes who, through neglect of the priests and their rites, had fallen to the status of Shudras. These are: Pundrakas, Codas, Dravidas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Chinas, Kiratas and Daradas. =Yajnavalkya smriti and Grhyasutras= According to Laurie Patton, a professor of Religion specialising on early Indian religions, the rights and status of Shudra varies widely across early Indian texts. While section 9.15 of Atharvaveda states Shudras may undertake thread wearing ceremony (upanayana), the Apastamba Grhysutra states they may not and excludes the Shudra students from hearing or learning the Vedas. Yajnavalkya Smriti in contrast mentions Shudra students, and the Mahabharata states that all four varnas including the Shudras may hear the Vedas. Other Hindu texts go further and state that the three varnas ‚Äì Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya ‚Äì may acquire knowledge from Shudra teachers, and the yajna sacrifices may be performed by Shudras. These rights and social mobility for Shudras may have arisen in times of lower societal stress and greater economic prosperity, periods that also saw the improvement in the social conditions of women. =Medieval Upanishads= Medieval era texts such as Vajrasuchi Upanishad discuss varna, and include the term Shudra.Mariola Offredi (1997), The banyan tree: essays on early literature in new Indo-Aryan languages, Volume 2, Manohar Publishers, , , page 442M.V. Nadkarni (2005), Review Articles: Perspectives on Dalit Problems and Solutions, Journal of Social and Economic Development, Vol. 7, No. 1, page 99 According to Ashwani Peetush, a professor of Philosophy at the Wilfrid Laurier University, the Vajrasuchi Upanishad is a significant text because it assumes and asserts that any human being from any social background can achieve the highest spiritual state of existence.Ashwani Peetush (2011), Justice and Religion: Hinduism, in Encyclopedia of Global Justice, Springer Netherlands, , pages 596‚Äì600 =Non-Hindu texts= Outside of the conflicting stances within the Hindu texts, non-Hindu texts present a different picture about the Shudras. A Buddhist text, states Patton, \\"refers to Shudras who know the Vedas, grammar, Mimamsa, Samkhya, Vaisheshika and lagna\\". According to Johannes Bronkhorst, a professor of Indology specializing on early Buddhism and Hinduism, the ancient Buddhist canon is predominantly devoid of varna discussion, and Shudra and other varnas are rarely referred to in its ancient discourses. The Buddhist texts do not describe the Indian society as divided into the four var·πáas of \\"Brahmins, Ks·∫°triyas, Vai≈õyas and ≈ö≈´dras\\". Instead, states Bronkhorst, the bulk of society is described as consisting of \\"householders\\" (PƒÅli: gahapati), without internal distinctions. Even where the Brahmins are mentioned in such a context, they too are referred to as householders, or BrƒÅhma·πáa-gahapati. The term va·πá·πáa does appear in the Buddhist texts as few exceptions, but states Bronkhorst, only in the context of abstract divisions of society and it seems to \\"have remained a theoretical concept without any parallel in actual practice\\". Education Historian R. S. Sharma, after discussing several examples concludes that the Dharma≈õƒÅstras did not allow the Shudras access to \\"literate education\\" but allowed them to learn arts and crafts such as elephant training, etc. He also adds that texts denied them Vedic education as it was believed that it impedes agriculture and vice versa. While the other varnas showed varying degrees of literacy, the Shudras were generally illiterate. The social reformer Jyotirao Phule blamed the deterioration of the Shudras on illiteracy and emphasized education for them. Phule stated: Occupation A Gurkha, a Brahmin and a Shudra in an 1868 photo. Traditionally, Shudras were peasants and artisans. The ancient texts designate the Shudra as a peasant. Shudras were described as the giver of grain and ancient texts describe a Shudra's mode of earning as being \\"by the sickle and ears of corn\\". The ancient precept, \\"Vedas are destroyer of agriculture and agriculture is destroyer of Vedas\\", is shown as one of the reasons as to why the Shudras were not allowed to learn Vedas. The fact that peasants were held as Shudras is also documented by Chinese traveller Xuanzang in the 7th century. Also, an \\"outcaste\\" who entered the profession of agriculture would be absorbed in the Shudra varna. The Shudra, states Marvin Davis, are not required to learn the Vedas. They were not \\"twice born\\" (Dvija), and their occupational sphere stated as service (seva) of the other three varna. The word Dvija is neither found in any Vedas and Upanishads, nor is it found in any Vedanga literature such as the Shrauta-sutras or Grihya- sutras. The word is almost entirely missing, in any context, from ancient Sanskrit literature composed before the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, and it scarcely appears in Dharmasutras literature. Increasing mentions of it appear in Dharmasastras texts of mid to late 1st millennium CE. The presence of the word Dvija is a marker that the text is likely a medieval era Indian text. The traditional occupation of Shudra as described by Ghurye is agriculture, trade and crafts. However, this categorisation varies by scholar. As per Drekmeier state \\"Vaishya and Shudra actually shared many occupations and were frequently grouped together\\". The Arthashastra mentions Shudra as artisans, while the Vishnusmriti (3rd century) states all arts to be their occupational domain. In contrast, the Parasarasmriti and other texts state that arts and crafts are the occupational domain of all four varnas. Other sources state that this statement of occupations of Shudra is a theoretical discussion found in select texts, it is not historical. Other Hindu texts such as the epics, states Naheem Jabbar, assert that Shudras played other roles such as kings and ministers. According to Ghurye, in reality, the hereditary occupation aspect of Shudra and other varnas was missing from large parts of India, and all four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras) were agriculturalists, traders or became warriors in large numbers depending on economic opportunity and circumstantial necessities. According to Ghurye: =Bali, Indonesia= Among the Hindu communities of Bali, Indonesia, the Shudra (locally spelled Soedra) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be a Brahmin (Brahmana), Kshatriya (Ksatrya) or Vaishya. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite meweda (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.Jane Belo (1953), Bali: Temple Festival, Monograph 22, American Ethnological Society, University of Washington Press, pages 4-5 =Historical evidence= Scholars have tried to locate historical evidence for the existence and nature of varna and jati in documents and inscriptions of medieval India. Supporting evidence for the existence of varna and jati systems in medieval India has been elusive, and contradicting evidence has emerged. Varna is rarely mentioned in the extensive medieval era records of Andhra Pradesh, for example. This has led Cynthia Talbot, a professor of history and Asian studies, to question whether varna was socially significant in the daily lives of this region. The mention of jati is even rarer, through the 13th century. Two rare temple donor records from warrior families of the 14th century claim to be Shudras. One states that Shudras are the bravest, the other states that Shudras are the purest. Richard Eaton, a professor of History, writes, \\"anyone could become a warrior regardless of social origins, nor do the jati appear as features of people's identity. Occupations were fluid.\\" Evidence shows, according to Eaton, that Shudras were part of the nobility, and many \\"father and sons had different professions, suggesting that social status was earned, not inherited\\" in the Hindu Kakatiya population in the Deccan region between the 11th and 14th centuries. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, none of Ashoka's inscriptions mention the terms Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras, and only mention Brahmins and ≈örama·πáas. Several popular medieval era Bhakti movement poet-saints and religious leaders were born in a Shudra family. Examples include Tukaram and Namdev.Richard M. Eaton (2005), A Social History of the Deccan, 1300‚Äì1761: Eight Indian Lives, Cambridge University Press, , pages 129-130 The compositions of Namdev have been popular not only in the Hindu community of Maharashtra, but also in the Sikh community. Sixty of his compositions were included by the Sikh Gurus of Punjab region as they compiled the Sikhism scripture the Guru Granth Sahib. Commentary A 1908 photo of a bride and bridegroom of the sudra caste in a horse-drawn vehicle. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, a social reformer, believed that there were initially only three varnas: the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya, and that the Shudras were the Kshatriyas who were denied the Upanayana, an initiation ritual, by the Brahmins. This claim has been contested by historians such as R. S. Sharma. Sharma criticized Ambedkar for relying solely on translations of texts for his information, and stated Ambedkar wrote the book with the sole purpose to prove Shudras were of high caste origin, which was very popular among the highly educated parts of the lower castes during that time period. Sri Aurobindo states Shudra and the other varna is a concept found in all human beings in different proportions. He states that this was externalised and mechanised into a system quite different from what it was intended. The tenets of Vedic Hinduism in north India held less sway in the south, where the societal divisions were simply Brahmin and Shudra. However, some non-Brahmins adopted the classification of Sat Shudra (clean Shudra) in an attempt to distinguish themselves from other non-Brahmin communities.

Spoken word refers to an oral poetic performance art that is based mainly on the poetic as well as the performer's aesthetic qualities. It is a continuation of the ancient oral artistic tradition that started in the late 20th century and focuses on the aesthetics of recitation and word play, such as the performer's live intonation and voice inflection. Spoken word is a \\"catchall\\" term that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including poetry readings, poetry slams, jazz poetry, and hip hop music, and can include comedy routines and prose monologues. As spoken word poetry is performed live, it is different from written poetry, because the way it sounds is one of the main components. Unlike written poetry, the poetic text takes its quality less from the visual aesthetics on a page, but depends more on phonaesthetics, or the aesthetics of sound. History Spoken word has existed for many years. Long before writing, through a cycle of practicing, listening and memorizing, each language drew on its resources of sound structure for aural patterns that made spoken poetry very different from ordinary discourse and easier to commit to memory. \\"There were poets long before there were printing presses, poetry is primarily oral utterance, to be said aloud, to be heard.\\" Poetry, like music, appeals to the ear, an effect known as euphony or onomatopoeia, a device to represent a thing or action by a word that imitates sound. \\"Speak again, Speak like rain\\" was how Kikuyu, an East African people, described her verse to author Isak Dinesen, confirming a comment by T. S. Eliot that \\"poetry remains one person talking to another\\".Eliot, T. S. (1942), \\"The Music of Poetry\\" (lecture). Glasgow: Jackson. The oral tradition is one that is conveyed primarily by speech as opposed to writing, in predominantly oral cultures proverbs (also known as maxims) are convenient vehicles for conveying simple beliefs and cultural attitudes. \\"The hearing knowledge we bring to a line of poetry is a knowledge of a pattern of speech we have known since we were infants\\". Performance poetry, which is kindred to performance art, is explicitly written to be performed aloud and consciously shuns the written form. \\"Form\\", as Donald Hall records \\"was never more than an extension of content.\\" Performance poetry in Africa dates to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry, while elegiac and panegyric court poetry were developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys.Finnegan, Ruth (2012), Oral Literature in Africa, Open Book Publishers. One of the best known griot epic poems was created for the founder of the Mali Empire, the Epic of Sundiata. In African culture, performance poetry is a part of theatrics, which was present in all aspects of pre-colonial African lifeJohn Conteh-Morgan, John (1994), \\"African Traditional Drama and Issues in Theater and Performance Criticism\\", Comparative Drama. and whose theatrical ceremonies had many different functions: political, educative, spiritual and entertainment. Poetics were an element of theatrical performances of local oral artists, linguists and historians, accompanied by local instruments of the people such as the kora, the xalam, the mbira and the djembe drum. Drumming for accompaniment is not to be confused with performances of the \\"talking drum\\", which is a literature of its own, since it is a distinct method of communication that depends on conveying meaning through non-musical grammatical, tonal and rhythmic rules imitating speech.Finnegan (2012), Oral Literature in Africa, pp. 467-484.Stern, Theodore (1957), Drum and Whistle Languages: An Analysis of Speech Surrogates, University of Oregon. Although, they could be included in performances of the griots. In ancient Greece, the spoken word was the most trusted repository for the best of their thought, and inducements would be offered to men (such as the rhapsodes) who set themselves the task of developing minds capable of retaining and voices capable of communicating the treasures of their culture. The Ancient Greeks included Greek lyric, which is similar to spoken-word poetry, in their Olympic Games. =Development in the United States= This poem is about the IMF; the poet expresses his political concerns about the IMF's practices and about globalization. Vachel Lindsay helped maintain the tradition of poetry as spoken art in the early twentieth century.'Reading list, Biography ‚Äì Vachel Lindsay' Poetry Foundation.org Chicago 2015 Robert Frost also spoke well, his meter accommodating his natural sentences. Poet laureate Robert Pinsky said, \\"Poetry's proper culmination is to be read aloud by someone's voice, whoever reads a poem aloud becomes the proper medium for the poem.\\" \\"Every speaker intuitively courses through manipulation of sounds, it is almost as though 'we sing to one another all day'.\\" \\"Sound once imagined through the eye gradually gave body to poems through performance, and late in the 1950s reading aloud erupted in the United States.\\" Some American spoken- word poetry originated from the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance, blues, and the Beat Generation of 1960s. Spoken word in African-American culture drew on a rich literary and musical heritage. Langston Hughes and writers of the Harlem Renaissance were inspired by the feelings of the blues and spirituals, hip-hop, and slam poetry artists were inspired by poets such as Hughes in their word stylings. The Civil Rights Movement also influenced spoken word. Notable speeches such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\", Sojourner Truth's \\"Ain't I a Woman?\\", and Booker T. Washington's \\"Cast Down Your Buckets\\" incorporated elements of oration that influenced the spoken word movement within the African-American community. The Last Poets was a poetry and political music group formed during the 1960s that was born out of the Civil Rights Movement and helped increase the popularity of spoken word within African-American culture. Spoken word poetry entered into wider American culture following the release of Gil Scott-Heron's spoken-word poem \\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\\" on the album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox in 1970.Sisario, Ben (May 28, 2011), Ben Sisario, \\"Gil Scott-Heron, Voice of Black Protest Culture, Dies at 62\\", The New York Times. The Nuyorican Poets Caf√© on New York's Lower Eastside was founded in 1973, and is one of the oldest American venues for presenting spoken-word poetry.\\"The History of Nuyorican Poetry Slam\\" , Verbs on Asphalt. In the 1980s, spoken-word poetry competitions, often with elimination rounds, emerged and were labelled \\"poetry slams\\". American poet Marc Smith is credited with starting the poetry slam in November 1984. In 1990, the first National Poetry Slam took place in Fort Mason, San Francisco. The poetry slam movement reached a wider audience following Russell Simmons' Def Poetry, which was aired on HBO between 2002 and 2007. The poets associated with the Buffalo Readings were active early in the 21st century. =International development= Kenyan spoken word poet Mumbi Machari is based. Outside of the United States, artists such as French singer- songwriters L√©o Ferr√© and Serge Gainsbourg made personal use of spoken word over rock or symphonic music from the beginning of the 1970s in such albums as Amour Anarchie (1970), Histoire de Melody Nelson (1971), and Il n'y a plus rien (1973), and contributed to the popularization of spoken word within French culture. In the UK, musicians who have performed spoken word lyrics include Blur, The Streets and Kate Tempest. In 2003, the movement reached its peak in France with Fabien Marsaud aka Grand Corp Malade being a forerunner of the genre. In Zimbabwe spoken word has been mostly active on stage through the House of Hunger Poetry slam in Harare, Mlomo Wakho Poetry Slam in Bulawayo as well as the Charles Austin Theatre in Masvingo. Festivals such as Harare International Festival of the Arts, Intwa Arts Festival KoBulawayo and Shoko Festival have supported the genre for a number of years. In Nigeria, there are poetry events such as Wordup by i2x Media, The Rendezvous by FOS (Figures Of Speech movement), GrrrAttitude by Graciano Enwerem, SWPC which happens frequently, Rhapsodist, a conference by J19 Poetry and More Life Concert (an annual poetry concert in Port Harcourt) by More Life Poetry.

In Trinidad and Tobago, this art form is widely used as a form of social commentary and is displayed all throughout the nation at all times of the year. The main poetry events in Trinidad and Tobago are overseen by an organization called the 2 Cent Movement. They host an annual event in partnership with the NGC Bocas Lit Fest and First Citizens Bank called \\"The First Citizens national Poetry Slam\\", formerly called \\"Verses\\". This organization also hosts poetry slams and workshops for primary and secondary schools. It is also involved in social work and issues. In Ghana, the poetry group Ehalakasa led by Sir Black, holds monthly TalkParty events (collaborative endeavour with Nubuke Foundation and/ National Theatre of Ghana) and special events such as the Ehalakasa Slam Festival and end-of-year events. This group has produced spoken-word poets including Mutombo da Poet, Chief Moomen, Nana Asaase, Rhyme Sonny, Koo Kumi, Hondred Percent, Jewel King, Faiba Bernard, Akambo, Wordrite, Natty Ogli, and Philipa. The spoken word movement in Ghana is rapidly growing that individual spoken word artists like MEGBORNA,https://hypercitigh.com/personality-of-the- week/meet-knust-finest-spoken-word-artist-chris-edzordzi-parker-mogborna/ are continuously carving a niche for themselves and stretching the borders of spoken word by combining spoken word with 3D animations and spoken word video game, based on his yet to be released poem, Alkebulan. Megborna performing at the First Kvngs Edition of the Megborna Concert,2019 In Kumasi, the creative group CHASKELE holds an annual spoken word event on the campus of KNUST giving platform to poets and other creatives. Poets like Elidior The Poet, Slimo, T-Maine are key members of this group. In Kenya, there is an annual poetry slam. In Israel, in 2011 there was a monthly Spoken Word Line in a local club in Tel-Aviv by the name of: \\"Word Up!\\". The line was organized by Binyamin Inbal and was the beginning of a successful movement of spoken word lovers and performers all over the country. Competitions Judges from a poetry slam listen to the contestants. Spoken-word poetry is often performed in a competitive setting. In 1990, the first National Poetry Slam was held in San Francisco. It is the largest poetry slam competition event in the world, now held each year in different cities across the United States.Poetry Slam, Inc. Web. November 28, 2012. The popularity of slam poetry has resulted in slam poetry competitions being held across the world, at venues ranging from coffeehouses to large stages. Movement Spoken-word poetry is typically more than a hobby or expression of talent. This art form is often used to convey important or controversial messages to society. Such messages often include raising awareness of topics such as: racial inequality, sexual assault and/or rape culture, anti-bullying messages, body positive campaigns, and LGBTQ topics. Slam poetry competitions often feature loud and radical poems that display both intense content and sound. Spoken-word poetry is also abundant on college campuses, YouTube, and through forums such as Button Poetry. Some spoken-word poems go viral and can then appear in articles, on TED talks, and on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

He is portrayed by Laurence Fishburne in the films, and in the video game The Matrix: Path of Neo where he was the only actor to reprise his character's voice. Concept and creation Lana and Lilly Wachowski, the creators of The Matrix franchise, instructed Fishburne to base his performance on Morpheus, a character in Neil Gaiman's comic book series The Sandman. At the studio's request, Gaiman later wrote \\"Goliath\\", a promotional short story set in the film's universe. The name Morpheus is that of the god of dreams in Greek mythology, which is consistent with the character's involvement with the \\"dreaming\\" of the Matrix. The mythical Morpheus and his family, including two brothers (Phobetor and Phantasos), lived in a dream world protected by the Gates of Morpheus with two monsters standing guard. Beyond the gates were the River of Forgetfulness, beside which Morpheus once carried his father to hide in a cave, and the River of Oblivion. This theme of duality carries over to Morpheus in The Matrix, who offers Neo either a blue pill (to forget about The Matrix and continue to live in the world of illusion) or a red pill (to enter the painful world of reality). Overview In the Matrix films, Morpheus is the captain of the Nebuchadnezzar, which is a hovercraft of the human forces of the last human city, Zion, in a devastated world where most humans are grown by sentient machines and kept imprisoned in the Matrix, a virtual computer-generated world. Morpheus was once a human living inside the Matrix until he was freed. Morpheus is apparently a very popular public figure in the city of Zion. He is also known in the Matrix, but as a dangerous terrorist wanted by 'Agents', who appear to be Federal investigators but are sentient computer programs that patrol the Matrix, eliminating any threat to the Matrix. Like other hovercraft crews, Morpheus and his crew are dedicated to the protection of Zion and the freeing of humans from the Matrix. Earlier in his life, Morpheus gained the romantic attention of Niobe, another hovercraft captain. Their relationship became estranged shortly after Morpheus visited the Oracle, an ally living in the Matrix, who told Morpheus that he would be the person who would find the One, a human having superhuman abilities within the Matrix who could end the human/machine war. Since that visit, Morpheus has spent much of his life searching the Matrix for the One. Personality In The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, Morpheus was known to be a truly inspirational leader and influential teacher to many people, particularly the majority of his crew, to the extent that Tank commented that \\"Morpheus was a father to them, as well as a leader\\". In The Matrix Revolutions, with Morpheus's faith in the prophecy shattered, he doesn't appear as strong a leader as he was in the first two films. Despite his strong faith, Morpheus still showed some rationality in dangerous situations rather than blindly relying on his beliefs to see him through the current crisis; perhaps his only truly irrational decision was to attack Agent Smith while unarmed in order to give Neo a chance to escape. His strong, almost single-minded belief in Neo as the One has very strong Biblical correlations to that of John the Baptist's belief in the prophecy of the Messiah. Like Morpheus preaching about the imminent return of the One into the Matrix, John was preaching in the desert of the Messiah's imminent return, and actively searched for the Messiah to come who would deliver his people from bondage. Upon finding Jesus, he believed so strongly in Jesus as the Messiah, John willingly stepped aside and let Christ take up the groundwork that John had created and laid before him, and continue where John had left off. Character history =The Matrix= In the first feature film, The Matrix, Morpheus successfully finds and monitors a man named Thomas A. Anderson, a hacker who calls himself Neo. Despite a close call with Agents that capture, interrogate, and place a surveillance device on Neo, Morpheus and his crew locate him. Morpheus offers Neo a choice of ingesting a red pill, which will activate a trace program to locate Neo's body in the real world and allow the Nebuchadnezzar crew to extract him, or a blue pill, which will leave Neo in the Matrix to live and believe as he wishes. Neo takes the red pill. The Nebuchadnezzar crew is then able to eject Neo's body from the Matrix powerplant and retrieve him from the cold sewers where the machines patrol. Morpheus takes a risk in helping Neo escape the Matrix, as human minds that live too long in the Matrix may have trouble in comprehending the reality. Initially, Neo does experience denial when Morpheus explains the truth, a point for which Morpheus apologizes. Shortly after Neo visits the Oracle, Morpheus is captured by agents who plan to hack into his mind. Because Morpheus, as a hovercraft captain, possesses access codes to the Zion mainframe computer, the surviving members of the ship's crew are about to unplug Morpheus from the Matrix, without reconnecting his mind and body, a process that will kill him. Neo and Trinity, however, reenter the Matrix to make a daring and successful rescue of Morpheus. Neo saves Trinity from a helicopter crash, confirming Morpheus' belief that Neo is indeed the One. Neo is eventually killed by Agent Smith shortly after the rescue, but revived as the One and returned to the Nebuchadnezzar before the Machines' Sentinels can destroy the ship. =The Matrix Reloaded= In the second film, The Matrix Reloaded, Morpheus is more confident that the war is nearing its end. A spiritual as well as an influential leader, Morpheus convinces one hovercraft ship to stay in the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle, despite orders from Zion for all ships to return to the city. Here he incurs the wrath of Jason Locke, commander of the Zion defensive forces; but Morpheus' actions are defended by Councillor Hamann, a member of the city's ruling body. With the aid of Trinity and Niobe, Morpheus successfully retrieves the Keymaker, an exiled program that can access many hidden areas of the Matrix, including the Source, the central Machine City mainframe computer and programming heart of the Matrix. Morpheus aids Neo in successfully entering the door to the Source before returning to the Nebuchadnezzar. After Neo enters the Source and returns from the Matrix with new information, he tells Morpheus that the Prophecy was a system of control that would bring the One to the Source to disseminate the programming inside Neo into the Matrix to allow a reload of the Matrix while Zion is destroyed by the machines and rebuilt by the One and red pills. A sudden Sentinel attack destroys the Nebuchadnezzar, further damaging Morpheus' belief in the outcome of the war. Upon witnessing the destruction of his ship, he quotes the Biblical Nebuchadnezzar; \\"I have dreamed a dream... but now that dream has gone from me.\\" The crew is rescued by the hovercraft Mjolnir commanded by Captain Roland, who joins forces with the craft Logos commanded by Niobe. =The Matrix Revolutions= In the final film, The Matrix Revolutions, Morpheus is somewhat dispirited, and has problems in understanding now what may happen to Zion and its people. Now without a ship of his own, he and Link (the Nebuchadnezzar's Operator) reside on the hovercraft Mjolnir, commanded by Roland. Morpheus renews his conviction that Neo could still save Zion, and supports Trinity in finding Neo, whose mind is trapped in a computer netherworld called Mobil Avenue, despite not being jacked in. Morpheus is called to the Oracle with Trinity, and with the Oracle's guardian, Seraph, he helps Trinity rescue Neo, via a visit to the Merovingian's lair and a Mexican standoff. Morpheus says farewell to Neo and Trinity before they leave for the Machine City in the hovercraft Logos to stop the war. Morpheus then aids Niobe as she flies the Mjolnir in a desperate ride back to Zion. The ship successfully stops the first onslaught of the Machine attack with the ship's electromagnetic pulse weapon. When the Sentinels suddenly stop a second wave of attacks, Morpheus realises that Neo is somehow fighting for them. When the Sentinels retreat after Neo defeats the former Agent Smith, now a virus that has threatened both humans and machines, Morpheus and Niobe embrace in celebration as cheers arise from the Zion population, who have received a brokered peace through Neo's sacrifice. Of the original Nebuchadnezzar crew in the Matrix, Morpheus is the only surviving member to see freedom for Zion. Referring to the subjectivity of reality throughout the film trilogy, Morpheus' last line in Matrix Revolutions, said in disbelief as the Sentinels retreat from Zion, is \\"Is this real?\\". =The Matrix Online= In Chapter 1.2 of The Matrix Online, Morpheus grows impatient with the machines and demands that they return the body of Neo. After many unanswered public speeches threatening action, Morpheus starts terrorist attacks throughout the Matrix. These attacks take the form of weapons that reveal the Matrix's inner workings (its code) for all human beings to see, even those not yet awakened to the simulation. This is known to have caused mass panic and forced awakenings to those not ready to see the truth. By killing Morpheus' simulacrum guards, redpills were however able to find means of disabling Morpheus' bombs. During the game events on May 26, 2005 (as recorded on the game's official website), Morpheus plants a code bomb in the Rumbaar water treatment facility. After planting the bomb, he realizes he is being hunted by the enigmatic, masked figure known as the Assassin. Morpheus escapes the treatment facility; however, upon his leaving, the Assassin bends the code of the Matrix and emerges from a vent in the wall. Morpheus is caught off-guard and is unable to dodge the Assassin's bullets. He dies from gunshot wounds. Some players argued against the death of the character Morpheus as the Matrix now provides an \\"Emergency Jack-Out\\" upgrade for redpills, eliminating the permanent death that previous redpills experienced if killed within the Matrix before the Truce. This feature could save a redpill's life with no fatal injuries. It was later revealed that the Assassin's bullets had contained a new form of code encryption, named a \\"kill code,\\" which bypassed this technology. These kill codes are explained to be extremely difficult to produce and usually require a direct sample of the subject's residual self- image data, thus making them extremely rare and only used in the most extreme and specialist of circumstances. These codes were utilized later in the story as well, being the basis of function for The Apothecary character and the subject of The Oracle's plan to wound the Oligarchy. Rumors and the popular belief of a faked death still run rampant however, largely based on the fact that prior to Morpheus' assassination a few select redpills were sent an email stating that he would likely \\"fade away\\" and hide. As with Neo, Morpheus' remains in the real world have yet to be found. Simulacra During Chapter 6 a figure appeared resembling Morpheus. It took the form of an RSI transmission, apparently originating from the Real World and spread disjointed messages about Neo's survival and imprisonment at the hands of The Machines. This was later revealed to be nothing more than a farce created by The General to sow dissent between Zion and The Machines, an effort he'd hoped would renew conflict between the two parties and give him purpose again. The fake, a Morpheus Simulacrum created from Zion records of the captain, took on a greater role once its master ordered it to deactivate itself. Disobeying its initial programming and refusing to shut down, the program went on to, over time, gain greater levels of self-awareness and sentience. It proved instrumental in The Machines' unlocking of the Zion RSI Database acquired during the 6th destruction of Zion as part of the renewed war effort following the Cypherite discovery of New Zion. This wasn't however done with malicious intent, in fact, the Simulacrum's personality was notably innocent, being more concerned with the world around it and its own existence than taking sides in any political or ideological struggles. In later chapters the Morpheus Simulacrum played a supporting role in the Oracle's faked death and subsequent plan to weaken the Oligarch forces threatening The Matrix. Approached by the Oligarch Halborn during his research into the life of The One, the Simulacrum coldly dismissed the Intruder's actions as only leading to his inevitable defeat.

He was the grandson of Emperor Zhang. When her infant stepson Emperor Shang succeeded to the throne in 106, Empress Dowager Deng kept the then-12-year-old Crown Prince Liu Hu in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the infant emperor's death and the successor to the throne. Prince Hu ascended the throne and became emperor when Emperor Shang died in August or September 106; however, Empress Dowager Deng still remained as the regent until her death in 121. Thereafter, Emperor An removed many of her relatives from government and many of them committed suicide, probably under duress. Emperor An did little to revive the withering dynasty. He began to indulge himself in women and heavy drinking and paid little attention to affairs of state, instead leaving matters to corrupt eunuchs. In this way, he effectively became the first emperor in Han history to encourage corruption. He also trusted his wife Empress Yan Ji and her family deeply, despite their obvious corruption. At the same time, droughts ravaged the country while peasants rose up in arms. In 125, Emperor An died while travelling to Nanyang. He was only 31. Family background and accession to the throne Then-Prince Hu was born in 94, to Prince Liu Qing of Qinghe and his concubine, Consort Zuo Xiao E (). Prince Qing was the older brother of Emperor He, and had once been crown prince under their father, Emperor Zhang, until the machinations of Emperor Zhang's wife, Empress Dou, led to his removal and his mother Consort Song's death. During Emperor He's reign, however, he was a trusted advisor to the emperor, and he had a major role in Emperor He's coup d'√©tat against Empress Dou's domineering brother, Dou Xian, in 92. When they were young, consort Zuo and her older sister Da E () were both confiscated and made court servant girls because their uncle, Zuo Sheng (), had been executed for making defamatory remarks against the emperor or imperial administration. As they grew older, they became known for beauty and talent and became ladies in waiting in Emperor He's palace; Xiao E was particularly known for her knowledge in history and poetry. At Prince Qing's request, Emperor He rewarded him with the two consorts. Both died sometime before Emperor He's death in 106 and were buried in the capital Luoyang. After Consort Zuo's death, Prince Hu was raised by Prince Qing's wife, Consort Geng (). When Emperor He died in 106, his infant son, Emperor Shang, ascended the throne. Most of Emperor He's brothers, including Prince Qing, remained in the palace at Luoyang but were ordered to report to their principalities. As an insurance measure, Emperor He's wife, Empress Dowager Deng, kept Prince Qing's wife and 12-year-old son (Prince Hu). When Emperor Shang died later in 106, the officials largely wanted to make Emperor Shang's brother, Prince Sheng () of Pingyuan, emperor. However, Empress Deng had initially denied Prince Sheng the throne because she believed him to be frequently ill; she was concerned that he would bear a grudge against her. At her insistence, Prince Hu ascended the throne as Emperor An. Early reign: regency by Empress Dowager Deng After Emperor An ascended the throne, however, the real power remained in Empress Dowager Deng's hands. She sent Consort Geng to join her husband in the Principality of Qinghe (in modern central Hebei) so that Emperor An had no real influence on the administration. Empress Dowager Deng was generally a capable ruler. While there were natural disasters and wars with Qiang and South Xiongnu, she generally coped with those emergencies well. She also carried out many criminal law reforms. During her regency, Emperor An appeared to have minimal input into the affairs of state. Meanwhile, he became heavily personally influenced by the eunuchs Jiang Jing () and Li Run (), and even more so by his wet nurse Wang Sheng (). He also was heavily influenced by his favorite consorts, Yan Ji (). He made Yan Ji empress in 115, even though she had poisoned one of his other consorts, Consort Li, who had given birth to his only son Liu Bao () earlier that year. While these people lacked real power as long as Empress Dowager Deng lived, they were planning to take power as soon as she was no longer be on the scene. Empress Dowager Deng was somewhat aware of these plans and was offended; she was also disappointed that Emperor An, who was considered a precocious and intelligent child, had neglected his studies and became only interested in drinking and women. It is suspected that at some point, she even considered replacing the emperor with his cousin Liu Yi (), the Prince of Pingyuan. However, she eventually decided against it. In 120, Emperor An named his only son, Prince Bao, crown prince. Late reign Empress Dowager Deng died in 121. At the age of 27, Emperor An finally had the reins of the imperial administration. He posthumously honored his father Prince Qing as Emperor Xiaode and his mother Consort Zuo as Empress Xiaode; his paternal grandmother Consort Song as Empress Jingyin; and his stepmother Consort Geng with the unique title of \\"Grand Consort of GƒÅnl√≠ng\\" (ÁîòÈôµÂ§ßË≤¥‰∫∫, Ganling being Prince Qing's tomb), a title inferior to his mother's, even though Consort Geng was his father's wife. He, however, was close to her and her brother Geng Bao (), and he quickly made his step-uncle a powerful official in his administration. Initially, Emperor An continued to follow Empress Dowager Deng's policies, including leaving members of her clan in important advisory positions. However, his own close circle of associates, including Jiang, Li, Wang, and Empress Yan, were ready to act. Late in 121, he stripped members of the Deng clan of their posts and fiefs, and many of them committed suicide, probably under duress. Later, he relented and allowed some of the survivors to return, but by that time the Deng clan had been decimated. In the place of the Dengs, the Song clan of Emperor An's grandmother became honored, but wielding much more actual power were the clan of the empress, the Yans‚Äîin particular Empress Yan's brothers Yan Xian (), Yan Jing (), and Yan Yao (). Also powerful were the eunuchs Jiang and Li, who had been made marquesses. They, along with several other eunuchs, as well as Wang and her daughter Bo Rong (), became extremely corrupt in their ways. Emperor An ignored criticism of these people and failed to punish them for their corruption. He often listened to their suggestions while ignoring the advice of his key officials. One of the most outspoken ones, Yang Zhen (), the commander of the armed forces, was eventually removed from his post in 124 and committed suicide in protest. In 121, there were again Qiang and Xianbei rebellions, which would continue to plague Emperor An for the rest of his reign. The only border where there were Han accomplishments during Emperor An's reign was on the northwestern front‚Äîthe Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia)‚Äîwhere Ban Chao's son Ban Yong () was able to reestablish Han dominance over a number of kingdoms. In 124, Wang Sheng, Jiang Jing, and another eunuch Fan Feng () falsely accused Crown Prince Bao's wet nurse Wang Nan () and chef Bing Ji (ÈÇ¥Âêâ, not to be confused with Emperor Xuan's prime minister of the same name), and Wang and Bing were executed. Crown Prince Bao was greatly saddened. Jiang and Fan, fearful of reprisals later, entered into a conspiracy with Empress Yan (who had always hated Crown Prince Bao as not born of herself) to falsely accuse Crown Prince Bao and his servants of crimes. Emperor An believed these charges, and demoted Crown Prince Bao to Prince of Jiyin. In 125, Emperor An was on a trip to Wancheng (ÂÆõÂüé, in modern Nanyang, Henan) when he suddenly felt ill and decided to return to Luoyang. Before he could, however, he died. Empress Yan did not want to allow his son Prince Bao to be emperor. Instead, she made Liu Yi () emperor; Liu Yi had been the Marquess of Beixiang and was both a grandson of Emperor Zhang and Emperor An's cousin. He is generally believed to have been far younger than Prince Bao, who was ten years old at the time, though his actual age is not recorded in history. The young emperor, however, died later that year, and a number of eunuchs loyal to Prince Bao, led by Sun Cheng, carried out a coup d'√©tat and made Prince Bao emperor (as Emperor Shun). The Yans were slaughtered, except for Empress Dowager Yan.

Shear (and tension) loads can be transferred between two structural elements by either a bearing-type connection or a slip-critical connection. In a slip-critical connection, loads are transferred from one element to another through friction forces developed between the faying surfaces of the connection. These friction forces are generated by the extreme tightness of the structural bolts holding the connection together. These bolts, usually tension control bolts or compressible washer tension indicating type bolts, are tensioned to a minimum required amount to generate large enough friction forces between the faying surfaces such that the shear (or tension) load is transferred by the structural members and not by the bolts (in shear) and the connection plates (in bearing). The \\"turn of the nut\\" method is also widely used to achieve that state of friction. If slip-critical connections fail (by slipping), they revert to bearing-type connections, with structural forces now transferred through bolt shear and connection plate bearing. Thus a slippage failure of a slip-critical connection is not necessarily a catastrophic failure. However, slippage of a slip-critical connection in columns may lead to column instability. Slippage of a slip critical joint in a roof truss could result in unintended ponding effects. The faying surfaces of slip-critical connections must be properly prepared in order to maximize friction forces between the surfaces joined. Usually, this requires cleaning, descaling, roughening, and/or blasting of the faying surfaces. Painting the faying surfaces with a class B primer also allows being in accordance with most of the design that asks for Slip-critical joint.

Recruited from MIT, he joined Theodore von K√°rm√°n's group at Caltech. During WWII, he was involved in the Manhattan Project, which ultimately led to the successful development of the first atomic bomb in America. Later on, he would eventually return to China, where he would make important contributions to China's missile and space program. During the Second Red Scare, in the 1950s, the US federal government accused him of communist sympathies. In 1950, despite protests by his colleagues, he was stripped of his security clearance. He decided to return to China, but he was detained at Terminal Island, near Los Angeles. After spending five years under house arrest, he was released in 1955 in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots who had been captured during the Korean War. He left the United States in September 1955 on the American President Lines passenger liner SS President Cleveland, arriving in China via Hong Kong. Upon his return, he helped lead the Chinese nuclear weapons program. This effort ultimately led to China's first successful atomic bomb test and hydrogen bomb test, making China the fifth nuclear weapons state, and achieving the fastest fission-to-fusion development in history. Additionally, Qian's work led to the development of the Dongfeng ballistic missile and the Chinese space program. For his contributions, he became known as the \\"Father of Chinese Rocketry\\", nicknamed the \\"King of Rocketry\\". He is recognized as one of the founding fathers of Two Bombs, One Satellite. In 1957, Qian was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He served as a Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 1987 to 1998. He was the cousin of mechanical engineer Hsue-Chu Tsien, who was involved in the aerospace industries of China and the United States; his nephew is Roger Y. Tsien, the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  Early life and education  Qian was born in Shanghai, with ancestral roots in Hangzhou. He graduated from The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, with Lu Shijia as classmate, and attended National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiaotong University) in 1934. There, he received a degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis on railroad administration. He interned at Nanchang Air Force Base. In August 1935, Qian left China on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a Master of Science degree after one year. While at MIT he was called Hsue-Shen Tsien. He was influenced by the methods of American engineering education, especially its focus on experimentation. This was in contrast to the contemporary approach practiced by many Chinese scientists, which emphasized theoretical elements rather than \\"hands-on\\" experience. Tsien's experiments included plotting of pitot pressures using mercury-filled manometers. Theodore von K√°rm√°n, Tsien's doctoral advisor, described their first meeting: K√°rm√°n made his home a social scene for the aerodynamicists of Pasadena, and Tsien was drawn in: \\"Tsien enjoyed visiting my home, and my sister took to him because of his interesting ideas and straightforward manner.\\"  Career in the United States  Left to right: Ludwig Prandtl (German scientist), Hsue-Shen Tsien, Theodore von K√°rm√°n. Prandtl served Germany during World War II; von K√°rm√°n and Tsien served the United States; after 1956, Tsien served China. Tsien's overseas cap displays his temporary U.S. Army rank of colonel. Prandtl was von K√°rm√°n's doctoral adviser; von K√°rm√°n in turn was Tsien's. Shortly after arriving at Caltech in 1936, Tsien became fascinated with the rocketry ideas of Frank Malina, other students of von K√°rm√°n, and their associates, including Jack Parsons. Along with his fellow students, he was involved in rocket-related experiments at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech. Around the university, the dangerous and explosive nature of their work earned them the nickname \\"Suicide Squad.\\" Tsien received his PhD from Caltech in 1939. During the Second World War, Tsien worked in the Manhattan Project, which led to America successfully developing the first atomic bomb. In 1943, Tsien and two other members of their rocketry group drafted the first document to use the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory, originally a proposal to the Army for developing missiles in response to Germany's V-2 rocket. This led to Private A, which flew in 1944, and later the Corporal, the WAC Corporal, and other designs. In 1945, as an Army colonel with a security clearance, Tsien was sent to Germany to investigate laboratories and question German scientists, including Wernher von Braun. Von K√°rm√°n wrote of Tsien, \\"At the age of 36, he was an undisputed genius whose work was providing an enormous impetus to advances in high-speed aerodynamics and jet propulsion.\\" During this time, he worked on designing an intercontinental space plane, which would later inspire the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a precursor to the American Space Shuttle. Tsien married Jiang Ying (ËíãËã±), a famed opera singer and the daughter of Jiang Baili (ËíãÁôæÈáå) and his wife, Japanese nurse Sat√¥ Yato. The elder Jiang was a military strategist and adviser to Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. The Tsiens were married on September 14, 1947Chang (1995), p. 139. in Shanghai, and had two children; their son Qian Yonggang (Èí±Ê∞∏Âàö, also known as Yucon Tsien) was born in Boston on October 13, 1948,Chang (1995), p. 141. while their daughter Qian Yongzhen (Èí±Ê∞∏Áúü) was born in early 1950Chang (1995), p. 153. when the family was residing in Pasadena, California. Shortly after his wedding, Tsien returned to America to take up a teaching position at MIT. Jiang Ying would join him in December 1947.Chang (1995), pp. 139‚Äì140. In 1949, with the recommendation of von K√°rm√°n, Tsien became Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion at Caltech. In 1947, Tsien was granted a permanent resident permit, and in 1949, he applied for naturalization, although he could not obtain citizenship. Except for the memories of a few individuals, there is no other official proof indicating that Tsien had tried to apply for naturalization. Years later, his wife Jiang Ying said in an interview with Phoenix Television that Tsien did not apply for naturalization. = Detention = By the early 1940s, US Army Intelligence was already aware of allegations that Tsien was a Communist, but his security clearance was not suspended.Chang (1995), p. 158. However, on June 6, 1950, his security clearance was revoked and Tsien was questioned by the FBI. Two weeks later Tsien announced that he would be resigning from Caltech and returning to China, which by then was effectively governed by the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong.Chang (1995), pp. 149‚Äì150. In August, Tsien had a conversation on the subject with the then Under Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball, whom Tsien knew on a personal basis. After Tsien told him of the allegations, Kimball responded, \\"Hell, I don't think you're a Communist\\", at which point Tsien indicated that he still intended to leave the country, saying \\"I'm Chinese. I don't want to build weapons to kill my countrymen. It's that simple.\\" Kimball then said, \\"I won't let you out of the country.\\" After the firm in charge of arranging Tsien's move back to China tipped off U.S. Customs that some of the papers encountered among his possessions were marked \\"Secret\\" or \\"Confidential,\\" U.S. officials seized them from a Pasadena warehouse. The U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Service issued a warrant for Tsien's arrest on August 25. Tsien claimed that the security-stamped documents were mostly written by himself and had outdated classifications, adding that, \\"There were some drawings and logarithm tables, etc., which someone might have mistaken for codes.\\"Chang (1995), p. 157. Included in the material was a scrapbook with news clippings about the trials of those charged with atomic espionage, such as Klaus Fuchs.Chang (1995), p. 160. Subsequent examination of the documents showed they contained no classified material. While at Caltech, Tsien had secretly attended meetings with J. Robert Oppenheimer's brother Frank Oppenheimer, Jack Parsons, and Frank Malina that were organized by the Russian-born Jewish chemist Sidney Weinbaum and called Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party.Ray Monk, Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center Random House (2012) Weinbaum's trial commenced on August 30 and both Frank Oppenheimer and Parsons testified against him.George Pendle, Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons Mariner Books (2006) p. 291. Weinbaum was convicted of perjury and sentenced to four years.Chang (1995), p. 159. Tsien was taken into custody on September 6, 1950 for questioning and for two weeks detained at Terminal Island, a low-security United States federal prison near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. When Tsien had returned from China with his new bride in 1947, he had answered \\"no\\" on an immigration questionnaire that asked if he ever had been a member of an organization advocating overthrow of the U.S. Government by force. This, together with an American Communist Party document from 1938 with Tsien's name on it, was used to argue that Tsien was a national security threat. Prosecutors also cited a cross-examination session where Tsien said, \\"I owe allegiance to the people of China\\" and would \\"certainly not\\" let the United States government make his decision for him as to whom he would owe allegiance to in the event of a conflict between the U.S. and communist China. On April 26, 1951, Tsien was declared subject to deportation and forbidden from leaving Los Angeles County without permission, effectively placing him under house arrest. During this time, Tsien wrote Engineering Cybernetics, which was published by McGraw Hill in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing servomechanisms. In its 18 chapters, it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, control design by perturbation theory, and von Neumann's theory of error control (chapter 18). Ezra Krendel reviewedEzra Krendel (1955) \\"Review of Engineering Cybernetics\\", Journal of the Franklin Institute 259(4): 367 the book, stating that it is \\"difficult to overstate the value of Tsien's book to those interested in the overall theory of complex control systems.\\" Evidently, Tsien's approach is primarily practical, as Krendel notes that for servomechanisms, the \\"usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used.\\"  Return to China  Qian became the subject of five years of secret diplomacy and negotiation between the U.S. and China. During this time, he lived under constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any classified research duties. Qian received support from his colleagues at Caltech during his incarceration, including president Lee DuBridge, who flew to Washington to argue Qian's case. Caltech appointed attorney Grant Cooper to defend Qian. The travel ban on Qian was lifted on , and he resigned from Caltech shortly thereafter. President Dwight Eisenhower personally agreed,Brownell, Richard. Space exploration. Detroit, Lucent Books, 2012. 82 p. departed from Los Angeles aboard the SS President Cleveland in September 1955 amidst rumors that his release was a swap for 11 U.S. airmen held captive by China since the end of the Korean War. Qian arrived at Hong Kong on 8 October 1955 and entered China via Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway later that day. Under Secretary Kimball, who had tried for several years to keep Qian in the U.S., commented on his treatment: \\"It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go.\\" Immediately upon his return, Qian began a remarkably successful career in rocket science, boosted by the reputation he garnered for his past achievements as well as Chinese state support for his nuclear research. He led and eventually became the father of the Chinese missile program, which constructed the Dongfeng ballistic missiles and the Long March space rockets.  Chinese nuclear program and other studies  In October 1956, he became the director of the Fifth Academy of the Ministry of National Defense, tasked with ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development. He was part of the overall effort that resulted in the successful \\"596\\" atomic bomb test on October 16, 1964, and the \\"Test No. 6\\" hydrogen bomb test on June 17, 1967. This was the fastest fission-to-fusion development in history at 32 months, compared to 86 months for the United States and 75 months for the USSR, and gave China a thermonuclear device ahead of major Western powers like France. Qian's reputation as a prominent scientist who was caught up in the red scare in the United States gave him considerable influence in the era of Mao Zedong and afterward. Qian eventually rose through Party ranks to become a Central Committee member. He became associated with the China's Space Program - From Conception to Manned Spaceflight initiative. Qian was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1957, a lifelong honor granted to Chinese scientists who have made significant advancements in their field. He organized scientific seminars and dedicated some of his time to training successors for his positions.ÁßëÊäÄÁΩë -„ÄäÁßëÊäÄÊó•Êä•„Äã- Èí±Â≠¶Ê£ÆÁöÑÁ≥ªÁªüÁßëÂ≠¶ÊàêÂ∞±ÂíåË¥°ÁåÆ He was heavily involved in the establishment of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1958 and served as the Chairman of the Department of Modern Mechanics of the university for a number of years. Outside of rocketry, Qian had a presence in numerous areas of study. He was among the creators of systematics, and made contributions to science and technology systems, somatic science, engineering science, military science, social science, the natural sciences, geography, philosophy, literature and art, and education. His advancements in the concepts, theories, and methods of the system science field include studying the open complex giant system.Èí±Â≠¶Ê£ÆÔºö„ÄäÂàõÂª∫Á≥ªÁªüÂ≠¶ÔºàÊñ∞‰∏ñÁ∫™ÁâàÔºâ„ÄãÔºå‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫§ÈÄöÂ§ßÂ≠¶Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æÈí±Â≠¶Ê£ÆÔºö„ÄäËÆ∫Á≥ªÁªüÂ∑•Á®ãÔºàÊñ∞‰∏ñÁ∫™ÁâàÔºâ„ÄãÔºå‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫§ÈÄöÂ§ßÂ≠¶Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ Additionally, he helped establish the Chinese school of complexity science. From the 1980s onward, Qian had advocated the scientific investigation of traditional Chinese medicine, Qigong, and the concept of \\"special human body functions\\". He particularly encouraged scientists to accumulate observational data on qigong so that future scientific theories could be established.  Later life  Qian Xuesen Library, Xi'an Jiaotong University Qian retired in 1991 and lived quietly in Beijing, refusing to speak to Westerners.Peter Grier, \\"The forgotten 'spy' case of a rocket scientist\\" The Christian Science Monitor Vol. 92 Issue 244, November 2000 In 1979, Qian was awarded Caltech's Distinguished Alumni Award for his achievements. Qian eventually received his award from Caltech, and with the help of his friend Frank Marble brought it to his home in a widely covered ceremony. Furthermore, in the early 1990s, the filing cabinets containing Qian's research work were offered to him by Caltech. Qian was invited to visit the US by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics after the normalization of the Sino-US relationship, but he refused the invitation, having wanted a formal apology for his detention. In a reminiscence published in 2002, Marble stated that he believed Qian had \\"lost faith in the American government\\" but that he had \\"always had very warm feelings for the American people.\\" The Chinese government launched its manned space program in 1992, reportedly with some help from Russia due to their extended history in space. Qian's research was used as the basis for the Long March rocket, which successfully launched the Shenzhou V mission in October 2003. The elderly Qian was able to watch China's first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed. In 2008, he was named Aviation Week and Space Technology Person of the Year. The recognition was not intended as an honor, but is given to the person judged to have the greatest impact on aviation in the past year.Hold Your Fire, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 168., No. 1, January 7, 2008, p. 8. Furthermore, that year China Central Television named Qian as one of the eleven most inspiring people in China.Person of the Year, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 168., No. 12, March 24, 2008, p. 22. In July 2009, the Omega Alpha Association, an international systems engineering honor society, named Qian (H. S. Tsien) one of four Honorary Members.http://www.omegalpha.org/honorary members/html On October 31, 2009, Qian died at the age of 98 in Beijing. A Chinese film production, Hsue-shen Tsien, directed by Zhang Jianya and starring Chen Kun as Qian was simultaneously released in Asia and North America on December 11, 2011, and on March 2, 2012, it was released in China.  In popular culture  Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, in his 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two, named a Chinese spaceship after him. The science fiction novel series The Expanse by James S. A. Corey also named a Martian spaceship after him (MCRN Xuesen).

The war will usually be won by the side with greater such resources.Types of War, www.military-sf.com, undated (accessed 20 January 2007) The word attrition comes from the Latin root atterere to rub against, similar to the \\"grinding down\\" of the opponent's forces in attrition warfare. Strategic considerations Traditionally, military theorists and strategists have viewed attrition warfare as something to be avoided. Attrition warfare represents an attempt to grind down an opponent and its superior numbers, which is the opposite of the usual principles of war in which one attempts to achieve decisive victories by using minimal necessary resources and in minimal amount of time, through manoeuvre, concentration of force, surprise, and related tactics. On the other hand, a side that perceives itself to be at a marked disadvantage in manoeuvre warfare or unit tactics may deliberately seek out attrition warfare to neutralize its opponent's advantages. If the sides are nearly evenly matched, the outcome of a war of attrition is likely to be a Pyrrhic victory. Sun Tzu has stated, \\"There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.\\" The difference between war of attrition and other forms of war is somewhat artificial since war always contains an element of attrition. One can be said to pursue a strategy of attrition if one makes it the main goal to cause gradual attrition to the opponent eventually amounting to unacceptable or unsustainable levels for the opponent while limiting one's own gradual losses to acceptable and sustainable levels. That should be seen as opposed to other main goals such as the conquest of some resource or territory or an attempt to cause the enemy great losses in a single stroke (such as by encirclement and capture). Historically, attritional methods are tried only as a last resort, when other methods have failed or are obviously not feasible. Typically, when attritional methods have worn down the enemy sufficiently to make other methods feasible, attritional methods are abandoned in favor of other strategies. In World War I, improvements in firepower but not communications and mobility forced military commanders to rely on attrition, with terrible casualties. Attritional methods are in themselves usually sufficient to cause a nation to give up a nonvital ambition, but other methods are generally necessary to achieve unconditional surrender. History French troopers using periscope, 1915. It is often argued that the best-known example of attrition warfare was on the Western Front during World War I.Kaye, C.A. 1957. \\"Military Geology in the United States Sector of the European Theater of Operations during World War II\\". Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 68(1): 47‚Äì54, 1 fig. Both military forces found themselves in static defensive positions in trenches running from Switzerland to the English Channel. For years, without any opportunity for maneuvers, the only way the commanders thought that they could defeat the enemy was to repeatedly attack head on and grind the other down.About World War I, www.english.illinois.edu, date unknown (accessed 20 January 2007) One of the most enduring examples of attrition warfare on the Western Front is the Battle of Verdun, which took place throughout most of 1916. Erich von Falkenhayn later claimed that his tactics at Verdun were designed not to take the city but rather to destroy the French Army in its defense. Falkenhayn is described as wanting to \\"bleed France white\\" and thus the attrition tactics were employed in the battle. Attritional warfare in World War I has been shown by historians such as Hew Strachan to have been used as a post hoc ergo propter hoc excuse for failed offensives. Contemporary sources disagree with Strachan's view on this. While the Christmas Memorandum is a post-war invention, the strategy of \\"bleeding France white\\" was the original strategy for the battle. Attrition to the enemy was easy to assert and difficult to refute and thus may have been a convenient facesaving excuse in the wake of many indecisive battles. It is, in many cases, hard to see the logic of warfare by attrition because of the obvious uncertainty of the level of damage to the enemy and of the damage that the attacking force may sustain to its own limited and expensive resources while trying to achieve that damage. Historians such as John Terraine and Gary Sheffield have suggested that attritional warfare was, however, a necessary step on the road to eventual victory, a 'wearing down process' that sapped Central Powers strength and left them vulnerable during the Hundred Days campaign of 1918. That is not to say that a general will not be prepared to sustain high casualties while trying to reach an objective. An example in which one side used attrition warfare to neutralize the other side's advantage in manoeuvrability and unit tactics occurred during the latter part of the American Civil War, when Union general Ulysses S. Grant pushed the Confederate Army continually, in spite of losses; he correctly predicted that the Union's far superior and more numerous supplies and manpower would overwhelm the Confederacy to the point of collapse, even if the casualty ratio was unfavorable. =Other examples= * Scythian tactics during the European Scythian campaign of Darius I of 513 BC, which was in deep steppes retreat, avoiding a direct confrontation with Darius I's army, while spoiling the wells and pastures *The Athenians, who were weaker in land warfare during the Peloponnesian War, employed attrition warfare using their navy. *The \\"delaying\\" tactics of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (surnamed \\"Cunctator\\", the delayer) against Hannibal Barca during the Second Punic War. * Siege of Tyre by Alexander the Great in 332 BC * Battle of Actium of 31 BC during the Roman civil wars * Muhammad Tapar's campaign against the Nizaris of Alamut in 1109‚Äì1118 * Battle of Myriokephalon by Manuel I Komnenos in 1176 * The Hungarian resistance against the Mongols 1241‚Äì1242 * The Dai Viet Kingdom (now known as Vietnam), three repulsions of Kublai Khan (the grandson of Genghis Khan and the last Khan of the Mongol Empire) in 1258, 1285 and 1288 * Fall of Constantinople by Mehmed II in 1453 * Night Attack at T√¢rgovi»ôte by Vlad the Impaler in 1462 * Fall of Tenochtitlan by Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1521 * The American strategy during the American Revolutionary War * The latter portion of the American Civil War, notably the Siege of Vicksburg, the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg * The French invasion of Russia by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1812 * Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar of the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 * The Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) * Tonnage war in the Atlantic and Pacific during World War II * The Air battle for Great Britain in World War II after the bombing of London * Static battles in World War II, including Soviet urban defense during the Battle of Stalingrad * Battles of Rzhev (1942‚Äì1943) * Battle of Tabu-dong, The final two years of the Korean War * The Vietnam War (Body count) * The \\"Long War\\" during the Provisional IRA's armed campaign against the British Army during the Troubles. * The Israeli‚ÄìEgyptian War of Attrition from 1967‚Äì1970. * The Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War * The later phases of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War * The War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) * The Sri Lankan Civil War after 2005 * The 2011 Libyan civil war is arguably an example of attrition warfare. * Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict (1978‚Äìpresent) * The Syrian Civil War (2011‚Äìpresent), in particular the Battle of Aleppo.

This town is in the Rural Municipality of Tisdale No. 427, Saskatchewan. Located at the junction of Highway 35 and Highway 3, and serviced by both the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, Tisdale is the grain handling centre of the region with five inland grain terminals, and is the centre of regional industry. The intersection of Highways 3 and 35 has traffic volumes of 11,200 vehicles per day and is the location of the largest 7-Eleven in Canada (by floor space) and the 16-foot [CONVERT] roadside statue of \\"The World's Largest Honey Bee\\" (the Giant Bee in Falher, Alberta, is actually bigger at 22 feet 8 inches). This town is the administrative office of the Kinistin Saulteaux Nation band government. History English explorer Henry Kelsey passed through this area in 1690 during his exploration of the Carrot River. The post office of Tisdale, provisional District of Saskatchewan, North West Territories was created on 1 February 1904. The community was originally known as \\"Doghide\\" after the Doghide River that flows through the town, but with the arrival of the railway the community was renamed \\"Tisdale\\" in honour of F.W. Tisdale, an employee of the Canadian Northern Railway. Western Canada's biggest gun shoot out took place just east of Tisdale in 1920. The historic gunfight involved a posse of Saskatchewan Provincial Police and four outlaws In 2005, Tisdale celebrated its 100th birthday with a homecoming celebration in conjunction with Saskatchewan's centennial. The town also underwent beautification projects, including the construction of a new town square. Demographics Economy For 60 years, until October 2015,'Rape and honey' slogan dropped Tisdale was known as the \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\" due to its significance in both rapeseed and honey production. Tisdale is also known as the Honey Capital of Saskatchewan. One third of the farmland in the Northeast region is cropped into canola and 10% of the honey produced in Canada comes from this area. Traditionally the area produces about 9 million pounds ($7.2 million) in honey. Due to the obvious alternate meaning, industrial metal band Ministry named their 1988 album The Land of Rape and Honey after seeing the motto on a Tisdale souvenir mug.Exclaim!

Weller achieved fame with the punk rock/new wave/mod revival band the Jam. He had further success with the blue-eyed soul music of the Style Council (1983‚Äì1989), before establishing himself as a solo artist with his eponymous 1992 album. Despite widespread critical recognition as a singer, lyricist, and guitarist, Weller has remained a national, rather than international, star and much of his songwriting is rooted in British society. Many of his songs with the Jam had lyrics about working class life. He was the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s mod revival, often referred to as \\"The Modfather\\", and an influence on Britpop bands such as Oasis. The Daily Telegraph said of Weller: \\"Apart from David Bowie, it's hard to think of any British solo artist who's had as varied, long-lasting and determinedly forward-looking a career.\\" The BBC described Weller in 2007 as \\"one of the most revered music writers and performers of the past 30 years\\". In 2012, he was among the British notables selected by the artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork ‚Äì the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover ‚Äì to celebrate the British social figures of his life. He has received four Brit Awards, winning the award for Best British Male twice, and the 2006 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Early life (1958‚Äì1975) Weller was born on 25 May 1958 in Woking, Surrey, England, to John and Ann Weller (n√©e Craddock). Although born John William Weller, he became known as Paul by his parents. His father worked as a taxi driver and a builder and his mother was a part-time cleaner. Weller started his education at Maybury County First School in 1963. His love of music began with The Beatles, then The Who and Small Faces. By the time Weller was eleven and moving up to Sheerwater County Secondary school, music was the biggest part of his life, and he had started playing the guitar. Weller's musical vocation was confirmed after seeing Status Quo in concert in 1972. He formed the first incarnation of The Jam in the same year, playing bass guitar with his best friends Steve Brookes (lead guitar) and Dave Waller (rhythm guitar). Weller's father, acting as their manager, began booking the band into local working men's clubs. Joined by Rick Buckler on drums, and with Bruce Foxton soon replacing Waller on rhythm guitar, the four-piece band began to forge a local reputation, playing a mixture of Beatles covers and a number of compositions written by Weller and Brookes. Brookes left the band in 1976, and Weller and Foxton decided they would swap guitar roles, with Weller now the guitarist. The Jam (1976‚Äì1982) The Jam emerged at the same time as punk rock bands such as The Clash, The Damned, and the Sex Pistols. The Clash emerged as leading early advocates of the band, and were sufficiently impressed to take them along as the support on their White Riot tour of 1977. The Jam performing in Newcastle in 1982 The Jam's first single, \\"In the City\\", took them into the UK Top 40 in May 1977. Although every subsequent single had a placing within the Top 40, it was not until the band released the political \\"The Eton Rifles\\" that it would break into the Top 10, hitting the No. 3 spot in November 1979. The increasing popularity of their blend of Weller's barbed lyrics with pop melodies eventually led to their first number one single, \\"Going Underground\\", in March 1980. \\"I like them a lot,\\" remarked Peter Gabriel, who enlisted Weller to play on his third album. \\"They're one of the new groups who have written the best songs. They're really very good.\\"Best magazine, May 1978; translated in Gabriel fanzine White Shadow (#1, pp16) by editor Fred Tomsett The Jam became the first band since the Beatles to perform both sides of the same single (\\"Town Called Malice\\" and \\"Precious\\") on one edition of Top of the Pops. They also had two singles, \\"That's Entertainment\\" and \\"Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?\\", reach No. 21 and No. 8 respectively in the UK singles chart despite not even being released as singles in the UK ‚Äì they got there purely on the strength of the huge number of people buying import sales of the German and Dutch single releases. The Jam still hold the record for the best-selling import-only singles in the UK charts. As the band's popularity increased, however, Weller became restless and wanted to explore a more soulful, melodic style of music with a broader instrumentation, and in consequence in 1982 he announced that The Jam would disband at the end of that year. The action came as a surprise to Foxton and Buckler who both felt that the band was still a creative formation with scope to develop further professionally, but Weller was determined to end the band and move on. Their final single, \\"Beat Surrender\\", became their fourth UK chart topper, going straight to No. 1 in its first week. Their farewell concerts at Wembley Arena were multiple sell-outs; their final concert took place at the Brighton Centre on 11 December 1982. The Style Council (1983‚Äì1989) At the beginning of 1983, Weller teamed up with keyboard player Mick Talbot to form a new group called The Style Council. Weller brought in Steve White to play drums, as well as singer Dee C. Lee, Weller's girlfriend of 6 years. She also had previously been a backing singer with Wham! Free of the limited musical styles he felt imposed by The Jam, under the collective of The Style Council Weller was able to experiment with a wide range of music, from pop and jazz to Soul/R&B;, house and folk-styled ballads. The band was at the vanguard of a jazz/pop revival that would continue with the emergence of bands like Matt Bianco, Sade, and Everything but the Girl, whose members Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt contributed vocals and guitar to the 1984 The Style Council song \\"Paris Match\\". Many of The Style Council's early singles performed well in the charts, and Weller would also experience his first success in North America, when \\"My Ever Changing Moods\\" and \\"You're The Best Thing\\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100. In Australia it was far more successful than The Jam, reaching the top of the charts in 1984 with \\"Shout to the Top\\". Weller appeared on 1984's Band Aid record \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" and was called upon to mime the absent Bono's lyrics on Top of the Pops. The Style Council was the second act to appear in the British half of Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in 1985. In December 1984, Weller put together his own charity ensemble called The Council Collective to make a record, \\"Soul Deep\\", to raise money for striking miners, and the family of David Wilkie. The record featured The Style Council plus a number of other performers, notably Jimmy Ruffin and Junior Giscombe. In spite of the song's political content, it still picked up BBC Radio 1 airplay and was performed on Top of the Pops, which led to the incongruous sight of lyrics such as \\"We can't afford to let the government win / It means death to the trade unions\\" being mimed amid the show's flashing lights and party atmosphere. As the 1980s wore on, The Style Council's popularity in the UK began to slide, with the band achieving only one top ten single after 1985. The Style Council's death knell was sounded in 1989 when its record company refused to release its fifth and final studio album, the house-influenced Modernism: A New Decade. With the rejection of this effort, Weller announced that The Style Council had split, and although the final album did have a limited vinyl run, it was not until the 1998 retrospective CD box set The Complete Adventures of The Style Council that the album would be widely available. Solo career =Early solo career (1990‚Äì1995)= Weller performing at V Festival in 2006 In 1989, Weller found himself without a band and without a recording deal for the first time since he was 17. After taking time off throughout 1990, he returned to the road in 1991, touring as \\"The Paul Weller Movement\\" with long-term drummer and friend Steve White, Paul Francis (session bassist from The James Taylor Quartet). After a slow start playing small clubs with a mixture of Jam/Style Council classics as well as showcasing new material such as \\"Into Tomorrow\\", by the time of the release of his 1992 LP, Paul Weller, he had begun to re-establish himself as a leading British singer-songwriter. This self-titled album saw a return to a more jazz- guitar-focused sound, featuring samples and a funk influence with shades of the Style Council sound. The album also featured a new producer, Brendan Lynch. Tracks such as \\"Here's a New Thing\\" and \\"That Spiritual Feeling\\" were marketed among the emerging acid jazz scene. Buoyed by the positive commercial and critical success of his first solo album, Weller returned to the studio in 1993 with a renewed confidence. Accompanied by Steve White, guitarist Steve Cradock and bassist Damon Minchella, the result of these sessions was the triumphant Mercury Music Prize-nominated Wild Wood, which included \\"Sunflower\\". His 1995 album Stanley Road took him back to the top of the British charts for the first time in a decade, and went on to become the best- selling album of his career. The album, named after the street in Woking where he had grown up, marked a return to the more guitar-based style of his earlier days. The album's major single, \\"The Changingman\\", was also a big hit, taking Weller to No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. Another single, the ballad \\"You Do Something To Me\\", was his second consecutive Top 10 single and reached No. 9 in the UK. Weller found himself heavily associated with the emerging Britpop movement that gave rise to such bands as Oasis, Pulp and Blur. Noel Gallagher (of Oasis) is credited as guest guitarist on the Stanley Road album track \\"I Walk on Gilded Splinters\\". Weller also returned the favour, appearing as a guest guitarist and backing vocalist on Oasis' hit song \\"Champagne Supernova\\". =The Modfather (1996‚Äì2007)= Heavy Soul, the follow-up to the million- selling Stanley Road, saw Weller twist his sound again. The album was more raw than its predecessor; Weller was now frequently playing live in the studio in as few takes as possible. The first single \\"Peacock Suit\\" reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart, and the album reached No. 2\\\\. Success in the charts also came from compilations: \\"Best Of\\" albums by The Jam and The Style Council charted, and in 1998 his own solo collection Modern Classics was a substantial success. In 2000, while living in Send, Surrey, he released his fifth solo studio album, Heliocentric. Once again finding himself without a record contract, Weller's Days of Speed worldwide tour provided him with the opportunity to view his works as one back catalogue, giving rise to a second successful live album in 2001. Days of Speed contained live acoustic versions from the world tour of the same name, including some of his best-known songs from his solo career and the back catalogues of his The Jam and The Style Council days. There were rumours at the time that Heliocentric would be Weller's final studio effort, but these proved unfounded when he released the No. 1 hit album Illumination in September 2002. Co-produced by Noonday Underground's Simon Dine, it was preceded by yet another top 10 hit single \\"It's Written in the Stars\\". Weller also appears on the 2002 Noonday Underground album called Surface Noise, singing on the track \\"I'll Walk Right On\\". In 2002, Weller collaborated with Terry Callier on the single \\"Brother to Brother\\", which featured on Callier's album Speak Your Peace. In 2003, Weller teamed up with electronic rock duo Death in Vegas on a cover of Gene Clark's \\"So You Say You Lost Your Baby\\", which featured on their Scorpio Rising album. In 2004, Weller released an album of covers entitled Studio 150. It debuted at No. 2 in the UK charts and included Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" as well as covers of songs by Gil Scott-Heron, Rose Royce and Gordon Lightfoot, amongst others. Weller's 2005 album As Is Now featured the singles \\"From The Floorboards Up\\", \\"Come On/Let's Go\\" and \\"Here's The Good News\\". The album was well-received, though critics noted that he was not moving his music forward stylistically, and it became his lowest-charting album since his 1992 debut. In February 2006 it was announced that Weller would be the latest recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BRIT Awards. Despite a tendency to shun such occasions, Weller accepted the award in person, and performed four songs at the ceremony, including The Jam's classic \\"Town Called Malice\\". In June 2006, another double live album titled Catch-Flame!, featuring songs from both his solo work and his career with The Jam and The Style Council, was released. In late 2006, the album Hit Parade was released, which collected all the singles released by The Jam, The Style Council and Weller during his solo career. Two versions of this album were released: a single disc with a selection from each stage of his career, and a four-disc limited edition, which included every single released and came with a 64-page booklet. Weller was offered appointment as a Commander of the Order of British Empire in the 2006 birthday honours, but rejected the offer. In 2007 Weller was guest vocalist on the album issue by the folk musical project The Imagined Village. =Critical success (2008‚Äìpresent)= The double album 22 Dreams was released on 2 June 2008, with \\"Echoes Round The Sun\\" as the lead single. Weller had parted company with his existing band before the recording this album, replacing everyone except guitarist Steve Cradock with Andy Lewis on bass, Andy Crofts of The Moons on keys and Steve Pilgrim of The Stands on drums. This album saw Weller move in a more experimental direction, taking in a wide variety of influences including jazz, folk and tango as well as the pop-soul more associated with his Style Council days. Weller also featured on two songs from The Moons' album \\"Life on Earth\\", playing piano on \\"Wondering\\" and lead guitar on \\"Last Night on Earth\\". Weller was the surprise recipient of the 2009 BRIT award for \\"Best Male Solo Artist\\", which resulted in controversy when it was discovered that a suspiciously high number of bets had been placed for Weller to win the award, for which James Morrison was T4's favourite. It was reported that the bookmakers had lost ¬£100,000 in the event, and that as a result would not be taking bets for the awards in the future. Weller and band line-up in Cardiff in 2008 In 2009, Weller guested on Dot Allison's 2009 album, Room 7¬Ω, co-writing \\"Love's Got Me Crazy\\". November and December also saw him on tour, playing shows across the country. On 24 February 2010, Weller received the Godlike Genius Award at the NME Awards. His 2010 album, Wake Up the Nation, was released in April to critical acclaim, and was subsequently nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. The album also marked his first collaboration with The Jam's bassist Bruce Foxton in 28 years. In May 2010, Weller was presented with the Ivor Novello Lifetime Achievement award, saying \\"I've enjoyed the last 33 years I've been writing songs and hopefully, with God's good grace, I'll do some more.\\" On 8 November 2012, Weller announced that he would release the Dragonfly EP on 17 December 2012, a limited edition vinyl run of 3000 copies. On 22 November 2011, Weller announced his eleventh studio album Sonik Kicks, which was released on 19 March 2012. Weller provided vocals on The Moons' 2012 single Something Soon. In December 2012, Weller headlined the Crisis charity gig at the Hammersmith Apollo, where he performed with Emeli Sande, Miles Kane and Bradley Wiggins. On 23 March 2013, Paul Weller played drums on stage with Damon Albarn, Noel Gallagher and Graham Coxon, playing the Blur track \\"Tender\\". This was played as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust concerts curated by Noel Gallagher. In 2014, Weller wrote \\"Let Me In\\" for Olly Murs's fourth album Never Been Better. In May 2015, Weller revealed dates for a West Coast Tour of the US to promote the Saturn's Pattern album. The tour was scheduled to run from 9 June to 9 October. In January 2017 he made a cameo appearance in \\"The Final Problem\\", the final episode of series four of the BBC TV series Sherlock. In January 2019, Weller announced the 8 March 2019 audio and video release of Other Aspects, Live At The Royal Festival Hall. It's the second of two shows and was recorded in October 2018 at London's Royal Festival Hall with an orchestra. Weller's most recent solo album, entitled \\"On Sunset\\", was released 3 July 2020, and rapidly reached the #1 slot on the UK album charts.

One World Trade Center is being constructed in the background, behind the Brookfield Place towers. Brookfield Place, built and still commonly referred to as the World Financial Center, is a shopping center LAUREN SHERMAN, Inside the Reinvention of Saks Fifth Avenue SEPTEMBER 6, 2016 and office-building complex located across West Street from the World Trade Center in the Battery Park City neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Overlooking the Hudson River, Brookfield Place has been home to offices of various companies including Merrill Lynch, RBC Capital Markets, Nomura Group, American Express, Bank of New York Mellon, Time Inc. 95.5 K-LOVE, 96.7 Air1, and Brookfield Asset Management. In 2014, the complex was given its current name following the completion of extensive renovations. Ownership and structure 200 Vesey Street Brookfield Place is owned by Toronto-based Brookfield Office Properties, except for the space occupied by American Express, which is owned by the American Express Company. 250 Vesey Street serves as the United States headquarters for Brookfield Office Properties. Brookfield Place has its own zip code, 10281. The buildings' original developer was Olympia and York, also based in Toronto. The buildings are: *200 Liberty Street, formerly One World Financial Center, (1986) height , 40 stories **Leasable area: **Rooftop: truncated square pyramid *225 Liberty Street, formerly Two World Financial Center, (1987), height , 44 stories **Leasable area: **Rooftop: round dome *200 Vesey Street, formerly Three World Financial Center, (also known as American Express Tower) (1985), height , 51 stories **Leasable area: **Rooftop: pyramid *250 Vesey Street, formerly Four World Financial Center, (1986), height , 34 stories (\\"North Tower\\") **Leasable area: **Rooftop: ziggurat *Winter Garden Atrium (1988) a glass domed pavilion housing various plants, trees and flowers, also shopping areas, cafes (located between buildings 2 and 3), rebuilt 2002 after terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. **Leasable area: *One North End Avenue, also known as the New York Mercantile Exchange building (1997), height , 16 stories **Leasable area: History The complex viewed from the World Trade Center in August 1992 Designed by architect C√©sar Pelli, with Adamson Associates, the World Financial Center complex was built by Olympia and York between 1982 and 1988 on the landfill used to build Battery Park City. The fill material consisted of dirt excavated during the building of the World Trade Center, as well as garbage and other debris. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, debris severely damaged the lobby and lower floors causing the building to be in danger of collapse. It has since been fully restored and significant repairs were made to the other buildings in the complex. The Winter Garden Atrium received major structural damage to its glass and steel frame, but ceremonially reopened on September 11, 2002. After the attacks, the World Financial Center underwent a $250 million renovation and expansion project, in conjunction with the construction of a new east-west passageway linking the complex with the World Trade Center site. The project included a transit pavilion to be built as an extension of the existing Winter Garden Atrium, on the West Street side. Preliminary plans called for the demolition of the Grand Staircase, which was the main focal entry point to Winter Garden and the waterfront, as it connected to the Vesey Street pedestrian bridge adjacent to the original World Trade Center. The Grand Staircase has also been used as an amphitheater; thus, the plans for demolition had outraged residents, who promptly appealed for its preservation in the latest redevelopment plans. The transit pavilion opened in 2013, and is located at 100 West Street.https://web.archive.org/web/20120104094650/http://worldfinancialcenter.com/ Leasable space on the lower floors of the office towers underwent conversions and expansion to accommodate new retail. One notable example is 2 Brookfield Place: a European-style marketplace and dining terrace opened in 2013. The space between 3 and 4 Brookfield Place, at 225 Vesey Street, which contained retail, expanded to accommodate in‚Äëline retail and high-end fashion retail, according to the plans and renderings. With some restaurants and retail temporarily closed due to construction, a food truck court was in operation beginning in early 2012 on North End Avenue. Various food trucks that operate around New York City, serving a variety of foods, service the Brookfield Place/Battery Park City area five days a week during lunch hours. A new 2,000-seat food court comprising existing restaurants, such as Le District and Hudson Eats, and new restaurants, opened in stages between November 2014 and March 2015; the food area is projected to generate about $120 million of revenue annually. Overall, the intent is to drive more tourism in the area with the retail and the new access to the passageway under West Street. It is also being developed as a catalyst to integrate and drive development in the adjacent largely residential Battery Park City area. Brookfield Properties bought the adjacent One North End Avenue building, headquarters of the New York Mercantile Exchange, in 2013, for , and integrated it into the complex. Following expansion, the entire World Financial Center complex was renamed Brookfield Place, in conjunction with similar complexes in Toronto, Calgary, and Perth owned by Brookfield. The name change took place in 2014.

He spent his reign improving the infrastructure of his kingdom, restoring Navarre's pride after the dismal reign of his father, Charles the Bad, and mending strained relations with France. Charles III was born at Mantes-la-Jolie, the son of Charles II of Navarre and Joan of Valois. He married Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of Castile, in 1375, putting an end to the conflict between Castile and Navarre. On 25 July 1390, Charles named Joanna as his heir to Navarre. Yet in 1397 his son, Charles, would be recognized as heir to Navarre. As king, his politics were peace with France, Castile, Aragon, and England, support for the Avignon Papacy, and matrimonial alliance. He collaborated with Castile in a war on the Kingdom of Granada. By the Treaty of Paris, he abandoned his claims to Champagne and Brie and made peace with France. Charles created the title Prince of Viana for the heir to the throne, entitling his grandson Charles in 1423. He was a patron of the arts and he finished construction on the great Gothic Cathedral of Pamplona. When it comes to Navarre's home policy, he decreed the watershed unification of Pamplona's boroughs in 1423, after over three centuries of division and rivalry. He also built the royal palace at Tafalla and the Royal Palace of Olite, where he died in 1425. Tomb of Charles III in the Cathedral of Pamplona.

The O'Reilly Factor first aired in the United States on Fox News Channel on October 7, 1996, the same day the network launched. It was hosted by conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly, who discussed current events and controversial political issues with guests. The final episode aired on April 21, 2017, after O'Reilly was fired from the network. Format Bill O'Reilly interviews former President George W. Bush for The O‚ÄôReilly Factor at the Air Force Museum, November 11, 2010 The O'Reilly Factor was generally pre-recorded, though on occasion it aired live if breaking news or special events were being covered (e.g., presidential addresses that occurred during prime-time and debate coverage). It was usually taped between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time and aired weekdays at 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The show was recorded \\"live to tape\\", meaning that the recording broke for commercials as if the show was actually on the air while being recorded. Some guests were interviewed before the \\"live to tape\\" period and were slotted in the program as appropriate. He began every show with the catch phrase from February 28, 2005 to April 11, 2017, \\"Caution! You are about to enter the No Spin Zone. The Factor begins right now!\\" followed by the theme song, and then saying \\"Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly, thanks for watching us tonight,\\" introducing the topic of the first segment, followed by \\"and that is the subject of this evening's Talking Points Memo\\", a monologue which was often followed with an interview on the same topic. O'Reilly and his producers discussed potential topics twice a week. Guest hosts included: Eric Bolling, Monica Crowley, Greg Gutfeld, E. D. Hill, Laura Ingraham, John Kasich, Michelle Malkin, Tony Snow, and Juan Williams. Audience Early in 2009, the show's ratings increased. In July 2009, Hal Boedeker blogged that The O'Reilly Factor peaked at 3.1 million viewers which was an increase of 37% from the previous year. In September 2009, The O'Reilly Factor was the #1 cable news show for 106 consecutive weeks. In May 2014, The O'Reilly Factor still held this top position, but average monthly viewers were down to 2.1 million, with a median age of 72 years. In March 2015, The O'Reilly Factor remained at the number one spot on cable news ratings for its 60th consecutive quarter, experiencing 19% growth in viewership among individuals aged 25 to 54 years old. Ratings were initially high after sexual harassment allegations against O'Reilly resurfaced in April 2017. In the time during Bill O'Reilly's week-long vacation preceding his firing (in which Dana Perino guest hosted), the ratings dropped 26%. Notable guests Michelle Malkin was a frequent guest host. A conservative commentator, she began boycotting the show in 2007 due to controversy involving remarks made against her by Geraldo Rivera over her position on illegal immigration. =2008 presidential contenders= Fox News producers had tried for years to get Hillary Clinton to come on the show. On April 30, 2008, Clinton agreed to come on the show as part of a pre-taped interview that would be broadcast over two days. The host also held an exclusive, four-part interview with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. Both interviews drew significant media attention as they were front runners for the 2008 presidential election. In the same election cycle, Ron Paul and O'Reilly got into a testy exchange over the issue of Iran. The 2008 Republican candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, and then Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden were also invited to the show, but chose not to make an appearance. Cultural impact In 2005, The Colbert Report premiered on Comedy Central. The show, hosted by Stephen Colbert, is a satirical spoof of pundit shows like The O'Reilly Factor, spoofing its format and the mannerisms and ideology of O'Reilly, whom Colbert calls \\"Papa Bear.\\" Colbert makes no secret of his spoofing O'Reilly: upon hearing the news that O'Reilly approved of The Colbert Report, he declared on-air that \\"I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist.\\" On January 18, 2007, Colbert appeared on The O'Reilly Factor and O'Reilly appeared on The Colbert Report.Bill O'Reilly Pt. 1. ComedyCentral.com January 18, 2007. Last Retrieved. After Bill O'Reilly left the show, the Late Show character Stephen Colbert made an appearance \\"via satellite\\" to bid his farewell to Bill. \\"‚ÄúHello, nation.\\" He said. \\"Shame on you. You failed him. You failed Bill O‚ÄôReilly. You didn‚Äôt deserve this great man...Bill, I invite you to come live in a mountain cabin with me and Jon Stewart. It‚Äôs fun; you‚Äôll like it.

Stay strong, papa bear.‚Äù The O'Reilly Factor has also been spoofed on Saturday Night Live, first by Jeff Richards and later on by Darrell Hammond, and then with Alec Baldwin, where Baldwin played both O'Reilly and Donald Trump in the same sketch in an interview segment. On MADtv, the parody was by Michael McDonald. O'Reilly himself has appeared on MADtv. Richards also played O'Reilly in an episode of Mind of Mencia where O'Reilly is a senator in the year 2016. The show was also spoofed by the TV series The Boondocks; first in the episode \\"The Trial of R. Kelly\\" where O'Reilly is shown talking about R. Kelly's latest legal trouble. Later in \\"Return of the King\\", O'Reilly is shown attacking Martin Luther King Jr. for saying that America should \\"love thy enemy\\" and \\"turn the other cheek\\", even in respects to the 9/11 attacks. The Chaser's War on Everything featured a segment in its second season where it poked fun at The O'Reilly Factor. Cancellation After five sexual harassment settlements by O'Reilly and Fox News were reported by The New York Times, The O'Reilly Factor lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their ads. Despite the loss of advertisers, The O'Reilly Factor's ratings increased during the controversy. On April 11, 2017, O'Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24, 2017.Bill O'Reilly taking vacation amid scandal, advertiser exodus CNN Money, April 11, 2017. On April 19, 2017, O'Reilly was fired. Online, references to O'Reilly on FoxNews.com were immediately removed, with the main show website redirecting to the FoxNews.com homepage and its content removed. The program continued for three more episodes without O'Reilly, but the title was shortened to The Factor. Dana Perino guest hosted the show on April 19, 2017 and April 20, 2017 and Greg Gutfeld hosted the final episode on April 21, 2017. In the April 19, 2017 episode, Perino read a prepared statement about O'Reilly's dismissal equivalent to what the network had released earlier in the day. The reasons for his firing and the sexual harassment allegations were not mentioned in the program itself. The termination of employment of the former host was a major feature of news coverage on both MSNBC and CNN; outside of the prepared statements, it was not mentioned on-air during the program and other regular topics were covered. The following day, images of the host were removed from the front windows of the News Corp. Building. O'Reilly was not given an opportunity to sign-off on-air, instead releasing a statement through his agency about the matter, while continuing to deny the sexual harassment allegations against him. During the final episode Gutfield spoke about the program's legacy and the loyalty of the show's staff after a segment with Tucker Carlson, followed by a fading of the stage's lighting to a dark state, revealing the set now blank of anything identifying the show. The three-day interregnum allowed the network to sort out a new prime-time lineup to start on April 24, 2017, which saw Tucker Carlson Tonight move into the former The O'Reilly Factor time-slot, followed by the move of the late afternoon program The Five to 9:00 p.m. ET.

It was invented by Paul J. Gruen of West Newbury, Massachusetts, United States, one of the era's top board game designers, and his brother-in-law Charles C. Bailey. It was Gruen's most successful game, outselling Monopoly in its first production year. Pay Day is currently marketed by Winning Moves. The game simulates money management, with the game board resembling a calendar month. Before the game, the players decide how many months to be played (i.e. how many times to travel across the board). During the game, players accumulate bills and expenses to pay, along with collecting their monthly wage on \\"pay day\\" at the end of the month. The winner is the player who has the most money at the end of the last month of play. Rules (original 1975-era) =Object= The object is to be the player who has the most cash and savings at the end of the game. The length of the game is decided by the players. With four players, a 3 month game takes about an hour and a 6 month game takes about 2 hours. =Equipment= The game is played under the 1975-era rules with the game board, one die, four playing pieces, play money, 16 \\"Deal\\" cards, 72 \\"Mail\\" cards. Older versions also included a \\"Savings and Loan Calculator\\" and 12 \\"savings and loans\\" pegs. Later editions replaced the \\"calculator\\" and pegs with a \\"Savings and Loan\\" pad plus a table to calculate savings and loan interest. =Play= Each player starts with $325. One player is selected to go first. Players roll the die and advance their playing piece from 1 to 6 spaces as indicated on the die. The player follows the instructions shown on the calendar space on the game board. There are 31 days in a Pay Day month. =Deal and Mail cards= If a player lands on either a \\"Deal\\" or \\"Mail\\" space, they will then select the appropriate card(s) from the top of the specified deck. Deal Cards The player has the option of purchasing the \\"Deal\\" for the cost indicated immediately or returning the card to the bottom of the deck. (One may take out a loan to pay for the deal.) The \\"Deal\\" is held until that player lands on a \\"Buyer\\" space at any time during the duration of the game. A \\"Deal\\" card has no value if it remains unsold at the end of the game. Whenever a \\"Deal\\" is purchased, all players have an opportunity to win the \\"Commission\\" indicated on the \\"Deal\\" card. Each player in turn rolls the die, with the highest roller collecting the \\"Commission\\" from the bank. Mail Cards Mail cards have varying content, just like real mail. Some mail cards are bills, some are fortuitous collections, and some are just entertaining (postcards and advertisements.) Bills are due at the end of the month (unless cancelled by Insurance, see below), while collections (except for Lottery Tickets) are payable immediately. Postcards and junk mail are immediately discarded. Three types of mail cards are \\"special\\" mail cards which have unique rules: ;Lottery Ticket: If a player gets a lottery ticket in the mail, that player can cash in the value of the ticket only if that player lands on the Lottery Draw space during the month they receive it in the mail. After the end of the month, if it is not redeemed, it becomes void and must be returned to the bottom of the Mail pile. ;Swellfare: If a player's loan, plus loan interest due, plus bills are greater than their total amount of cash, they are in debt. That player may bet up to $100, then if that player rolls a 5 or a 6, they collect 10 times the amount bet; otherwise, the amount bet goes into the pot. Swellfare cards not used are immediately discarded. ;Insurance: If a player receives a mailing for either auto insurance (\\"Carr Insurance Co.\\") or health insurance (\\"Aches & Pains Insurance Co.\\"), the player may purchase insurance at their option. If purchased, the insurance is good for the entire game and will automatically cancel any related bills (including those already held by the player). Insurance cards not used are immediately discarded. =Daylight Savings= Each player in turn, starting with the player who landed there, moves their token back one space and follows the instructions as in a regular turn. If a player's game piece is on the \\"Start\\" space when another player lands on \\"Daylight Savings\\", they simply collect another $325 and leave the game piece on \\"Start.\\" The \\"Daylight Savings\\" process takes place only once on any turn and should not be repeated if a player lands there as a result of another player having landed there first. =Town Election = All players must contribute to the town election. ($50 per person.)If a player does not have the cash, they must withdraw from their savings, or take out or increase a loan. The next player to roll a 6 during the course of the game wins the Pot (including any \\"Swellfare\\" money that may already be in there). =Poker Game= Each player has the option of placing $100 on the board. All poker game participants roll the die. The highest roller collects all of the money. =Buyer= If a player holding a Deal card lands on a Buyer space, they may return it to the bottom of the Deal deck and collect the indicated sale price from the bank. Only one Deal card may be redeemed per turn. =Savings and Loans= A player may have either a savings account or a loan, but never both at the same time. ;Savings: Players may start or add to their savings only on Pay Day. Players may withdraw all or part of their savings only on Pay Day (if the player wishes to withdraw at another time, they must pay a $50 fee). A player receives 10% interest on the balance in his/her savings account every time he lands on Pay Day. For easy calculation of interest on savings or loans refer to the Interest Table. ;Loans: A loan may be taken out or increased at any time in $100 increments. A player must pay 20% interest on his/her outstanding loan balance every time they land on Pay Day. Loans may only be paid off on Pay Day. ;Calculating savings and loans: The original editions included a \\"Savings and Loan Calculator\\" peg board and 12 \\"savings and loans\\" pegs. When a player opened an account, a peg was then added in the appropriate S or L section of the player‚Äôs calculator to show the amount of money which was held or lent by the bank. This system was later replaced with a \\"Savings and Loan\\" pad to actually hand write the amounts in the savings and loan accounts, plus there was a printed table to help calculate savings and loan interest. =Sweet Sunday= As the name indicates, Sweet Sunday spaces have neither an award nor a penalty, just a space to \\"rest\\". =Pay Day= A player who reaches this space immediately stops, regardless of any additional counts on the die, and goes through these steps in the indicated order. # Collect monthly wages of $325, except on the last month of play. # Collect 10% interest on any savings account, or pay 20% interest on any outstanding loan balance to the bank. # Pay all bills received during the month and place them in the discarded mail stack. If a player does not have enough cash to pay the bills, they must either withdraw money from their savings account, or take out or increase a loan. # OPTIONAL: Pay off part or all of an outstanding loan, withdraw money from a savings account without penalty, or deposit money into the account. These transactions may only be done in $100 increments. # Discard any unused Lottery Tickets. # Discard any Deal cards still held (last month of play only). # Move the game piece back to the Start space, unless the player has just completed their last month of play. =Winning= The player who finishes the game with the most money (cash plus savings or cash minus loans) after all players clearing the set number of months before the play starts is the winner. If all players are \\"in the negative\\" (all have loans exceeding their cash), then whoever is the least \\"in the negative\\" wins. Changes to the 1994 edition Some of the changes/additions to the 1994 edition included: * The maximum number of players was increased to six, as well as the number of players' tokens. * The game now had 24 \\"Deal\\" cards and 48 \\"Mail\\" cards * Savings accounts were removed from the game. Players can only open loans. * Players began the game with $3,500 and received this amount at the end of each month. Loan increments were also increased from $100 to $1,000. The other dollar amounts were also multiplied by 10. ** However, the loan interest per month was decreased from 20 percent to 10 percent. * The \\"Pot\\" was renamed to \\"Jackpot\\". * The lottery ticket mail card and the lottery draw was replaced with new lottery rules: Once a player lands on the Lottery space, a lottery begins. The Bank first antes up $1,000, then each player may optionally ante an additional $100 to the pot. Then starting with the player who landed on the space, each player who anted in turn picks a different number from 1 to 6. The player who landed on the Lottery space rolls the die, and the player whose number is rolled collects all the money. * Additional special board spaces: ** Super Ski Sunday, Charity Concert, Food for the Month, and Shopping Spree: the player must put the amount shown into the Jackpot. ** Sweepstakes: the player who lands on this space receives $5000 from the bank. ** Radio phone-in contest: each player, starting with the one who lands on this space, rolls the die, and the first one to roll a 3 receives $1,000 from the bank. ** Happy Birthday: the player who lands on this space gets $100 each from every other player. ** Yard Sale: at the start of a game, a \\"Deal\\" card is placed face down under the edge of the board next to this space, indicating the deal being sold at the yard sale. The player who lands on this space then pays the bank $100 times the number rolled and takes the Deal card under the edge of the board. A new deal card is then placed face down to indicate the deal at the next yard sale. ** Walk For Charity: All players, except the player who landed on this space, roll the die and put $100 times the number rolled into the Jackpot. * Special mail cards: ** Pay a Neighbor: the player chooses an opponent to pay the amount shown on the card. Even if predetermined month of the player is retired. ** Mad Money: the player chooses an opponent to collect from the amount shown on the card. ** Charity: the player must put the amount of money shown on the card into the Jackpot.

It is located between the mouths of the Daliao River (the historical lower section of the Liao River) in the west and the Yalu River in the east, and encompasses the territories of the whole sub-provincial city of Dalian and parts of prefectural cities of Yingkou, Anshan and Dandong. The word \\"Liaodong\\" literally means \\"east of the Liao region\\", referring to the Warring States period Yan commandery of Liaodong, which encompassed an area from modern Liaoning-Jilin border in the north to the Chongchon River in the south, and from just east of the Qian Mountains to the Daling River in the west. The modern usage of \\"Liaodong\\" however simply refers to the half of Liaoning province that is east of the Liao River.  Geography  Map including the Liaodong Peninsula The Liaodong Peninsula lies on the northern shore of the Yellow Sea, dividing the Liaodong Bay (the largest of the three bays of the Bohai Sea) to its west from the Korea Bay to its east. It forms the southern part of a mountain belt that continues northward in the Changbai Mountains. The part of the mountain range on the peninsula is known as the Qianshan Mountains, named after Qian Mountain in Anshan, which includes Dahei Mountain in Dalian.  History  = Pre-Han = The Liaodong region was settled since prehistoric times by Neolithic people such as Xinle culture. It later came under the rule of the Gojoseon kingdom, which encompassed the northern Korean Peninsula and the region southeast of the Liao River. In the late 4th century BC, the expanding Chinese State of Yan conquered this region from Gojoseon, and established the Liaodong Commandery. = Han to Qing = After the fall of the Yan state, the region was taken over by the short-lived Qin Dynasty, and then its prominent successor Han Dynasty. After the Han Dynasty fragmented at the turn of the 3rd century, the region changed hands between various warlord states such as the Gongsun Yuan, the nomadic Wuhuan, and Cao Wei, before eventually falling under the reunified Western Jin dynasty. However, after the Western Jin fell from the Uprising of the Five Barbarians and during the subsequent chaotic Sixteen Kingdoms periods, the region was ruled by Former Yan, Former Qin, Later Yan and later Goguryeo, before being reconquered by the Tang Dynasty. In 698 AD, Wu Zhou's defeat at the Battle of Tianmenling allowed the newly found Balhae to rule the region for the next two centuries, before taken over by the Khitan Liao Dynasty, and followed by the Jin dynasty, Yuan dynasty, Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty. = 20th century = Convention of retrocession of the Liaotung Peninsula, 8 November 1895. The peninsula was an important area of conflict during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895). Defeat precipitated decline in the Qing dynasty which was exploited by colonial powers who extracted numerous concessions. The peninsula was ceded to Japan, along with Taiwan and Penghu, by the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 17 April 1895. However the ceding of Liaodong peninsula was rescinded after the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895 by Russia, France and Germany. In the aftermath of this intervention, the Russian government pressured the Qing dynasty to lease Liaodong and the strategically important L√ºshunkou (Port Arthur) for use by the Russian Navy. As in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Liaodong peninsula was the scene of major fighting in the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), including the bloody Siege of Port Arthur. As a consequence of the Treaty of Portsmouth (5 September 1905), which ended the Russo-Japanese War, both sides agreed to evacuate Manchuria and return it to China, with the exception of the Liaodong Peninsula leased territory which was transferred to Japan,Article Five:The Imperial Government of Russia transfer and assign to the Imperial Government of Japan, with the consent of the Government of China, the lease of Port Arthur, Ta-Lien and the adjacent territory and territorial waters, and all rights, privileges and concessions connected with or forming part of such lease (‚Ä¶) which was to administer it as the Kwantung Leased Territory. After Japan lost World War II, and the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, Liaodong was again under unified Chinese rule, where it has been to this day.

They are one of the possible builders of the pre-Columbian city of El Taj√≠n, and further maintained quarters in Teotihuac√°n (a city which they claim to have built). Until the mid-19th century they were the world's main producers of vanilla. Etymology The term \\"totonac\\" refers to the people living in Totonacapan. There is no agreement as to the origin of the term. Some authors have translated the term \\"totonac\\" as a Nahuatl word meaning \\"People of Hot Land\\". The translation for this word in the Totonac Language, according to sources, is \\"toto-nacu\\" meaning \\"three hearts\\" signifying their three cities or cultural centers: Cempoala, Tajin and Teayo. Evidence, however, is inconclusive.Sandstrom, Alan R., and E. Hugo Garc√≠a Valencia (Eds.). Native Peoples of the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Tucson: The University of Arizona Press (2005). p. 192 Geography and lifestyle View of the main square of the ruins of the city of Cempoala, capital Totonac Nation, the first to establish a military alliance with the Castilian armies to attack the dominions of Aztec Triple Alliance or ƒíxcƒÅn Tlahtol≈çyƒÅn. A ceramic Totonac statuette In the 15th century, the Aztecs labeled the region of the Totonac \\"Totonacapan\\"; which then extended roughly from Papantla in the north to Cempoala in the south. Totonacapan was largely hot and humid. Along with the normal agricultural crops of maize, manioc, squash, beans, pumpkin and chili peppers, the region was noted for its production of liquid amber and cotton. Even during the disastrous central Mexican famine of 1450-1454, the region remained a reliable agricultural center. At that time, many Aztecs were forced to sell themselves or their family members as slaves to the Totonac in exchange for subsistence maize. =Diet= There is a total absence of comals, metates and manos meaning the Totonacs did not eat tortillas; however, even though corn was grown it did not form a large part of their diet. The Totonacs ate fruit, most notably zapotes, guavas, papayas, plantains and avocados. Men hunted and fished shark, turtle, deer, armadillo, opossums, and frogs. Women raised turkeys and dogs. Peasants as well as nobles ate corn porridge in the morning. Lunch was the main meal of the day and consisted of manioc, bean stew or even a rich meat sauce for the nobles. Fish and seafood as well as game was eaten by both nobles and farmers. The agave provided liquor. =Clothing= Totonac women were expert weavers and embroiderers; they dressed grandly and braided their hair with feathers. The Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n stated that, in all aspects of their appearance, the women were \\"quite elegant\\", women wore skirts (embroidered for the nobles) and a small triangular poncho covering the breasts. Noble women wore shell and jade necklaces and earrings and often tattooed their faces with red ink. Married women wore their hair in the Nahuatl fashion while peasant women wore their hair long. Likewise, the noble men dressed well, adorning themselves with multicolored cloaks, loin cloths, necklaces, arm bands, lip plugs and devices made of the prized quetzal feathers. Hair was kept long with a thick tuft of hair on the top tied up with a ribbon. =Housing= Houses were generally thatched and had an overhang. They were rectangular in shape. History The region of Totonacapan was subject to Aztec military incursions from the mid-15th century until the Spanish arrival. Despite the establishment of Aztec fortifications throughout the region, rebellion was endemic. Major Totonac centers were Papantla, with an estimated population of 60,000 in 1519, Xalapa (around 120,000), and Cempoala (around 80,000). Cempoala was the first indigenous city state visited by Hern√°n Cort√©s in his march to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl√°n.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, The Totonacs of Cempoala joined forces with Cort√©s, and along with the Tlaxcalan Indians, contributed significantly to the Spanish conquest. Totonacapan became incorporated into the Spanish regime with comparatively little violence, but the region was ravaged by epidemic diseases during the 16th century. Today, approximately 90,000 Totonac speakers reside in the region. Language The Totonac people speak Totonac, which, together with Tepehua, form an isolated language family; that is, they are not known to be related to any other languages or language families. There are several local varieties of Totonac that are not mutually intelligible. The first grammatical and lexical descriptions of Totonac accessible to Europeans (now lost) were by Fray Andr√©s de Olmos, who also wrote the first such descriptions of Nahuatl and Huastec (Teenek). The main varieties of Totonac are: *Papantla Totonac: spoken by some 80,000 speakers in El Escol√≠n, Papantla, Cazones, Taj√≠n, Espinal, and other towns along the Gulf Coast of Veracruz. *North-Central Totonac: spoken roughly between Poza Rica in Veracruz and Mecapalapa, Pantepec, and Xicotepec de Ju√°rez in Puebla. *South-Central Totonac: spoken mostly in the Sierra Norte de Puebla, including the towns of Zapotitl√°n de M√©ndez, Coatepec, and Huehuetla in Puebla. *Misantla Totonac: spoken by fewer than 500 people in Yecuatla and other communities outside the city of Misantla, Veracruz.  Religion  Most present-day Totonacs are Roman Catholic. However, their Christian practice is often mixed with vestiges of their traditional religion, a notable instance being la Costumbre, a survival of an old rite of sacrifice in which various seeds are mixed with earth and the blood of fowls and dispersed over the planting fields.Catholic Encyclopedia. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14794a.htm The traditional religion was described in the early 1960s by the French ethnographer, Alain Ichon.Ichon 1973 No other major essay on Totonac religion has been found. Mother goddesses played a very important role in Totonac belief, since each person's soul is made by them.Alfredo L√≥pez Austin (transl. by Ortiz de Montellano) : Tamoanchan, Tlalocan. University Press of Colorado, 1997. p. 161, citing Inchon, p. 46 If a newly born child dies, its soul \\"does not go to the west, the place of the dead, but to the east with the Mothers\\".Alfredo L√≥pez Austin (transl. by Ortiz de Montellano) : Tamoanchan, Tlalocan.

As to traditional curers, it is believed that they \\"are born during a storm, under the protection of thunder. They think that a lightning bolt strikes the house of a new-born baby ..., and makes it ... under its possession\\".Alfredo L√≥pez Austin (transl. by Ortiz de Montellano) : Tamoanchan, Tlalocan.

East Jerusalem Zoning Map of East Jerusalem. The Arab areas are coloured green while the Jewish areas are blue. East Jerusalem or Eastern Jerusalem ( ; ) is the sector of Jerusalem that was occupied by Jordan during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, as opposed to the western sector of the city, West Jerusalem, which was occupied by Israel. Since the 1967 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, East Jerusalem has been considered occupied by Israel by the international community. This area includes Jerusalem's Old City and some of the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, such as the Temple Mount, Western Wall, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Dome of the Rock and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, as well as a number of adjacent neighbourhoods. Israeli and Palestinian definitions of it differ. The Palestinian official position is based on the 1949 Armistice Agreements, while the Israeli position is based mainly on the current municipality boundaries of Jerusalem. These were determined by a series of administrative enlargements decided by Israeli municipal authorities since the June 1967 Six-Day War. Despite its name, East Jerusalem includes neighborhoods to the north, east and south of the Old City and, in the wider definition of the term, even on all these sides of West Jerusalem. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal under international law. Israel disputes this interpretation. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Jerusalem was contested between Jordan and Israel. At the cessation of hostilities, the two countries secretly negotiated a division of the city, with the eastern sector coming under Jordanian rule. This arrangement was formalized in the Rhodes Agreement in March 1949. David Ben-Gurion presented his party's assertion that \\"Jewish Jerusalem is an organic, inseparable part of the State of Israel\\" in December 1949, and, the following year, Jordan annexed East Jerusalem. These decisions were confirmed respectively in the Knesset in January 1950 and the Jordanian Parliament in April 1950. When occupied by Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, East Jerusalem, with expanded borders, came under direct Israeli rule, though, according to Ian Lustick, never formally annexed. In a unanimous General Assembly resolution, the UN declared the measures changing the status of the city to be invalid. In the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)'s Palestinian Declaration of Independence of 1988, Jerusalem is stated to be the capital of the State of Palestine. In 2000, the Palestinian Authority passed a law proclaiming Jerusalem as its capital, and in October 2002, this law was approved by chairman Yasser Arafat. Since that time Israel has shut down all offices and NGO organisations connected to the PLO in East Jerusalem, saying that the Oslo Accords do not permit the Palestinian National Authority to operate in Jerusalem. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) recognised East Jerusalem as capital of the State of Palestine on 13 December 2017. The annual number of building permits granted for construction in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem have expanded by 60% since Donald Trump became US president in 2017. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of building permits. Political term East Jerusalem is a term that has strong political implications. Arabs use the term Arab Jerusalem for this area in official English-language documents, emphasizing the predominance of the Arabic- speaking Palestinian population and distinguishing it from the Hebrew-speaking parts of Jerusalem. Israelis call the Arab-populated part of the city East Jerusalem because of its geographic location in the eastern part of the single larger Jerusalem city unit. East Jerusalem is ambiguous and may refer to either of the following: * From 1948 to 1967 it referred to the Jordanian- ruled part of the city, mainly the predominantly Arab business district, the Old City and surrounding neighborhoods; counterpart of West Jerusalem, which referred to the Israeli part of the city. * It may be applied to the area that Israel annexed and included in municipal Jerusalem following its occupation by Israel from Jordan in 1967, which lies north, east and south of the former East Jerusalem. This area includes an additional approximate of the West Bank, including territory which previously included 28 villages and areas of the Bethlehem and Beit Jala municipalities under Jordanian rule. History =Ancient period= The area of East Jerusalem has been inhabited since 5,000 BCE, with settlement beginning in the Chalcolithic period. Tombs are attested by the Early Bronze Age, around 3,200 BCE. In the late second millennium BCE settlement concentrated around the City of David which was chosen because of its proximity to the Gihon Spring. Massive Canaanite constructions were undertaken, with a water channel excavated through rock drawing water to a pool inside the citadel, whose wall was a massive 23 feet thick, built from rocks some weighing up to 3 tons. Old Roman era gate beneath the Damascus Gate (Bab al-'Amud) in Jerusalem =British Mandatory Period= In 1934, the British Mandatory authorities divided Jerusalem into 12 wards for electoral purposes. The mapping was criticized by those who believed it was drawn to ensure a Palestinian majority on the Jerusalem city council. The actual mapping suggests otherwise, according to Michael Dumper, who states that the peculiar \\"hook\\" on the western electoral borders was a gerrymander made to include as many new Jewish neighbourhoods on that side as possible, while keeping outside of the boundaries Arab villages. To the east, the city's border ended at the Old City walls, in order to exclude the contiguous Arab neighbourhood of Silwan, Ras al-Amud and At-Tur and Abu Tor. These boundaries defined the municipality down to 1948. By 1947 Palestinian Arabs constituted a majority overall in the Jerusalem district, but Jews predominated within the British municipal boundaries, 99,000 to 65,100 Arabs. The Jewish presence in eastern Jerusalem was concentrated to the Old Quarter, with a scattering also present in Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah. =1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and aftermath= Of the 30 holy places in Jerusalem, only 3 were located in Western Jerusalem, with the overwhelming bulk lying within the eastern sector. During the subsequent 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, a large number of Jerusalem's churches, convents, mosques, synagogues, monasteries and cemeteries were hit by shell or gunfire. After the armistice the city was divided into two parts. The western portion came under Israeli rule, while the eastern portion, populated mainly by Muslim and Christian Palestinians, came under Jordanian rule, with the international community withholding recognition of the respective areas of control of both parties. During the Battle for Jerusalem, fighting in the Jewish quarter between the Jordanian Arab Legion and the IDF, Irgun and Lehi had been particularly fierce, leaving the zone in ruins. The battle and subsequent looting by Palestinian civilians left 27 synagogues and 30 schools destroyed. The Jordanian army is said to have blown up, three days after conquering the area, what remained of the Hurva Synagogue, which had served both as a civilian refuge and Israeli military post. For Palestinians, expulsions from the Jerusalem area date back to January 1948, when the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel in Qatamon. The death of 26 civilians marked the beginning of evacuation of the area, which increased after the nearby Deir Yassin massacre in early April, followed by a 3-day assault and looting from 30 April onwards. In the first six months of the 1948 war 6,000 Jews also abandoned the city, and when war broke out, thousands fled the northern areas subject to Jordanian shelling. After the surrender to the Jordanian Arab Legion, the Red Cross, which had been invested with the authority to protect many major sites, oversaw the evacuation westwards through Zion Gate of some 1,300 Jews from the Old Quarter. The only eastern area of the city that remained in Israeli hands throughout the 19 years of Jordanian rule was Mount Scopus, where the Hebrew University is located, which formed an enclave during that period. Likewise, Palestinians living in such western Jerusalem neighbourhoods as Qatamon, Talbiya, Baq'a, 'Ayn Karim, Lifta and Malha either fled or were forced out, many of them seeking refuge in the Old City East Jerusalem absorbed thousands of Palestinian refugees, a substantial number of whom were middle-class people from West Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods when they came under Israeli rule, and many were settled in the previous Jewish areas of the eastern sector, whose inhabitants, likewise refugees, were relocated in the formerly majority-Arab suburbs of West Jerusalem, such as Overall, as a result of the conflict, the Jewish population of Jerusalem fell by 30-40% while Eyal Benvenisti states half of its Palestinian population of 60,000 left. According to the Jordanian census of 1952, East Jerusalem had an Arab population of 46.700. =Jordanian rule= 1961 Jordan Tourism Map of Jerusalem King Hussein flying over the Temple Mount while it was under Jordanian control, 1965 Jerusalem was to be an international city under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. It was not included as a part of either the proposed Jewish or Arab states. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the western part of Jerusalem was captured by Israel, while East Jerusalem (including the Old City) was captured by Jordan. The war came to an end with the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements. On 23 January 1950, Israel declared Jerusalem its capital, with a Knesset resolution declaring that, \\"With the creation of a Jewish State, Jerusalem again became its capital\\". Jordan followed suit on 24 April and, on the basis of a referendum conducted also among Palestinian West Bankers, the Hashemite Kingdom incorporated the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The unification was recognized by the United Kingdom, which however stipulated that they did not recognize the assertion of Jordanian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, but only de facto control. The United States, while approving the unification, withheld making any public statement and likewise affirmed that since the issue of Jerusalem was sub judice, it did not recognize either the Israeli annexation of West Jerusalem, nor the Jordanian annexation of the eastern area of the city. The municipal boundaries of Jordanian East Jerusalem were expanded to cover by taking in the nearby villages of Silwan, Ras al-Amud Aqabat al-Suwana, 'Ard al-Samar and parts of Shuafat. This expansion of the boundaries was prompted in large part by the need to cope with housing the refugee flow of Palestinians from West Jerusalem. While many municipal functions were shifted to Amman, in 1953, Jordan conferred on East Jerusalem the status of amana (trusteeship)- in response to Israeol efforts to make West Jerusalem Israel's capital- effectively making the city Jordan's second capital. The political motive behind the transfer of the bureaucracy to Amman lay in the desire to weaken the power of the rival al-Husayni clan. Generally the Jordanian authorities maintained the Ottoman status quo with regard to sacred sites in East Jerusalem. When the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, always an object of bitter contention between Greek Orthodox and Latin rite Christians, was engulfed in flames and severely damaged on 29 November 1949, the Vatican proposed the Tesla plan, which foresaw a reconstruction involving the demolition of the existing church and a contiguous mosque and its replacement by a predominantly Catholic-style structure. Jordan's King Abdullah gave his assent, on one condition he knew would be impossible to fulfill and therefore would abort the project. He stipulated that to go ahead, all involved denominations would have to approve the plan, which would have given the Catholic Church a primacy of authority over the others. Repairs were delayed a decade until a consensus was achieved between the Greek, Latin-rite and Armenian clerics (excluding the Copts), with Jordan playing a pivotal role as mediator. In the early 1960s Jordan gave the go-ahead for the construction of the Intercontinental Hotel on the Mount of Olives on waqf terrain expropriated in 1952 from the family of Abd al-Razzaq al-'Alami. Three roads, one an access route built through the Jewish Har HaZeitim Cemetery damaged many gravestones, though opinjions differ as to the scale of the damage. For Yitzhak Reiter, the majority of graves were unaffected. According to Michael Fischbach, 40,000 of the 50,000 tombstones suffered some form of desecration. The Israeli government protested the desecration, stating that some gravestones had been used for roadwork and a military latrine. This East Jerusalem controversy inverted the terms of an earlier dispute when Jordan complained in 1950 of Israeli damage to the Mamilla cemetery in West Jerusalem. the ancient Jewish cemetery on Mount of Olives Tourism in Palestine had long been an undeveloped and marginal sector of the local economy, and, with the division of Jerusalem after 1948, political issues impeded its commercial development as a tourist destination. Eastern Jerusalem suffered an outflow of population, partially accounted for by merchants and administrators moving to Amman. On the other hand, it maintained its religious importance, as well as its role as a regional center. Reaffirming a 1953 statement, Jordan in 1960 declared Jerusalem its second capital. The US (and other powers) protested this plan, and stated it could not \\"recognize or associate itself in any way with actions which confer upon Jerusalem the attributes of a seat of government...\\" During the 1960s, Jerusalem saw economic improvement and its tourism industry developed significantly, and its holy sites attracted growing numbers of pilgrims, but as Jordan did not recognize Israeli passports, neither Jewish nor Muslim Israelis were allowed access to their traditional sites of worship in East Jerusalem, though Israeli Christians, with a special laissez-passer. were permitted to visit Bethlehem over Christmas and the New Year. =Israeli rule= =After 1967 war= United Nations map of the area, showing the Israeli occupation arrangements. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, the eastern part of Jerusalem came under Israeli rule, along with the entire West Bank. Shortly after the Israeli takeover, East Jerusalem was absorbed into West Jerusalem, together with several neighboring West Bank villages. In November 1967, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 was passed, calling for Israel to withdraw \\"from territories occupied in the recent conflict\\" in exchange for peace treaties. In 1980, the Knesset passed the Jerusalem Law, which declared that \\"Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel\\", which is commonly called an act of annexation, though no such formal measure was even taken. This declaration was determined to be \\"null and void\\" by United Nations Security Council Resolution 478. Overview On 28 June 1967 Israel extended Israeli \\"law, jurisdiction and administration\\" to the area of East Jerusalem, without naming it, by incorporating it into its municipality of West Jerusalem. Internally, this move was explained as one of annexation, integrating that part of the city into Israel. Towards the international community, which was critical, it was justified as a purely technical measure, to provide equal administrative services to all its residents, and not annexation, and the same applied to Israel's assertion of a claim of sovereignty on the passage of the 30 July 1980 Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council censured Israel for the move and declared the law \\"null and void\\" in United Nations Security Council Resolution 478, and the international community continues to regard East Jerusalem as held under Israeli occupation. Israel then disbanded the elected Arab municipal council placing it under the administration of West Jerusalem's mayor Teddy Kollek. A problem arose when it was noted that East Jerusalem also had a mayor, Ruhi al-Khatib, and an elected 11 other members on the Jordanian city council. Uzi Narkiss realized the Arab council had not been dismissed. He therefore ordered the deputy military governor, Ya'akov Salman, to depose the council. Salman was at a loss as to how this measure could be executed, but Narkiss insisted he find some grounds for doing so. Eventually Salman summoned Khatib and 4 other members to the Gloria Hotel restaurant, and read out a short statement in Hebrew. > In the name of the Israeli Defense Forces, I respectfully inform Mr Ruhi al- > Khatib and members of the Jerusalem City Council that the Council is hereby > dissolved. al-Khatib demanded the order in writing, and an Arabic translation was written out on a napkin. According to Uzi Benzamin, the Israeli journalist who wrote up the encounter, \\"the whole episode lacked any shred of legality\\". Soon after al-Khatib, who had worked for an orderly transition, was deported to Jordan for organizing protests. Services like electricity supply were transferred from Palestinian to Israeli companies, and a ministerial decision established a policy that the ratio of Jews to Palestinians, as a matter of policy, would be 76 to 24, though the 2000 Masterplan adjusted this to a 70-30 ratio, which in turn had to be subject to a 60-40% proportion given Palestinian demographic growth, which now constitutes 37% of the city's population. When offered a path to Israeli citizenship, the overwhelming majority opted for resident status instead, and adopted a boycott strategy against Israeli institutions. 90% of the land of East Jerusalem included thereafter in its municipality was added after 1967 by expropriating in most cases village or private land owned by people, not from East Jerusalem itself, but who were living in 28 Palestinian villages. According to its former deputy mayor Meron Benvenisti, the plan was designed in such a way as to incorporate a maximum of land with a minimum of Arabs. Thereafter a property tax (arnona) regime was introduced which allowed Jewish settlers a 5-year exemption and then reduced taxes, while leaving Jerusalemite West Bankers, whose zones are classified to be in the high property tax bracket, paying for 26% of municipal services, while themselves receiving only 5% of the benefit (2000). By 1986 60% of Arab East Jerusalem lacked a garbage collection infrastructure, schools could not expand classrooms and were forced into a unique double-shift system. Jewish neighbourhoods were allowed to build up to eight storeys high while Palestinians in East Jerusalem were restricted to two. The area's infrastructure still remains in a state of neglect. According to B'Tselem, as of 2017, the 370,000 overcrowded West Bankers in this zone are bereft of any control over their lives, given extreme restrictions on the movement of residents without any advance notice. Their residency can be revoked; building permits are rarely given and a separation wall fences them off from the rest of the city. Every day 140,000 Palestinnians have to negotiate checkpoints to work, get a medical check-up or visit friends. Poverty has steadily increased among them, with 77% of \\"non-Jewish\\" households in Jerusalem under the Israeli poverty line, as opposed to 24.4% of Jewish families (2010). An International Crisis Group report of 2012 described the effects of Israeli policies: cut off from trade with the West Bank by the Separation Barrier, denied political organization ‚Äì which Israel's counter-terrorism agency includes as \\"political subversion\\" ‚Äì by the closure of the PLO's Orient House, it is an \\"orphan city\\" hemmed in by flourishing Jewish neighbourhoods. With local construction blocked, the Palestinian neighbourhoods have become slums, where even the Israeli police will not venture except for security reasons, so that criminal businesses have thrived. =Territorial modifications= The extension of Israeli jurisdiction into East Jerusalem and its surroundings on into the municipality of Jerusalem involved the inclusion of several neighboring villages, expanding the municipality area of Jordanian East Jerusalem by integrating into it a further of West Bank territory, while excluding many of East Jerusalem's suburbs, such as Abu Dis, Al-Eizariya, Beit Hanina and Al- Ram, and dividing several Arab villages. Israel refrained however from endowing citizenship ‚Äì a mark of annexation- on the Palestinians incorporated within the new municipal borders. The old Moroccan Quarter in front of the Western Wall was bulldozed three days after its capture, leading to the forced resettlement of its 135 families. It was replaced with a large open air plaza. The Jewish Quarter, destroyed in 1948, was depopulated, rebuilt and resettled by Jews. After 1980 incorporation Israeli West Bank barrier in Jerusalem Under Israeli rule, members of all religions are largely granted access to their holy sites, with the Muslim Waqf maintaining control of the Temple Mount and the Muslim holy sites there. With the stated purpose of preventing infiltration during the Second Intifada, Israel decided to surround Jerusalem's eastern perimeter with a security barrier. The structure has separated East Jerusalem neighborhoods from the West Bank suburbs, all of which are under the jurisdiction of Israel and the IDF. The planned route of the separation barrier has raised much criticism, with the Israeli Supreme Court ruling that certain sections of the barrier (including East Jerusalem sections) must be re-routed. In the Oslo Accords, the PLO conceded that the question of East Jerusalem be excluded from the interim agreement, and be left to final status negotiations. Under the pretext that they are part of the PA, Israel closed many Palestinian NGOs since 2001. In the 25 January 2006 Palestinian Legislative Elections, 6,300 East Jerusalem Arabs were registered and permitted to vote locally. All other residents had to travel to West Bank polling stations. Hamas won four seats and Fatah two, even though Hamas was barred by Israel from campaigning in the city. Fewer than 6,000 residents were permitted to vote locally in the prior 1996 elections. In March 2009, a confidential \\"EU Heads of Mission Report on East Jerusalem\\" was published, in which the Israeli government was accused of \\"actively pursuing the illegal annexation\\" of East Jerusalem. The report stated: \\"Israeli 'facts on the ground' ‚Äì including new settlements, construction of the barrier, discriminatory housing policies, house demolitions, restrictive permit regime and continued closure of Palestinian institutions ‚Äì increase Jewish Israeli presence in East Jerusalem, weaken the Palestinian community in the city, impede Palestinian urban development and separate East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank.\\" In 2018, Al Bawaba reported that Israel had approved the construction of 640 new \\"Jewish-only\\" housing units in the ultra orthodox Ramat Shlomo settlement. Some of these units will be built on privately owned Palestinian lands. According to B'tselem, the Israeli authorities have destroyed 949 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem since 2004, resulting in the displacement of over 3,000 Palestinians. Since 2016 there has been a notable uptick in demolitions, with 92 razed that year. In the first ten months of 2019 over 140 homes were demolished, leaving 238 Palestinians, 127 of them minors, homeless.Yumna Patel, 'Israel destroyed record number of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem in 2019,' Mondoweiss 25 October 2019 'Demolition of houses and Non-residential structures in East Jerusalem, 2004-2019,' B'tselem 24 October 2019 A poll conducted by Palestinian Center for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations, among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship contrary to 31% who opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll, 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighborhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule. As of 1998 Jerusalem's religious heritage consists of 1072 synagogues, 52 mosques, 65 churches and 72 monasteries. Status Jerusalem municipal area, under Israel in 2000 Greater Jerusalem, May 2006. CIA remote sensing map showing areas they consider settlements, plus refugee camps, fences, walls, etc. =Sovereignty= East Jerusalem has been occupied by Israel since 1967 and has been effectively annexed, in an act internationally condemned, by Israel in 1980. On 27‚Äì28 June 1967, East Jerusalem was integrated into Jerusalem by extension of its municipal borders and was placed under the law, jurisdiction and administration of the State of Israel. In a unanimous General Assembly resolution, the UN declared the measures trying to change the status of the city invalid. In a reply to the resolution, Israel denied these measures constituted annexation, and contended that it merely wanted to deliver services to its inhabitants and protect the Holy Places. Some lawyers, among them Yehuda Blum and Julius Stone, have argued that Israel has sovereignty over East Jerusalem under international law, since Jordan did not have legal sovereignty over the territory, and thus Israel was entitled in an act of self-defense during the Six-Day War to \\"fill the vacuum\\". This interpretation is a minority position, and international law considers all the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) to be occupied territory and call for Palestinians in the occupied territories (including East Jerusalem) to be given self-determination Israel has never formally annexed Jerusalem, nor claimed sovereignty there but its extension of Israeli law and administration there in 1967, and the Jerusalem Basic Law of 1980 are often taken as coinstituting an effective form of annexation The Israeli Supreme Court recognized that East Jerusalem had become an integral part of the State of Israel, ruling that even if Knesset laws contravene international law, the court is bound by domestic law and therefore considers the area annexed. According to lawyers, annexation of an area would automatically make its inhabitants Israeli citizens, a condition lacking and East Jerusalem's Palestinians have the status of \\"permanent residents\\". The United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 of 2012 affirmed that East Jerusalem forms part of the West Bank and is occupied. Historically, defining a Palestinian position on Jerusalem and East Jerusalem proved difficult, given the political conflicts that arose between strategies proposed by the local East Jerusalemite establishment led by Faisal Husseini and those of the PLO under Yasser Arafat regarding the processes to be chosen to define the city's Palestinian status. =Negotiations on \\"share\\" or \\"divide\\"= East Jerusalem, with Israeli West Bank barrier in the background Both the Oslo Accords and the 2003 Road map for peace postponed the negotiations on the status of Jerusalem. The 1997 Beilin‚ÄìEitan Agreement between some members of the Likud block and Yossi Beilin, representing Labor, which envisioned for final negotiations a limited autonomy to a demilitarized \\"Palestinian entity\\" surrounded on all sides by Israel, stated that all of Jerusalem would remain unified under Israeli sovereignty. Beilin suggested Palestinians would accept a capital outside of Jerusalem in Abu Dis, undermined the credibility of the document in Palestinian eyes. Israel's settlement policy in East Jerusalem has been described by Avi Shlaim and others as one aiming to preempt negotiations by creating facts on the ground. The Beilin‚ÄìAbu Mazen agreement of 1995, suggested while Israel would not accept challenges to its political sovereignty over all of Jerusalem it might, with the idea of a holy basin, theoretically allow Palestinian extraterritorial sovereignty over a part of the East Jerusalem area, with Palestinians directly controlling the Noble Sanctuary, while Jews would obtain religious rights over the Temple Mount. This view, splitting religious and political authority, was unacceptable to Hamas and Arafat soon disowned the idea. At the 2000 Camp David Summit, it was agreed there could be no return to the pre-1967 Jerusalem lines of demarcation; that Israel's unilaterally imposed municipal boundaries were not fixed; that just as Israel's expansion there would be larger than mapped just after 1967, so too the Palestinian expansion would stretch out to take in villages not connected to the city earlier; that Jerusalem would remain a single unified metropolitan unit not divided by an international border, and under the governance of two distinct municipal authorities, with one under full Palestinian sovereignty and serving as the capital of the State of Palestine, exercising full powers in most parts of East Jerusalem. An exchange of neighbourhoods was envisaged, with Israel taking sovereignty over Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Ze'ev and Gush Etzion, while excluding areas earlier included, such as Sur Baher, Beit Hanina and Shu'afat. During the last serious negotiations in 2008 with the government OF Ehud Olmert, Olmert, on 16 September, included a map which foresaw a shared arrangement over Jerusalem, with Israeli settlements remaining in Israel and Palestinian neighbourhoods part of a Palestinian state and constituting their future capital. The Holy Basin, including the Old City, would be under joint trusteeship overseen by Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United States and the state of Palestine. Olmert showed, but would not share, the map with Mahmood Abbas, who was forced to make a copy of it on a napkin. =Jerusalem as capital= Dome of the Rock in the Old City While both Israel and Palestine declared Jerusalem their capital, the Palestinians usually refer to East Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine. In 1980, the Knesset adopted the \\"Jerusalem Law\\" as a Basic Law, declaring Jerusalem \\"complete and united\\", \\"the capital of Israel\\". The law applied to both West and East Jerusalem within, among others, the expanded boundaries as defined in June 1967. While the Jerusalem Law has political and symbolic importance, it added nothing to the legal or administrative circumstance of the city. The Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (Oslo I), signed 13 September 1993, deferred the settlement of the permanent status of Jerusalem to the final stages of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The Beilin-Abu Mazen Plan stated that, \\"Israel will recognize that the (portion of) the area defined as 'Al-Quds' prior to the six day war which exceeds the area annexed to Israel in 1967 will be the capital of the Palestinian state\\". This formulation was based, according to Tanya Reinhart, on a verbal trick in that, by conferring on Abu Dis, which was within the Jordanian municipality of Jerusalem but outside Israel's redefinition, the title the holy city referring in Arabic to Jerusalem, Israel could assert that it was acceding to the idea of dividing Jerusalem. Arafat concurred with this Israeli proposal, and Israel asserted a pre-condition, namely, that all Palestinian institutions be removed from Jerusalem proper and transferred to Abu Dis. In compliance, the Palestinians built their government offices and a proposed future parliament house there, but an undertaking to transfer Abu Dis, and the neighbouring Al-Eizariya into Area C, under full Palestinian autonomy, was never fulfilled. Ehud Barak had, it is reported, before the Camp David talks, reneged on this promise which was personally conveyed to the Palestinians through President Bill Clinton. Barak remained committed to a unified Israeli Jerusalem, the default position of all Israeli governments who regard its division as non-negotiable. At the Taba Summit in 2001 Israel made substantial concessions regarding territory but not sufficient to permit a contiguous Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. Position of the United States American policy on Jerusalem, despite a standard refrain of \\"continuity,\\" has been altered repeatedly since 1947, exhibiting sometimes drastic fluctuations since 1967. Historically, down to 1967, it had viewed East Jerusalem as forming part of the West Bank, a territory under belligerent occupation. On 1 March 1990, President George H. W. Bush stated publicly, the first time for an American president, an objection to Israeli building in East Jerusalem. That same year, the United States Congress unanimously adopted the Senate's Concurrent Resolution 106 adopted a resolution affirming its belief that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city this view with the Senate Concurrent Resolution 113 of 1992. This was sponsored by AIPAC and, according to John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, was a \\"transparent attempt to disrupt the peace process\\". In the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 8 November 1995 it set 1999 as the final date whereby the US embassy was to be relocated to that city, stating Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel, and that no more that 50% of the State Department funds for building abroad should be allocated until the Embassy was established there. Provision was made for the exercise of a presidential waiver. In 1991, as part of a preparatory gesture before the Madrid Peace Conference the United States in a Letter of Assurances to the Palestinians (15 October 1991) stated that the United States undertook to act as an honest broker and expressed opposition to any unilateral measures that might prejudice peace talks, a statement the Palestinians understood to refer to Israeli settlements and policy in Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the subsequent Clinton Administration refused to characterise East Jerusalem as being under occupation and viewed it as a territory over which sovereignty was undefined. Vice President Al Gore stated that the US viewed \\"united Jerusalem\\" as the capital of Israel. In light of this designation, the US has since abstained from Security Council resolutions which use language which construes East Jerusalem as forming part of the West Bank. In 2016, U.S. presidential election candidate Donald Trump vowed to recognize all of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel if he wins the election. In 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and, on 14 May 2018, the United States moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. =Residency= Following the 1967 war, Israel conducted a census in East Jerusalem and granted permanent Israeli residency to those Arab Jerusalemites present at the time of the census. Those not present lost the right to reside in Jerusalem. Jerusalem Palestinians are permitted to apply for Israeli citizenship, provided they meet the requirements for naturalization‚Äîsuch as swearing allegiance to Israel and renouncing all other citizenships‚Äîwhich most of them refuse to do. At the end of 2005, 93% of the Arab population of East Jerusalem had permanent residency and 5% had Israeli citizenship. Between 2008 and 2010, approximately 4,500 Palestinians resident in East Jerusalem applied for Israeli citizenship, of which one third were accepted, one third rejected, and one third had the decision postponed. As residents, East Jerusalemites without Israeli citizenship have the right to vote in municipal elections and play a role in the administration of the city. Residents pay taxes, and following a 1988 Israeli Supreme Court ruling, East Jerusalem residents are guaranteed the right to social security benefits and state health care. Until 1995, those who lived abroad for more than seven years or obtained residency or citizenship in another country were deemed liable to lose their residency status. In 1995, Israel began revoking permanent residency status from former Arab residents of Jerusalem who could not prove that their \\"center of life\\" was still in Jerusalem. This policy was rescinded four years later. In March 2000, the Minister of the Interior, Natan Sharansky, stated that the \\"quiet deportation\\" policy would cease, the prior policy would be restored, and Arab natives to Jerusalem would be able to regain residency if they could prove that they have visited Israel at least once every three years. Since December 1995, permanent residency of more than 3,000 individuals \\"expired\\", leaving them with neither citizenship nor residency. Despite changes in policy under Sharansky, in 2006 the number of former Arab Jerusalemites to lose their residency status was 1,363, a sixfold increase on the year before. Urban planning UN map showing a series of Israeli \\"Inner Settlements\\" ‚Äì each represented as red crosses ‚Äì with clusters in the Old City, to the south adjacent to the City of David (shown as \\"Beit Hazofe\\" (◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊î◊¶◊ï◊§◊î, \\"Observation House\\")) and Ma'ale HaZeitim, and to the north around Shimon HaTzadik. The term East Jerusalem sometimes refers to the area which was incorporated into the municipality of Jerusalem after 1967, covering some , while sometimes it refers to the smaller area of the pre-1967 Jordanian-controlled part of the Jerusalem municipality, covering . 39 percent (372,000) of Jerusalem's 800,000 residents are Palestinian, but the municipal budget allocates only 10% of its budget to them. East Jerusalem has been designed to become an Israeli Jewish city surrounding numerous small enclaves, under military control, for the Palestinian residents. The last link in the chain of settlements closing off East Jerusalem from the West Bank was forged in 1997 when Binyamin Netanyahu approved, as part of what he perceived as a battle for the city, the construction of the settlement of Har Homa. According to the Israeli non- governmental organization B'Tselem, since the 1990s, policies that made construction permits harder to obtain for Arab residents have caused a housing shortage that forces many of them to seek housing outside East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem residents that are married to residents of the West Bank and Gaza have had to leave Jerusalem to join their husbands and wives due to the citizenship law. Many have left Jerusalem in search of work abroad, as, in the aftermath of the Second Intifada, East Jerusalem has increasingly been cut off from the West Bank and thereby has lost its main economic hub. Israeli journalist Shahar Shahar argues that this outmigration has led many Palestinians in East Jerusalem to lose their permanent residency status. According to the American Friends Service Committee and Marshall J. Breger, such restrictions on Palestinian planning and development in East Jerusalem are part of Israel's policy of promoting a Jewish majority in the city. On 13 May 2007, the Israeli Cabinet began discussion regarding a proposition to expand Israel's presence in East Jerusalem and boost its economy so as to attract Jewish settlers. To facilitate more Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, the Cabinet is now considering an approximately 5.75 billion NIS plan to reduce taxes in the area, relocate a range of governmental offices, construct new courthouses, and build a new center for Jerusalem studies. Plans to construct 25,000 Jewish homes in East Jerusalem are in the development stages. As Arab residents are hard-pressed to obtain building permits to develop existing infrastructure or housing in East Jerusalem, this proposition has received much criticism. According to Justus Weiner of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the Jerusalem municipality granted the Arab sector 36,000 building permits, \\"more than enough to meet the needs of Arab residents through legal construction until 2020\\". Both Arabs and Jews \\"typically wait 4‚Äì6 weeks for permit approval, enjoy a similar rate of application approvals, and pay an identical fee ($3,600) for water and sewage hook-ups on the same size living unit\\". Weiner writes that while illegal Jewish construction typically involves additions to existing legal structures, illegal Arab construction involves the construction of entire multi-floor buildings with 4 to 25 living units, built with financial assistance from the Palestinian National Authority on land not owned by the builder. A European Union report of March 2010 has asserted that 93,000 East Jerusalem Palestinians, 33% of the total, are at risk of losing their homes, given Israeli building restrictions imposed on them, with only 13% of the municipal territory allowed for their housing, as opposed to 53% for Jewish settlement. It wrote further that in 2013 98 such buildings were demolished, leaving 298 people homeless, while a further 400 lost their workplace and livelihoods, and that 80% live below the poverty level. 2,000 Palestinian children, and 250 teachers in the sector must pass Israeli checkpoints to get to school each day. Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem have 30 times the number of playgrounds that Palestinian areas have. One was built for the 40,000 strong community of Sur Baher with Belgian funding in 2015 after a Jerusalem court directed the municipal council to begin constructing them. It was constructed without a permit, and the Israeli authorities say the difference is due to the difficulty of finding vacant lots suitable to playgrounds in the Arab sectors. Demographics In the 1967 census, the Israeli authorities registered 66,000 Palestinian residents (44,000 residing in the area known before the 1967 war as East Jerusalem; and 22,000, in the West Bank area annexed to Jerusalem after the war). Only a few hundred Jews were living in East Jerusalem at that time, since most Jews had been expelled in 1948 during the Jordanian rule. By June 1993, a Jewish majority was established in East Jerusalem: 155,000 Jews were officially registered residents, as compared to 150,000 Palestinians. At the end of 2008, the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these, 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Arabs. Of the Arabs, 95% were Muslims, comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem, and the remaining 5% were Christians. In 2008, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census. At the end of 2008, East Jerusalem's main Arab neighborhoods included Shuafat (38,800), Beit Hanina (27,900), the Muslim Quarter of the Old City (26,300), At-Tur including As- Sawana (24,400). East Jerusalem's main Jewish neighborhoods include Ramot (42,200), Pisgat Ze'ev (42,100), Gilo (26,900), Neve Yaakov (20,400), Ramat Shlomo (15,100) and East Talpiot (12,200). The Old City (including the already mentioned Muslim Quarter) has an Arab population of 36,681 and a Jewish population of 3,847. In 2016, the population of East Jerusalem was 542,400, comprising 61% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these, 214,600 (39.6%) were Jews, and 327,700 (60.4%) were Arabs. According to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem has expanded by 60% since Trump became US president in 2017. Since 1991, Palestinians who make up the majority of the residents in the area have only received 30% of the building permits. Healthcare Until 1998, residents of East Jerusalem were disadvantaged in terms of healthcare service and providers. By 2012, almost every neighborhood in East Jerusalem had health clinics that included advanced medical equipment, specialized ER units, X-ray diagnostic centers and dental clinics. Israel's system of healthcare entitles all Israeli citizens and East Jerusalem residents to receive free healthcare service funded by the Israeli government. According to Haaretz in 2015, the quality of healthcare centers between Israeli cities and East Jerusalem are almost equal. The health quality indices in East Jerusalem increased from a grade of 74 in 2009 to 87 in 2012, which is the same quality grade the clinics in West Jerusalem received.B'tselem maintains that, despite constituting 40% of Jerusalem's population, the municipality only runs six healthcare centers in the Palestinian sector, compared to the 27 run by the state in Jewish neighbourhoods. According to ACRI, only 11% of the residents of East Jerusalem are treated by the welfare services. In 2006 64% of the Palestinian population lived below the population. By 2015 75%, and 84% of their children, were living below the poverty line. In 2018, President Donald Trump's administration cut $25 million from hospitals in East Jerusalem that specialized in cancer care for Palestinians. The cut in funds covers 40% of the running costs for 6 hospitals providing treatment for patients from both the Gaza Strip and the broader West Bank where treatment is unavailable. The shortfall was thought to put at serious risk the viability of both Augusta Victoria Hospital and Saint John Eye Hospital. The sum saved was to be redirected to \\"high-priority projects\\" elsewhere. Culture Jerusalem was designated the Arab Capital of Culture in 2009. In March 2009, Israel's Internal Security Minister responded with a number of injunctions, banning scheduled cultural events in the framework of this designation in Jerusalem, Nazareth and in other parts of the Palestinian Territories. The Minister instructed Israel Police to \\"suppress any attempts by the PA to hold events in Jerusalem and throughout the rest of the country\\". The minister issued the ban on the basis that the events would be a violation of a clause in the interim agreement between Israel and the Palestinians that forbids the Palestinian Authority (PA) from organizing events in Israeli territory. On 22 June 2013, the Israeli Public Security Minister closed the El-Hakawati Theater for eight days, to prevent a puppet theater festival with an 18-year tradition. Israel Security Agency Shin Bet accused the Palestinian Authority of funding the child-festival, which was denied by the theater director. A month later, members of Israel's theater world held a protest. On 29 June 2013, Israel denied members of the Ramallah Orchestra from the Al Kamandj√¢ti music school access to East Jerusalem, where they were to give a concert in the French St. Anne's church. Nevertheless, after the musicians had climbed over the Separation Wall, the concert eventually took place. Economy May 2013, UNCTAD published the first comprehensive investigation into the East Jerusalem economy undertaken by the United Nations. The report concluded that the Israeli occupation had caused the economy to shrink by half in the last 20 years compared to West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it described as \\"a dismal testament to the decline of the East Jerusalem economy and its growing isolation under prolonged occupation\\", that resulted in the economic isolation of Palestinian residents. It found a 77% to 25% differential in the number of households living below the poverty line in non-Jewish and Jewish households respectively, with the differential in child poverty being 84% for Palestinian children as opposed to 45% for Jewish children. Major problems were said to be restrictions on movement of goods and people, which Israel says are imposed for security reasons, and Israeli neglect of \\"dire socio- economic conditions\\". UNCTAD said \\"the Israeli government could go much further in meeting its obligations as an occupying power by acting with vigour to improve the economic conditions in East Jerusalem and the well-being of its Palestinian residents\\". The Palestinians' governor of Jerusalem said \\"some relaxation of the political situation\\" was required for the economy to improve. Other Over 95% of East Jerusalemite Palestinians retain residency status rather than citizenship. Application for citizenship have grown from 69 (2003) to over 1,000 (2018) but obtaining Israel citizenship has been described as an uphill battle, with the number of applicants who receive a positive response meager. Obtaining an appointment for an interview alone can take 3 years followed by another 3 to 4 years to obtain a decision one way or another. Of 1,081 requests in 2016 only 7 were approved, though by 2018, 353 approvals were given to the 1,012 Palestinians applying. Lack of sufficient fluency in Hebrew, suspicions the applicant might have property in the West Bank, or be a security risk (such as having once visited a relative gaoled on security grounds) are considered impediments. East Jerusalem residents are increasingly becoming integrated into Israeli society. Trends among East Jerusalem residents have shown: increasing numbers of applications for an Israeli ID card; more high school students taking the Israeli matriculation exams; greater numbers enrolling in Israeli academic institutions; a decline in the birthrate; more requests for building permits; a rising number of East Jerusalem youth volunteering for national service; a higher level of satisfaction according to polls of residents; increased Israeli health services; and a survey showing that in a final agreement more East Jerusalem Palestinians would prefer to remain under Israeli rule. According to the Israeli Education Ministry, the number of East Jerusalem high school students who took Israeli matriculation exams rose from 5,240 in 2008 to 6,022 in 2011. There are 10 schools in East Jerusalem that specialize in preparing East Jerusalem students for Israeli universities and colleges; one of the biggest schools is the Anta Ma'ana (\\"You are with us\\") Institute on Al-Zahara Street. East Jerusalem has a shortage of schools for Palestinian children. In 2012, the classroom shortage was reportedly 1,100, due to what Haaretz described as \\"years of intentional neglect of East Jerusalem schools, which serve the Arab population by the Education Ministry and the city\\". A relatively high dropout rate of schoolchildren is found in the Arab sector, even 40% among 12th graders in 2011. Education The new building is Schmidt's Girls College.

Drilling began on 24 May 1970 using the Uralmash-4E, and later the Uralmash-15000 series drilling rig. Boreholes were drilled by branching from a central hole.

On 6 June 1979, the world depth record held by the Bertha Rogers hole in Washita County, Oklahoma, United States, at was broken. In 1983, the drill passed , and drilling was stopped for about a year for numerous scientific and celebratory visits to the site. This idle period may have contributed to a breakdown after drilling resumed; on 27 September 1984, after drilling to , a section of the drill string twisted off and was left in the hole. Drilling was later restarted from . The hole reached in 1989. In that year, the hole depth was expected to reach by the end of 1990 and by 1993.Kola Superdeep is in the Guinness Book of World Records, Zemlya i Vselennaya, 1989, no. 3, p.9 Because of higher-than-expected temperatures at this depth and location, instead of the expected , drilling deeper was deemed unfeasible. The unexpected decrease in density, the greater porosity, and the unexpectedly high temperatures, caused the rock to behave somewhat like a plastic, making drilling nearly impossible. Kola Superdeep Borehole, Murmansk, Russia (Atlas Obscura, accessed 14 August 2020) Drilling was terminated in 1992. Research The Kola Superdeep Borehole penetrated about a third of the way through the Baltic Shield continental crust, estimated to be around deep, reaching Archean rocks at the bottom. The project has been a site of extensive geophysical examinations. The stated areas of study were the deep structure of the Baltic Shield, seismic discontinuities and the thermal regime in the Earth's crust, the physical and chemical composition of the deep crust and the transition from upper to lower crust, lithospheric geophysics, and to create and develop technologies for deep geophysical study. To scientists, one of the more fascinating findings to emerge from this well is that no transition from granite to basalt was found at the depth of about , where the velocity of seismic waves has a discontinuity. Instead the change in the seismic wave velocity is caused by a metamorphic transition in the granite rock. In addition, the rock at that depth had been thoroughly fractured and was saturated with water, which was surprising. This water, unlike surface water, must have come from deep-crust minerals and had been unable to reach the surface because of a layer of impermeable rock. Microscopic plankton fossils were found 6 kilometers (4 mi) below the surface. Another unexpected discovery was a large quantity of hydrogen gas. The drilling mud that flowed out of the hole was described as \\"boiling\\" with hydrogen. In 1992 an international geophysical experiment obtained a reflection seismic crustal cross-section through the well. The Kola-92 working group consisted of researchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland, the University of Wyoming in the United States and the University of Bergen in Norway as well as several Russian earth science research institutions.

Part of the Collegiate Gothic Memorial Quadrangle complex completed in 1922, it is named for Charles William Harkness, brother of Yale's largest benefactor, Edward Harkness. History Harkness Tower over the year The tower was constructed between 1917 and 1921 as part of the Memorial Quadrangle donated to Yale by Anna M. Harkness in honor of her recently deceased son, Charles William Harkness, an 1883 Yale graduate. When the residential college system was inaugurated in 1933, the tower became part of Branford College. It was designed by James Gamble Rogers, a Yale College classmate of Anna Harkness's other son, Edward S. Harkness. James S. Hedden was the contractor's supervisor for the project and took many photographs of the construction's progress. The tower underwent renovations from September 2009 to May 2010 to repair its masonry and ornament. Influence Harkness Tower was the first couronne (\\"crown\\") tower in English Perpendicular Gothic style built in the modern era. James Gamble Rogers, who designed the tower and many of Yale's Collegiate Gothic structures, said it was inspired by the 15th- century Boston Stump, the tower of the parish church of St Botolph in Boston, Lincolnshire and tallest parish church tower in England. Rogers also based some details on the 16th-century tower of St Giles' church in Wrexham, Wales, where Elihu Yale is buried. In turn, Harkness Tower has been identified as the direct influence for the tower of the Cathedral of Christ the King in Hamilton, Ontario. The tower's image was adopted by the Yale Herald, a weekly student newspaper, for its masthead. Design The bronze clock faces on the Tower Harkness Tower is 216 feet (66 m) tall, one foot for each year since Yale's founding at the time it was built. From a square base, it rises in stages to a double stone crown on an octagonal base, and at the top are stone finials. From the street level to the roof, there are 284 steps. Midway to the top, four openwork copper clockfaces tell the hours. The bells of the carillon are behind the clockfaces, fixed to a frame made of steel I-beams. The playing console of the carillon is at the level of the balconies immediately below the clock faces. Lower levels of the tower house a water tank (no longer used), two practice carillons, the old chimes playing console, office space for the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs, and a memorial chapel. =Materials= The tower was built of separate stone blocks, and reinforced with steel in 1966 to handle the new bells in the carillon. Yale tour guides frequently mention the legend that the tower was the world's tallest free-standing stone structure until it required reinforcement after an eccentric architect or philanthropist ordered acid to be poured down the walls to make it look older. In reality, the Washington Monument was the country's tallest such structure long before Harkness Tower was built. =Ornamentation= The tower's decorative elements were sculpted by Lee Lawrie. The lowest level of sculpture depicts Yale's Eight Worthies: Elihu Yale, Jonathan Edwards, Nathan Hale, Noah Webster, James Fenimore Cooper, John C. Calhoun, Samuel F. B. Morse, and Eli Whitney. The second level of sculpture depicts Phidias, Homer, Aristotle, and Euclid. The next level of sculpture consists of allegorical figures depicting Medicine, Business, Law, the Church, Courage and Effort, War and Peace, Generosity and Order, Justice and Truth, Life and Progress, and Death and Freedom. The gargoyles on the top level depict Yale's students at war and in study (a pen-wielding writer, a proficient athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a diligent scholar), along with masks of Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Shakespeare. Reception The witticism, attributed to various modernist architects, that had they to choose any place in New Haven to live s/he would select the Harkness Tower, for then they \\"would not have to look at it,\\" is apparently apocryphal, derivative of a similar story told of Guy de Maupassant and the Eiffel Tower. Carillon The console from which the Yale Memorial Carillon is played. The tower contains the Yale Memorial Carillon, a 54-bell carillon. It is a transposing instrument; the C bell sounds a concert B. Ten bells were installed in 1922 and 44 added in 1966. The instrument is played by members of a student-run group set up for the purpose, the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, and selected guest carillonneurs. During the school year, the instrument is played twice per day: a half-hour session at 12:30 p.m. and a one-hour session at 5:30 p.m. (Some residents of Branford College and Saybrook College, of which the tower forms a part of the periphery, have been known to refer to the daily performances as \\"Heavy Metal.\\") In summer it is played only in the evening, plus a summer series of Friday concerts. Carillon play was suspended in 2009 and 2010 during the tower's renovation.

Wires connect the clappers to the console below. The Yale Memorial Carillon (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Harkness Carillon) is a carillon of 54 bells in Harkness Tower at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. This carillon is a transposing instrument pitched in B. Its 54 bells are chromatically arranged from G (1.5 octaves below middle-C) to C (3 octaves above middle-C) for a total of 4.5 octaves. The lowest bell is an F‚ôØ concert pitch, and weighs 13,400 pounds. Each bell is engraved with the year it was cast, the seal of the foundry, the seal of Yale, and the motto \\"For God, For Country, and For Yale.\\" Origin Harkness Tower, the Memorial Quadrangle that surrounds it, and the Harkness Memorial Chime were all part of a gift to Yale made by Anna M. Harkness in memory of her son, Charles William Harkness. Its original 10 bells (an instrument with a range of less than two octaves is referred to as a chime - the Harkness Memorial Chime - rather than a carillon) were cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders of Loughborough, England, in 1921. They were installed in Harkness Tower in 1922 and were first rung by John Taylor on June 9, 1922. The chimes were rung regularly by the university organist, Samuel H. Smith, until 1946 when this duty was assumed by a student, Elliot H. Kone '49. On his graduation in 1949, Kone formed a student organization, the Guild of Yale Bellringers, to continue with four rings per day. Expansion In 1966, the instrument was expanded by the installation of an additional 44 bells, made possible by a gift from Florence S. Marcy Crofut and also cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders. The original chime had 10 pitches, which were named in concert pitch (F‚ôØ-G-A-B-C-C‚ôØ-D-E-F‚ôØ-G); the expansion kept the same bell as bourdon, but the notes were renamed to make the bourdon a G (it is common practice to make carillons transposing instruments so that composers can assume a standard range). The new fully chromatic 4.5 octave carillon was named the Yale Memorial Carillon to avoid showing preference to either the Harkness or the Crofut gift. At this point the Guild renamed itself the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs. Before the additional bells arrived, a practice carillon was installed in the tower to allow Guild members to learn the new instrument ahead of time. The practice carillon has a keyboard and pedalboard identical to those of the carillon, but the keys strike small tone bars instead of full-sized bells. The practice carillon allows Guild members to practice at a volume comparable to that of most other instruments instead of at the full volume of the carillon, which can be heard for several blocks. A second practice carillon was installed in April, 2006, adding greater flexibility to practicing schedules. Yale tour guides like to perpetuate the myth that Harkness Tower was once the tallest free-standing stone structure in the world, but needed to be reinforced because an eccentric architect poured acid down the walls to make the tower look older. However, the Washington Monument has been the tallest free-standing stone structure in the United States since it was completed, long before Harkness Tower was built. Furthermore, it was the weight of the additional bells in 1966 that necessitated the reinforcement of the tower with a steel frame structure to carry the additional weight.  Current use  The instrument is currently rung by Guild members twice a day when classes are in session, and in the evening during the summer. From September to May, rings occur at 12:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. During the summer, the Guild hosts a concert series of guest carillonneurs on Friday evenings. Free tours are led by students throughout the year and can be arranged using the Guild's website. The carillon console. Guild members strike the batons with their hand and the pedals with their feet to move the clappers of the bells. Every fall semester, all students from Yale College and the Yale Graduate Schools are invited to learn to play the carillon and can audition for a place in the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs. These students undergo an intensive five-week training program led by experienced members of the guild concluding with an audition. The most skilled students are admitted to the group, and perform regularly on the carillon.

This is most often as a result of a pituitary adenoma (specifically pituitary basophilism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) that stimulates the synthesis of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Pituitary adenomas are responsible for 80% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome, when excluding Cushing's syndrome from exogenously administered corticosteroids. This should not be confused with ectopic Cushing syndrome or exogenous steroid use.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001443/  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of Cushing's disease are similar to those seen in other causes of Cushing's syndrome. Patients with Cushing's disease usually present with one or more signs and symptoms secondary to the presence of excess cortisol or ACTH. Although uncommon, some patients with Cushing's disease have large pituitary tumors (macroadenomas). In addition to the severe hormonal effects related to increased blood cortisol levels, the large tumor can compress adjacent structures. These tumors can compress the nerves that carry information from the eyes, causing a decrease in peripheral vision. Glaucoma and cataracts also may occur in Cushing's syndrome. In children, the two main symptoms are obesity and decreased linear growth. The clinical diagnosis must be based on the presence of one or more of the symptoms listed below, because the syndrome itself has no true pathognomonic signs or symptoms. The most common symptoms seen in male patients are purple striae, muscle atrophy, osteoporosis, and kidney stones. =Common= Common signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease include the following: * weight gain * high blood pressure * poor short-term memory * irritability * excess hair growth (women) * Impaired immunological function * red, ruddy face * extra fat around neck, \\"Buffalo Hump\\" * moon face * fatigue * red stretch marks * poor concentration * irregular menstruation =Less common= The less-common signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease include the following: * insomnia * recurrent infection * thin skin and stretch marks * easy bruising * weak bones * acne * balding (women) * depression * hip and shoulder weakness * swelling of feet/legs * diabetes mellitus * erectile dysfunction  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is made first by diagnosing Cushing's syndrome, which can be difficult to do clinically since the most characteristic symptoms only occur in a minority of patients. Some of the biochemical diagnostic tests used include salivary and blood serum cortisol testing, 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) testing, the dexamethasone suppression test (DST), and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS or BIPSS for bilateral IPSS). No single test is perfect and multiple tests should always be used to achieve a proper diagnosis. Diagnosing Cushing's disease is a multidisciplinary process involving doctors, endocrinologists, radiologists, surgeons, and chemical pathologists. = ACTH blood test = Once Cushing's syndrome has been diagnosed, the first step towards finding the cause is measuring plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration. A concentration consistently below 1.1 pmol/L is classified as corticotropin-independent and does not lead to a diagnosis of Cushing's disease. In such cases, the next step is adrenal imaging with CT. If plasma corticotropin concentrations are consistently above 3.3 pmol/L, then corticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome is most likely. Any intermediate values need to be cautiously interpreted and a corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) test is advised in order to confirm corticotropin dependency. If corticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome is determined then the next step is to distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic corticotropin syndrome. This is done via a combination of techniques including CRH, high-dose DST, BIPSS, and pituitary MRI. = Dexamethasone suppression test = Two dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) are generally used, the overnight test and the 48 hour test. For both tests, a plasma cortisol level above 50 nmol/L is indicative of Cushing's disease. However, 3‚Äì8% of patients with Cushing's disease will test negative due to a retention of dexamethasone suppression abilities. For non-Cushing or healthy patients, the false-positive rate is 30%. The 48-h DST is advantageous since it is more specific and can be done by outpatients upon proper instruction. In the high-dose 48-h DST, 2 mg of dexamethasone is given every 6 hours for 48 hours or a single dose of 8 mg is given. This test is not needed if the 48-h low-dose DST has shown suppression of cortisol by over 30%. These tests are based on the glucocorticoid sensitivity of pituitary adenomas compared to non-pituitary tumors. = ACTH stimulation test = An ACTH stimulation test involving administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or another agent can differentiate this condition from ectopic ACTH secretion. In a patient with Cushing's disease, the tumor cells will be stimulated to release corticotropin and elevated plasma corticotropin levels will be detected. This rarely occurs with ectopic corticotropin syndrome and thus is quite useful for distinguishing between the two conditions. If ectopic, the plasma ACTH and cortisol levels should remain unchanged; if this is pituitary related, levels of both would rise. The CRH test uses recombinant human or bovine-sequence CRH, which is administered via a 100Œºg intravenous bolus dose. The sensitivity of the CRH test for detecting Cushing's disease is 93% when plasma levels are measured after fifteen and thirty minutes. However, this test is used only as a last resort due to its high cost and complexity. = Imaging = A CT or MRI of the pituitary may also show the ACTH-secreting tumor if present. However, in 40% of Cushing's disease patients MRI is unable to detect a tumor. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing's disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery. The average size of tumor, both those that were identified on MRI and those that were only discovered during surgery, was 6 mm. = Inferior petrosal sinus sampling = IPSS (inferior petrosal sinus sampling) or BIPSS (bilateral IPSS) is a more accurate but invasive test used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic or adrenal Cushing's syndrome. A corticotropin gradient sample via BIPSS is required to confirm diagnosis when pituitary MRI imaging and biochemical diagnostic tests have been inconclusive. A basal central:peripheral ratio of over 2:1, or a ratio over 3:1 when CRH is administered, is indicative of Cushing‚Äôs disease. This test has been the gold standard for distinguishing between Cushing's disease and ectopic corticotropin syndrome. The BIPSS has a sensitivity and specificity of 94% for Cushing's disease but it is usually used as a last resort due to its invasiveness, rare but serious complications, and the expertise required to perform it. = Urinary free cortisol test = Another diagnostic test used is the urinary free cortisol (UFC) test, which measures the excess cortisol excreted by the kidneys into the urine. Results of 4x higher cortisol levels than normal are likely to be Cushing's disease. This test should be repeated three times in order to exclude any normally occurring periods of hypercortisolism. The UFC test has a specificity of 81% and thus has a high rate of false-positives that are due to pseudo-Cushing states, sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, familial glucocorticoid resistance, and hyperthyroidism. = Late night (midnight) salivary cortisol test = The late night or midnight salivary cortisol test has been gaining support due to its ease of collection and stability at room temperature, therefore it can be assigned to outpatients. The test measures free circulating cortisol and has both a sensitivity and specificity of 95‚Äì98%. This test is especially useful for diagnosing children.  Treatment  The first-line treatment of Cushing's disease is surgical resection of ACTH- secreting pituitary adenoma; this surgery involves removal of the tumor via transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). There are two possible options for access to the sphenoidal sinus, including of endonasal approach (through the nostril) or sublabial approach (through an incision under the upper lip); many factors such as the size of nostril, the size of the lesion, and the preferences of the surgeon cause the selection of one access route over the other. Some tumors do not contain a discrete border between the tumor and pituitary gland; therefore, careful sectioning through the pituitary gland may be required to identify the location of the tumor. The probability of successful resection is higher in patients where the tumor was identified at initial surgery in comparison to patients where no tumor was found initially; the overall remission rates in patients with microadenomas undergoing TSS are in range of 65%‚Äì90%, and the remission rate in patients with macroadenomas are lower than 65%. Patients with persistent disease after initial surgery are treated with repeated pituitary surgery as soon as the active persistent disease is evident; however, reoperation has a lower success rate and increases the risk of pituitary insufficiency. Pituitary radiation therapy is another option for treatment of postoperative persisting hypercortisolemia following unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery. External-beam pituitary RT is more effective treatment for pediatric CD in children with cure rates of 80‚Äì88%. Hypopituitarism specifically growth hormone deficiency has been reported as the only most common late morbidity of this treatment; GHD has been reported in 36% and 68% of the patients undergoing post-pituitary RT for Cushing's disease. Bilateral adrenalectomy is another treatment that provides immediate reduction of cortisol level and control of hypercortisolism. However, it requires education of patients, because lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is needed for these patients. One of the major complications of this treatment is progression of Nelson's syndrome which is caused by enhance level of tumor growth and ACTH secretion post adrenalectomy in 8‚Äì29% of patients with CD. During post surgical recovery, patients collect 24-hour urine sample and blood sample for detecting the level of cortisol with the purpose of cure test; level of cortisol near the detection limit assay, corresponds to cure. Hormonal replacement such as steroid is given to patients because of steroid withdrawal. After the completion of collecting urine and blood samples, patients are asked to switch to glucocorticoid such as prednisone to decrease symptoms associated with adrenal withdrawal. Mitotane is also used A study of 3,525 cases of TSS for Cushing's disease in the nationally representative sample of US hospitals between 1993 and 2002 was conducted and revealed the following results: the in-hospital mortality rate was 0.7%; the complication rate was 42.1%. Diabetes insipidus (15%), fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (12.5%), and neurological deficits (5.6%) were the most common complications reported. The analyses of the study show that complications were more likely in patients with pre- operative comorbidities. Patients older than 64 years were more likely to have an adverse outcome and prolonged hospital stay. Women were 0.3 times less likely to have adverse outcomes in comparison to men. Epidemiology Cases of Cushing's disease are rare, and little epidemiological data is available on the disease. An 18-year study conducted on the population of Vizcaya, Spain reported a 0.004% prevalence of Cushing's disease. The average incidence of newly diagnosed cases was 2.4 cases per million inhabitants per year. The disease is often diagnosed 3‚Äì6 years after the onset of illness. Several studies have shown that Cushing's disease is more prevalent in women than men at a ratio of 3‚Äì6:1, respectively. Moreover, most women affected were between the ages of 50 and 60 years. The prevalence of hypertension, and abnormalities in glucose metabolism are major predictors of mortality and morbidity in untreated cases of the disease. The mortality rate of Cushing's disease was reported to be 10‚Äì11%, with the majority of deaths due to vascular disease Women aged 45‚Äì70 years have a significantly higher mortality rate than men. Moreover, the disease shows a progressive increase with time. Reasons for the trend are unknown, but better diagnostic tools, and a higher incidence rate are two possible explanations. History The disease associated with this increased secretion of cortisol was described by the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1912, after he was presented with a unique case of the disease in 1910Cushing H: The Pituitary Body and its Disorders: Clinical States Produced by Disorders of the Hypophysis Cerebra. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott, 1912 a 23-year-old woman called Minnie G. whose symptoms included painful obesity, amenorrhea, hypertrichosis (abnormal hair growth), underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics, hydrocephalus and cerebral tension. This combination of symptoms was not yet described by any medical disorder at the time. However, Cushing was confident that Minnie's symptoms were due to dysfunction of the pituitary gland and resembled those associated with an adrenal tumor. Given this conviction, and his knowledge of the three anterior pituitary cell types, Cushing hypothesized that if acidophil hyperpituitarism (excess secretion from the acidophil cells) caused acromegaly, then an excess of basophil cells must be involved in another pituitary disorder that involves sexual dysfunction (amenorrhea in females and erectile dysfunction in males) and could explain Minnie's symptoms. Experimental evidence and case reports by Cushing led to his publication in 1932 on pituitary basophilism as the cause of Cushing's disease. In this publication, the clinical symptoms of the disease, named after Cushing, were described. Reprinted in Out of the 12 cases with hypercortisolism described in Cushing's monograph on the pituitary body, 67% died within a few years after symptom presentation, whereas Minnie G. survived for more than 40 years after symptom presentation, despite the fact that she did not receive any treatments for a pituitary tumor. The prolonged survival made Minnie's case unique at the time. The reason behind this survival remains a mystery, since an autopsy of Minnie was refused after her death. However, the most likely explanation, proposed by J. Aidan Carney and based on statistical evidence, was that the basophil adenoma Minnie might have harbored underwent partial infarction, leading to symptom regression. The other hypothesis was that Minnie might have suffered from Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD), which when associated with Cushing's syndrome (Carney complex) can infrequently cause spontaneous symptom regression of the latter. In 1924, the Soviet neurologist Nikolai Itsenko reported two patients with pituitary adenoma. The resulting excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion led to the production of large amounts of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Considering this impact, the name of Itsenko was added to the title in some East European and Asian countries, and the disease is called Itsenko- Kushing disease.

It was released in August 1977 on singer Glenn Danzig's label Blank Records. 500 copies were produced on black 7\\" vinyl. Both songs from the single were re-recorded and re-released in various versions over the following twenty years. Background The Misfits had formed in February 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, with a lineup including Danzig (who also played electric piano), bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Manny Mart√≠nez. the band was without a guitar player for six months. Danzig therefore used his electric piano to fill out the rhythm on the two songs \\"Cough/Cool\\" and \\"She\\", which were recorded in June 1977 at the Rainbow Studio and mastered at Spectrum Sound in Brooklyn, New York, by Rich Flores. By the time of the single's release in August 1977 the band had added First guitarist Franch√© Coma and Danzig phased out the piano in favor of singing exclusively. Caiafa's surname was misspelled on the single's sleeve as \\"Caifa\\", leading him to insist that from then on he be credited as \\"Jerry, only Jerry\\". \\"Jerry Only\\" soon became his pseudonym, which he has continued to use throughout the rest of his career. The subject of the song \\"She\\" is not mentioned in the lyrics, but Misfits associate Eerie Von noted in The Misfits box set in 1996 that the song was about Patty Hearst. The lyrics reference Hearst's participation in a San Francisco bank robbery in 1974: \\"She walked out with empty arms, machine gun in her hand/She is good and she is bad, no one understands/She walked in in silence, never spoke a word/She's got a rich daddy, she's her daddy's girl\\". Re-releases and other versions \\"Cough/Cool\\" and \\"She\\" were re-recorded and re-released in several versions in subsequent years. \\"She\\" was re-recorded in January 1978, with guitar in place of the electric piano, for the Static Age album. The album was not released in its intended form for 20 years, though many of its songs saw release in various versions over the years. \\"She\\" had been one of three songs from the sessions that were never mixed, however, and so this version was not released until 1997, when Static Age was finally issued in its entirety. A third version of \\"She\\" was released in 1985 on the compilation album Legacy of Brutality, with overdubbed guitar and bass tracks by Danzig. This version was reissued on Misfits the following year. A new version of \\"Cough/Cool\\" appeared on Collection II in 1996; this version used the drum track from the original recording, but Danzig overdubbed guitar and drum machine tracks and new vocals. The original mixes of both \\"Cough/Cool\\" and \\"She\\", from the original single, were included in The Misfits box set (1996) along with the alternative versions from Legacy of Brutality and Collection II. Cover versions \\"Cough/Cool\\" has been covered by English rock band The Wytches on their album Home Recordings, and by Washington DC rock band Adam West on their first fan club 7\\" single in 1993. Cover versions of \\"She\\" have appeared on two Misfits tribute albums, though these are based on later versions of the song that have guitar rather than electric piano. Snapcase covered the song for Violent World: A Tribute to the Misfits (1997), while the Demons covered it for Hell on Earth: A Tribute to the Misfits (2000). The Murder City Devils also covered the song for the compilation album Free the West Memphis 3 (2000) and the re- issue of their album In Name and Blood.

An interval signal, or tuning signal, is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in international broadcasting, numbers stations, and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programmes in different languages. It serves several purposes: * It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency of the station. This is because most older and cheaper radio receivers do not have digital frequency readout. * It informs other stations that the frequency is in use. * It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands. The practise began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into shortwave broadcasts. The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the United States, where jingles were used as identification.

The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events. The company has also found mainstream success in a series of loosely historical action games, the flagship titles of which are the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series, also known as the Mus≈ç series. Koei also owns a division known as Ruby Party, which focuses on otome games. On April 1, 2009, Koei merged with Tecmo to form the Tecmo Koei Holdings holding company. Koei changed its name to Tecmo Koei Games on April 1, 2010 by absorbing Tecmo, and again on July 1, 2014, to Koei Tecmo Games.https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/php/pdf/news_20140526_01.pdf History Koei was established in July 1978 by Y≈çichi Erikawa (also known as Kou Shibusawa) and Keiko Erikawa. Yoichi was a student at Keio University, and when his family's rural dyestuffs business failed he decided to pursue his interest in programming. The company has remained located in the Hiyoshi area of Yokohama. The company initially focused on personal computer sales and made-to-order business software. In 1982, the company released the erotic title (Eroge), , which was an early role-playing adventure game with color graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. In 1983 it released , a historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of Japanese history. The game went on to receive numerous awards, and Koei produced several more such games set against the backdrop of world history, including Romance of the Three Kingdoms, set during the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, and , set in Portugal during the Age of Exploration. In 1988, Koei established a North American subsidiary, Koei America Corporation, in California. This subsidiary localized Koei games for export to all territories outside Japan, as well as producing original games and concepts with the leadership of designer Stieg Hedlund, like Liberty or Death, Celtic Tales: Balor of the Evil Eye, Gemfire and Saiyuki: Journey West. After Hedlund's departure, this subsidiary ceased game development in 1995, focusing instead on localization, sales and marketing. Though none of Koei's historical simulations achieved mass market success, they acquired a loyal cult following. This following allowed Koei to remain profitable, since they could reliably predict how many copies of their games would sell (especially important during the cartridge era, when a surplus of unsold cartridges on a single game was often enough to bankrupt a company). A Canadian subsidiary, Koei Canada, Inc. was established in early 2001, and a European subsidiary, Koei Limited was established in early 2003 in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. Koei also maintains subsidiaries in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan and Lithuania. Recently, Koei created a Singapore branch for game development such as Sangokushi Online. All Koei operations in English in turn ceased in 2012, with the previously unannounced closing of Koei's North American support forums and website. They resumed in 2016, with the English language PC release of Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII. Koei's Ruby Party division specializes on games labeled as Neoromance: GxB dating sims, usually with extra side-quests. Out of the three Neoromance series, the best known is Angelique, which has been in production since 1994. Harukanaru Toki no Naka de is a newer Neoromance hit, with many sequels and an anime television series based on it. The newest game in the series, Kin'iro no Corda, is gaining popularity partially because the manga series it was based on, has been recently licensed by Viz for English language publishing. It gaining more popularity though, and an anime television series based on it began airing in October 2006. A sequel was also released on the PlayStation 2 in March 2007. On September 4, 2008, Koei announced that it was in talks to purchase ailing competitor Tecmo.

The family is named for the genus Desis, members of which live in a very unusual location ‚Äî between the tides. The family has been reevaluated in recent years and now includes inland genera and species as well, such as Badumna and Phryganoporus. In 2017, the family Amphinectidae was merged into Desidae. The family Toxopidae has been separated off. Those intertidal spiders that are truly marine commonly live in barnacle shells, which they seal up with silk; this allows them to maintain an air bubble during high tide. They emerge at night to feed on various small arthropods that live in the intertidal zone. Distribution As now circumscribed, the family Desidae is mainly found in South America and Australasia, with some species reaching north to Malaysia. Metaltella simoni has been introduced in a large part of the Southern United States (records exist from California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida) and is considered an invasive species in Florida. It is feared that it could extirpate the native titanoecid species Titanoeca brunnea.

He was a great-grandson of Emperor Zhang. After Emperor Zhi was poisoned to death by the powerful official Liang Ji in 146, Liang Ji persuaded his sister, the regent Empress Dowager Liang to make the 14-year-old Liu Zhi, the Marquess of Liwu, who was betrothed to their sister Liang N√ºying (), emperor. As the years went by, Emperor Huan, offended by Liang Ji's autocratic and violent nature, became determined to eliminate the Liang family with the help of eunuchs. Emperor Huan succeeded in removing Liang Ji in 159 but this only caused an increase in the influence of these eunuchs over all aspects of the government. Corruption during this period had reached a boiling point. In 166, university students rose up in protest against the government and called on Emperor Huan to eliminate all corrupt officials. Instead of listening, Emperor Huan ordered the arrest of all students involved. Emperor Huan has largely been viewed as an emperor who might have had some intelligence but lacked wisdom in governing his empire; and his reign contributed greatly to the downfall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Hou Hanshu (History of the Later Han) recounts that one Roman envoy (perhaps sent by emperor Marcus Aurelius) reached the Chinese capital Luoyang in 166 and was greeted by Emperor Huan. Emperor Huan died in 168 after reigning for 22 years; he was 36. He was succeeded by Emperor Ling of Han. Family background and ascension Liu Zhi was born in 132, to Liu Yi (), the Marquess of Liwu, and his concubine Yan Ming (). Liu Yi was the son of Liu Kai (), the Prince of Hejian (and therefore a grandson of Emperor Zhang), and he had initially been made the Prince of Pingyuan as the heir of his cousin Liu Sheng () by Empress Dowager Deng Sui, the regent for Emperor An, who was impressed with his abilities. That led to rumors that Empress Deng was looking to replace Emperor An, Prince Yi's cousin, with Prince Yi. After Empress Dowager Deng died in 121, Emperor An, bearing a grudge against Prince Yi, demoted him to the rank of Marquess of Duxiang and exiled him to his father's principality. During the reign of Emperor Shun, Prince Kai requested that he be allowed to give Liwu County, part of his principality, to his son, and Emperor Shun permitted it. Marquess Yi thus became the Marquess of Liwu. By 146, Liu Zhi had inherited his father's title and was betrothed to Liang N√ºying, the younger sister of the regent Empress Dowager Liang Na and her violent and corrupt brother, Grand Marshal Liang Ji. That year, Liang Ji, bearing a grudge against the eight- year-old Emperor Zhi for calling him an \\"arrogant general,\\" murdered the young emperor by poison. The officials largely favored Emperor Zhi's first cousin Liu Suan () the Prince of Qinghe, who was described as a solemn and proper man. Prince Suan's age was not given in history, though he appeared to be an adult by this time. However, Liang Ji was hesitant to yield authority to an able emperor. Because Marquess Zhi was betrothed to his sister and relatively young, Liang Ji felt that he could control him and insisted on making him emperor. Marquess Zhi took the throne later that year as Emperor Huan. Early reign:under Empress dowager Liang regency and under Liang Ji's shadow An Eastern Han (25-220 AD) mural of a banquet scene, from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Ê±âÂ¢ì, Pinyin: Dahuting Han mu) of Zhengzhou, Henan province, China Mural of a woman dressed in Hanfu, from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Ê±âÂ¢ì, Pinyin: Dahuting Han mu) of the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China After Emperor Huan's ascension at age 14, Empress Dowager Liang continued to serve as regent. However, her brother Liang Ji came to take on more and more control, even more than the empress dowager. Emperor Huan posthumously honored his grandfather and father as emperors but, because the empress dowager was regent, did not honor his mother Yan Ming as an empress dowager; rather, she was given the title of an imperial consort. His father's wife, Lady Ma, was belatedly honored as an imperial consort as well in 148. In 147, he married Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji's sister Liang N√ºying, making her empress. It appeared that, while the Liangs were in control, Emperor Huan was not a complete puppet. Instead, as a sign of bad things to come, he trusted eunuchs in his decision-making. That same year, Liang Ji, in conjunction with the eunuchs Tang Heng () and Zuo Guan (), but with Emperor Huan's clear approval, falsely accused the honest officials Li Gu () and Du Qiao () of conspiring to overthrow Emperor Huan and replace him with Prince Suan. Li and Du were executed, while Prince Suan was demoted to marquess status and committed suicide. In 150, Empress Dowager Liang announced that she was retiring and returning imperial authority to Emperor Huan. Later that year, she died. Emperor Huan then honored his mother as an empress dowager. However, without his sister to curb his power, Liang Ji came to be even more powerful than before. His violence and corruption increased and he stamped out all dissent with threats of death. He even threw his humble and peace-loving brother Liang Buyi () out of the government. In 152, Empress Dowager Yan died. Because Emperor Huan had inherited the throne through a collateral line, he was not permitted by customs to be the mourner. Instead, his brother Liu Shi () the Prince of Pingyuan served as chief mourner. In 153, the first major public confrontation between an official and a powerful eunuch occurred‚Äîforeshadowing many to come. Zhu Mu (), the governor of Ji Province (modern central and northern Hebei) had found out that the father of the powerful eunuch Zhao Zhong () had been improperly buried in a jade vest, an honor that was reserved to imperial princes. He ordered an investigation: Zhao's father was exhumed and the jade vest was stripped away, an act that angered Zhao and Emperor Huan. Zhu was not only removed from his post but was sentenced to hard labor. Coup d'etat against Liang Ji As the years went by, Emperor Huan became increasingly disgruntled at Liang Ji's control of the government and was also angered by Empress Liang's behavior. Because of her position as Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji's sister, Empress Liang was wasteful in her luxurious living, far exceeding any past empress, and was exceedingly jealous. She did not have a son and, because she did not want any other imperial consorts to have sons, she would find some way to murder pregnant consorts. Emperor Huan did not dare to react to her due to Liang Ji's power, but rarely had sexual relations with her. In 159, angry and depressed that she had lost her husband's favor, Empress Liang died. This death started a chain of events that led to Liang Ji's downfall later that year. Liang, in order to continue to control Emperor Huan, had adopted his wife's beautiful cousin (the stepdaughter of her uncle Liang Ji (Ê¢ÅÁ¥Ä‚Äînote different characters despite the same pronunciation)), Deng Mengn√º (), as his own daughter, changing her family name to Liang. He and Sun gave Liang Mengn√º to Emperor Huan as an imperial consort. After Empress Liang's death, they hoped that she would eventually be made empress. To completely control her, Liang Ji planned to have her mother, Lady Xuan (), killed: he sent assassins against her but the assassination was foiled by the powerful eunuch Yuan She (), a neighbor of Lady Xuan. Lady Xuan reported the assassination attempt to Emperor Huan, who was greatly angered. He entered into a conspiracy with eunuchs Tang Heng, Zuo Guan, Shan Chao (), Xu Huang (), and Ju Yuan () to overthrow Liang‚Äîsealing the oath by biting open Dan's arm and swearing by his blood. Liang Ji had some suspicions about what Emperor Huan and the eunuchs were up to, and began an investigation. The five eunuchs quickly reacted. They had Emperor Huan openly announce that he was taking back power from Liang Ji and mobilized the imperial guards to defend the palace against a counterattack by Liang. They surrounded Liang's house and forced him to surrender. Liang and Sun were unable to respond and committed suicide. The entire Liang and Sun clans (except for Liang Ji's brothers Liang Buyi and Liang Meng [Ê¢ÅËíô], who had previously already died) were arrested and slaughtered. A large number of officials were executed or deposed for close association with Liang‚Äîso many that the government was almost unable to function for some time. Liang and Sun's properties were confiscated by the imperial treasury, which allowed the taxes to be reduced by 50% for one year. The people greatly celebrated Liang Ji's death. Late reign: empowerment of the eunuchs After Liang Ji's death, Emperor Huan made Liang Mengn√º empress. However, he disliked her family name and therefore ordered her to take the family name Bo (). He later found out that her original family name was actually Deng, and therefore had her family name restored. The people had great expectations for Emperor Huan's administration after the death of Liang Ji. However, having been unable to overthrow Liang Ji without the five eunuchs' help, Emperor Huan greatly rewarded them, making them and several other eunuchs who participated in the coup d'√©tat marquesses and further giving them governmental posts that conferred tremendous power. Further, the five eunuch-marquesses openly engaged in massive corruption and became extremely wealthy with Emperor Huan's approval. A song written about the four remaining eunuch-marquesses following Dan's death described them in this way: :Zuo can reverse heaven's decision. Ju sits by himself without match. Xu is a lying wolf. Tang's power is as prevalent as the falling rain. Emperor Huan himself was also corrupt and unwilling to accept any criticism. In 159, when the honest county magistrate Li Yun () submitted a petition urging him to curb the power of the eunuchs, Emperor Huan was deeply offended that he included the phrase, \\"Is the emperor turning blind?\\" and, despite intercessions by a number of officials and even some fairly-minded eunuchs, had Li and his friend Du Zhong () both executed. In 161, apparently in reaction to spending due to renewed Qiang rebellions and new agrarian revolts, Emperor Huan issued an edict offering minor offices for sale‚Äîincluding imperial guard officer positions. This practice set a bad precedent and would become even more prevalent and problematic under Emperor Huan's successor, Emperor Ling. While Emperor Huan actually was able to find competent generals to suppress the rebellions or to persuade the rebels to surrender, the rampant corruption came to cause new rebellions as soon as the old ones are quelled. In 165, perhaps finally fed up with the eunuchs' excess, Emperor Huan demoted Ju, the only eunuch remaining of the original five. Several other corrupt eunuchs were also demoted or deposed. However, soon thereafter, the eunuchs' powers were restored again. For the rest of Emperor Huan's reign, there would be a cycle of rise and fall of power of the eunuchs after conflicts with officials, but inexorably the eunuchs would return, becoming more powerful than before. Later that year, apparently tired of Empress Deng and sick of her disputes with a favorite consort of his, Consort Guo, Emperor Huan deposed and imprisoned her. She died in anger, and several of her family members were executed. He wanted to make another consort, Tian Sheng () empress, but officials opposed this on the basis that she was of lowly birth. They recommended that he make Consort Dou Miao (), the daughter of Dou Wu (), a Confucian scholar and a descendant of Dou Rong (), who had contributed much to the establishment of the Eastern Han Dynasty, empress. Even though he did not favor Consort Dou, Emperor Huan gave in to pressure and made her empress. In 166, a major public confrontation between university students and eunuchs evolved into a major incident. The governor of the capital province (modern western Henan and central Shaanxi), Li Ying, had arrested and executed a fortuneteller named Zhang Cheng (), who had had his son kill a man, having predicted that a general pardon was coming. Li was arrested and 200 some university students signed a petition requesting his release. This further angered Emperor Huan, who had the students arrested. Only after about a year and Dou Wu's intercession were Li and the university students released, but all of them had their citizenship rights stripped. This incident was later known as the first Disaster of Partisan Prohibition. In 168, Emperor Huan died without a son. Empress Dou, jealous of how he favored Consort Tian, had her immediately put to death. She conducted a survey among the members of the imperial clan and decided on the 11-year-old Liu Hong (), the Marquess of Jieduting, who then ascended the throne as Emperor Ling.

The Reform Party was dissolved, and the Canadian Alliance created. Ablonczy was re- elected under the new party's banner in the 2000 federal election. In December 2001, Ablonczy entered the 2002 Canadian Alliance leadership contest on a platform of promoting \\"a process to combine the Canadian Alliance, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and other interested partners into an effective, unified opposition party before the next election.\\"Ablonczy, Diane, \\"Building the Conservative Coalition ‚Äì a Blueprint for a Better Canada\\", Communication piece for the Canadian Alliance Leadership Contest, January 2002 She placed third with 3.8% of the vote.

Ablonczy also criticized the Chr√©tien government for \\"chastising the U.S. for sending Arar back to Syria where he is also a citizen\\".Edited Hansard * Table of Contents * Number 026 (Official Version) Arar was imprisoned for over a year in Syria, and was repeatedly tortured by Syrian authorities.

He was a Liberal member of Canada's House of Commons from 1993 to 2006 representing the riding of Peterborough. Previously, Adams represented the provincial riding of Peterborough in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1990, sitting as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party. Background Adams was born in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and educated at the University of Sheffield and McGill University. He served as director of the subarctic research laboratory in Schefferville, Quebec, and was a member of the Geography department and coordinator of Northern Studies at Trent University in Peterborough, where he was later Emeritus Professor. Adams also served as Vice President ‚Äì Academic while at Trent. Adams has authored many books and articles, and co-edited the regional history Peterborough and the Kawarthas. In 1981, he was named as Peterborough's Citizen of the Year. Provincial politics In 1977, Adams ran as the Liberal candidate in the 1977 provincial election, but finished third against Progressive Conservative John Turner and incumbent New Democrat Gill Sandeman. He ran again in the 1981 provincial election, and finished second against Turner. Adams ran for the seat again in the 1987 provincial election, and won by a comfortable majority amid a landslide provincial victory for the Liberal Party. He served as a backbench supporter of David Peterson and was appointed as parliamentary assistant to Minister of the Environment Jim Bradley from 1989 to 1990. The Liberals were defeated by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, and Adams lost his seat to NDP candidate Jenny Carter by 185 votes. Federal politics Adams was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the federal election of 1993, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Bill Domm by almost 16,000 votes. He was re-elected in the elections of 1997, 2000, and 2004, each time by a comfortable margin. He was for many years a prominent supporter of Jean Chr√©tien, opposing Paul Martin's bid to succeed Chr√©tien as party leader. Adams was appointed by Martin as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal on 20 July 2004. He did not stand for re-election in the 2006 federal election. In 2012 he was made a member of the Order of Ontario.

An online music store is a business that sells digital audio files of music recordings over the Internet. Customers gain ownership of a license to use the files, in contrast to a music streaming service, where they listen to recordings without gaining ownership. Customers pay either for each recording or on a subscription basis. Online music stores generally also offer partial streaming previews of songs, with some songs even available for full length listening. They typically show a picture of the album art or of the performer or band for each song. Some online music stores also sell recorded speech files, such as podcasts, and video files of movies. History The first free high-fidelity online music archive of downloadable songs on the Internet was the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA), which was started by Rob Lord, Jeff Patterson and Jon Luini from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993. The realization of the market for downloadable music grew widespread with the development of Napster, a music and file sharing service created by Shawn Fanning that made a major impact on the Internet scene in 2000. Some services have tethered downloads, meaning that playing songs requires an active membership. Napster was founded as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet service that emphasized sharing audio files, typically music, encoded in MP3 format. The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement, ceased operations and was eventually acquired by Roxio. In its second incarnation Napster became an online music store until Rhapsody acquired it from Best Buy on December 1, 2011. Later companies and projects successfully followed its P2P file sharing example such as Gnutella, Freenet, Kazaa, Bearshare, and many others. Some services, like LimeWire, Scour, Grokster, Madster, and eDonkey2000, were brought down or changed due to similar circumstances. In 2000, Factory Records entrepreneur Tony Wilson and his business partners launched an early online music store, Music33, which sold MP3s for 33 pence per song. The major record labels eventually decided to launch their own online stores, allowing them more direct control over costs and pricing and more control over the presentation and packaging of songs and albums. Sony Music Entertainment's service did not do as well as was hoped. Many consumers felt the service was difficult to navigate and use. Sony's pricing of US$3.50 per song track also discouraged many early adopters of the service. Furthermore, as MP3 Newswire pointed out in its review of the service, users were actually only renting the tracks for that $3.50, because the patron did not own the audio file. After a certain point the files expired and could not be played again without repurchase. The service quickly failed. Undaunted, the record industry tried again. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment teamed up with a service called Duet, later renamed pressplay. EMI, AOL/Time Warner and Bertelsmann Music Group teamed up with MusicNet. Again, both services struggled, hampered by high prices and heavy limitations on how downloaded files could be used once paid for. In the end, consumers chose instead to download music using illegal, free file sharing programs, which many consumers felt were more convenient and easier to use. Non-major label services like eMusic, Cductive and Listen.com (now Rhapsody) sold the music of independent labels and artists. The demand for digital audio downloading skyrocketed after the launch of Apple's iTunes Store (then called iTunes Music Store) in April 2003 and the creation of portable music and digital audio players such as the iPod. These players enabled music fans to carry their music with them, wherever they went. Amazon launched its Amazon MP3 service for the US in September 2007, expanding it gradually to most countries where Amazon operates. 21st century An increasing number of new services appeared in the 2000s that enabled musicians to sell their music directly to fans without an intermediary. These type of services usually use e-commerce-enabled web widgets that embed into many types of web pages. This turns each web page into the musician's own online music store. Furthermore, there had been a boom in \\"boutique\\" music stores that cater to specific audiences. On October 10, 2007, English rock band Radiohead released the album In Rainbows as a download. Listeners were allowed to purchase the album for whatever price they wanted to pay, legally allowing them to download the album for free. About one-third of people who downloaded the album paid nothing, with the average price paid being ¬£4. After three months online the album was taken down by the band and released on compact disc (CD). , the largest online music store was the iTunes Store, with around 80% of the market. On 3 April 2008, the iTunes Store surpassed Wal-Mart as the biggest music retailer in the United States, a milestone in the music industry as it was the first time in history that an online music retailer exceeded those of physical music formats (e.g., record shops selling CDs). In the early 2010s, online music stores‚Äîespecially iTunes‚Äîexperienced a marked increase in sales. Consumer spending shifted away from the purchase of CDs in favor of purchasing albums from online music stores, or more commonly, purchasing individual songs. The iTunes platform has been the main reason for this shift, as it originally sold every song in its library for 99 cents. Historically, albums would be sold for about five times the cost of a single, but iTunes was selling every song for a tenth of the price of an album. However, in order to increase album sales, iTunes instituted \\"Complete My Album\\", which offered a discounted price on the full album when a consumer had already purchased one or more songs. Furthermore, with the rising popularity of Cyber Monday, online music stores have further gained ground over other music distribution sources. iTunes rolled out an Instant Gratification (instant grat) service, in which some individual tracks or bonus tracks were made available to customers who have pre-ordered albums.http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2014/06/how-an-unsigned- artist-used-itunes-instant-gratification-to-get-a-top-10-hit-on-itunes.html The instant-grat tracks have changed the criteria for the UK Official Charts's singles. In 2013, David Bowie's \\"Where Are We Now?\\" was not allowed to chart because it was a pre-order for the album The Next Day, but Official Charts later ruled that effective February 10, 2013, certain instant grats could be allowed to appear in the Top 40.http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/instant- grat-tracks-to-qualify-for- chart/054179https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/14/official-charts-to-allow-instant- grat-tracks-following-david-bowie-controversy-3477842/ Instant grats have also been offered on other online music stores including Amazon and Spotify.https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Danny-Bryant-Release- New-Album-Revelation-This-April-20180126 Compared to file sharing Much controversy surrounds file sharing, so many of these points are disputed. =Advantages of legal online stores= * The sale of licensed content adheres to copyright laws * More consistent and higher-quality metadata, because the entering of the metadata is more centralized and done with more oversight. * Music download companies are more accountable to users than creators of file- sharing programs * A centralized repository of music makes it easier to find the songs you want. * Notably, Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs claimed in his introduction of the iTunes Store that downloading from file-sharers is theoretically working for less than minimum wage - \\"By spending an hour of your time to save less than four dollars, he calculated, 'you're working for less than minimum wage!'\\". =Disadvantages of online stores= * Many major online music stores only offer music in one audio format. * Most online music stores sell music encoded in a lossy file format, compared to an audio CD. For the most part, music that is sold in lossy MP3 format is not sold at higher bit rate encoding. * Few online music stores offer music in lossless, metadata-enabled formats such as FLAC or ALAC, but instead stick to WAV files in which no metadata can generally be embedded. AIFF files with metadata are offered but in larger size files than FLAC or ALAC without advantage in sound quality. In contrast, lossless rips of CDs in FLAC format are widely available on the web for illegal downloading. * Some stores use Digital Rights Management technology, which limits the use of music files on certain devices. The restrictions vary between different services, and sometimes even between different songs from the same service. *Online stores charge for downloading songs and other content, whereas illegal file sharing does not have any fees (although illegal song downloaders may face fines and prosecution in some jurisdictions and illegal files may contain computer viruses) Internet radio Online music stores receive competition from online radio, as well as file sharing. Online radio is the free distribution of webcasts on the Internet via streaming. Listeners can create customizable \\"stations\\" based on a genre, artists, or song of their choice. Notable Internet Radio service providers are Pandora, Last FM and recently Spotify, with Pandora being the largest. Pandora holds 52% of the market share in Internet radio, with 60 million registered users and almost one billion stations from which users can choose.

Born the son of a lesser marquis who descended directly from Emperor Zhang (the third Eastern Han emperor), Liu Hong was chosen to be emperor in 168 around age 12 after the death of his predecessor, Emperor Huan, who had no son to succeed him. He reigned for about 21 years until his death in 189. Emperor Ling's reign saw another repetition of corrupt eunuchs dominating the Han central government, as was the case during his predecessor's reign. Zhang Rang, the leader of the eunuch faction, managed to dominate the political scene after defeating a faction led by Empress Dowager Dou's father, Dou Wu, and the Confucian scholar-official Chen Fan in 168. After reaching adulthood, Emperor Ling was not interested in state affairs and preferred to indulge in women and a decadent lifestyle. At the same time, corrupt officials in the Han government levied heavy taxes on the peasants. He exacerbated the situation by introducing a practice of selling political offices for money; this practice severely damaged the Han civil service system and led to widespread corruption. Mounting grievances against the Han government led to the outbreak of the peasant-led Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184. Emperor Ling's reign left the Eastern Han dynasty weak and on the verge of collapse. After his death, the Han Empire disintegrated in chaos for the subsequent decades as various regional warlords fought for power and dominance. (See End of the Han dynasty.) The Han dynasty ended in 220 when Emperor Ling's son, Emperor Xian, abdicated his throne ‚Äì an event leading to the start of the Three Kingdoms period in China.  Family background and accession to the throne  Liu Hong was a hereditary marquis ‚Äì the Marquis of Jiedu Village (). In the Han dynasty, a village marquis's marquisate usually comprised only one village or, in rarer cases, two or three villages. He was the third person in his family to hold this title; his father Liu Chang () and grandfather Liu Shu () were also formerly Marquis of Jiedu Village. His great- grandfather, Liu Kai (), the Prince of Hejian (), was the sixth son of Emperor Zhang, the third emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. His mother, Lady Dong, was Liu Chang's formal spouse. When Emperor Huan died in 168 without a son to succeed him, his empress, Empress Dou, became empress dowager, and she examined the genealogy of the imperial clan to choose a candidate to be the next emperor. For reasons unknown, her assistant Liu Shu () recommended Liu Hong, the Marquis of Jiedu Village. After consulting with her father Dou Wu and the Confucian scholar-official Chen Fan, Empress Dowager Dou installed a 12-year-old Liu Hong on the throne, and continued ruling on his behalf as regent. The newly enthroned Emperor Ling bestowed posthumous titles on his grandfather, father and grandmother, honouring them as emperors and an empress respectively. His mother, Lady Dong, did not become empress dowager and instead received the title of an Honoured Lady.  Early reign  Dou Wu and Chen Fan, who became the most important officials in the central government, sought to purge the eunuch faction. Later in 168, they even proposed to exterminate all the powerful eunuchs, a proposal that Empress Dowager Dou rejected. However, word of the plot was leaked, and the eunuchs, after kidnapping the empress dowager and taking the young emperor into custody (after persuading him that it was for his own protection) arrested and executed Chen Fan. Dou Wu resisted but was eventually defeated and forced to commit suicide. The Dou clan was slaughtered. The powerful eunuchs, led by Cao Jie () and Wang Fu (), became the most powerful individuals in the central government. After the destruction of the Dou clan, in 169, Emperor Ling promoted his mother to the position of empress dowager, though he continued honouring Empress Dowager Dou, now under house arrest, as empress dowager as well. Members of the Dong clan began to enter government, but did not have substantial influence. Later that year, the eunuchs persuaded Emperor Ling that the \\"partisans\\" (i.e., Confucian officials and those who supported them) were plotting against him, and a large number of partisans were arrested and killed; the others had their civil liberties stripped completely, in an event historically known as the second Disaster of Partisan Prohibitions. Empress Dowager Dou died in 172. Despite suggestions by eunuchs to have her only buried as an imperial consort and not be honoured as Emperor Huan's wife, Emperor Ling had her buried with full honours befitting an empress dowager in Emperor Huan's mausoleum. In the aftermaths of her death, a vandal wrote on the palace gate: \\"All that is under the heaven is in upheaval. Cao and Wang murdered the empress dowager. The key officials only know how to be officials and had nothing faithful to say.\\" The angry eunuchs ordered an investigation which led to over 1,000 arrests, but nothing conclusive was found. In that year, the eunuchs also falsely accused Emperor Huan's brother, Liu Kui (), the Prince of Bohai, of treason and forced him to commit suicide. The members of his entire household, including his wife, concubines, children, assistants and principality officials, were all rounded up and executed. As the Han government became more corrupt, the people received heavier tax burdens. As Emperor Ling grew older, he not only took no remedial action, but continued to tolerate the eunuchs' corruption for the most part. A major defeat of the Han army by the Xianbei tribes in 177 further drained the imperial treasury. In 178, Emperor Ling's wife Empress Song, whom he made empress in 171 but did not favour, fell victim to the eunuchs' treachery. Her aunt, Lady Song, was Liu Kui's wife, so the eunuchs were worried that she would seek vengeance on them. Thus, by collaborating with other imperial consorts who wanted to replace the empress, the eunuchs falsely accused Empress Song of using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ling. The emperor believed them and deposed the empress, who was imprisoned and died in despair. Her father, Song Feng (), and the rest of her family were exterminated.  Middle reign  In 178, Emperor Ling introduced the practice of selling political offices for money ‚Äì a practice which severely damaged the Han civil service system and led to widespread corruption. The people who paid for these positions perpetuated corruption upon taking office. That was exactly what Emperor Ling had in mind: he allowed the officials to pay by instalments after taking office if they could not afford the initial amount. In 180, Emperor Ling instated Lady He as the new empress and appointed her brother, He Jin, as a key official in his government. (According to legends, she managed to enter Emperor Ling's imperial harem because her family bribed the eunuchs in charge of selecting women for the emperor.) She received the position of empress because she bore Emperor Ling a son, Liu Bian; the emperor had other sons but they died prematurely before Liu Bian's birth. During these years, Emperor Ling became interested in building imperial gardens so he ordered the commandery and principality officials throughout the Han Empire to pay their tributes to him directly, so he could use the money to finance his construction projects. This, in turn, created pressures on the officials to resort to corrupt practices so they could extract a larger tribute from their jurisdictions for the emperor. In spite of all his flaws, Emperor Ling occasionally heeded good advice from his subjects but was not consistent in doing so. His subjects often found it frustrating to try to convince him on policy issues because he only listened to them when he wanted to.  The Yellow Turban Rebellion  Chariots and cavalry, detail of a mural from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Ê±âÂ¢ì, Pinyin: Dahuting Han mu) of the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China Sometime before 183, a major Taoist rebel movement had started in Ji Province ‚Äì the Taiping Sect (), led by Zhang Jiao, who claimed he had magical powers to heal the sick. By 183, his teachings and followers had spread to eight of the empire's thirteen provinces ‚Äì Ji, Qing, Xu, You, Jing, Yang, Yan, and Yu. Several key imperial officials became concerned about Zhang Jiao's hold over his followers, and suggested that the Taiping Sect be disbanded. Emperor Ling did not listen to them. Zhang Jiao had in fact planned a rebellion. He commissioned 36 military commanders, set up a shadow government, and wrote a declaration: \\"The blue heaven is dead. The yellow heaven will come into being. The year will be jiazi. The world would be blessed.\\" (Under the traditional Chinese sexagenary cycle calendar method, 184 would be the first year of the cycle, known as jiazi.) Zhang Jiao had his supporters write jiazi in large characters with white talc everywhere they could ‚Äì including on the doors of government offices in the imperial capital and other cities. One of Zhang Jiao's followers, Ma Yuanyi (), plotted with two eunuchs to start an uprising inside the palace. Early in 184, this plot was discovered, and Ma Yuanyi was immediately arrested and executed. Emperor Ling ordered that Taiping Sect members be arrested and executed, and Zhang Jiao immediately declared a rebellion. Every member of the rebellion wore a yellow turban or headscarf as their symbol ‚Äì and therefore the rebellion became known for it. Within a month, Zhang Jiao controlled large areas of territory. Under suggestion by the eunuch L√º Qiang (), who was sympathetic to the partisans, Emperor Ling pardoned the partisans to ward off the possibility they would join the Yellow Turbans. (L√º Qiang himself became a victim, however, when the other eunuchs, in retaliation, falsely accused him of wanting to depose the emperor, and he committed suicide later that year.) Emperor Ling sent out a number of military commanders against the Yellow Turbans, and in these campaigns several of them distinguished themselves ‚Äì including Huangfu Song, Cao Cao, Fu Xie (), Zhu Jun, Lu Zhi, and Dong Zhuo. A key military development with great implications later was that the Yellow Turbans fought mainly with troops deployed from the battle-tested Liang Province who had been accustomed to suppressing rebellions by the Qiang tribes. In late 184, Zhang Jiao was killed, and while the rest of the Yellow Turbans were not defeated immediately, they gradually dissipated by the following year. Because of the Liang Province forces' contributions to the campaign, they began to be feared and began to look down on troops from all other provinces. During and in the aftermaths of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, many people from other provinces, in order to ward off pillaging by Yellow Turbans or governmental forces, also organised themselves into military groups, and a good number resisted government forces, and even after the Yellow Turbans were defeated, the central government's control of the provinces was no longer what it used to be.  Late reign  Even after the Yellow Turban Rebellion was suppressed, Emperor Ling did not change his wasteful and corrupt ways. He continued to levy heavy taxes and continued to sell offices. As a result, other agrarian and military rebellions multiplied. In 185, when a fire broke out in the southern part of the imperial palace, the Ten Attendants suggested to Emperor Ling to levy a tax of ten maces from every mu of farmland to raise funds for rebuilding the palace. Emperor Ling then ordered the officials in Taiyuan (), Hedong () and Didao () commanderies to transport wood and patterned rocks to Luoyang (the imperial capital) as construction materials. When the shipments reached the palace, the eunuchs who received them scolded the labourers for delivering materials of poor quality, and insisted on paying them far below market prices ‚Äì to as low as a tenth of the market price. They then resold the materials to other eunuchs, who refused to buy. Over time, the accumulated piles of wood started decaying. The construction works were thus delayed for years. In order to please Emperor Ling, some regional officials levied heavier taxes and forced the people to produce greater quantities of construction materials ‚Äì this led to greater resentment from the common people.(ÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÂçóÂÆÆÁÅΩ„ÄÇËÆì„ÄÅÂø†Á≠âË™™Â∏ù‰ª§ÊñÇÂ§©‰∏ãÁî∞ÁïíÁ®ÖÂçÅÈå¢Ôºå‰ª•‰øÆÂÆÆÂÆ§„ÄÇÁôºÂ§™Âéü„ÄÅÊ≤≥Êù±„ÄÅÁãÑÈÅìË´∏ÈÉ°ÊùêÊú®ÂèäÊñáÁü≥ÔºåÊØèÂ∑ûÈÉ°ÈÉ®ÈÄÅËá≥‰∫¨Â∏´ÔºåÈªÉÈñÄÂ∏∏‰æçËºí‰ª§Ë≠¥Âëµ‰∏ç‰∏≠ËÄÖÔºåÂõ†Âº∑ÊäòË≥§Ë≤∑ÔºåÂçÅÂàÜÈõá‰∏ÄÔºåÂõ†Âæ©Ë≤®‰πãÊñºÂÆ¶ÂÆòÔºåÂæ©‰∏çÁÇ∫Âç≥ÂèóÔºåÊùêÊú®ÈÅÇËá≥ËÖêÁ©çÔºåÂÆÆÂÆ§ÈÄ£Âπ¥‰∏çÊàê„ÄÇÂà∫Âè≤„ÄÅÂ§™ÂÆàÂæ©Â¢ûÁßÅË™øÔºåÁôæÂßìÂëºÂóü„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78. Emperor Ling appointed cavalry officers to serve as his messengers whenever he issued orders for things to be delivered to Luoyang. These officers, known as zhongshi (‰∏≠‰Ωø; \\"central emissaries\\"), abused their power by forcing the regional officials, who were afraid of them, to give them bribes. The appointment of officials below the position of Inspector () was decided by the amount of money they could pay to fund the army and palace construction. Before assuming office, these officials had to undergo an assessment to determine their \\"value\\". Some who could not afford the required amount committed suicide, while others who refused to take up their appointments were forced into accepting.(Âá°Ë©îÊâÄÂæµÊ±ÇÔºåÁöÜ‰ª§Ë•øÂúíÈ®∂ÂØÜÁ¥ÑÂãëÔºåËôüÊõ∞„Äå‰∏≠‰Ωø„ÄçÔºåÊÅêÂãïÂ∑ûÈÉ°ÔºåÂ§öÂèóË≥ïË≥Ç„ÄÇÂà∫Âè≤„ÄÅ‰∫åÂçÉÁü≥ÂèäËåÇÊâçÂ≠ùÂªâÈÅ∑Èô§ÔºåÁöÜË≤¨Âä©Ëªç‰øÆÂÆÆÈå¢ÔºåÂ§ßÈÉ°Ëá≥‰∫å‰∏âÂçÉËê¨ÔºåÈ§òÂêÑÊúâÂ∑Æ„ÄÇÁï∂‰πãÂÆòËÄÖÔºåÁöÜÂÖàËá≥Ë•øÂúíË´ßÂÉπÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåÂæóÂéª„ÄÇÊúâÈå¢‰∏çÁï¢ËÄÖÔºåÊàñËá≥Ëá™ÊÆ∫„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÂÆàÊ∏ÖËÄÖÔºå‰πû‰∏ç‰πãÂÆòÔºåÁöÜËø´ÈÅ£‰πã„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78. Around the time, there was one Sima Zhi (), who had been newly appointed as the Administrator () of Julu Commandery (). As he had a reputation for being an honest official, he was required to pay less ‚Äì three million maces. Upon receiving the order, he lamented, \\"I should be like a parent to the common people, but I have been forced to exploit them to satisfy (the Emperor's) needs. I can't bear to do this.\\" He attempted to resign, claiming that he was ill, but his request was denied. When he reached Meng Ford () near Luoyang, he wrote a memorial to point out all the problems with the government and cite historical examples to warn the emperor. He then committed suicide by consuming poison. After reading Sima Zhi's memorial, Emperor Ling temporarily stopped collecting funds for rebuilding the palace,(ÊôÇÈâÖÈπøÂ§™ÂÆàÊ≤≥ÂÖßÂè∏È¶¨Áõ¥Êñ∞Èô§Ôºå‰ª•ÊúâÊ∏ÖÂêçÔºåÊ∏õË≤¨‰∏âÁôæËê¨„ÄÇÁõ¥Ë¢´Ë©îÔºåÊÇµÁÑ∂Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁÇ∫Ê∞ëÁà∂ÊØçÔºåËÄåÂèçÂâ≤ÂâùÁôæÂßìÔºå‰ª•Á®±ÊôÇÊ±ÇÔºåÂêæ‰∏çÂøç‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçËæ≠ÁñæÔºå‰∏çËÅΩ„ÄÇË°åËá≥Â≠üÊ¥•Ôºå‰∏äÊõ∏Ê•µÈô≥Áï∂‰∏ñ‰πãÂ§±ÔºåÂè§‰ªäÁ¶çÊïó‰πãÊàíÔºåÂç≥ÂêûËó•Ëá™ÊÆ∫„ÄÇÊõ∏Â•èÔºåÂ∏ùÁÇ∫Êö´Áµï‰øÆÂÆÆÈå¢„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78. but quickly resumed his construction projects later. He built a hall within the western gardens and filled it with treasures and silk taken from the agriculture department. He also visited his birthplace in Hejian Commandery, where he acquired land and used it to build mansions and towers. As Emperor Ling came from a relatively poor background as a lesser marquis, he had a strong desire to accumulate as much personal wealth as possible ‚Äì especially after he saw that his predecessor, Emperor Huan, did not leave behind a large family fortune for him. He drew his wealth not just from the imperial treasuries, but also from the low-ranking eunuchs who attended to him.(ÂèàÈÄ†Ëê¨ÈáëÂ†ÇÊñºË•øÂúíÔºåÂºïÂè∏Ëæ≤ÈáëÈå¢ÁπíÂ∏õÔºå‰ªûÁ©çÂÖ∂‰∏≠„ÄÇÂèàÈÇÑÊ≤≥ÈñíË≤∑Áî∞ÂÆÖÔºåËµ∑Á¨¨ËßÄ„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊú¨‰æØÂÆ∂ÔºåÂÆøË≤ßÔºåÊØèÊ≠éÊ°ìÂ∏ù‰∏çËÉΩ‰ΩúÂÆ∂Â±ÖÔºåÊïÖËÅöÁÇ∫ÁßÅËáßÔºåÂæ©ËáßÂØÑÂ∞èÈªÉÈñÄÂ∏∏‰æçÈå¢ÂêÑÊï∏ÂçÉËê¨„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78.

As the eunuchs were highly trusted and favoured by Emperor Ling, they behaved lawlessly and abused their power. They even built lavish mansions for themselves in the same design as the imperial palace. When Emperor Ling once visited Yong'anhou Platform (), a high viewing platform, the eunuchs were worried that he would see their mansions and become suspicious. Thus, they told him, \\"Your Majesty shouldn't put yourself on higher ground. If you do so, the people will scatter.\\" The emperor believed them and stopped visiting high towers and viewing platforms.(Â∏∏‰∫ëÔºö„ÄåÂºµÂ∏∏‰æçÊòØÊàëÂÖ¨ÔºåË∂ôÂ∏∏‰æçÊòØÊàëÊØç„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÆ¶ÂÆòÂæóÂøóÔºåÁÑ°ÊâÄÊÜöÁïèÔºå‰∏¶Ëµ∑Á¨¨ÂÆÖÔºåÊì¨ÂâáÂÆÆÂÆ§„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂ∏∏ÁôªÊ∞∏ÂÆâ‰æØËá∫ÔºåÂÆ¶ÂÆòÊÅêÂÖ∂ÊúõË¶ãÂ±ÖËôïÔºå‰πÉ‰Ωø‰∏≠Â§ß‰∫∫Â∞ö‰ΩÜË´´Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§©Â≠ê‰∏çÁï∂ÁôªÈ´òÔºåÁôªÈ´òÂâáÁôæÂßìËôõÊï£„ÄÇ„ÄçËá™ÊòØ‰∏çÊï¢Âæ©ÂçáËá∫Ê¶≠„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78. In 186, Emperor Ling tasked the eunuchs Song Dian () and Bi Lan () with overseeing new construction projects, including a new palace hall, four large bronze statues, four giant bronze bells and water-spouting animal sculptures, among others. He also ordered coins to be minted and widely circulated. Many people perceived this to be a display of the emperor's extravagance, and pointed to signs showing that the coins will eventually scatter everywhere. This turned out to be true when chaos broke out in Luoyang after Emperor Ling's death.(ÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÈÅÇ‰ΩøÈâ§Áõæ‰ª§ÂÆãÂÖ∏Áπï‰øÆÂçóÂÆÆÁéâÂ†Ç„ÄÇÂèà‰ΩøÊéñÂ∫≠‰ª§Áï¢ÂµêÈëÑÈäÖ‰∫∫ÂõõÂàóÊñºÂÄâÈæç„ÄÅÁéÑÊ≠¶Èóï„ÄÇÂèàÈëÑÂõõÈêòÔºåÁöÜÂèó‰∫åÂçÉÊñõÔºåÁ∏£ÊñºÁéâÂ†ÇÂèäÈõ≤Ëá∫ÊÆøÂâç„ÄÇÂèàÈëÑÂ§©Á•øËù¶ËüáÔºåÂêêÊ∞¥ÊñºÂπ≥ÈñÄÂ§ñÊ©ãÊù±ÔºåËΩâÊ∞¥ÂÖ•ÂÆÆ„ÄÇÂèà‰ΩúÁøªËªäÊ∏¥ÁÉèÔºåÊñΩÊñºÊ©ãË•øÔºåÁî®ÁÅëÂçóÂåóÈÉäË∑ØÔºå‰ª•ÁúÅÁôæÂßìÁÅëÈÅì‰πãË≤ª„ÄÇÂèàÈëÑÂõõÂá∫ÊñáÈå¢ÔºåÈå¢ÁöÜÂõõÈÅì„ÄÇË≠òËÄÖÁ´äË®Ä‰æàËôêÂ∑≤ÁîöÔºåÂΩ¢Ë±°ÂÖÜË¶ãÔºåÊ≠§Èå¢ÊàêÔºåÂøÖÂõõÈÅìËÄåÂéª„ÄÇÂèä‰∫¨Â∏´Â§ß‰∫ÇÔºåÈå¢ÊûúÊµÅÂ∏ÉÂõõÊµ∑„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 78.

In 188, under the suggestions of Liu Yan, Emperor Ling greatly increased the political and military power of the provincial governors and selected key officials to serve as provincial governors. In 189, as Emperor Ling became critically ill, a succession issue came into being. Emperor Ling had two surviving sons ‚Äì Liu Bian, the son of Empress He, and Liu Xie, the son of Consort Wang. Because Emperor Ling had, earlier in his life, frequently lost sons in childhood, he later believed that his sons needed to be raised outside the palace by foster parents. Therefore, when Liu Bian was born, he was entrusted to Shi Zimiao (), a Taoist, and referred to \\"Marquis Shi.\\" Later, when Liu Xie was born, he was raised by Emperor Ling's mother, Empress Dowager Dong, and was known as \\"Marquis Dong.\\" Liu Bian was born of the empress and was older, but Emperor Ling viewed his behaviour as being insufficiently solemn and therefore considered making Liu Xie crown prince, but hesitated and could not decide. When Emperor Ling died later that year, a powerful eunuch whom he trusted, Jian Shuo, wanted to first kill Empress He's brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, and then make Liu Xie emperor, and therefore set up a trap at a meeting he was to have with He Jin. He Jin found out, and peremptorily declared Liu Bian emperor.

Alcock, (April 16, 1948 ‚Äì October 14, 2011) was a Canadian politician. He represented the riding of Winnipeg South in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2006 and was a cabinet minister in the government of Prime Minister Paul Martin. Alcock was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Early life and career Alcock was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simon Fraser University and a Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University. He was the director of Manitoba Child and Family Services from 1983 to 1985 and in this capacity spearheaded an effort to rewrite the province's child protection legislation. As a result of his efforts, Manitoba became the first province in Canada to introduce official protocols to deal with instances of child sex abuse.Reg Alcock, official biographical sketch, 2006 campaign material. Alcock has also been active with the Harvard Policy Group, which studies the effects of Information Technology on the public sector. He began his political career at the provincial level, working as an organizer for the Manitoba Liberal Party in the early 1980s.Paul Samyn, \\"Doer, Alcock crusaders again\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 2005, A7. Alcock was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Winnipeg division of Osborne in the 1988 provincial election, in which the Manitoba Liberal Party rose from one seat to twenty under the leadership of Sharon Carstairs. He later worked as campaign manager for high-profile Liberal incumbent Lloyd Axworthy in the 1988 federal election.Derek Ferguson, \\"Liberal gains no fluke\\", Toronto Star, 23 November 1988, A21. Alcock served as official opposition house leader and finance critic and was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election despite a shift against his party. He endorsed Jean Chr√©tien's bid to lead the federal Liberal Party in 1990,Paul Samyn, \\"Alcock wants PM to retire early\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 December 2002. and declared his own intention to enter federal politics in 1992.John Dafoe, \\"Post-referendum populism turns into lassitude in the West\\", Globe and Mail, 21 November 1992, D2. Alcock won the Liberal nomination for Winnipeg South in early 1993, defeating rival candidate Linda Asper by only five votes on the third ballot of what proved to be a divisive contest.Jim Carr, \\"Ready for a fight\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 March 1993, Editorial. Asper later attempted to challenge the results, and subsequently left the Liberal Party. He won a convincing victory over incumbent Progressive Conservative incumbent Dorothy Dobbie in the 1993 federal election and entered parliament as a government backbencher. Government backbencher Alcock soon developed a reputation as one of the most technologically savvy members of parliament. In 1994, he became the first MP to electronically coordinate his parliamentary office from his riding instead of relying on permanent staff in Ottawa.John Douglas, \\"MP is wired for politics\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 1994, City Page. Reform Party MP Stephen Harper said that many in his party were trying to adapt similar systems. At around the same time, he became the first Canadian MP to host an official website.\\"Manitoba lawmaker enters cyberspace\\", Associated Press Political Service, 19 April 1995. He was appointed to the standing committee on foreign affairs and international trade in 1995,\\"Alcock named to powerful panel Staff\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 February 1995, Canadian Wire Stories. and was named chair of the standing committee on transport in 1997.Dan Lett, \\"Two Winnipeg Liberal MPs move up power structure\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 March 1996, A5. The Chr√©tien government called a new federal election in the summer of 1997, only three- and-a-half years into its five-year mandate. The election timing was controversial in Manitoba, as it coincided with significant flooding from the Red River into Winnipeg. Alcock, along with other Manitoba Liberal MPs, requested a delay until the flooding was under control.Dan Lett, \\"MPs want vote delayed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 April 1997. When Chr√©tien called the election anyway, Alcock transformed his campaign office into a volunteer relief centre.Bud Robertson, \\"Politicians unite against flood\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 April 1997, A7. He was personally involved in sandbagging and evacuation efforts and did not actively campaign in the first period of the election. He was nonetheless returned by a significant margin.Tim Harper, \\"McDonough says election call 'insensitive'\\", Toronto Star, 29 April 1997, A11. From 1998 to 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In 1998, he brought forward a private member's bill to overturn Louis Riel's conviction for high treason and recognize him as a Father of Confederation.Paul Samyn, \\"MPs eye clean slate for Riel\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 March 1998, A1. There were frequent rumours that Alcock would be appointed to the Chr√©tien cabinet, but he was passed over on more than one occasion. His professional relationship with Chr√©tien deteriorated after 2000, and in 2002 he became the primary Manitoba organizer for Paul Martin's bid to replace Chr√©tien as party leader.\\"Winnipeg voters love Martin\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 June 2002, A1. In the same year, he became one of the first Liberal MPs to openly call for Chr√©tien's resignation.Anne Dawson, \\"16 Liberal MPs willing to declare PM should resign\\", National Post, 25 July 2002, A01. Alcock increased his public profile in 2003, after chairing a committee which forced privacy commissioner George Radwanski to resign from office after revelations of lax spending habits.\\"Radwanski quits under pressure\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 24 June 2003, A1. Cabinet minister When Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada on December 12, 2003, he appointed Alcock to cabinet as President of the Treasury Board, Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, and political minister responsible for Manitoba. He was also named to the government's priorities and planning committee, described as the \\"inner circle\\" of cabinet,\\"New PM names 15 to inner circle\\", National Post, 13 December 2003, A4. and was appointed chair of a cabinet committee that conducted a comprehensive review of government spending.Darren Yourk, \\"Ottawa freezes capital spending\\", globeandmail.com, 16 December 2003, Breaking News. =Policy= As president of the Treasury Board, Alcock was responsible for overseeing the Canadian civil service and the spending details of government agencies. He also played a leading role in coordinating the Martin government's response to the federal sponsorship scandal, in which some public monies were misappropriated by bureaucrats and advertising agents in Quebec with ties to the Liberal Party.\\"Tory hopes to slay Grit giant\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 June 2004, A13. Alcock announced a new appointment process for crown corporation executives in 2004,\\"President of the Treasury Board Announces New Appointment Process\\", Canada NewsWire, 15 March 2004, 13:45 report. and the following year he issued a new policy of management control for government agencies. He argued that these reforms would prevent similar scandals from occurring in the future.Campbell Clark, \\"Liberals to unveil new bureaucratic controls\\", Globe and Mail, 26 October 2005, A4. One of his more notable initiatives was the establishment of a chief audit executive for each government department and agency.Peter Larson, \\"Gomery: The cure may be worse than the disease\\", Toronto Star, 14 November 2005, A17. In total, Alcock brought forward 158 separate reforms for the public service in late 2005, and promised that another eighty would follow. Critics considered this to be excessive and some suggested that Alcock was micro-managing his department.\\"Harper hints at easing up on rules\\", Hamilton Spectator, 24 March 2006, A17. Alcock also released a comprehensive proposal for reforming Canada's regulatory system in March 2005. He argued that his reforms would reduce delays for patent drug approval and avoid the duplication of existing foreign research without compromising safety standards.Paul Vieira, \\"Alcock aims to put new rules into regulation\\", National Post, 26 March 2005, FP3. Critics of the plan suggested that it could jeopardize Canadian sovereignty and lead to the adoption of American regulatory standards.\\"Loss of sovereignty feared over 'smart regulation'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 March 2005, A10. In February 2004, the National Post identified Alcock as a leading cabinet supporter of private-public partnerships.Bill Curry, \\"Liberals building a case for privatizing\\", National Post, 9 February 2004, A1. =Other= In early 2005, Alcock publicly criticized his government's position against the legalization of marijuana, saying, \\"If we actually wanted to break the back of organized crime, we would be better off to control it. When you have these things underground, what you end up fuelling is organized crime.\\"\\"Alcock at odds with party over pot\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 March 2005, B4. 2006 election Alcock was unexpectedly defeated in the 2006 federal election, losing to Conservative Rod Bruinooge by just 111 votes in Winnipeg South. He took personal responsibility for the loss and acknowledged that he did not spend enough time campaigning in his own riding. Alcock also said that being the government's point man for the sponsorship scandal did not help his electoral prospects, though he ultimately defended his government's actions. One of Alcock's final acts in office was to approve a payment of up to $40,000 to assist Jean Pelletier with legal fees in a court challenge against the Gomery Commission. Representatives of other parties criticized this payment, saying that the government should only cover legal costs for working civil servants. Pelletier's lawyer argued that it followed a long-standing government policy for high-ranking functionaries in judicial proceedings.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Treasury Board to review legal-fees offer to Pelletier\\", Globe and Mail, 26 April 2006, A10. Out of parliament In March 2006, Alcock announced that he would support Belinda Stronach if she entered the contest to succeed Paul Martin as Liberal leader.\\"Stronach gets veteran's support for an undeclared leadership bid\\", National Post, 4 March 2006, A6. Stronach announced in early April that she would not be a candidate. Several of members of Alcock's political organization later worked for Ken Dryden's campaign, and Alcock himself endorsed Dryden at the leadership convention.Paul Samyn, \\"Dryden's team trails in score\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 October 2006, A1. Dryden dropped off after the second ballot and endorsed Bob Rae and then eventual winner St√©phane Dion. In January 2007, Alcock was appointed to the faculty of the University of Manitoba as an executive in residence at the I. H. Asper School of Business.\\"U of M adds Alcock to faculty\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 January 2007. He was also appointed as a research affiliate with the Leadership Network at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. Death Alcock died on October 14, 2011, after suffering an apparent heart attack at James Richardson International Airport in Winnipeg. He was 63 years old. Trivia *In September 2005, Alcock donated an original painting entitled, \\"The view from my seat in the House of Commons, May 19, 6:10 p.m.\\", to a charity auction in Winnipeg. The work, a parody of Edvard Munch's The Scream, depicted Alcock's impression of the opposition Conservative caucus moments after the Liberals won a crucial confidence vote that could have forced early elections. Alcock acknowledged that the painting was mostly traced. It sold for $2,200.Jane Taber, \\"Alcock rises to the artistic challenge\\", Globe and Mail, 1 October 2005, A4. *Alcock suffered weight- related health problems during his political career. Facing the prospect of severe diabetes, he reduced his weight from 430 pounds to 295 pounds in the mid-2000s.John Ivison, \\"Losing the election was 'my own damn fault'\\" , National Post, 26 January 2006, online edition.

She is the former wife of Pierre Trudeau, 15th Prime Minister of Canada; they divorced in 1984, during his final months in office. She is the mother of Justin Trudeau, the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada; the journalist and author Alexandre \\"Sacha\\" Trudeau; and the deceased Michel Trudeau. She is the first woman in Canadian history to have been both the wife and the mother of prime ministers. Early years Trudeau was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Scottish-born James \\"Jimmy\\" Sinclair, a former Liberal member of the Parliament of Canada and Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and Doris Kathleen (Bernard) Sinclair. Her grandmother, Rose Edith (Ivens) Bernard, with whom Trudeau had an especially-close relationship, lived in Roberts Creek, British Columbia, in later life, and was from Virden, Manitoba. Her grandfather, Thomas Kirkpatrick Bernard, was born in Makassar, Sulawesi, Indonesia, and immigrated in 1906 at age 15 with his family to Penticton, British Columbia, eventually working as a payroll clerk for Canadian Pacific Railway. The Bernards were the descendants of colonists in Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia, including Francis James Bernard, a London, England-born Anglo-Irishman whose great-grandfather, Arthur Bernard, was a member of the Irish House of Commons for Bandonbridge, and brother of Francis Bernard, Solicitor-General for Ireland, and ancestor of the Earls of Bandon. Francis James Bernard was the founder of the Singapore Police Force in 1819, The Singapore Chronicle, the first newspaper in Singapore, was established with Bernard as owner, publisher, and editor in 1824 and he opened up Katong, now a densely populated-residential enclave, the first to cultivate a coconut estate there in 1823. Bernard married Margaret Trudeau's 3rd great- grandmother, Esther Farquhar, in 1818, the eldest daughter of Scotsman William Farquhar, a colonial leader in the founding of modern Singapore, by Farquhar's first wife, Antoinette \\"Nonio\\" Clement, daughter of a French father and an ethnic Malaccan mother.\\"Stamford Raffles was not-above sneering at Farquhar's Malay wife and the children by her he acknowledged. 'The Maya Connexion', he termed them archly.\\" Another great-grandmother, Cornelia Louisa Intveld, married in 1822 to Royal Navy officer and merchant, William Purvis, from Dalgety Bay, Scotland, and a first cousin of American abolitionist Robert Purvis; a noted fine soprano and a beauty of her era. Upon glimpsing her across the auditorium at the opera in London, England, British King William IV sent his equerry to invite her to his box. After she refused, the King sent the equerry back just to ask her name. Intveld was born in Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia, where her father, who came from humble beginnings in Hellevoetsluis, South Holland, rose up through the Dutch East India Company to become the Dutch Resident of Padang. Her maternal grandmother was an Ono Niha ranee (a term covering every rank from chieftain's daughter to princess) married a prominent Dutch colonial official and merchant. Acclaimed British harpsichordist, Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, and Hawaiian settler, Edward William Purvis, according to popular belief, was the namesake of the ukulele, are Margaret Trudeau's first cousins, three times-removed. Trudeau explored her mother's family's roots in Singapore during an episode of Who Do You Think You Are?. Trudeau's family moved to a large house in Rockcliffe Park, Ontario, in 1952 after her father was appointed to the Cabinet, and she attended Rockcliffe Park Public School although they returned to North Vancouver after he lost his re-election bid in 1958. She attended Hamilton Junior Secondary School and Delbrook Senior Secondary School in North Vancouver. Trudeau graduated in 1969 from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology.http://www.sfu.ca/appreciation/tribute/473/index.html Marriage to Pierre Trudeau As an 18-year-old vacationing in Tahiti with her family, Sinclair met Pierre Trudeau, who was then Minister of Justice. Sinclair did not recognize him, and she, in fact, thought little of their encounter, but Trudeau was captivated by the carefree \\"flower child\\", nearly thirty years younger than he was, and began to pursue her. Pierre Trudeau was a bachelor before he became Prime Minister in 1968. They kept their romance private, so Canada was shocked after the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation led its morning radio broadcast about Prime Minister Trudeau honeymooning at Alta Lake, British Columbia, at the foot of Whistler Blackcomb Ski Resort the day after a surprise wedding in North Vancouver, British Columbia, on March 4, 1971. Although she had accompanied Pierre Trudeau in public a year before to ice skate and dance at an event at Rideau Hall, official residence of Canada's Governor General, it was a complete secret except to immediate-family members and close friends that she was in a romantic relationship, then in a six-month engagement to the Prime Minister. As Pierre Trudeau was a Catholic, she converted to Roman Catholicism for their marriage. She would, in later life, study Buddhism although she now considers herself an Anglican. Asked about her role in a marriage to the prime minister, Trudeau said, \\"I want to be more than a rose in my husband's lapel.\\" In 1971, the Trudeaus took a second honeymoon in the Caribbean to Barbados and an unidentified nearby island then Tobago, then to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (including both Bequia and St. Vincent) with Pierre taking a side-trip to Trinidad while Margaret stayed in Tobago. After Pierre Trudeau's government's near defeat in 1972 where Margaret herself was very uninvolved in the campaign, she decided to become much more active for the 1974 federal election. At a rally in Vancouver, she told a crowd of 2,000 her husband taught her \\"a lot about loving.\\" The remark was wildly mocked and dismissed in public during the campaign by members of the press gallery as well as by her husband's main political rivals Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leader Robert Stanfield and New Democratic Party leader David Lewis. Liberal party organizers considered her a top campaign asset, and sent her off alone to help local candidates in hotly contested ridings while critics noted, the wives of Stanfield and Lewis were on the campaign trail, they rarely spoke and stood behind their husbands at events. Political observers also found Pierre Trudeau noticeably more relaxed at events while Margaret came along. Initially, she brought her six-month-old son Sasha on the trail with her, and one veteran reporter said, \\"It's the first campaign plane for the first thing off is a crib and a diaper bag.\\" Later, she left her sons with her parents in North Vancouver while campaigning. Asked at the time if she thought her campaigning was helping Pierre Trudeau pick up votes, she replied, \\"I won't know until July 8th. But 52 per cent of the voters in this country are women...an awful lot ...\\" Her husband's party returned to a majority-government. Trudeau had difficulty adjusting to her new position.\\"From the day I became Mrs. Pierre Elliott Trudeau,\\" she writes in her memoirs, \\"a glass panel was gently lowered into place around me, like a patient in a mental hospital no longer considered able to make decisions and cannot be exposed to a harsh light.\\" The couple had three children: Justin (born December 25, 1971), Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973), and Michel (October 2, 1975 ‚Äì November 13, 1998). Margaret Trudeau (third from left) at the White House in 1977, alongside her husband Pierre, Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter Although the couple initially appeared to have a very close and loving relationship, the marriage soon began to fall apart. Trudeau resented her husband's constant work-related absences, and was forced to raise her three young sons largely by herself. Beyond the normal extensive publicity her high-profile position brought, in a few instances, she headlined. Trudeau smuggled drugs in the prime minister's luggage, made scantily-clad appearances at Studio 54, and tore apart a quilt made by Canadian conceptual artist Joyce Wieland on the wall in the prime- minister's official residence in Ottawa because it celebrated \\"reason over passion\\". (Her husband's personal motto was \\"Reason before passion\\".) Over time, the marriage disintegrated to the point, as recounted in her book, Trudeau had an affair with US Senator Ted Kennedy. She was also associated with members of the Rolling Stones, including Ronnie Wood and, according to Keith Richards's autobiography, Life, Mick Jagger. She separated from her husband in 1977, and became a much-talked-about jet-setter. She gave many \\"tell-all\\" interviews to Canadian and American magazines, and appeared in two motion pictures. Pierre Trudeau won custody of the children and did not pay any spousal support. Trudeau had a difficult time earning a living after her marriage. She wrote the book Beyond Reason about her marriage. On the eve of the 1979 election, in which Pierre Trudeau's party lost the majority of seats in the House of Commons, she was seen dancing at Studio 54 nightclub in New York City. A photo of her at the disco was featured on many front pages across Canada. Divorce and second marriage Trudeau filed at the Ontario Supreme Court for a no-fault divorce on November 16, 1983, one which was finalized on April 2, 1984. On April 18, 1984, in the chambers of Judge Hugh Poulin, with her three sons attending, she married in a civil ceremony Ottawa real-estate developer Fried Kemper, with whom she had two children: son Kyle (born 1984); and daughter Alicia (born 1988). Later life In November 1998, the Trudeaus' youngest son, Michel, an avid outdoorsman, was killed when an avalanche swept him to the bottom of British Columbia's Kokanee Lake. The loss of her son was devastating for Trudeau, and she suffered another major depressive episode that led to her second divorce. When Pierre Trudeau died in 2000, Margaret was at his bedside with their surviving sons Justin and Alexandre.Cleroux, Richard (September 30, 2000). Ex-wife at Trudeau's deathbed. Irish Independent. Retrieved May 8, 2020. Speaking in 2010 about her marriage to Trudeau, she said: \\"Just because our marriage ended didn't mean the love stopped.\\" On October 19, 2015, her eldest son, Justin Trudeau, led the Liberal Party to a majority government, becoming the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada. During the campaign, she was involved, but avoided campaigning in public as the Harper campaign's main attack line against Justin was \\"Just Not Ready\\" and feared they would suggest her son was \\"so unready he needs his mummy.\\" On April 27, 2020, Trudeau was hospitalized with smoke inhalation after a fire broke out in her apartment building.\\"Margaret Trudeau in hospital after fire at Montreal apartment building\\". CBC News Montreal, April 28, 2020. Work, advocacy and writing Trudeau speaks at the University of the Fraser Valley in 2017. From 2002 to 2017, Trudeau was the honorary president of WaterAid Canada, an Ottawa-based organization dedicated to helping the poorest communities in developing countries build sustainable water supply and sanitation services. In 2014, she visited Mali as an ambassador of WaterAid Canada. On May 5, 2006, Trudeau announced she has bipolar disorder. Since then, she advocated for reducing the social-stigma of mental illness--bipolar disorder in particular--with speaking engagements across North America. In May 2019, she presented the one-woman-show Certain Woman of an Age in Chicago as part of the city's Wellness Week. She is an honorary patron of the Canadian Mental Health Association.. In July 2019, she attended an opening ceremony of WE College in Narok County (Kenya) with former Prime Minister of Canada Kim Campbell, Kenyan First Lady Margaret Kenyatta and Craig Kielburger, a co- founder of WE Charity organization. In 2010, she authored Changing My Mind, a book about her personal experience with bipolar disorder. Award In 2013, Trudeau received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Western Ontario in recognition of her work to combat mental illness.

The four tracks comprising the EP were recorded, along with thirteen others, in early 1978 for the proposed Static Age album. When the band could not find a record label to release the album, they instead released four of the songs as \\"Bullet\\" on singer Glenn Danzig's label Plan 9 Records. The songs were re- released in different versions over subsequent years, until Static Age was finally released in its entirety in 1997. Background In August 1977 the Misfits released their debut single \\"Cough/Cool\\" on Blank Records, a label operated by singer Glenn Danzig. Several months later Mercury Records issued a Pere Ubu record on their own Blank Records imprint, unaware that Danzig held a trademark on the name. They offered him thirty hours of studio time in exchange for the rights to the Blank Records name, which he accepted. In January and February 1978 the Misfits, then consisting of Danzig, guitarist Franch√© Coma, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Mr. Jim, recorded seventeen songs at C.I. Recordings in New York City with engineer and producer Dave Achelis. Because of the time constraints they recorded the songs live in the studio with only a few takes each and very few overdubs. They mixed fourteen of them with Achelis for their proposed first album, to be titled Static Age. However, the band were unable to find a record label interested in releasing the album, and instead released four of the tracks as the \\"Bullet\\" EP in June 1978 on Danzig's new label Plan 9 Records. The song \\"Bullet\\" references the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, with sexually explicit lyrics directed at his wife Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: \\"Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead/Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head/Texas is the reason that the President's dead/You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck\\". Pressing information The first pressing of \\"Bullet\\" consisted of 1,000 copies on black 7\\" vinyl with a gatefold cover and lyrics sheet. These copies had \\"distributed by Ork\\" printed on the back sleeve, as a distribution deal with Ork Records had been planned, but distribution through Ork never took place. A second pressing of 2,000 on red vinyl had a different back cover, removing the band photo and mention of Ork and replacing it with artwork of a bullet hole and the words \\"better dead on red\\". 7,000 additional copies were later pressed on black vinyl with the same cover as the second pressing. Re-releases and other versions All four songs from \\"Bullet\\" were reissued on the Beware EP in January 1980, and a live version of \\"We Are 138\\" appeared on the Evilive EP in 1982. The compilation album Misfits (1986), released three years after the band's breakup, included \\"Bullet\\" and \\"Hollywood Babylon\\", while Collection II (1995) included \\"We Are 138\\" and \\"Attitude\\". The Misfits box set in 1996 presented the complete Static Age album for the first time, including all four tracks from the \\"Bullet\\" single. Static Age was also released as a separate album that July. Cover versions \\"Bullet\\" was covered by Refused for the Children In Heat compilation, and the Hellacopters covered it on the tribute album Hell on Earth: A Tribute to the Misfits (2000). Entombed also covered \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" on the same album. \\"Attitude\\" was covered by Sum 41, the Slackers, and Guns N' Roses.

He became emperor around the age of 13 upon the death of his father, Emperor Ling, and ruled briefly from 15 May to 28 September 189 before he was deposed, after which he became known as the \\"Prince of Hongnong\\". His emperor title, \\"Emperor Shao\\" (literally \\"young emperor\\"), was also used by other emperors who were in power for very short periods of time. In 190, he was poisoned to death by Dong Zhuo, the warlord who deposed him and replaced him with his younger half-brother, Liu Xie (Emperor Xian).  Family background  Liu Bian was born in 176 to Liu Hong (Emperor Ling) and one of his consorts, Lady He. At the time of his birth, he was Emperor Ling's only son because the emperor's other sons who were born before Liu Bian died prematurely. As Emperor Ling believed that he lost his previous sons due to bad luck, he ordered Shi Zimiao (), a Taoist, to raise his newborn son; Liu Bian was given the title \\"Marquis Shi\\" ().(Èï∑‰∏ÉÂ∞∫‰∏ÄÂØ∏„ÄÇÁîüÁöáÂ≠êËæØÔºåÈ§äÊñºÂè≤ÈÅì‰∫∫ÂÆ∂ÔºåËôüÊõ∞Âè≤‰æØ„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 10 (Part 2).(ÈÅì‰∫∫Ë¨ÇÈÅìË°ì‰πã‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÁçªÂ∏ùÊò•ÁßãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈùàÂ∏ùÊï∏Â§±Â≠êÔºå‰∏çÊï¢Ê≠£ÂêçÔºåÈ§äÈÅì‰∫∫Âè≤Â≠êÁúáÂÆ∂ÔºåËôüÊõ∞Âè≤‰æØ„ÄÇ„Äç) Annotation in Houhanshu vol. 10 (Part 2).

When his subjects asked him to name one of his sons as crown prince, Emperor Ling had a dilemma between Liu Bian and Liu Xie, his only two surviving sons. He felt that Liu Bian was unfit to be emperor because he was frivolous and unable to command respect, so he preferred Liu Xie. However, he was also worried that if he chose Liu Xie, Empress He would turn to her half- brother, He Jin, for help. He Jin held the position of General-in-Chief () and was a highly influential figure in the imperial court.

Reign  When Emperor Ling became critically ill in 189, he secretly entrusted an eight-year-old Liu Xie to a close aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon the emperor's death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. Jian Shuo's plan to make Liu Xie emperor ultimately failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor's mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son.

They indiscriminately slaughtered anyone who looked like a eunuch; some young men who had no facial hair, in desperation, dropped their pants in front of the soldiers to prove that they were not eunuchs. During the attack, the eunuchs took Emperor Shao, the Prince of Chenliu (Liu Xie) and Empress Dowager He hostage and tried to flee from the palace.

As Lu Zhi and Min Gong were escorting the emperor and prince back to the imperial palace, they were intercepted by forces under the command of Dong Zhuo, one of the warlords initially summoned by He Jin to put pressure on Empress Dowager He. When Dong Zhuo met them, Emperor Shao was so shocked that he could not express his thoughts clearly. In contrast, Liu Xie had no difficulty in describing what happened and, in Dong Zhuo's impression, behaved more like an emperor than Emperor Shao. Dong Zhuo thus conceived the idea of deposing Emperor Shao and replacing him with Liu Xie.  Deposal and death  After escorting the emperor and prince back to Luoyang, Dong Zhuo took advantage of the power vacuum created by the conflict between He Jin and the eunuch faction to seize control of the central government and imperial court. Many officials and the imperial troops stationed in Luoyang felt intimidated by the elite, battle-tested soldiers whom Dong Zhuo brought along with him from Liang Province. Dong Zhuo eventually had Emperor Shao deposed and replaced with Liu Xie, who became historically known as Emperor Xian. The former Emperor Shao was given the honorary title \\"Prince of Hongnong\\". Later that year, Dong Zhuo had Empress Dowager He poisoned to death in Yong'an Palace ().(Ëë£ÂçìÈÅÇÂª¢Â∏ùÔºåÂèàËø´ÊÆ∫Â§™ÂêéÔºåÊÆ∫ËàûÈôΩÂêõÔºå‰ΩïÊ∞èÈÅÇ‰∫°ÔºåËÄåÊº¢ÂÆ§‰∫¶Ëá™Ê≠§Êïó‰∫Ç„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 69.(Âπ∂Â∑ûÁâßËë£ÂçìË¢´ÂæµÔºåÂ∞áÂÖµÂÖ•Ê¥õÈôΩÔºåÈôµËôêÊúùÂ∫≠ÔºåÈÅÇÂª¢Â∞ëÂ∏ùÁÇ∫ÂºòËæ≤ÁéãËÄåÁ´ãÂçîÔºåÊòØÁÇ∫ÁçªÂ∏ù„ÄÇ ...

In early 190, after a coalition of warlords launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of freeing Emperor Xian and the central government from his control, Dong Zhuo became worried that the warlords might restore the Prince of Hongnong to the throne and hence threaten the legitimacy of the government he controlled in Luoyang. Within a month after the campaign started, Dong Zhuo sent his adviser Li Ru to force the prince to commit suicide by drinking poisoned wine. The prince was allowed to bid his wife, Consort Tang, and other concubines farewell before succumbing to his fate. However, in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the former emperor writes a poem that upsets Dong Zhuo who then sends Li Ru to kill him.

In practice, identifiably Christian art only survives from the 2nd century onwards. After 550 at the latest, Christian art is classified as Byzantine, or of some other regional type.van der Meer, F., 27 uses \\"roughly from 200 to 600\\". It is hard to know when distinctly Christian art began. Prior to 100, Christians may have been constrained by their position as a persecuted group from producing durable works of art. Since Christianity was largely a religion of the lower classes in this period, the lack of surviving art may reflect a lack of funds for patronage, and simply small numbers of followers. The Old Testament restrictions against the production of graven (an idol or fetish carved in wood or stone) images (see also Idolatry and Christianity) may also have constrained Christians from producing art. Christians may have made or purchased art with pagan iconography, but given it Christian meanings, as they later did. If this happened, \\"Christian\\" art would not be immediately recognizable as such. Early Christianity used the same artistic media as the surrounding pagan culture. These media included fresco, mosaics, sculpture, and manuscript illumination. Early Christian art used not only Roman forms but also Roman styles. Late classical style included a proportional portrayal of the human body and impressionistic presentation of space. Late classical style is seen in early Christian frescos, such as those in the Catacombs of Rome, which include most examples of the earliest Christian art. The Brescia Casket, 4th-century ivory Early Christian art and architecture adapted Roman artistic motifs and gave new meanings to what had been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the peacock, Vitis viniferavines, and the \\"Good Shepherd\\". Early Christians also developed their own iconography; for example, such symbols as the fish (ikhthus) were not borrowed from pagan iconography. Early Christian art is generally divided into two periods by scholars: before and after either the Edict of Milan of 313, bringing the so-called Triumph of the Church under Constantine, or the First Council of Nicea in 325. The earlier period being called the Pre-Constantinian or Ante-Nicene Period and after being the period of the First seven Ecumenical Councils. The end of the period of early Christian art, which is typically defined by art historians as being in the 5th‚Äì7th centuries, is thus a good deal later than the end of the period of early Christianity as typically defined by theologians and church historians, which is more often considered to end under Constantine, around 313‚Äì325. Symbols Good Shepherd from the Catacomb of Priscilla, 250‚Äì300 During the persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire, Christian art was necessarily and deliberately furtive and ambiguous, using imagery that was shared with pagan culture but had a special meaning for Christians. The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of Christian tombs in the catacombs of Rome. From literary evidence, there may well have been panel icons which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared. Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by pictogram symbols such as the Ichthys (fish), peacock, Lamb of God, or an anchor (the Labarum or Chi-Rho was a later development). Later personified symbols were used, including Jonah, whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between the death and resurrection of Jesus, Daniel in the lion's den, or Orpheus' charming the animals. The image of \\"The Good Shepherd\\", a beardless youth in pastoral scenes collecting sheep, was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus. These images bear some resemblance to depictions of kouros figures in Greco-Roman art. The \\"almost total absence from Christian monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned cross\\" except in the disguised form of the anchor,Marucchi, Orazio. \\"Arch√¶ology of the Cross and Crucifix.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 Sept. 2018 online is notable. The Cross, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion on a cross, was not represented explicitly for several centuries, possibly because crucifixion was a punishment meted out to common criminals, but also because literary sources noted that it was a symbol recognised as specifically Christian, as the sign of the cross was made by Christians from very early on. The popular conception that the Christian catacombs were \\"secret\\" or had to hide their affiliation is probably wrong; catacombs were large-scale commercial enterprises, usually sited just off major roads to the city, whose existence was well known. The inexplicit symbolic nature of many early Christian visual motifs may have had a function of discretion in other contexts, but on tombs, they probably reflect a lack of any other repertoire of Christian iconography. The dove is a symbol of peace and purity. It can be found with a halo or celestial light. In one of the earliest known Trinitarian images, \\"the Throne of God as a Trinitarian image\\" (a marble relief carved c. 400 CE in the collection of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), the dove represents the Spirit. It is flying above an empty throne representing God, in the throne are a chlamys (cloak) and diadem representing the Son. The Chi-Rho monogram, XP, apparently first used by Constantine I, consists of the first two characters of the name 'Christos' in Greek. Christian art before 313 Noah praying in the Ark, from a Roman catacomb A general assumption that early Christianity was generally aniconic, opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney's analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994). This distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: \\"first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen\\". These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that \\"overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined\\", so placing less emphasis on the Jewish background of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.Finney, viii‚Äìxii, viii and xi quoted Finney suggests that \\"the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti- materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art\\".Finney, 108 In the Dura-Europos church, of about 230‚Äì256, which is in the best condition of the surviving very early churches, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the Good Shepherd. The building was a normal house apparently converted to use as a church.Graydon F. Snyder, Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine, p. 134, Mercer University Press, 2003, google books The earliest Christian paintings in the Catacombs of Rome are from a few decades before, and these represent the largest body of examples of Christian art from the pre-Constantinian period, with hundreds of examples decorating tombs or family tomb-chambers. Many are simple symbols, but there are numerous figure paintings either showing orants or female praying figures, usually representing the deceased person, or figures or shorthand scenes from the bible or Christian history. The style of the catacomb paintings, and the entirety of many decorative elements, are effectively identical to those of the catacombs of other religious groups, whether conventional pagans following Ancient Roman religion, or Jews or followers of the Roman mystery religions. The quality of the painting is low compared to the large houses of the rich, which provide the other main corpus of painting surviving from the period, but the shorthand depiction of figures can have an expressive charm. A similar situation applies at Dura-Europos, where the decoration of the church is comparable in style and quality to that of the (larger and more lavishly painted) Dura-Europos synagogue and the Temple of Bel. At least in such smaller places, it seems that the available artists were used by all religious groups. It may also have been the case that the painted chambers in the catacombs were decorated in similar style to the best rooms of the homes of the better-off families buried in them, with Christian scenes and symbols replacing those from mythology, literature, paganism and eroticism, although we lack the evidence to confirm this.Balch, 183, 193 We do have the same scenes on small pieces in media such as pottery or glass, though less often from this pre-Constantinian period. There was a preference for what are sometimes called \\"abbreviated\\" representations, small groups of say one to four figures forming a single motif which could be easily recognised as representing a particular incident. These vignettes fitted the Roman style of room decoration, set in compartments in a scheme with a geometrical structure (see gallery below). Biblical scenes of figures rescued from mortal danger were very popular; these represented both the Resurrection of Jesus, through typology, and the salvation of the soul of the deceased. Jonah and the whale,Balch, 41 and chapter 6 the Sacrifice of Isaac, Noah praying in the Ark (represented as an orant in a large box, perhaps with a dove carrying a branch), Moses striking the rock, Daniel in the lion's den and the Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace () were all favourites, that could be easily depicted. Early Christian sarcophagi were a much more expensive option, made of marble and often heavily decorated with scenes in very high relief, worked with drills. Free-standing statues that are unmistakably Christian are very rare, and never very large, as more common subjects such as the Good Shepherd were symbols appealing to several religious and philosophical groups, including Christians, and without context no affiliation can be given to them. Typically sculptures, where they appear, are of rather high quality. One exceptional group that seems clearly Christian is known as the Cleveland Statuettes of Jonah and the Whale, and consists of a group of small statuettes of about 270, including two busts of a young and fashionably dressed couple, from an unknown find-spot, possibly in modern Turkey. The other figures tell the story of Jonah in four pieces, with a Good Shepherd; how they were displayed remains mysterious. The depiction of Jesus was well-developed by the end of the pre-Constantinian period. He was typically shown in narrative scenes, with a preference for New Testament miracles, and few of scenes from his Passion. A variety of different types of appearance were used, including the thin long-faced figure with long centrally-parted hair that was later to become the norm. But in the earliest images as many show a stocky and short- haired beardless figure in a short tunic, who can only be identified by his context. In many images of miracles Jesus carries a stick or wand, which he points at the subject of the miracle rather like a modern stage magician (though the wand is a good deal larger). Saints are fairly often seen, with Peter and Paul, both martyred in Rome, by some way the most common in the catacombs there. Both already have their distinctive appearances, retained throughout the history of Christian art. Other saints may not be identifiable unless labelled with an inscription. In the same way some images may represent either the Last Supper or a contemporary agape feast.

In the 4th century, the rapidly growing Christian population, now supported by the state, needed to build larger and grander public buildings for worship than the mostly discreet meeting places they had been using, which were typically in or among domestic buildings. Pagan temples remained in use for their original purposes for some time and, at least in Rome, even when deserted were shunned by Christians until the 6th or 7th centuries, when some were converted to churches. Elsewhere this happened sooner. Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable, not simply for their pagan associations, but because pagan cult and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a windowless backdrop. The usable model at hand, when Emperor Constantine I wanted to memorialize his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the basilica. There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side, and an apse at one end opposite to the main door at the other. In, and often also in front of, the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated. In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes. This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches, and generally in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire, and Roman Africa, were more adventurous, and their models were sometimes copied in the West, for example in Milan. All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls, a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions, and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian church architecture. Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in Byzantine architecture, which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on. A particular and short-lived type of building, using the same basilican form, was the funerary hall, which was not a normal church, though the surviving examples long ago became regular churches, and they always offered funeral and memorial services, but a building erected in the Constantinian period as an indoor cemetery on a site connected with early Christian martyrs, such as a catacomb. The six examples built by Constantine outside the walls of Rome are: Old Saint Peter's Basilica, the older basilica dedicated to Saint Agnes of which Santa Costanza is now the only remaining element, San Sebastiano fuori le mura, San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano, and one in the modern park of Villa Gordiani.Webb, Matilda. The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide, p. 251, 2001, Sussex Academic Press, , , google books A martyrium was a building erected on a spot with particular significance, often over the burial of a martyr. No particular architectural form was associated with the type, and they were often small. Many became churches, or chapels in larger churches erected adjoining them. With baptistries and mausolea, their often smaller size and different function made martyria suitable for architectural experimentation. Among the key buildings, not all surviving in their original form, are: *Constantinian Basilicas: **Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran **St Mary Major **Old Saint Peter's Basilica **Church of the Holy Sepulchre **Church of the Nativity **Saint Sofia Church, Sofia *Centralized Plan **Santa Constanza, built as an Imperial mausoleum adjoining a funerary hall, part of the wall of which survives. **Church of St. George, Sofia File:Basilica of Hagia Sofia, Bulgaria.jpgExterior of the Basilica St. Sofia in Sofia, Bulgaria, 4th cent.

With the final legalization of Christianity, the existing styles of Christian art continued to develop, and take on a more monumental and iconic character. Before long very large Christian churches began to be constructed, and the majority of the rich elite adapted Christianity, and public and elite Christian art became grander to suit the new spaces and clients. Although borrowings of motifs such as the Virgin and Child from pagan religious art had been pointed out as far back as the Protestant Reformation, when John Calvin and his followers gleefully used them as a stick with which to beat all Christian art, the belief of Andr√© Grabar, Andreas Alf√∂ldi, Ernst Kantorowicz and other early 20th-century art historians that Roman Imperial imagery was a much more significant influence \\"has become universally accepted\\". A book by Thomas F. Mathews in 1994 attempted to overturn this thesis, very largely denying influence from Imperial iconography in favour of a range of other secular and religious influence, but was roughly handled by academic reviewers.The book was The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art by Thomas F.

More complex and expensive works are seen, as the wealthy gradually converted, and more theological complexity appears, as Christianity became subject to acrimonious doctrinal disputes. At the same time a very different type of art is found in the new public churches that were now being constructed. Somewhat by accident, the best group of survivals of these is from Rome where, together with Constantinople and Jerusalem, they were presumably at their most magnificent. Mosaic now becomes important; fortunately this survives far better than fresco, although it is vulnerable to well-meaning restoration and repair. It seems to have been an innovation of early Christian churches to put mosaics on the wall and use them for sacred subjects; previously, the technique had essentially been used for floors and walls in gardens. By the end of the period the style of gold background had developed that continued to characterize Byzantine images, and many Early Medieval Western ones. With more space, narrative images containing many people develop in churches, and also begin to be seen in later catacomb paintings. Continuous rows of biblical scenes appear (rather high up) along the side walls of churches. The best-preserved 5th-century examples are the set of Old Testament scenes along the nave walls of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. These can be compared to the paintings of Dura-Europos, and probably also derive from a lost tradition of both Jewish and Christian illustrated manuscripts, as well as more general Roman precedents. The large apses contain images in an iconic style, which gradually developed to centre on a large figure, or later just the bust, of Christ, or later of the Virgin Mary. The earliest apses show a range of compositions that are new symbolic images of the Christian life and the Church. No panel paintings, or \\"icons\\" from before the 6th century have survived in anything like an original condition, but they were clearly produced, and becoming more important throughout this period. Sculpture, all much smaller than lifesize, has survived in better quantities. The most famous of a considerable number of surviving early Christian sarcophagi are perhaps the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus and Dogmatic sarcophagus of the 4th century. A number of ivory carvings have survived, including the complex late-5th-century Brescia Casket, probably a product of Saint Ambrose's episcopate in Milan, then the seat of the Imperial court, and the 6th-century Throne of Maximian from the Byzantine Italian capital of Ravenna.

There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the Catacombs of Rome by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish, and had probably originally been given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year. Their iconography has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated. Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture of the deceased (usually, it is presumed). The progression to an increased number of images of saints can be seen in them.Grig, throughout The same technique began to be used for gold tesserae for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

He first became prominent serving Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth in Ireland. He developed efficient methods to survey the land that was to be confiscated and given to Cromwell's soldiers. He also remained a significant figure under King Charles II and King James II, as did many others who had served Cromwell. Petty was briefly a Member of the Parliament of England and was also a scientist, inventor, and merchant, and was a charter member of the Royal Society. It is for his theories on economics and his methods of political arithmetic that he is best remembered, however, and to him is attributed the philosophy of \\"laissez-faire\\" in relation to government activity. He was knighted in 1661. He was the great-grandfather of Prime Minister William Petty Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne and 1st Marquess of Lansdowne. Life and influences Petty was born and buried in Romsey, and was a friend of Samuel Pepys. He became a founding member of The Royal Society. Petty is best known for economic history and statistical writings, before Adam Smith. Of particular interest were his forays into statistical analysis. Petty's work in political arithmetic, along with the work of John Graunt, laid the foundation for modern census techniques. Moreover, this work in statistical analysis, when further expanded by writers like Josiah Child documented some of the first expositions of modern insurance. Vernon Louis Parrington notes him as an early expositor of the labour theory of value as discussed in Treatise of Taxes in 1692. In 1858 Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, one of Petty's descendants, erected a memorial and likeness of Petty in Romsey Abbey. The text on it reads: \\"A true patriot and a sound philosopher who, by his powerful intellect, his scientific works and indefatigable industry, became a benefactor to his family and an ornament to his country\\". A monumental slab on the floor of the south choir aisle of the Abbey reads \\"HERE LAYES SIR WILLIAM PETY\\". In fairness, a less invested portrait of Petty could call him a very fortunate character as easily. Petty was a music professor before being apprenticed to the brilliant Thomas Hobbes of Oxford and Cambridge University. Petty arrived upon Laissez-faire's competing view of economics at a time of great opportunity and growth in a fledgling expanding British Empire. \\"Laissez-faire\\" policies stood in direct contrast to his supervisor Hobbes' Social Contract, developed based on Hobbes' experiences during the greatest depression in Britain's history The General Crisis. To afford some context, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's experiences during the Great Depression of 1930, prompted him to create the Second Bill of Rights similarly. =Early life= Petty's father and grandfather were clothiers. He was a precocious and intelligent youngster and in 1637 became a cabin boy, but was set ashore in Normandy after breaking his leg on board. After this setback, he applied in Latin to study with the Jesuits in Caen, supporting himself by teaching English. After a year, he returned to England, and had by now a thorough knowledge of Latin, Greek, French, mathematics, and astronomy. After an uneventful period in the Navy, Petty left to study in Holland in 1643, where he developed an interest in anatomy. Through an English professor in Amsterdam, he became the personal secretary to Hobbes allowing him contact with Descartes, Gassendi and Mersenne. In 1646, he returned to England and, after developing a double-writing instrument with little success in sales, he studied medicine at Oxford University. He befriended Hartlib and Boyle, and he became a member of the Oxford Philosophical Club. =Academic and surveyor= By 1651, Petty was an anatomy instructor at Brasenose College, Oxford, as deputy to Thomas Clayton the younger. He was one of the physicians involved in treating Anne Greene, a woman who survived her own hanging and was pardoned because her survival was widely held to be an act of divine intervention. The event was widely written about at the time, and helped to build Petty's career and reputation. He was also Gresham Professor of Music in London.list of professors of Gresham College (via archive.org). William Petty, c. 1650. In 1652, he left on a leave of absence and travelled with Oliver Cromwell's army in Ireland, as physician-general. His opposition to conventional universities, being committed to 'new science' as inspired by Francis Bacon and imparted by his afore-mentioned acquaintances, perhaps pushed him from Oxford. He was pulled to Ireland perhaps by sense of ambition and desire for wealth and power. His breadth of interests was such that he successfully secured the contract for charting Ireland in 1654, so that those who had lent funds to Cromwell's army might be repaid in land ‚Äì a means of ensuring the army was self-financing. This enormous task he completed in 1656 and became known as the Down Survey, later published (1685) as Hiberniae Delineatio. As his reward, he acquired approximately in Kenmare, in southwest Ireland, and ¬£9,000. This personal gain to Petty led to persistent court cases on charges of bribery and breach of trust, until his death. Back in England, as a Cromwellian supporter, he ran successfully for Parliament in 1659 for West Looe. =Natural philosopher= Despite his political allegiances, Petty was well-treated at the Restoration in 1660, although he lost some of his Irish lands. Charles II at their first meeting brushed aside Petty's apologies for his past support for Cromwell, \\"seeming to regard them as needless\\", and discussed his experiments into the mechanics of shipping instead.Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin edition 1993 p.189 In 1661 he was elected MP for Inistioge in the Parliament of Ireland. In 1662, he was admitted a charter member of the Royal Society of the same year. This year also saw him write his first work on economics, his Treatise of Taxes and Contributions. Petty counted among his many scientific interests naval architecture: he had become convinced of the superiority of double-hulled boats, although they were not always successful; the Experiment reached Porto in 1664, but sank on the way back. =Ireland and later life= Petty was knighted in 1661 by Charles II and returned to Ireland in 1666, where he remained for most of the next twenty years. The events that took him from Oxford to Ireland marked a shift from medicine and the physical sciences to the social sciences, and Petty lost all his Oxford offices. The social sciences became the area that he studied for the rest of his life. His primary interest became Ireland's prosperity and his works describe that country and propose many remedies for its then backward condition. He helped found the Dublin Society in 1682. Returning ultimately to London in 1685, he died in 1687. He regarded his life in bittersweet terms. He had risen from humble origins to mix with the intellectual elite and was by 35 a considerably wealthy man and leading member of the \\"progressive sciences\\". Nonetheless, he was insecure about his land holdings and his ambitions of obtaining important political posts remained frustrated. Perhaps he expected the astronomical rise he experienced in his early years to continue throughout his life. Contemporaries described him, nonetheless, as humorous, good-natured and rational. Petty as projector Petty's baronetcies in Kerry Petty gained possession of the three baronies of Iveragh, Glanarought and Dunkerron in County Kerry. He soon became a projector, developing extensive plans for an ironworks and a fishery on his substantial estates in Kerry. Although he had great expectations of his application of his scientific methods to improvement, little of practical consequence came of these. He started by applying his political arithmetic to his own estates: he surveyed the population and livestock, to develop an understanding of the lands potential. The ironworks was established in 1660. Family William Petty married Elizabeth Waller in 1667. She was a daughter of the regicide Sir Hardress Waller (whose life was spared after the Restoration) and Elizabeth Dowdall. She had been previously married to Sir Maurice Fenton, who died in 1664. She was given the title Baroness Shelburne for life. They had three surviving children: * Charles Petty, 1st Baron Shelburne * Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne * Anne, who married Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry. Neither Charles nor Henry had male issue and the Shelburne title passed to Anne's son John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne, who took his mother's surname, and whose descendants hold the title Marquis of Lansdowne. Her grandson William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, praised her as a woman of strong character and intelligence, the only person who could manage her bad-tempered and tyrannical husband. Economic works and theories: overview The Economic Writings, 1899 Two men crucially influenced Petty's economic theories. The first was Thomas Hobbes, for whom Petty acted as personal secretary. According to Hobbes, theory should set out the rational requirements for \\"civil peace and material plenty\\". As Hobbes had centred on peace, Petty chose prosperity. The influence of Francis Bacon was also profound. Bacon, and indeed Hobbes, held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must be the basis of all rational sciences. This passion for accuracy led Petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision, rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives, yielding a new subject that he named \\"political arithmetic\\". Petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist, amidst the merchant-pamphleteers, such as Thomas Mun or Josiah Child, and philosopher- scientists occasionally discussing economics, such as John Locke. He was indeed writing before the true development of political economy. As such, many of his claims for precision are of imperfect quality. Nonetheless, Petty wrote three main works on economics, Treatise of Taxes and Contributions (written in 1662), Verbum Sapienti (1665) and Quantulumcunque Concerning Money (1682). These works, which received great attention in the 1690s, show his theories on major areas of what would later become economics. What follows is an analysis of his most important theories, those on fiscal contributions, national wealth, the money supply and circulation velocity, value, the interest rate, international trade and government investment. Many of his economic writings were collected by Charles Henry Hull in 1899 in The Economic Writings of Sir William Petty. Hull, in his scholarly article 'Petty's Place in the History of Economic Theory' (1900) proposed a division of the economic writings of Petty in three (or four) groups: * the first group, written when Petty had returned to London after finishing his \\"Down Survey\\" in Ireland, consists mainly of A Treatise of Taxes & Contributions (written and first published 1662) and Verbum Sapienti (written 1665, printed 1691). These texts relate to the discussions about fiscal issues, following the Restoration and the expenses of the first Dutch war. * the second group holds The Political Anatomy of Ireland and Political Arithmetick. These texts were written some ten years later in Ireland. As Hull writes, the \\"direct impulse to their writing came from Dr. Edward Chamberlayne's Present State of England, published 1669\\". * Again ten years later the third group of pamphlets was written, that were contributions to the dispute whether London were a larger city than Paris, and that are titled the Essays in Political Arithmetick by Hull. This group of pamphlets had a close relation to John Graunt's Observations upon the Bills of Mortality of London. * The Quantulumcunque concerning Money (written in 1682, and printed 1695, and perhaps in 1682), can probably be considered as belonging to a group of its own. The division given here was still used by scholars at the end of the twentieth century.See for instance for instance and . One may wonder why Hull does not mention A Treatise of Ireland in this list. He was the first to have this manuscript, dated 1687, printed. (). Fiscal contributions Fiscal contributions were of prime concern to policymakers in the 17th century, as they have remained ever since, for the wise country would not spend above its revenues. By Petty's time, England was engaged in war with Holland, and in the first three chapters of Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure, to which the monarch could adhere, when deciding how to raise money for the war. Petty lists six kinds of public charge, namely defence, governance, the pastorage of men's souls, education, the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure, or things of universal good. He then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges. He thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges, and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly, sick, orphans, etc., as well as the government employment of supernumeraries. On the issue of raising taxes, Petty was a definite proponent of consumption taxes. He recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet the various types of public charges that he listed. They should also be horizontally equitable, regular and proportionate. He condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively. He recommended a much higher quality of statistical information, to raise taxes more fairly. Imports should be taxed, but only in such a way that would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce. A vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies. Linked to this, and aware of the scarcity of money, Petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver, which he estimated to be less than 1% of national wealth. To him, too much importance was placed on money, \\"which is to the whole effect of the Kingdom‚Ä¶ not [even] one to 100\\". National income accounting In making the above estimate, Petty introduced in the first two chapters of Verbum Sapienti the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth. To him, it was all too obvious that a country's wealth lay in more than just gold and silver. He worked off an estimation that the average personal income was ¬£6 13s 4d per annum, with a population of six million, meaning that national income would be ¬£40m. Petty's theory produced estimates, some more reliable than others, for the various components of national income, including land, ships, personal estates and housing. He then distinguished between the stocks (¬£250m) and the flows yielding from them (¬£15m). The discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income (¬£40m) leads Petty to postulate that the other ¬£25m is the yield from what must be ¬£417m of labour stock, the \\"value of the people\\". This gave a total wealth for England in the 1660s of ¬£667m. Statistician Sir William Petty Petty's only statistical technique is the use of simple averages. He would not be a statistician by today's standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data. Because obtaining census data was difficult, if not impossible, especially for Ireland, he applied methods of estimation. The way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of London. He would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths. His method of using exports is by considering that a 30 percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population. The way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by 30 ‚Äì estimating that one out of thirty people die each year. To obtain the population of all of England he would multiply the population of London by 8. Such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and Petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the Crown. (Henry Spiegel) Money supply and the velocity of its circulation This figure for the stock of wealth was contrasted with a money supply in gold and silver of only ¬£6m. Petty believed that there was a certain amount of money that a nation needed to drive its trade. Hence it was possible to have too little money circulating in an economy, which would mean that people would have to rely on barter. It would also be possible for there to be too much money in an economy. But the topical question was, as he asks in chapter 3 of Verbum Sapienti, would ¬£6m be enough to drive a nation's trade, especially if the King wanted to raise additional funds for the war with Holland? The answer for Petty lay in the velocity of money's circulation. Anticipating the quantity theory of money often said to be initiated by John Locke, whereby economic output (Y) times price level (p) = money supply (MS) times velocity of circulation (v), Petty stated that if economic output was to be increased for a given money supply and price level, 'revolutions' must occur in smaller circles (i.e. velocity of circulation must be higher). This could be done through the establishment of a bank. He explicitly stated in Verbum Sapienti \\"nor is money wanting to answer all the ends of a well policed state, notwithstanding the great decreases thereof which have happened within these Twenty years\\"Verbum Sapienti, p.113 and that higher velocity is the answer. He also mentions that there is nothing unique about gold and silver in fulfilling the functions of money and that money is the means to an end, not the end itself: > Nor were it hard to substitute in the place of Money [gold and silver] (were > a comptency of it wanting) what should be equivalent unto it. For Money is > but the Fat of the Body-Politick, whereof too much doth often hinder its > agility, as too little makes it sick... so doth Money in the State quicken > its Action, feeds from abroad in the time of Dearth at home.'Hull 1899: > p.113 What is striking about these passages is his intellectual rigour, which put him far ahead of the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century. The use of biological analogies to illustrate his point, a trend continued by the physiocrats in France early in the 18th century, was also unusual. Theory of value On value, Petty continued the debate begun by Aristotle, and chose to develop an input-based theory of value: \\"all things ought to be valued by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour\\" (p. 44). Both of these would be prime sources of taxable income. Like Richard Cantillon after him, he sought to devise some equation or par between the \\"mother and father\\" of output, land and labour, and to express value accordingly. He still included general productivity, one's \\"art and industry\\". He applied his theory of value to rent. The natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities. It was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production. The interest rate The natural rate of rent is related to his theories on usury. At the time, many religious writers still condemned the charging of interest as sinful. Petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates, regarding the phenomenon as a reward for forbearance on the part of the lender. Incorporating his theories of value, he asserted that, with perfect security, the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal could have bought ‚Äì again, a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings. Where security was more \\"casual\\", the return should be greater ‚Äì a return for risk. Having established the justification for usury itself, that of forbearance, he then shows his Hobbesian qualities, arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate, pointing to the \\"vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature\\".Quantumlumque, (p. 48 Laissez-faire governance This is one of the major themes of Petty's writings, summed up by his use of the phrase vadere sicut vult, whence we get laissez-faire. As mentioned earlier, the motif of medicine was also useful to Petty, and he warned against over-interference by the government in the economy, seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient. He applied this to monopolies, controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities. They were, to him, vain and harmful to a nation. He recognised the price effects of monopolies, citing the French king's salt monopoly as an example. In another work, Political Arithmetic, Petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale. He described the phenomenon of the division of labour, asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper, if many work on it. Petty said that the gain is greater \\"as the manufacture itself is greater\\". Foreign exchange and control of trade On the efflux of specie, Petty thought it vain to try to control it, and dangerous, as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money. He noted in Quantulumcunque concerning money that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie. On exports in general, he regarded prescriptions, such as recent Acts of Parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn, as \\"burthensome\\". Further restrictions \\"would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said Trade\\" (p. 59), albeit with a concession that he is no expert in the study of the wool trade. On prohibiting imports, for example from Holland, such restrictions did little other than drive up prices, and were only useful if imports vastly exceeded exports. Petty saw far more use in going to Holland and learning whatever skills they have than trying to resist nature. Epitomizing his viewpoint, he thought it preferable to sell cloth for \\"debauching\\" foreign wines, rather than leave the clothiers unemployed. Division of labour In his Political Arithmetick, Petty made a practical study of the division of labour, showing its existence and usefulness in Dutch shipyards. Classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organised with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy. Petty also applied the principle to his survey of Ireland. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training. Urban society Petty projected the growth of the city of London and supposed that it might swallow the rest of England ‚Äì not so far from what actually happened: > Now, if the city double its people in 40 years, and the present number be > 670,000, and if the whole territory be 7,400,000, and double in 360 years, > as aforesaid, then by the underwritten table it appears that A.D. 1840 the > people of the city will be 10,718,880, and those of the whole country but > 10,917,389, which is but inconsiderably more. Wherefore it is certain and > necessary that the growth of the city must stop before the said year 1840, > and will be at its utmost height in the next preceding period, A.D. 1800, > when the number of the city will be eight times its present number, > 5,359,000. And when (besides the said number) there will be 4,466,000 to > perform the tillage, pasturage, and other rural works necessary to be done > without the said city.OF THE GROWTH OF THE CITY OF LONDON ‚Äì among the essays > downloadable at the Gutenberg link. He imagined a future in which \\"the city of London is seven times bigger than now, and that the inhabitants of it are 4,690,000 people, and that in all the other cities, ports, towns, and villages, there are but 2,710,000 more.\\" He expected this some time round 1800, extrapolating existing trends. Long before Malthus, he noticed the potential of human population to increase. But he also saw no reason why such a society should not be prosperous. Summary and legacy The above shows the contribution Petty made to theoretical issues that have dominated the later subject of economics ever since. He covered such a wide range of topics according to his political arithmetic method, i.e. like modern economists, he set out to prove his claims by finding data and statistics, rather than relying on anecdotal evidence. He wrote rigorously, but also with concision and humour. The issues that Petty thought about and wrote are major topics that have plagued the minds of economic theorists ever since. He influenced not only immediate successors such as Richard Cantillon but also some of the greatest minds in economics, including Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes. With Adam Smith, he shared a world view that believed in a harmonious natural world. The parallels in their canons of taxation epitomise their joint belief in natural liberty and equality. They both saw the benefits of specialisation and the division of labour. Furthermore, Smith and Petty developed labour theories of value, as did David Ricardo, Henry George, and Karl Marx in the 19th century. Smith said nothing about Petty in The Wealth of Nations. In his published writings, there is nothing apart for a reference in a letter to Lord Shelburne, one of Petty's aristocratic descendants.Correspondence of Adam Smith, Letter No. 30, Glasgow Edition Petty continued to exercise influence. Karl Marx thought, as did Petty, that the total effort put in by the aggregate of ordinary workers represented a far greater contribution to the economy than contemporary ideas recognised. This belief led Petty to conclude in his estimates that labour ranked as the greatest source of wealth in the kingdom. By contrast Marx's conclusions were that surplus labour was the source of all profit, and that the labourer was alienated from his surplus and thus from society. Marx's high esteem of Adam Smith is mirrored in his consideration of Petty's analysis, as witnessed by countless quotations in his major work Das Kapital. John Maynard Keynes also wrote at a time of mass discord, as unemployment was rampant and economies stagnant during the 1930s. He showed how governments could manage aggregate demand to stimulate output and employment, much as Petty had done with simpler examples in the 17th century. Petty's simple ¬£100-through-100-hands multiplier was refined by Keynes and incorporated into his model.

(2007) \\"Global pollinator decline: a literature review\\" UNEP/GRID ‚Äì Europe. Most, but not all, data used to formulate this concept comes from honeybees and bumblebees in Europe and North America. Some species are doing better than others, some are stable. Worldwide, managed honey bee populations are increasing. There is as yet no hard evidence pollinator decline exists. The theory gained currency in the media in the early 2000s and was primarily based on the problems the US honey industry was facing at the time (colony collapse disorder), and the observed decline in biodiversity in European wild bee populations. Worldwide, the bee population has been increasing steadily since 1975, based on honey production. China is responsible for most of the growth. The period of time with the lowest growth in worldwide honey production was between 1991 to 1999, this is clearly due to the economic collapse after the dissolution of communism in the former Soviet sphere of influence. As of 2020 the production has increased further by 50% compared to 2000, when people first began to publish about 'pollinator decline'. However, in the United States, due to the varroa mite, other diseases and economic conditions the managed hive industry is shrinking, increasing the service costs for the speciality crops which depend on it. In the US, wild and managed bees contribute to $15 billion in crop value. As of 2009, the amount of hives in the USA has been shrinking at a steady pace since 1961. Pollinators participate in the sexual reproduction of many plants by ensuring cross- pollination, essential for some species and a major factor in ensuring genetic diversity for others. Since plants are the primary food source for animals, the possible reduction or disappearance of pollinators has been referred to as an \\"armageddon\\" by some journalists. Evidence Colony collapse disorder has attracted much public attention. It is claimed that if bee-keepers find maintaining their hives too difficult, everyone will starve to death. According to a 2013 blog the winter losses of beehives had increased in recent years in Europe and the United States, with a hive failure rate up to 50%. A 2017 German study, using 1,500 samples from 63 sites, indicated that the biomass of flying insects in that area had declined by three-quarters in the previous 25 years. One 2009 study stated that while the bee population had increased by 45% over the past 50 years, the amount of crops which use bees had increased by 300%; although there is absolutely no evidence this has caused any problems, the authors propose it might cause \\"future pollination problems\\". In mathematical models of the networks linking different plants and their many pollinators, such a network can continue to function very well under increasingly harsh conditions, but when conditions become extremely harsh, the entire network fails simultaneously.  Possible explanations  Although there is no evidence that pollinator decline exists, a number of possible reasons for the theoretical concept have been proposed, such as exposure to pathogens, parasites, and pesticides; habitat destruction; climate change; market forces; intra- and interspecific competition with native and invasive species; and genetic alterations. Honey bees are an invasive species throughout most of the world where they have been introduced, and the constant growth in the amount of these pollinators may possibly cause a decrease in pollinators. Light pollution has been suggested a number of times as a possible reason for the possible decline in flying insects.Light pollution a reason for insect decline!? press release igb-berlin.de, 19 June 2018Artificial Lighting at Night Could be Cause of Declining Insect Populations photonics.com, 29 June 2018Insects, bats and artificial light at night: Measures to reduce the negative effects of light pollution in: dspace.library.uu.nl, retrieved 28 July 2018, author: Claudia Rieswijk (2015), Faculty of Science Theses (Master thesis), Utrecht university One study found that air pollution, such as from cars, has been inhibiting the ability of pollinators such as bees and butterflies to find the fragrances of flowers. Pollutants such as ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals bond quickly with volatile scent molecules of flowers, which consequently travel shorter distances intact. Pollinators must thus travel longer distances to find flowers. Pollinators may also face an increased risk of extinction because of global warming due to alterations in the seasonal behaviour of species. Climate change can cause bees to emerge at times in the year when flowering plants were not available.Gosden Emily (29 March 2014) Bees and the crops they pollinate are at risk from climate change, IPCC report to warn The Daily Telegraph, Retrieved 30 March 2014  Consequences  Seven out of the ten most important crops in the world, in terms of volume, are pollinated by wind (maize, rice and wheat) or have vegetative propagation (banana, sugar cane, potato, beet, and cassava) and thus do not require animal pollinators for food production. Additionally crops such as sugar beet, spinach and onions are self-pollinating and do not require insects. Nonetheless, an estimated 87.5% of the world's flowering plant species are animal-pollinated, and 60% of crop plant speciesRoubik, D.W., 1995. \\"Pollination of Cultivated Plants in the Tropics\\". In: Agricultural Services Bulletin 118. Food Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy. Pages 142‚Äì148 use animal pollinators. This includes the majority of fruits, many vegetables, and also fodder. According to the USDA 80% of insect crop pollination in the US is due to honey bees. A study which examined how fifteen plant species said to be dependent on animals for pollination would be impacted by pollinator decline, by excluding pollinators from them with domes, found that while most species do not suffer any impacts from decline in terms of reduced fertilization rates (seed set), three species did. The expected direct reduction in total agricultural production in the US in the absence of animal pollination is expected to be 3 to 8 %, with smaller impacts on agricultural production diversity. Of all the possible consequences, the most important effect of pollinator decline for humans in Brazil, according to one 2016 study, would be the drop in income from high-value cash crops, and would impact the agricultural sector the most. A 2000 study about the economic effects of the honey bee on US food crops calculated that it helped to produce US$14.6 billion in monetary value. In 2009 another study calculated the worldwide value of the 100 crops that need pollinators at ‚Ç¨153 billion (not including production costs). Despite the dire predictions, the theorised decline in pollinators has had no effect on food production, with yields of both animal- pollinated and non-animal-pollinated crops increasing at the same rate, over the period of supposed pollinator decline. = Possible nutritional consequences = A 2015 study looked at the nutritional consequences of pollinator decline. It investigated if four third world populations might in the future potentially be at possible risk of malnutrition, assuming humans did not change their diet or have access to supplements, but concluded that this cannot be reliably predicted. According to their model, the size of the effect that pollinator decline had on a population depends on the local diet, and vitamin A is the most likely nutrient to become deficient, as it is already deficient. More studies also identified vitamin A as the most pollinator-dependent nutrient. Another 2015 study also modeled what would happen should 100% of pollinators die off. In that scenario, 71 million people in low-income countries would become deficient in vitamin A, and the vitamin A intake of 2.2 billion people who are already consuming less than the recommended amount would further decline. Similarly, 173 million people would become deficient in folate, and 1.23 million people would further lessen their intake. Additionally, the global fruit supply would decrease by 22.9%, the global vegetable supply would decrease by 16.3%, and the global supply of nuts and seeds would decrease by 22.1%. This would lead to 1.42 million additional deaths each year from diseases, as well as 27 million disability-adjusted life years. In a less extreme scenario wherein only 50% of pollinators die off, 700,000 additional deaths would occur each year, as well as 13.2 million disability-adjusted years. A melon plant, a crop requiring a pollinator and a good source of vitamin A One study estimated that 70% of dietary vitamin A worldwide is found in crops that are animal pollinated, as well as 55% of folate. At present, eating plants which are pollinated by animals is responsible for only 9%, 20%, and 29% of calcium, fluoride, and iron intake, respectively, with most coming from meat and dairy. 74% of all globally produced lipids are found in oils from plants that are animal pollinated, as well as 98% of vitamin C.  Solutions  Efforts are being made to sustain pollinator diversity in agricultural and natural ecosystems by some environmental groups. In 2014 the Obama administration published \\"the Economic Challenge Posed by Declining Pollinator Populations\\" fact sheet, which stated that the 2015 budget proposal recommended congress appropriate approximately $50 million for pollinator habitat maintenance and to double the area in the Conservation Reserve Program dedicated to pollinator health, as well as recommending to \\"increase funding for surveys to determine the impacts on pollinator losses\\". Some international initiatives highlight the need for public participation and awareness of pollinator conservation. Pollinators and their health have become growing concerns for the public. Around 18 states within America have responded to these concerns by creating legislation to address the issue. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the enacted legislation in those states addresses five specific areas relating to pollinator decline: awareness, research, pesticides, habitat protection and beekeeping.

Zhang Liang ( 3rd century BC ‚Äì 186 BC), courtesy name Zifang, was a strategist and statesman who lived in the early Western Han dynasty. He is also known as one of the \\"Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty\\" (), along with Han Xin () and Xiao He. Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the establishment of the Han dynasty. After his death, he was honoured with the posthumous title \\"Marquis Wencheng\\" by Emperor Qianshao. Early life Zhang Liang was born in Xinzheng (Êñ∞ÈÑ≠; present-day Zhengzhou, Henan), the capital of the H√°n state(), while his ancestral home was in Chengfu (ÂüéÁà∂; present-day Chengfu Town, Bozhou, Anhui). He descended from an aristocrat family in H√°n. His grandfather served three generations of the H√°n rulers as chancellors while his father served two generations. Zhang Liang missed the opportunity to inherit his family's legacy as the H√°n state was annexed by the Qin state in 230 BC as part of Qin's wars of unification. Becoming a Fugitive =Assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang= To avenge the fall of his native state, Zhang Liang dedicated his efforts to hiring assassins to kill the Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang. He spent his entire family fortune and failed to give his deceased younger brother a proper funeral. He managed to find a man with great physical strength to help him, and had an iron hammer weighing 120 ancient catties (roughly 160 lbs. or 72 kg) forged for the strongman. In 218 BC, Zhang Liang heard that Qin Shi Huang was going to Yangwu County (east of present-day Yuanyang County, Henan) as part of his inspection tour, and was due to pass by Bolangsha during the journey. Zhang Liang and the strongman lay in ambush at Bolangsha and waited for the emperor's convoy to approach. They saw that all the carriages that passed by were pulled by four horsesAccording to the rites of the Qin dynasty, only the emperor's carriage would be pulled by six horses. The carriages of the emperor's subjects would be pulled by four horses. Zhang Liang was aware of that and he confirmed that the carriage pulled by six horses was the one carrying the emperor. and believed that the most decorated one in the middle was the emperor's carriage. The strongman hurled the hammer towards it and the heavy projectile crushed the carriage, killing its occupant. Zhang Liang fled from the scene during the ensuing chaos. Qin Shi Huang was actually not in that carriage and survived the assassination attempt, after which he ordered the arrest of Zhang Liang. Zhang Liang eluded the dragnet for ten days by using fake identities and becoming a fugitive. =Meeting Huang Shigong= An illustration of Zhang Liang putting Huang Shigong's shoe back on at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing. As a wanted man by the government, Zhang Liang travelled to Xiapi and stayed there for some time, using fake identities to evade the authorities. One day, Zhang Liang took a stroll at Yishui Bridge and met an old man there. The man walked towards Zhang Liang and chucked his shoe down the bridge on purpose, after which he yelled at Zhang, \\"Hey boy, go down and fetch me my shoe!\\" Zhang Liang was astonished and unhappy but obeyed silently. The old man then lifted his foot and ordered Zhang Liang to put on the shoe for him. Zhang Liang was furious but he controlled his temper and meekly obliged. The man did not show any sign of gratitude and walked away laughing. The old man came back after walking a distance and praised Zhang Liang, \\"This child can be taught!\\"(Â≠∫Â≠êÂèØÊïôÁü£!) and asked Zhang Liang to meet him at the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, \\"How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!\\" Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, \\"You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I'm the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng.\\" The old man was Huang Shigong (ÈªÉÁü≥ÂÖ¨; lit. \\"Yellow Rock Old Man\\") . The book was titled The Art of War by Taigong () and believed to be the Six Secret Teachings by Jiang Ziya, while some called it Three Strategies of Huang Shigong. In legend, Zhang Liang returned to the indicated site 13 years later and did see a yellow rock there. He built a shrine to worship the rock and the rock was buried with him after his death. Rebelling against the Qin dynasty In 209 BC, during the reign of Qin Er Shi, several uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Many of these rebel forces claimed to be restoring the former states that were annexed by Qin two decades ago. Zhang Liang rallied about 100 men to start a rebellion as well, but his force was too weak, so he led his followers to join Jing Ju, a pretender to the throne of the former Chu state. He met Liu Bang during his journey and was impressed with Liu's charisma that he changed his decision and joined Liu instead. Zhang Liang became a temporary advisor to Liu Bang and followed Liu to join Xiang Liang's rebel force. The following year, Xiang Liang installed Mi Xin as King Huai II of Chu after eliminating Jing Ju. Zhang Liang's main goal was to reestablish his native state of H√°n, so he managed to persuade Xiang Liang to do the same for the H√°n state. Han Cheng, a descendant of the royal family of H√°n, was enthroned as King of H√°n, while Zhang Liang was appointed as the H√°n's chancellor. Han Cheng's armies attempted to capture Qin cities that were formerly H√°n territories but did not achieve much success and engaged in guerrilla warfare for about a year. Later that year, Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao and King Huai II put Xiang Yu (Xiang Liang's nephew) and Liu Bang each in charge of an army to attack Qin, promising that whoever entered Guanzhong (heartland of Qin) first would be conferred the title of \\"King of Guanzhong\\". In 207 BC, the combined forces of Liu Bang and Han Cheng conquered Yangzhai (present-day Yuzhou City, Henan), the former capital of the H√°n state. Han Cheng stayed behind to defend Yangzhai, while Zhang Liang served as a temporary advisor to Liu Bang. Zhang Liang contributed to Liu Bang's eventual victory in the race to Guanzhong for the strategies he proposed. For example, at the battle of Yao Pass, Zhang Liang suggested tricking the Qin commander into surrendering by bribing him with gifts. Liu Bang wanted to accept the surrendered Qin troops into his army but Zhang Liang cautioned him, saying that some of the troops were unwilling to surrender even though their commander agreed. That night, Liu Bang's forces caught the Qin army off guard and scored a major victory. In another incident, Zhang Liang warned Liu Bang against making a detour at Wancheng, because they would be at risk of being surrounded by the enemy if Liu did so. Chu‚ÄìHan Contention =Feast at Hong Gate= Upon entering the Epang Palace in Xianyang (the Qin capital), Liu Bang was strongly tempted by the riches it housed and wanted to stay there forever. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang about overindulgence in sensual pleasures and Liu ordered his men to seal the treasures and move to Bashang to wait for Xiang Yu and the other rebel forces to arrive. During this period of time, Liu Bang heeded Zhang Liang's advice and governed Guanzhong with benevolence, restoring peace and stability, and forbidding his men from pillaging the cities and harming the common people. In 206 BC, Xiang Yu's army arrived at Hangu Pass (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered his men to prevent Xiang's forces from entering Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by Fan Zeng and a defector from Liu's side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu's uncle, Xiang Bo, was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang was shocked and fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the Feast at Hong Gate hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang's suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu's cousin Xiang Zhuang to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang's life. Meanwhile, Zhang Liang left the tent to find Fan Kuai to save Liu Bang. Following Zhang Liang's instructions, Fan Kuai burst in and openly chided Xiang Yu, making a speech about Liu Bang's accomplishments and affirming that Liu had no intention of opposing Xiang Yu. Liu Bang left the banquet later on the pretext of going to the latrine and was received by Xiahou Ying, who had been waiting nearby on Zhang Liang's instruction. Zhang Liang remained behind to hold Xiang Yu's attention while Liu Bang escaped. Before leaving, Zhang Liang presented Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng with a pair of jade pieces. =Eighteen Kingdoms= Xiang Yu split the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms later, granting the land of Guanzhong to three surrendered Qin generals, even though Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to King Huai II's earlier promise. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day Sichuan) instead and granted the title of \\"King of Han\\". Han Cheng retained his rulership as King of H√°n and Zhang Liang was moved from Liu Bang's side back to H√°n to continue serving as chancellor. Before parting ways, Liu Bang presented Zhang Liang with some gold and pearls, all of which Zhang gave to Xiang Bo. Zhang Liang also urged Liu Bang to destroy the gallery roads leading to Bashu during the journey to Hanzhong, in order to reduce Xiang Yu's suspicions that Liu was planning to return and challenge him. Although Han Cheng was the king of H√°n, Xiang Yu did not permit him to govern his kingdom and forced him to accompany him back to his Western Chu's capital of Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu). Han Cheng was demoted to \\"Marquis of Rang\\" later and killed on Xiang Yu's orders. Xiang Yu seized Han Cheng's kingdom and made his subordinate Zheng Chang the new King of H√°n. Zhang Liang was still the chancellor of H√°n under the new arrangement but he was aware of his precarious position, and cognisant of how Xiang Yu had destroyed his hope of restoring the H√°n state. Zhang Liang fled from H√°n later and returned to join Liu Bang in the winter of 206 BC. Liu Bang conferred on Zhang Liang the title of \\"Marquis of Chengxin\\" and Zhang became a permanent advisor to Liu from that time. =Conquest of the Three Qin and Battle of Pengcheng= Starting in 206 BC, after Liu Bang's forces conquered the Three Qins, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu engaged in a four-year-long power struggle for supremacy over China, historically known as the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention. In 205 BC, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the Battle of Pengcheng and he retreated to Xiayi. Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the \\"Xiayi Plan\\" (). Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice: he sent Xiao He to persuade Ying Bu to join him; contacted Peng Yue and allied with him; and allowed Han Xin to lead part of his army to attack other territories on the northern front. In 204 BC, Liu Bang was trapped by Xiang Yu in Xingyang and both sides reached a stalemate. Li Yiji suggested to Liu Bang to recreate the former states of the Warring States period and install the descendants of their royal families on their respective thrones. This plan was intended to help Liu Bang gain the support of the vassal states' rulers, who would help him in the war against Xiang Yu. However, Zhang Liang disapproved of the plan as he felt that the states were more likely to support Western Chu instead as Chu was superior to Han in terms of military might. Liu Bang realised the problem and immediately dismissed Li Yiji's plan. In 203 BC, after his victory at the Battle of Wei River, Han Xin conquered the Qi kingdom and sent a messenger to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu appoint him as the acting King of Qi. Liu was still trapped at Xingyang then and he was furious after hearing the request because he was expecting Han Xin to come to his aid. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang that if he refused to approve Han Xin's request, Han might be discontented and declare independence from Liu, putting them in a dangerous situation. Liu Bang reluctantly agreed and sent Zhang Liang to pass the king's seal to Han Xin. Zhang Liang met Han Xin and succeeded in reaffirming Han's loyalty to Liu Bang. =Battle of Gaixia= By late 203 BC, Zhang Liang saw that the tide had turned in favour of Liu Bang, as Xiang Yu had been surrounded on three sides. Together with Chen Ping, Zhang Liang suggested to Liu Bang to renounce the Treaty of Hong Canal and use the opportunity to eliminate Western Chu. However, at the Battle of Guling, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu because the expected reinforcements from Han Xin and Peng Yue did not arrive. Zhang Liang explained to Liu Bang that Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops because they did not have their fiefs yet, even though they had received their titles of vassal kings. Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice and granted lands to Han Xin and Peng Yue. Two months later, as Zhang Liang predicted, Han Xin and Peng Yue arrived with their armies and formed a coordinated attack on Western Chu together with Liu Bang's force, defeating Xiang Yu at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC. In service during the Han dynasty In 202 BC, after his victory over Xiang Yu, Liu Bang ascended the throne and became historically known as \\"Emperor Gaozu of Han\\". Following the establishment of the Han dynasty, Zhang Liang remained as a key advisor to Gaozu even though he did not receive any formal appointment as a government minister. Together with Lou Jing, Zhang Liang later suggested for Gaozu to build his capital in Chang'an instead of Luoyang, as Chang'an was in a more strategic position than Luoyang (fertile land and surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes). Once, Gaozu noticed that some of his subjects were having a secret discussion and he asked for Zhang Liang's opinion. Zhang Liang told Gaozu that they were plotting a rebellion and Gaozu was shocked. Zhang Liang proceeded to ask Gaozu whom of all his subjects he hated the most. Gaozu mentioned Yong Chi, who had rebelled against him before but surrendered later. Zhang Liang then suggested to Gaozu to grant Yong Chi a noble title, because if the others saw that Gaozu was able to forgive Yong Chi, they would be at ease and would not think of rebelling. Subsequently, Zhang Liang retired from state affairs and practised Taoism. In late 201 BC, Gaozu rewarded his subjects who contributed to the dynasty's founding and he conferred the title of \\"Marquis of Liu\\" on Zhang Liang. In 196 BC, Gaozu left to suppress a rebellion by Ying Bu, and requested Zhang Liang to come out of retirement to assist the crown prince, Liu Ying, in governing the home territories. After returning from the campaign, Gaozu wanted to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi, the Prince of Zhao. Zhang Liang opposed Gaozu's decision but Gaozu ignored him so Zhang feigned illness and retired again. When approached by Empress L√º Zhi to help Liu Ying retain his position, Zhang Liang recommended the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang to help Liu Ying, and the four men succeeded in convincing Gaozu to keep Liu Ying as the crown prince. Zhang Liang remained in retirement until his death in 186 BC. Death and burial place The Zhang Liang Tomb in Zhangjiajie, Hunan. Little is known about Zhang Liang's later life, hence his final resting place has been a mystery throughout history. A Zhang Liang Tomb stands at 6 km southwest of present-day Lankao County, Henan. According to legend, during the L√º Clan Disturbance, Zhang Liang moved to Mount Baiyun at the southwest of Donghun County (present- day Lankao County, Henan), and was buried there after his death. A Zhang Liang Temple used to stand beside the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Another Zhang Liang Tomb stands at south of Weishan County, Shandong. The stone tablet in front of the grave bearing Zhang Liang's name was erected in 1737 during the Qing dynasty. A Zhang Liang Shrine also used to stand east of the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. However, some believed that Zhang Liang's tomb was in present-day Pei County, Xuzhou. According to the 7th-century gazetteer Kuodi Zhi, Zhang Liang's tomb was 65 li east of Pei County, near Liucheng, where a Zhang Liang Temple was also located. According to Xianshizhi () and Lingmuzhi (), Zhang Liang's tomb was at Mount Qingyan in Hunan. Modern references An article in Xianzhuan Shiyi () tells the story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal. Âº†ËâØ ‰øÆÁÇºÊàê‰ªôÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã (The story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal) Zhang Liang practised some of the book's teachings and attained some magical powers. Zhang Liang was buried at Dragon Head Plains () after his death. In legend, Zhang Liang's tomb was raided when the Red Brows Army revolted, and the robbers saw a yellow stone pillow inside his tomb. The pillow transformed swiftly and flew away like a shooting star, and nothing else was found in the tomb, not even Zhang Liang's body. Zhang Liang became an immortal and served Laozi as an assistant. Zhang Liang's grandson, Zhang Daoling, became an immortal, too, and he went with his grandfather to meet the Queen Mother of the West on Mount Kunlun. Zhang Liang's encounter with Huang Shigong had also become one of the classic Chinese folk tales about humility for later generations to learn from. Zhang Liang is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei. He has higher intelligence stats than all these characters, except for Jiang Ziya. Zhang Liang is also a playable character of the \\"Wizard\\" class in the action RPG Prince of Qin. He also appears as a character in the animation series The Legend of Qin. References *Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 55. *Ban Gu et al. Book of Han, Volume 40. *Sima Guang.

He reigned from 28 September 189 until 11 December 220. Liu Xie was a son of Liu Hong (Emperor Ling) and was a younger half-brother of his predecessor, Liu Bian (Emperor Shao). In 189, at the age of eight, he became emperor after the warlord Dong Zhuo, who had seized control of the Han central government, deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with Liu Xie. The newly enthroned Liu Xie, historically known as Emperor Xian, was in fact a puppet ruler under Dong Zhuo's control. In 190, when a coalition of regional warlords launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of freeing Emperor Xian, Dong Zhuo ordered the destruction of the imperial capital, Luoyang, and forcefully relocated the imperial capital along with its residents to Chang'an. After Dong Zhuo's assassination in 192, Emperor Xian fell under the control of Li Jue and Guo Si, two former subordinates of Dong Zhuo. The various regional warlords formally acknowledged Emperor Xian's legitimacy but never took action to save him from being held hostage. In 195, Emperor Xian managed to escape from Chang'an and return to the ruins of Luoyang during a feud between Li Jue and Guo Si, where he soon became stranded. A year later, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang, received Emperor Xian, took him under his protection, and escorted him to Xu, where the new imperial capital was established. Although Cao Cao paid nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian, he was actually the de facto head of the central government. He skillfully used Emperor Xian as a \\"trump card\\" to bolster his legitimacy when he attacked and eliminated rival warlords in his quest to reunify the Han Empire under the central government's rule. Cao Cao's success seemed inevitable until the winter of 208‚Äì209, when he lost the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs against the southern warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The battle paved the way for the subsequent emergence of the Three Kingdoms later of Wei, Shu and Wu. In late 220, some months after Cao Cao's death, Cao Cao's successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. He then established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor ‚Äì an event marking the formal end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. The dethroned Emperor Xian received the noble title Duke of Shanyang () from Cao Pi and spent the rest of his life in comfort and enjoyed preferential treatment. He died on 21 April 234, about 14 years after the fall of the Han dynasty. Family background Liu Xie was born in 181 to Emperor Ling and his Consort Wang. During her pregnancy, Consort Wang, fearful of Emperor Ling's Empress He, had taken drugs that were intended to induce an abortion, but was not successful in her attempt. Soon after she gave birth to Liu Xie, the jealous Empress He poisoned her by putting poison in her food. Emperor Ling was enraged and wanted to depose her, but the eunuchs pleaded on her behalf, and she was not deposed. Liu Xie was raised personally by Emperor Ling's mother Empress Dowager Dong and known by the circumspect title \\"Marquis Dong\\". (This is due to superstition; Emperor Ling had lost a number of sons previously, and therefore both Liu Xie and his elder brother Liu Bian were known by such titles; Liu Bian, having been raised by Shi Zimiao (), was known as \\"Marquis Shi\\"). Liu Bian was born of the empress and was older, but Emperor Ling viewed his behaviour as being insufficiently solemn and therefore considered appointing Liu Xie as his crown prince, but hesitated and could not decide. When Emperor Ling died in 189, an influential eunuch official whom he trusted, Jian Shuo, wanted to first kill Empress He's brother, General-in- Chief He Jin, and then install Liu Xie on the throne, and therefore set up a trap at a meeting he was to have with He Jin. He Jin found out, and preemptively declared Liu Bian the new emperor. Later that year, Emperor Shao granted Liu Xie the title \\"Prince of Bohai\\" () and later changed his title to \\"Prince of Chenliu\\" (). Accession to the throne and collapse of the Han dynasty =Rise of Dong Zhuo= After Liu Bian became emperor, He Jin became the most powerful official in the imperial court, and he and his advisor Yuan Shao quickly entered into a conspiracy to exterminate the eunuchs. They were, however, rebuffed by Empress Dowager He, and they hatched the plan to secretly order a number of warlords to advance on the capital Luoyang to force Empress Dowager He to agree to their demands. One of these warlords was Dong Zhuo, who saw this as an opportunity to control the central government. He Jin's plan was discovered by the eunuchs, who laid a trap for him and killed him. Yuan Shao then led his forces into the palace and killed the majority of the eunuchs. The remaining eunuchs initially took the young emperor and Liu Xie hostage, but were eventually forced to commit suicide when the battle turned against them. When Dong Zhuo then arrived on scene, he, impressed with his own power and unimpressed with the nervous Emperor Shao, forced the young emperor to yield the throne to Liu Xie (partly because he was raised by Empress Dowager Dong who, while not related to Dong Zhuo, was therefore respected by Dong Zhuo), who then ascended the throne as Emperor Xian. Dong Zhuo then murdered Empress Dowager He and the former Emperor Shao, and became firmly in control of the political scene. =Forced relocation west and the death of Dong Zhuo= Chariots and cavalry, detail of a mural from the Dahuting Tomb (ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Êº¢Â¢ì) of the late Eastern Han dynasty, located in Zhengzhou, Henan. In the spring of 190, a number of local officials, loosely forming a coalition led by Yuan Shao, quickly rose up against Dong Zhuo. Even though they still feared Dong Zhuo's military power and did not directly advance on Luoyang, Dong Zhuo was also fearful of their collective strength, and therefore determined to move the capital west to the old Han capital Chang'an, closer to his power base in Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û; covering present-day Gansu). On 9 April 190, he forced Emperor Xian to relocate to Chang'an and set fire to Luoyang, leaving it largely in ruins. After the revolting coalition collapsed, a number of officials, led by Wang Yun and L√º Bu, assassinated Dong on 22 May 192. For a while, it appeared that the Han regime might return to normal, as Wang Yun quickly established relatively friendly relations with the local officials resisting Dong but by this time acting more as local warlords. However, due to Wang Yun's failure to pacify Dong Zhuo's former subordinates, they rose in revolt and killed Wang. =Return to Luoyang's ruins= Detail of a banquet scene, mural from the Dahuting Tomb (ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Êº¢Â¢ì) of the late Eastern Han dynasty, located in Zhengzhou, Henan. Dong Zhuo's former subordinates, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, took Emperor Xian and the imperial court under their control. However, Li Jue and Guo Si did not have serious ambitions, and their incompetence in governance furthered the breakdown of the Han Empire into warlord regimes. In 195, Li Jue and Guo Si had a major fallout, and Li took Emperor Xian hostage while Guo took the officials hostage as they battled. Later in the year, after peace talks between Li Jue and Guo Si, they agreed to allow Emperor Xian to return to Luoyang, but as soon as Emperor Xian departed Chang'an, they regretted their decision and chased him with their troops. While they were never able to capture him, Emperor Xian's court was rendered poor and unable to fend for itself, and once it returned to Luoyang, it lacked even the basic essentials of life. Many officials starved to death. At this time, Yuan Shao's strategist Ju Shou suggested that he welcome Emperor Xian to his base in Ji Province so that he could effectively be in control of the central government, but the other strategists Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed ‚Äî under the faulty logic that if he did, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao listened to Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong and never again considered welcoming Emperor Xian. =Tight control by Cao Cao= What Yuan Shao would not do, Cao Cao did. Cao Cao was at this time a relatively minor warlord, as the governor of Yan Province (covering present-day western Shandong and eastern Henan), with his headquarters at Xu (present-day Xuchang, Henan). He saw the strategic advantage in having the emperor under his control and protection, and in 196 he marched west to Luoyang and, after securing an agreement with Emperor Xian's generals Dong Cheng and Yang Feng, convincing them of his loyalty, he entered Luoyang and technically shared power with Dong and Yang, but was in fact in command. Unlike the situation with Dong Zhuo, though, Cao Cao knew how to assuage the other generals and nobles, and while he gave them little power, he made sure that they remained honoured, so minimal opposition against him developed at the imperial court. He then moved the capital to Xu to affirm his control over the central government, and when Yang Feng opposed him, he defeated Yang and was able to move the capital. Cao Cao then began to issue imperial edicts in Emperor Xian's name ‚Äî including a harshly-worded edict condemning Yuan Shao for taking over nearby provinces ‚Äî even though it still bestowed Yuan with the highly honorific post of Grand Commandant. Cao Cao and Emperor Xian maintained a superficially cordial relationship, but this did not prevent two major confrontations involving Cao and other court officials. The arrest of Consort Dong with Emperor Xian helpless in the background, from a Qing dynasty illustration of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In early 199, as Cao Cao was facing a major military confrontation against Yuan Shao, Dong Cheng claimed to have received a secret edict issued by Emperor Xian (hidden in a belt), and he entered into a conspiracy with Liu Bei, Zhong Ji () and Wang Fu () to assassinate Cao Cao. Late in 199, Liu Bei started a rebellion and waited for Dong Cheng to act in the capital, but in 200, Dong's conspiracy was discovered, and he, along with Zhong Ji and Wang Fu, were killed. Liu Bei was later defeated by Cao Cao and forced to flee to Yuan Shao's territory. Dong Cheng's daughter, an imperial consort, was pregnant, and Emperor Xian personally tried to intercede for her, but Cao Cao had her executed anyway. Emperor Xian's empress, Fu Shou, angry and fearful about how Consort Dong died, wrote her father, Fu Wan (), a letter accusing Cao Cao of cruelty, and implicitly asking her father to start a new conspiracy against Cao. Fu Wan was fearful of Cao Cao and never acted on the letter, in 214, her letter was discovered. Cao Cao was extremely angry and forced Emperor Xian to have Empress Fu deposed. Emperor Xian was hesitant, and Cao Cao sent his soldiers into the palace to put pressure on the emperor. Empress Fu hid inside the walls, but was finally discovered and dragged out. As she was led away, she cried out to Emperor Xian for him to save her life, but his only response was that he could not even know what would happen to him. She was killed, along with her two sons and family. Cao Cao soon forced Emperor Xian to instate his daughter Cao Jie, then an imperial consort, as the new empress. Abdication and death Cao Cao died on 15 March 220. His son and successor, Cao Pi, soon forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne in favour of himself, ending the Han dynasty. Cao Pi established a new state known as Cao Wei (sometimes known inaccurately as the Kingdom of Wei), and he granted Emperor Xian a noble title ‚Äì Duke of Shanyang (). The former Emperor Xian died in 234 and was buried with honours befitting an emperor, using Han ceremonies, and the then emperor of Wei, Cao Rui, was one of the mourners. As Emperor Xian's crown prince was already dead, his grandson Liu Kang () inherited his dukedom, which lasted for 75 more years and two more dukes, Liu Jin () and Liu Qiu (), until the line was exterminated by invading Xiongnu tribes in about 309, during the Jin dynasty. This practice of an emperor conferring hereditary nobility on his predecessor, from whom he usurped the throne, was known as er wang san ke (‰∫åÁéã‰∏âÊÅ™).

He was vice president of Bolivia from August 2002 to October 2003. Mesa previously had been a television journalist. His widespread recognition prompted the MNR candidate Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada to pick him as running mate in the 2002 Bolivian presidential elections. The winning ticket of S√°nchez-Mesa took office August 6, 2002.Vicepresidency of Bolivia Soon after becoming vice president, a wave of protests and strikes shut down Bolivia in a bitter dispute known as the Bolivian Gas War. The demonstrations eventually forced S√°nchez de Lozada to resign, which put forward Mesa as president. Mesa was a spokesman for Bolivia in the Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean case in the International Court of Justice, which was ultimately unsuccessful.Bolivia seeks to improve its international image El Pa√≠s 17 December 2004 Mesa is a member of the Inter- American Dialogue.  Early life = Family = He is the son of an architect and historian: Jos√© de Mesa and Teresa Gisbert. =Education= He grew up in La Paz, Bolivia. He enrolled in San Estaniis-lao de Kotska in Madrid. In 1971, He studied Literature in Las Universidades Complutense de Madrid. He entered the department of Political Science in the University of Madrid. Three years later, he returned to his native La Paz, and joined the Language and Literature Department of the University of San Andres.  Career  In 1969, Carlos Mesa was a radio intern at Universo de La Paz, where he made his debut as a journalist. He later developed two radio programs M√©ndez (1974) and Metropolitana (1976) = Vice-president of Bolivia (2002-2003) = His widespread recognition prompted the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) candidate Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada to pick him as running mate in the 2002 Bolivian presidential elections. The winning ticket of S√°nchez-Mesa took office August 6, 2002.Vicepresidency of Bolivia As vice president, Carlos Mesa also was the leader of Congress of Bolivia. Soon after becoming vice president, a wave of protests and strikes shut down Bolivia in a bitter dispute known as the Bolivian Gas War. As the gas conflict escalated, Mesa ended discontent with the government's heavy-handed repression of the protests, which would leave over 60 people dead during September and October 2003. He did not resign, but he did withdraw his support for S√°nchez de Lozada five days before the latter's resignation, saying: \\"I cannot continue to support the situation we are living through\\". Mesa also resigned his membership to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement. In September 2003, he addressed the UN General Assembly, where he warned: > Democracy is in danger in Bolivia as the result of legitimate pressures from > the poor. We cannot generate economic growth and well-being for a few and > then expect that the large majorities that are excluded will watch silently > and patiently. We poor countries demand that our products be admitted into > the markets of rich countries in adequate > conditions.http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031017/API/310171127&cachetime;=5 = Presidency (2003‚Äì2005) = On 17 October 2003 S√°nchez de Lozada resigned and fled to the United States of America. Mesa thus assumed functions as President of Bolivia. Eight months after assuming office, Mesa found himself, like President Sanchez de Lozada, under the same extreme internal and external political pressures over the use of Bolivia's 1.5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas reserves, estimated to be worth billions of dollars (USD). It also placed him at the center of extreme political pressures from both internal Bolivian and external foreign interests regarding the use of Bolivia's rates and the property of the gas reserves for the Bolivian state. In addition, in January 2004, he announced that his government would hold a series of rallies around the country and at its embassies abroad, demanding that Chile return to Bolivia a stretch of seacoast that the country lost in 1879 after the end of the War of the Pacific. Chile has traditionally refused to negotiate on the issue, but Mesa nonetheless made this policy a central point of his administration seeking the popular support he lacked. In July 2004, under pressure from the Movement for Socialism (MAS) of the peasant trade unionist Evo Morales, he organised a \\"gas referendum\\" during which the majority of the population voted for the nationalisation of hydrocarbons. Faced with opposition from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and multinationals, he declared that this law was \\"impossible\\" to implement.http://risal.collectifs.net/spip.php?page=imprimer&id;_article=1485#nh11 Following a resurgence in protests, he tendered his resignation to congress on March 6, 2005; however, the legislators voted almost unanimously the next day to reject his offer. Still, domestic tensions between the poor and rural eastern highlands and the wealthier cities and oil-rich south continued to rise. Weeks of escalating street demonstrations and widening disorder reached a peak in June 2005 as tens of thousands of protesters marched into La Paz. Aware of his growing inability to control or influence events without resorting to violence, Mesa tendered his resignation to congress. This time, congress unanimously accepted his offer. The presidents of the two national legislative chambers at that point abdicated their constitutional powers in favor of Eduardo Rodr√≠guez, the chief justice of the Supreme Court and new president of Bolivia. He was charged with the duty of swiftly organizing national elections, which led to the massive victory of MAS candidate Evo Morales in December 2005. Later, Evo Morales's government accused Carlos Mesa for economic damages to the country interests. =Bolivian spokesman before the ICJ= Leaving behind previous animosity, Morales agreed with Mesa that the latter would be the Bolivian spokesman in the case against Chile presented to the International Court of Justice. = Return to politics = On 6 October 2018 Mesa Gisbert joined the Revolutionary Left Front (FRI) and announced on his YouTube channel that he would run for president in the 2019 election. On 13 November 2018 the FRI formed with Sovereignty and Freedom the Civic Community coalition to support Mesa's bid for presidency. His candidacy was also externally supported by the National Unity Front. The election saw the victory of incumbent President Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism; however, the election was alleged to be marred by fraud and controversy, triggering protests and strikes by the opposition. Following two weeks of protests and under increasing pressure from the Armed Forces of Bolivia, Morales resigned along with Vice-President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera, President of the Senate Adriana Salvatierra, President of the Chamber of Deputies V√≠ctor Borda and First Vice-President of the Senate Rub√©n Medinaceli. Second Vice- President of the Senate Jeanine √Å√±ez assumed functions as acting President of Bolivia. Mesa recognised √Å√±ez as the legitimate President and announced he would run again in the 2020 election. With the right-wing parties divided between multiple candidates, Mesa held a consistent second place behind the front runner Luis Arce, the MAS candidate, in opinion polling. Despite hopes of a one-on-one race between the two in a November runoff, a quick-count of the vote conducted by polling firm Ciesmori on the morning of 19 October indicated that Arce had won 52.4% of the vote, enough to win the election outright. Mesa conceded the election later the same day writing on Twitter ‚ÄúI give a very heartfelt thanks to the Bolivians who voted for CC [Comunidad Ciudadana]. And to the Bolivian people for their democratic commitment. To the militants and directors of CC, to our allies: FRI, People First and Chuquisaca Somos Todos. It is our turn to be the head of the opposition.

Etymology The English name refers to the long hind claws. The genus name Calcarius is from Latin calcaria, \\"spurs\\", and the specific lapponicus refers to Lapland. Description The Lapland longspur is a robust bird, with a thick yellow seed-eater's bill. The summer male has a black head and throat, white eyestripe, chestnut nape, white underparts, and a heavily streaked black-grey back. Other plumages have a plainer orange-brown head, a browner back and chestnut nape and wing panels. Measurements: * Length: 5.9-6.3 in (15-16 cm) * Weight: 0.8-1.2 oz (22.3-33.1 g) * Wingspan: 8.7-11.4 in (22-29 cm) Distribution and habitat It breeds across Arctic Europe and the Palearctic and in Canada and the northernmost United States. It is migratory, wintering in the Russian steppes, the southern United States, Northern Scandinavian arctic areas and down to coastal Southern Sweden, Denmark and Great Britain. This is the only Asian species of the longspur buntings, and while it probably did not evolve there, it has been present in Eastern Europe for at least about 30,000 years. Behaviour =Call= The most common flight call is a hard \\"prrrrt\\" usually preceded by a more nasal \\"teeww\\". When breeding, it also makes a softer \\"duyyeee\\" followed by a pause and a \\"triiiuuu\\"; both sounds alternate. =Breeding= It breeds in wet areas with birch or willow, and or bare mountains, and winters on cultivated land or coasts. The bird is often seen close to the tree line, and likes to feed in mixed-species flocks in winter. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. The nest is on the ground. 2‚Äì4 eggs are laid. =Food habits= Sitting on a dead cow parsnip, Buldir Island, Alaska The food habits of the Lapland longspur are quite simple: mostly seeds in winter and arthropods in the summer, when they are in activity. During the winter, the longspur feeds on seeds. They pick them on the ground, rarely feeding directly on plants. They will forage around the same area for a period varying between a few minutes and an hour, then fly away looking for a new foraging area. Their seed diet is composed mainly of seeds from grass, foxtail, cultivated millet, crabgrass and wheat. During the breeding season, the birds migrate to the north, where their diet switches to arthropods. Nestlings are only fed arthropods, which also constitute the diet of the parents at that time of the year (June to July). The birds often catch insects in mid-air, but do forage through vegetation when climatic conditions prevent the insects from flying. Longspurs can consume between 3000 and 10,000 prey items (insects or seeds) per day, depending on their energy needs. Dipteran larvae and adults form the major part of their insectivorous diet.

(subsets of a common set X) is a set whose elements are determined by the sequence in either of two equivalent ways: (1) by upper and lower bounds on the sequence that converge monotonically to the same set (analogous to convergence of real- valued sequences) and (2) by convergence of a sequence of indicator functions which are themselves real-valued. As is the case with sequences of other objects, convergence is not necessary or even usual. More generally, again analogous to real-valued sequences, the less restrictive limit infimum and limit supremum of a set sequence always exist and can be used to determine convergence: the limit exists if the limit infimum and limit supremum are identical. (See below). Such set limits are essential in measure theory and probability. It is a common misconception that the limits infimum and supremum described here involve sets of accumulation points, that is, sets of x = limk->‚àûxk, where each xk is in some Ank. This is only true if convergence is determined by the discrete metric (that is, xn -> x if there is N such that xn = x for all n ‚â• N). This article is restricted to that situation as it is the only one relevant for measure theory and probability. See the examples below. (On the other hand, there are more general topological notions of set convergence that do involve accumulation points under different metrics or topologies.) Definitions =The two definitions= Suppose that \\\\\\\\{A_n\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^\\\\infty is a sequence of sets. The two equivalent definitions are as follows. *Using union and intersection, define :: \\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\ge 1} \\\\bigcap_{j \\\\geq n} A_j :and :: \\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcap_{n \\\\ge 1} \\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq n} A_j :If these two sets are equal, then the set-theoretic limit of the sequence An exists and is equal to that common set. Either set as described above can be used to get the limit, and there may be other means to get the limit as well. *Using indicator functions, let 1An(x) equal 1 if x is in An and 0 otherwise. Define :: \\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X: \\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}(x) = 1 \\\\\\\\} :and :: \\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X: \\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}(x) = 1 \\\\\\\\}, :where the expressions inside the brackets on the right are, respectively, the limit infimum and limit supremum of the real-valued sequence 1An(x). Again, if these two sets are equal, then the set-theoretic limit of the sequence An exists and is equal to that common set, and either set as described above can be used to get the limit. To see the equivalence of the definitions, consider the limit infimum. The use of DeMorgan's rule below explains why this suffices for the limit supremum. Since indicator functions take only values 0 and 1, if and only if 1An(x) takes value 0 only finitely many times. Equivalently, \\\\scriptstyle x\\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\ge 1}\\\\ \\\\bigcap_{j \\\\ge n} A_jif and only if there exists n such that the element is in Am for every m ‚â• n, which is to say if and only if x ‚àâ An for only finitely many n. Therefore, x is in the iff x is in all except finitely many An. For this reason, a shorthand phrase for the limit infimum is \\"x ‚àà An all except finitely often\\" (or \\"x ‚àà An all but finitely often\\"), typically expressed by \\"An a.e.f.o.\\" (or by \\"An a.b.f.o.\\"). Similarly, an element x is in the limit supremum if, no matter how large n is there exists m ‚â• n such that the element is in Am. That is, x is in the limit supremum iff x is in infinitely many An. For this reason, a shorthand phrase for the limit supremum is \\"x ‚àà An infinitely often\\", typically expressed by \\"An i.o.\\". To put it another way, the limit infimum consists of elements that \\"eventually stay forever\\" (are in each set after some n), while the limit supremum consists of elements that \\"never leave forever\\" (are in some set after each n). =Monotone sequences= The sequence {An} is said to be nonincreasing if each An+1 ‚äÇ An and nondecreasing if each An ‚äÇ An+1. In each of these cases the set limit exists. Consider, for example, a nonincreasing sequence {An}. Then :\\\\bigcap_{j \\\\geq n} A_j = \\\\bigcap_{j \\\\geq 1} A_j \\\\text{ and } \\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq n} A_j = A_n. From these it follows that :\\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\geq 1} \\\\bigcap_{j \\\\geq n} A_j = \\\\bigcap_{j \\\\geq 1} A_j = \\\\bigcap_{n \\\\geq 1} \\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq n} A_j = \\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n. Similarly, if {An} is nondecreasing then :\\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq 1} A_j. Properties *If the limit of 1An(x), as n goes to infinity, exists for all x then ::\\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X: \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}(x) = 1 \\\\\\\\}. :Otherwise, the limit for {An} does not exist. *It can be shown that the limit infimum is contained in the limit supremum: ::\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n\\\\subset\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n, :for example, simply by observing that x ‚àà An all except finitely often implies x ‚àà An infinitely often. *Using the monotonicity of \\\\scriptstyle B_n = \\\\bigcap_{j\\\\ge n}A_j and of \\\\scriptstyle C_n = \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\ge n}A_j, ::\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\bigcap_{j\\\\ge n}A_j\\\\text{ and }\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\bigcup_{j\\\\ge n}A_j. *By using DeMorgan's rule twice, with set complement Ac = X\\\\A, ::\\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcup_n \\\\Bigl(\\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq n} A_j^c\\\\Bigr)^c = \\\\Bigl(\\\\bigcap_n \\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq n} A_j^c\\\\Bigr)^c = \\\\Bigl(\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n^c\\\\Bigr)^c. :That is, x ‚àà An all except finitely often is the same as x ‚àâ An finitely often. *From the second definition above and the definitions for limit infimum and limit supremum of a real-valued sequence, ::\\\\textbf{1}_{\\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n}(x) = \\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\textbf{1}_{A_j}(x) = \\\\sup_{n \\\\ge 1}\\\\inf_{j \\\\ge n}\\\\textbf{1}_{A_j}(x) :and ::\\\\textbf{1}_{\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n}(x) = \\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\textbf{1}_{A_j}(x) = \\\\inf_{n \\\\ge 1}\\\\sup_{j \\\\ge n}\\\\textbf{1}_{A_j}(x). *Suppose \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{F} is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of X. That is, \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{F} is nonempty and is closed under complement and under unions and intersections of countably many sets. Then, by the first definition above, if each An ‚àà \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{F} then both and are elements of \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{F}. Examples *Let Then ::\\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcup_n \\\\bigcap_{j\\\\ge n}\\\\Bigl(-\\\\frac{1}{j}, 1-\\\\frac{1}{j}\\\\Bigr] = \\\\bigcup_n \\\\Bigl[0, 1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\Bigr] = [0, 1) :and ::\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcap_n \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\ge n}\\\\Bigl(-\\\\frac{1}{j}, 1-\\\\frac{1}{j}\\\\Bigr] = \\\\bigcap_n \\\\Bigl(-\\\\frac{1}{n}, 1\\\\Bigr) = [0, 1). :So exists. *Change the previous example to Then ::\\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcup_n \\\\bigcap_{j\\\\ge n} \\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{(-1)^j}{j}, 1-\\\\frac{(-1)^j}{j}\\\\Bigr] = \\\\bigcup_n \\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{1}{2n}, 1-\\\\frac{1}{2n}\\\\Bigr] = (0, 1) :and ::\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\bigcap_n \\\\bigcup_{j\\\\ge n} \\\\Bigl(\\\\frac{(-1)^j}{j}, 1-\\\\frac{(-1)^j}{j}\\\\Bigr] = \\\\bigcap_n \\\\Bigl(-\\\\frac{1}{2n-1}, 1+\\\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\\\Bigr] = [0, 1]. :So does not exist, despite the fact that the left and right endpoints of the intervals converge to 0 and 1, respectively. *Let }. Then ::\\\\bigcup_{j \\\\geq n} A_j = \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\cap[0,1] : (which is all rational numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive) since even for j < n and 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ j, k/j = (n√ók)/(n√ój) is an element of the above. Therefore, :: \\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\cap[0,1]. :On the other hand, ::\\\\bigcap_{j \\\\geq n} A_j = \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}, :which implies :: \\\\liminf_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n = \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. :In this case, the sequence A1, A2, ... does not have a limit. Note that is not the set of accumulation points, which would be the entire interval (according to the usual Euclidean metric). Probability uses Set limits, particularly the limit infimum and the limit supremum, are essential for probability and measure theory. Such limits are used to calculate (or prove) the probabilities and measures of other, more purposeful, sets. For the following, \\\\scriptstyle(X,\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathbb{P}) is a probability space, which means \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{F} is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of \\\\scriptstyle X and \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbb{P} is a probability measure defined on that œÉ-algebra. Sets in the œÉ-algebra are known as events. If A1, A2, ... is a monotone sequence of events in \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{F} then exists and :\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n) = \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\mathbb{P}(A_n). =Borel‚ÄìCantelli lemmas= In probability, the two Borel‚ÄìCantelli lemmas can be useful for showing that the limsup of a sequence of events has probability equal to 1 or to 0. The statement of the first (original) Borel‚ÄìCantelli lemma is :\\\\text{if } \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\mathbb{P}(A_n) < \\\\infty \\\\text{ then } \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n) = 0. The second Borel‚ÄìCantelli lemma is a partial converse: :\\\\text{if } A_1, A_2, \\\\dots \\\\text{ are independent events and } \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\mathbb{P}(A_n) = \\\\infty \\\\text{ then } \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\limsup_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} A_n) = 1. =Almost sure convergence= One of the most important applications to probability is for demonstrating the almost sure convergence of a sequence of random variables. The event that a sequence of random variables Y1, Y2, ... converges to another random variable Y is formally expressed as \\\\scriptstyle\\\\\\\\{\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}Y_n - Y=0\\\\\\\\}. It would be a mistake, however, to write this simply as a limsup of events. That is, this is not the event \\\\scriptstyle\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\\\\\{Y_n - Y=0\\\\\\\\}! Instead, the complement of the event is :\\\\\\\\{\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}Y_n - Y eq 0\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}Y_n - Y > \\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\text{ for some } k\\\\\\\\} ::= \\\\bigcup_{k\\\\ge 1}\\\\bigcap_{n\\\\ge 1}\\\\bigcup_{j \\\\ge n} \\\\\\\\{Y_j - Y > \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\\\\\} = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\{Y_n - Y > \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\\\\\}. Therefore, :\\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\\\\\{\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}Y_n - Y eq 0\\\\\\\\}) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\{Y_n - Y > \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\\\\\}).

It breeds across southern Europe, on the Mediterranean islands and in north Africa. It is a resident of these warmer areas, and does not migrate in winter. It is common in all sorts of open areas with some scrub or trees, but has a preference for sunny slopes. Changes in agricultural practice have affected this species very adversely at the northern fringes of its range, and in England, where it once occurred over much of the south of the country, it is now restricted to south Devon. The cirl bunting is the mascot on the signs for the village of Stokeinteignhead in Devon. Etymology The genus name Emberiza is from Old German Embritz, a bunting. The specific cirlus is from a local Italian name cirlo, for a type of bunting, from zirlare, \\"to chirp\\". The English cirl is derived from cirlus, \\"probably from zirlare, to whistle as a thrush\\". Description The cirl bunting is like a small yellowhammer, 15‚Äì16.5 cm in length (wing-span 22‚Äì22.5 cm) with a thick seed- eater's bill. The male has a bright yellow head, with a black crown, eyestripe and throat, and a greenish breast band across its otherwise yellow underparts, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much more like the yellowhammer, but has a streaked grey-brown rump and chestnut shoulders. The monotonous song of the cock is rattling trill, like Arctic warbler or the terminal rattle of lesser whitethroat. In the summer their natural food consists of invertebrates for example grasshoppers and crickets to feed their chicks. In the winter they feed on small seeds from over-wintered stubbles, fallow land, set-aside, and the over-winter feeding of stock with grain or hay. They tend to feed in flocks during the winter. The nest is on the ground, within dense cover such as that provided by thick hedgerows and scrub. The ideal scrub is said to be blackthorn, hawthorn, bramble and gorse. The breeding season runs from April until mid-September, potentially having three broods in total. They are sedentary in nature and will often travel only from their nests to forage in summer, and up to in winter to find stubbles. Two to five eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of buntings. The ideal farmland habitat is a mixture of grass and arable fields, divided by thick hedgerows with pockets of dense scrub.\\"Farming for Birds Cirl Bunting RSPB\\" leaflet They can tolerate a certain degree of urbanisation, and are found in green spaces in towns and cities, even Rome. English population Frontispiece of the Ornithological Dictionary, 1802, showing a male cirl bunting. George Montagu discovered the species near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon, still its British stronghold. =History= A very small cirl bunting population exists in South Devon in England, near the small town of Kingsbridge where the pioneering ornithologist George Montagu discovered the species, as he recorded in his book, the Ornithological Dictionary, 1802.Montagu, George (1802). Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds, London: J. White. The species appears to have first colonised Britain near Kingsbridge, most likely not long before Montagu described it. It expanded from there across southern England in the nineteenth century. It retreated from the 1930s onwards, so that by 1989 the population again survived mainly near Kingsbridge. Since then, conservation efforts have increased the population more than fivefold, but it remains almost wholly in Devon. =Conservation= Through its Countryside Stewardship Scheme and environmental stewardship, Natural England has various options to conserve the species: * Allow stubbles to overwinter. Leave crops such as spring barley stubble untreated (no fertiliser, pesticide, or cultivation) until the end of the following March. This allows the cirl bunting to feed over the winter on the spilt grain and seeds of broad-leaved arable weeds like fat hen, chickweed, and annual meadow grass Poa annua, which grow in the meantime. The loss of this old farming practice led to the species' decline. * Maintain semi-improved or rough grassland and field margins, particularly tussocky grasses such as cock's-foot. These provide an overwintering habitat for insects, which in turn provides food for the cirl bunting and their chicks. * Sow barley-based wild bird seed mix crop. This crop has an open structure, allowing birds to forage. * Delay spraying insecticides to provide invertebrate food for as long as possible. * Leave hedgerows untrimmed for periods of time. This provides breeding areas and food. A partnership between Natural England and the RSPB runs the \\"Cirl Bunting Project\\", part of a larger project called \\"Action for Birds\\". Through the efforts of conservation organisations and landowners, the cirl bunting population has increased from 118 pairs in 1989 to 700 pairs in 2003. However, their range has not expanded.

Its technological roots can be traced back to the late 1950s, when China began a ballistic missile program in response to perceived American (and, later, Soviet) threats. However, the first Chinese crewed space program only began several decades later, when an accelerated program of technological development culminated in Yang Liwei's successful 2003 flight aboard Shenzhou 5\\\\. This achievement made China the third country to independently send humans into space. Plans currently include a permanent Chinese space station in 2022 and crewed expeditions to the Moon. Officials have articulated long term ambitions to exploit Earth-Moon space for industrial development. Officials announced China's first landing of a reusable space vehicle at Lop Nur on September 6, 2020. History Dong Fang Hong I - Chinese first satellite (1970), Space technology exhibition in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China After the United States threatened to use nuclear weapons during the Korean War , Chairman Mao Zedong decided that only a nuclear deterrent of its own would guarantee the security of the newly founded PRC. Additionally, he wanted China to gain status among the world's powers that‚Äîas he felt‚Äîdid not respect him. From this, he decided instead to only implement his new plan with the Republic of China (present-day Taiwan) as \\"China\\". Thus, Mao announced his decision to develop China's own strategic weapons, including nuclear bombs and associated missiles for the warheads, during a Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee meeting held on January 15, 1955. The Chinese nuclear weapons program was designated by the codename of \\"02\\". The Fifth Academy of the National Defense Ministry () was founded on October 8, 1956, with Qian Xuesen, who had just been deported from the United States after being accused of being a communist during the red scare, as director. The Academy started the development of the first ballistic missile program, adopted on March 1, 1956 and known as the first Twelve-Year- Plan for Chinese aerospace. After the launch of mankind's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, Mao decided during the National Congress of the CPC on May 17, 1958 to make China an equal with the superpowers (\\"\\") (We need to develop the artificial satellite too), by adopting Project 581 with the objective of placing a satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the PRC's founding. This goal would be achieved in three phases: developing sounding rockets first, then launching small satellites and in the final phase, large satellites. The construction of China's first missile test base, code-named Base 20 (), started in April 1958 and it entered service on October 20 of the same year. The first Chinese missile was built in October 1958 as a reverse-engineered copy of the Soviet R-2 short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), itself an upgraded version of a German V-2 rocket. Its range was 590 km, weighing 20.5 tons and propelled with liquid oxygen and alcohol. China's first ever T-7 sounding rocket was successfully launched from the Nanhui launch site on February 19, 1960. China started to develop medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) in July 1960, with an increased range double that of the R-2. During the cordial Sino-Soviet relations of the 1950s, the USSR engaged in a cooperative technology transfer program with the PRC under which they trained Chinese students and provided the fledgling program with a sample R-2 rocket. But when Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was denounced as revisionist, with Mao asserting that there had been a counter-revolution in the Soviet Union and that capitalism had been restored, the friendly relationship between the two countries turned to confrontation. As a consequence, all Soviet technological assistance was abruptly withdrawn after the 1960 Sino-Soviet split. Only 17 days after the last Soviet expert had left China, the first Soviet built R-2 rocket fueled with Chinese-made propellant was launched with success on September 10, 1960. Due to Cold War tension, Mao decided in December 1963 that China should develop missile defence system capacity. During a conference held on February 2, 1964, directive 640 (640ÊåáÁ§∫)was adopted (later known as Project 640). The first successful launch of a Chinese 1059 SRBM missile copy of the R-2 was conducted only two months later on November 5, 1960. The missile was also designated DF-1. The first DF-2 MRBM was tested on March 21, 1962, but failed. Development eventually continued with the redesigned DF-2A MRBM which was successfully tested on June 29, 1964. It would enter service by the end of 1966. The first successful launch and recovery of a T-7A(S1) sounding rocket carrying a biological experiment (transporting eight white mice) was on July 19, 1964 from Base 603 (ÂÆâÂæΩÂπøÂæ∑Ë™ìËäÇÊ∏°‰∏≠ÂõΩÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢ÂÖ≠„Äá‰∏âÂü∫Âú∞. China started to develop the DF-5 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program in August 1965. It was designed to carry a single nuclear warhead and has a maximum range of 12000 km. In November 1966, it was decided to build a second ballistic missile test site, the Northern Missile Test Site (ÂçéÂåóÂØºÂºπËØïÈ™åÂú∫)) in Shanxi Province, farther away from China's northern border. On October 27, 1966, a nuclear-tipped DF-2A missile was launched from Jiuquan and the 20 kilotons yield nuclear warhead exploded at the height of 569 meters over the target in Lop Nor or Base 21 situated 894 km away. On December 26, 1966, China tested its first indigenously developed DF-3 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with success. The DF-3 was a single-stage, single-warhead missile with a maximum range of 2500 km. The development of the DF-4 IRBM began in 1967 in parallel with the single-stage DF-3. In March 1967, development started on the JL-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile to accompany the Type 092 ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) also in development. The launch of Long March 3B Rocket in 1997 Long March 2D lifting off in 2012 Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, one of the first Chinese spaceports. Chinese EVA spacesuit \\"Feitian\\". As the space race between the two superpowers reached its climax with the conquest of the Moon, Mao and Zhou Enlai decided on July 14, 1967 that the PRC should not be left behind, and started China's own crewed space program. China's first spacecraft designed for human occupancy was named Shuguang-1 (ÊõôÂÖâ‰∏ÄÂè∑) in January 1968. China's Space Medical Institute (Ëà™Â§©ÂåªÂ≠¶Â∑•Á®ãÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) was founded on April 1, 1968, and the Central Military Commission issued the order to start the selection of astronauts. As part of the \\"third line\\" effort to relocate critical defense infrastructure to the relatively remote interior (away from the Soviet border), it was decided to construct a new space center in the mountainous region of Xichang in the Sichuan province, code-named Base 27. A first liquid-propellant DF-3 medium-range ballistic missile was successfully launched from the Northern Missile Test Site on December 18, 1968, inaugurating the test site. In August 1969, the development of China's first heavy-lift satellite launch vehicle (SLV), the Feng Bao 1 (FB-1) (È£éÊö¥‰∏ÄÂè∑, was started by Shanghai's 2nd Bureau of Mechanic-Electrical Industry. The all- liquid two-stage launcher was derived from the DF-5 ICBM. Only a few months later, a parallel heavy-lift SLV program, also based on the same DF-5 ICBM and known as CZ-2, was started in Beijing by the First Space Academy. The DF-4 was used to develop the Long March-1 SLV. A newly designed spin-up orbital insertion solid propellant rocket motor third stage was added to the two existing Nitric acid/UDMH liquid propellant stages. An attempt to use this vehicle to launch a Chinese satellite before Japan's first attempt ended in failure on November 16, 1969. The first DF-4 liquid-propellant with two-stage, single-warhead IRBM was tested with success on January 30, 1970. The addition of a second-stage allowed the missile to increase its range to over 4750 km. The second satellite launch attempt on April 24, 1970 was successful. A CZ-1 was used to launch the 173 kg Dong Fang Hong I (‰∏úÊñπÁ∫¢‰∏ÄÂè∑, meaning The East Is Red I), also known as Mao-1. It was the heaviest first satellite placed into orbit by a nation, exceeding the combined masses of the first satellites of the other four previous countries. The third stage of the CZ-1 was specially equipped with a 40 m2 solar reflector (ËßÇÂØüÁêÉ) deployed by the centrifugal force developed by the spin up orbital insertion solid propellant stage. Therefore, the faint magnitude 5 to 8 brightness of the DFH-1 made the satellite (at best) barely visible with naked eyes was consequently dramatically increased to a comfortable magnitude 2 to 3. The PRC's second satellite was launched with the last of the CZ-1 SLVs on March 3, 1971. The 221 kg ShiJian-1 (SJ-1) was equipped with a magnetometer and cosmic-ray/x-ray detectors. The first crewed space program known as Project 714, was officially adopted in April 1971 with the goal of sending two astronauts into space by 1973 aboard the Shuguang spacecraft. The first screening process for astronauts had already ended on March 15, 1971, with 19 astronauts chosen. The program would soon be cancelled due to political turmoil. A first flight test of the DF-5 ICBM was carried out in October 1971. On August 10, 1972, the new heavy-lift SLV FB-1 made its maiden test flight, with only partial success. The CZ-2A launcher, originally designed to carry the Shuguang-1 spacecraft, was first tested on November 5, 1974, carrying China's first FSW-0 recoverable satellite, but failed. After some redesign work, the modified CZ-2C successfully launched the FSW-0 No.1 recoverable satellite (ËøîÂõûÂºèÂç´Êòü) into orbit on November 26, 1975. After expansion, the Northern Missile Test Site was upgraded as a test base in January 1976 to become the Northern Missile Test Base (ÂçéÂåóÂØºÂºπËØïÈ™åÂü∫Âú∞) known as Base 25. After Mao died on September 9, 1976, his rival, Deng Xiaoping, denounced during the Cultural Revolution as reactionary and therefore forced to retire from all his offices, slowly re-emerged as China's new leader in 1978. At first, new development was slowed. Then, several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelled‚Äîthe Fanji ABM system, the Xianfeng Anti- Missile Super Gun, the ICBM Early Warning Network 7010 Tracking Radar and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program. Nevertheless, some development did proceed. The first Yuanwang-class space tracking ship was commissioned in 1979. The first full-range test of the DF-5 ICBM was conducted on May 18, 1980. The payload reached its target located 9300 km away in the South Pacific () and retrieved five minutes later by helicopter. Further development of the Long March rocket series allowed the PRC to initiate a commercial launch program in 1985, which has since launched more than 50 foreign satellites, primarily for European, African and Asian interests. The next crewed space program was even more ambitious and proposed in March 1986, as Astronautics plan 863-2. This consisted of a crewed spacecraft (Project 863-204) used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station (Project 863-205). Several spaceplane designs were rejected two years later and a simpler space capsule was chosen instead. Although the project did not achieve its goals, it would ultimately evolve into the 1992 Project 921. The Ministry of Aerospace Industry was founded on July 5, 1988. On September 15, 1988, a JL-1 SLBM was launched from a Type 092 submarine. The maximum range of the SLBM is 2150 km. Along Deng's policy of capitalist reforms in the Chinese economy, Chinese culture also changed. Therefore, names used in the space program, previously all chosen from the revolutionary history of the PRC, were soon replaced with mystical-religious ones. Thus, new Long March carrier rockets were renamed Divine arrow (Á•ûÁÆ≠), spacecraft Divine vessel (Á•ûËàü), space plane Divine dragon (Á•ûÈæô), land-based high-power laser Divine light (Á•ûÂÖâ) and supercomputer Divine might (Á•ûÂ®Å). In June 1993, China Aerospace Industry Corporation (National Space Bureau) was founded in Beijing. On February 15, 1996, during the flight of the first Long March 3B heavy carrier rocket carrying Intelsat 708, the rocket veered off course immediately after clearing the launch platform, crashing 22 seconds later. It crashed away from the launch pad into a nearby mountain village. On the 50th anniversary of the PRC's founding, China launched the Shenzhou 1 spacecraft on November 20, 1999 and recovered it after a flight of 21 hours. The country became the third country with a successful crewed space program by sending an astronaut into space aboard Shenzhou 5 on October 15, 2003 for more than 21 hours. China has since turned its focus to extraterrestrial exploration starting with the Moon. The first Chinese Lunar Exploration Program un-crewed lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 was successfully launched on October 24, 2007, making China the fifth nation to successfully orbit the Moon. Chinese space program and the international community =Dual-use technologies and outer space= The PRC is a member of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and a signatory to all United Nations treaties and conventions on space, with the exception of the 1979 Moon Treaty. The United States government has long been resistant to the use of PRC launch services by American industry due to concerns over alleged civilian technology transfer that could have dual-use military applications to countries such as North Korea, Iran or Syria, and announced an official embargo against the PRC in 2000. Thus, financial retaliatory measures have been taken on many occasions against several Chinese space companies. = NASA's Chinese exclusion policy = Due to security concerns, all researchers from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are prohibited from working with Chinese citizens affiliated with a Chinese state enterprise or entity. In April 2011, the 112th United States Congress banned NASA from using its funds to host Chinese visitors at NASA facilities. In March 2013, the U.S. Congress passed legislation barring Chinese nationals from entering NASA facilities without a waiver from NASA. The history of the U.S. exclusion policy can be traced back in 1998 when a U.S. Congressional Commission led by Christopher Cox discovered that the technical information that American companies provided China for its commercial satellite ended up improving Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile technology. This was further aggravated in 2007 when China blew up a defunct meteorological satellite in low Earth orbit to test a ground-based anti-satellite (ASAT) missile. The debris created by the explosion contributed to the space junk that litter Earth's orbit, exposing other nations' space assets to the risk of accidental collision. The United States also fears the Chinese application of dual-use space technology for nefarious purposes. The U.S. imposed an embargo to the U.S. - China space cooperation throughout the 2000s and by 2011, a clause inserted by then-Congressman Frank Wolf in the 2011 U.S. federal budget forbids NASA from hosting or participating in a joint scientific activity with China. The Chinese response to the exclusion policy involved its own space policy of opening up its space station to the outside world, welcoming scientists coming from all countries. American scientists have also boycotted NASA conferences due to its rejection of Chinese nationals in these events. Organization Initially the space program of the PRC was organized under the People's Liberation Army, particularly the Second Artillery Corps. In the 1990s, the PRC reorganized the space program as part of a general reorganization of the defense industry to make it resemble Western defense procurement. The China National Space Administration, an agency within the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense currently headed by Zhang Kejian, is now responsible for launches. The Long March rocket is produced by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, and satellites are produced by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. The latter organizations are state-owned enterprises; however, it is the intent of the PRC government that they should not be actively state-managed and that they should behave much as private companies would in the West. =Universities and institutes= The space program also has close links with: * College of Aerospace Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology * School of Astronautics, Beihang University * School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University * School of Astronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University * School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhejiang University * Institute of Aerospace Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiaotong University * College of Aeronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology * School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University =Space cities= *Dongfeng space city (‰∏úÈ£éËà™Â§©Âüé), also known as Base 20 (‰∫åÂçÅÂü∫Âú∞) or Dongfeng base (‰∏úÈ£éÂü∫Âú∞) *Beijing space city (Âåó‰∫¨Ëà™Â§©Âüé) *Wenchang space city (ÊñáÊòåËà™Â§©Âüé) *Shanghai space city (‰∏äÊµ∑Ëà™Â§©Âüé) *Yantai space city (ÁÉüÂè∞Ëà™Â§©Âüé) *Guizhou Aerospace Industrial Park (Ë¥µÂ∑ûËà™Â§©È´òÊñ∞ÊäÄÊúØ‰∫ß‰∏öÂõ≠), also known as Base 061 (Ëà™Â§©‚óãÂÖ≠‰∏ÄÂü∫Âú∞), founded in 2002 after approval of Project 863 for industrialization of aerospace research centers (\\"ÂõΩÂÆ∂863ËÆ°ÂàíÊàêÊûú‰∫ß‰∏öÂåñÂü∫Âú∞\\"). =Suborbital launch sites= *Nanhui (ÂçóÊ±áÂéøËÄÅÊ∏ØÈïá‰∏úËøõÊùë) First successful launch of a T-7M sounding rocket on February 19, 1960. *Base 603 (ÂÆâÂæΩÂπøÂæ∑Ë™ìËäÇÊ∏°‰∏≠ÂõΩÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢ÂÖ≠„Äá‰∏âÂü∫Âú∞) Also known as Guangde Launch Site (ÂπøÂæ∑ÂèëÂ∞ÑÂú∫). The first successful flight of a biological experimental T-7A(S1) sounding rocket transporting eight white mice was launched and recovered on July 19, 1964. =Satellite launch centers= The PRC operates 4 satellite launch centers: *Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (JSLC) *Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC) *Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center (TSLC) *Wenchang Satellite Launch Center (WSLC) =Monitoring and control centers= *Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center (BACCC) *Xi'an Satellite Control Center (XSCC) also known as Base 26(‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ≠Âü∫Âú∞) *Fleet of six Yuanwang-class space tracking ships. *Data relay satellite (Êï∞ÊçÆ‰∏≠ÁªßÂç´Êòü) Tianlian I (Â§©Èìæ‰∏ÄÂè∑), specially developed to decrease the communication time between the Shenzhou 7 spaceship and the ground; it will also improve the amount of data that can be transferred. The current orbit coverage of 12 percent will thus be increased to a total of about 60 percent. *Deep Space Tracking Network composed with radio antennas in Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Urumuqi, forming a 3000 km VLBI (ÁîöÈïøÂü∫Á∫øÂπ≤Ê∂â).

The top-secret Project 714 aimed to put two people into space by 1973 with the Shuguang spacecraft. Nineteen PLAAF pilots were selected for this goal on March 1971. The Shuguang-1 spacecraft to be launched with the CZ-2A rocket was designed to carry a crew of two. The program was officially cancelled on May 13, 1972 for economic reasons, though the internal politics of the Cultural Revolution likely motivated the closure. The short- lived second crewed program was based on the successful implementation of landing technology (third in the World after USSR and United States) by FSW satellites. It was announced a few times in 1978 with the open publishing of some details including photos, but then was abruptly canceled in 1980. It has been argued that the second crewed program was created solely for propaganda purposes, and was never intended to produce results. =Project 863= A new crewed space program was proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in March 1986, as Astronautics plan 863-2. This consisted of a crewed spacecraft (Project 863-204) used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station (Project 863-205). In September of that year, astronauts in training were presented by the Chinese media. The various proposed crewed spacecraft were mostly spaceplanes. Project 863 ultimately evolved into the 1992 Project 921. =Project 921 (Shenzhou)= Spacecraft Shenzhou 7 re-entry module A model of Shenzhou spacecraft In 1992, authorization and funding was given for the first phase of Project 921, which was a plan to launch a crewed spacecraft. The Shenzhou program had four uncrewed test flights and two crewed missions. The first one was Shenzhou 1 on November 20, 1999. On January 9, 2001 Shenzhou 2 launched carrying test animals. Shenzhou 3 and Shenzhou 4 were launched in 2002, carrying test dummies. Following these was the successful Shenzhou 5, China's first crewed mission in space on October 15, 2003, which carried Yang Liwei in orbit for 21 hours and made China the third nation to launch a human into orbit. Shenzhou 6 followed two years later ending the first phase of the Project 921. Missions are launched on the Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The China Crewed Space Engineering Office provides engineering and administrative support for the crewed Shenzhou missions. Space laboratory The second phase of the Project 921 started with Shenzhou 7, China's first spacewalk mission. Then, two crewed missions were planned to the first Chinese space laboratory. The PRC initially designed the Shenzhou spacecraft with docking technologies imported from Russia, therefore compatible with the International Space Station (ISS). On September 29, 2011, China launched Tiangong 1. This target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station. On October 31, 2011, a Long March 2F rocket lifted the Shenzhou 8 uncrewed spacecraft which docked twice with the Tiangong 1 module. The Shenzhou 9 craft took off on 16 June 2012 with a crew of 3. It successfully docked with the Tiangong-1 laboratory on 18 June 2012, at 06:07 UTC, marking China's first crewed spacecraft docking. Another crewed mission, Shenzhou 10, launched on 11 June 2013. The Tiangong 1 target module is then expected to be deorbited. A second space lab, Tiangong 2, launched on 15 September 2016, 22:04:09 (UTC+8). The launch mass was 8,600 kg, with a length of 10.4m and a width of 3.35m, much like the Tiangong 1. Shenzhou 11 launched and rendezvoused with Tiangong 2 in October 2016, with an unconfirmed further mission Shenzhou 12 in the future. The Tiangong 2 brings with it the POLAR gamma ray burst detector, a space-Earth quantum key distribution and laser communications experiment to be used in conjunction with the Mozi 'Quantum Science Satellite', a liquid bridge thermocapillary convection experiment and a space material experiment. Also included is a stereoscopic microwave altimeter, a space plant growth experiment, and a multi-angle wide-spectral imager and multi-spectral limb imaging spectrometer. Onboard TG-2 there will also be the world's first-ever in-space cold atomic fountain clock. Space station A larger basic permanent space station (Âü∫Êú¨ÂûãÁ©∫Èó¥Á´ô) would be the third and last phase of Project 921. This will be a modular design with an eventual weight of around 60 tons, to be completed sometime before 2022. The first section, designated Tiangong 3, was scheduled for launch after Tiangong 2, but ultimately not ordered after its goals were merged with Tiangong 2. This could also be the beginning of China's crewed international cooperation, the existence of which was officially disclosed for the first time after the launch of Shenzhou 7. The Chinese space station is scheduled to be completed in 2022. =Lunar exploration= In February 2004, the PRC formally started the implementation phase of its uncrewed Moon exploration project. According to Sun Laiyan, administrator of the China National Space Administration, the project will involve three phases: orbiting the Moon; landing; and returning samples. The first phase planned to spend 1.4 billion renminbi (approx. US$170 million) to orbit a satellite around the Moon before 2007, which is ongoing. Phase two involves sending a lander before 2010. Phase three involves collecting lunar soil samples before 2020. On November 27, 2005, the deputy commander of the crewed spaceflight program announced that the PRC planned to complete a space station and a crewed mission to the Moon by 2020, assuming funding was approved by the government. On December 14, 2005, it was reported \\"an effort to launch lunar orbiting satellites will be supplanted in 2007 by a program aimed at accomplishing an uncrewed lunar landing. A program to return uncrewed space vehicles from the moon will begin in 2012 and last for five years, until the crewed program gets underway\\" in 2017, with a crewed Moon landing some time after that.http://www.cio-today.com/news/China-To-Send- People-to-Moon/story.xhtml?story_id=032001DRNFR4 Nonetheless, the decision to develop a totally new Moon rocket in the 1962 Soviet UR-700M-class (Project Aelita) able to launch a 500-ton payload in LTO and a more modest 50 tons LTO payload LV has been discussed in a 2006 conference by academician Zhang Guitian (Âº†Ë¥µÁî∞), a liquid propellant rocket engine specialist, who developed the CZ-2 and CZ-4A rockets engines. On June 22, 2006, Long Lehao, deputy chief architect of the lunar probe project, laid out a schedule for China's lunar exploration. He set 2024 as the date of China's first moonwalk. In September 2010, it was announced that the country is planning to carry out explorations in deep space by sending a man to the Moon by 2025. China also hopes to bring a Moon rock sample back to Earth in 2017, and subsequently build an observatory on the Moon's surface. Ye Peijian, Commander in Chief of the Chang'e programme and an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, added that China has the \\"full capacity to accomplish Mars exploration by 2013.\\" On December 14, 2013 China's Chang'e 3 became the first object to soft-land on the Moon since Luna 24 in 1976. On January 3, 2019, Chang'e 4, the China National Space Administration's lunar rover, successfully landed on the far side of the Moon. The rover was able to transmit data back to Earth despite the lack of radio frequencies on the far side, via a dedicated satellite sent earlier to orbit the moon. The landing and data transmission is considered a landmark achievement for human space exploration. As indicated by the official Chinese Lunar Exploration Program insignia, denoted by a calligraphic Moon ideogram (Êúà) in the shape of a nascent lunar crescent, with two human footsteps at its center, the ultimate objective of the program is to establish a permanent human presence on the Earth's natural satellite. Annotated image of the approximate landing site of the Chinese Chang'e-3 lander. It was launched at 17:30 UTC on 1 December 2013, and reached the Moon's surface on 14 December 2013. The lunar coordinates are: 44.12¬∞N 19.51¬∞W. Yang Liwei declared at the 16th Human in Space Symposium of International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) in Beijing, on May 22, 2007 that building a lunar base was a crucial step to realize a flight to Mars and farther planets. According to practice, since the whole project is only at a very early preparatory research phase, no official crewed Moon program has been announced yet by the authorities. But its existence is nonetheless revealed by regular intentional leaks in the media. A typical example is the Lunar Roving Vehicle (ÊúàÁêÉËΩ¶) that was shown on a Chinese TV channel (‰∏úÊñπÂç´ËßÜ) during the 2008 May Day celebrations. =Mission to Mars and beyond= Sun Laiyan, administrator of the China National Space Administration, said on July 20, 2006 that China would start deep space exploration focusing on Mars over the next five years, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006‚Äì2010) Program period.People's Daily Online - Roundup: China to develop deep space exploration in five years The first uncrewed Mars exploration program could take place sometime between around 2033, followed by a crewed phase in 2040-2060. The Mars 500 study of 2011 prepared for this crewed mission. Moreover, in order to make crewed flight in deep space toward Mars safer, a space weather forecast system was to be completed by 2017 with the KuafuÊàëÂõΩÁõÆÂÖâË∂ÖË∂äÊúàÁêÉ \\"Â§∏Áà∂ËÆ°Âàí\\"ÈõÑÂøÉÂãÉÂãÉ-ÁßëÊäÄ-‰∫∫Ê∞ëÁΩë mission satellites placed at the Lagrangian Point L1.People's Daily Online. \\"China plans new space project probing Sun-Earth environment\\" However, due to withdrawal first by Canada and then ESA, the project was indefinitely postponed. In 2006, the Chief Designer of the Shenzhou spacecraft stated in an interview that: = Space-based solar power = According to the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) presentation at the 2015 International Space Development Congress in Toronto, Canada, Chinese interest in space-based solar power began in the period 1990‚Äì1995. By 2011 there was a proposal for a national program, with advocates such as Pioneer Professor Wang Xiji stating in an article for the Ministry of Science and technology that \\"China had built up a solid industrial foundation, acquired sufficient technology and had enough money to carry out the most ambitious space project in history. Once completed, the solar station, with a capacity of 100MW, would span at least one square kilometre, dwarfing the International Space Station and becoming the biggest man-made object in space\\" and \\"warned that if it did not act quickly, China would let other countries, in particular the US and Japan, take the lead and occupy strategically important locations in space.\\" Global Security cites a 2011-01 Journal of Rocket propulsion that articulates the need for 620+ launches of their Long March-9 (CZ-9) heavy lift system for the construction of an orbital solar power plant with 10,000 MW capacity massing 50,000 tonnes. Artist's concept of the Chinese large modular space station By 2013 there was a national goal, that \\"the state has decided that power coming from outside of the earth, such as solar power and development of other space energy resources, is to be China's future direction\\" and the following roadmap was identified: \\"In 2010, CAST will finish the concept design; in 2020, we will finish the industrial level testing of in-orbit construction and wireless transmissions. In 2025, we will complete the first 100kW SPS demonstration at LEO; and in 2035, the 100MW SPS will have electric generating capacity. Finally in 2050, the first commercial level SPS system will be in operation at GEO.\\" The article went on to state that \\"Since SPS development will be a huge project, it will be considered the equivalent of an Apollo program for energy. In the last century, America's leading position in science and technology worldwide was inextricably linked with technological advances associated with implementation of the Apollo program. Likewise, as China's current achievements in aerospace technology are built upon with its successive generations of satellite projects in space, China will use its capabilities in space science to assure sustainable development of energy from space.\\" In 2015, the CAST team won the International SunSat Design Competition with their video of a Multi-Rotary Joint concept.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhgJwnpYRGc The design was presented in detail in a paper for the Online Journal of Space Communication. In 2016, Lt Gen. Zhang Yulin, deputy chief of the [PLA] armament development department of the Central Military Commission, suggested that China would next begin to exploit Earth-Moon space for industrial development. The goal would be the construction of space-based solar power satellites that would beam energy back to Earth. Goals The China National Space Administration stated that their long-term goals are: * Improve their standing in the world of space science * Establish a crewed space station * Crewed missions to the Moon * Establish a crewed lunar base * Robotic mission to Mars * Exploit Earth-Moon space for industrial development.

Examples of other aryl groups consist of: * The tolyl group, CH3C6H4, which is derived from toluene (methylbenzene) * The xylyl group, (CH3)2C6H3, which is derived from xylene (dimethylbenzene) * The naphthyl group, C10H8, which is derived from naphthalene Arylation is the process in which an aryl group is attached to a substituent. It is typically achieved by cross-coupling reactions.  Nomenclature  The most basic aryl group is phenyl, which is made up of a benzene ring with one hydrogen atom substituted for some substituent, and has the molecular formula C6H5‚àí. Note that phenyl groups are not the same as benzyl groups, which consists of a phenyl group attached to a methyl group, and has the molecular formula C6H5CH2‚àí. Phenol (or hydroxybenzene) To name compounds containing phenyl groups, the phenyl group can be taken to be the parent hydrocarbon and being represented by the suffix \\"-benzene\\". Alternatively, the phenyl group could be treated as the substituent, being described within the name as \\"phenyl\\". This is usually done when the group attached to the phenyl group consists of six or more carbon atoms. As an example, consider a hydroxyl group connected to a phenyl group. In this case, if the phenyl group was taken as the parent hydrocarbon, the compound would be named hydroxybenzene. Alternatively, and more commonly, the hydroxyl group could be taken as the parent group (and the phenyl group treated as the substituent), resulting in the more familiar name phenol.  Reactions  = Electrophilic aromatic substitution = Benzene rings have a delocalised pi- system of electrons, which creates areas of high negative charge. This makes aromatic compounds more prone to attacks by electrophilic reagents. However, due to the high stability of benzene rings, they will only react with highly reactive electrophiles, and will only undergo substitution reactions (but not addition reactions). Benzene's unusual stability is explained by its ability to delocalise charges by resonance. Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene takes place in two main steps: electrophilic attack and proton loss. The image below summarizes the general mechanism of an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. upright=2.3 An example of such reaction is between bromine and benzene. In this reaction, a bromine atom will substitute a hydrogen atom in the benzene ring, giving bromobenzene, an aryl halide. However, due to the unreactive nature of benzene, catalyst such as aluminium chloride is needed. The formula for this reaction is: : C6H6 \\\\+ 0.5 Br2 ‚Üí C6H5Br Electrophilic Substitution of Bromine on Benzene = Halogen-metal exchange of aryl halides = Organometallic compounds are compounds that have a bond between a carbon and a metal atom. The halogen atom of an aryl halide atom could be exchanged for a metal atom using an organometallic reagent. An example of such reaction is the reaction between bromobenzene and an organolithium reagent, where there is a nucleophilic attack of the lithium cation on bromine. The formula to such reaction is: : C6H5Br + C4H10Li ‚Üí C6H5Li + C4H10Br Reaction of Organolithium and Aryl Halide The reaction is able to occur since benzene has a higher acidity compared to butane, which can be explained by the stability of the carbanion after the molecule loses a proton. The lithium-phenyl complex (C6H5Li) can better delocalize the negative charge by resonating it around the benzene ring; whereas in a lithium-butyl complex (C4H10Li), the molecule is not capable of such resonance and is further destabilized by the fact that the negative charge is placed on a primary carbon. Hence, formation of the lithium-phenyl complex can be observed.

It lives in Eurosiberia east of the Urals. Etymology The genus name Emberiza is from Old German Embritz, a bunting. The specific leucocephalos is from Ancient Greek leukos, \\"whites\\", and kephalos, \\"headed\\". Description and song The pine bunting is a robust 16‚Äì17.5-centimetre bird, with a thick seed-eater's bill. The male has a white crown and cheeks, and a chestnut forehead and throat, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much duller and is more streaked on its undersides. Non-breeding plumage is like that of a yellowhammer, but with all the yellow replaced by white. Its song and calls are like those of the yellowhammer. Breeding and habitat The pine bunting breeds across much of temperate Asia, migrating south to central Asia, north India and southern China in winter. It is common in all sorts of open land with some scrub or trees, including cultivation, but has a greater preference for open forest (usually pines) than the closely related yellowhammer. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe, but often winters in north-east Italy and Tuscany. =Appearance of pine bunting √ó yellowhammer hybrids= Hybrids between pine bunting and yellowhammer show a mixture of characters. One such bird, a vagrant in Suffolk, England in 1982, the \\"Sizewell bunting\\", is documented and illustrated with photographs in British Birds Lansdown, Peter and Trevor D. Charlton (1990) 'The Sizewell Bunting': a hybrid Pine Bunting √ó Yellowhammer in Suffolk British Birds 83(6):240‚Äì242 Some doubt has been cast upon male birds which appear to all intents and purposes to be pure pine buntings, but show yellow primary fringes. Previously, in Britain, these were regarded as potentially hybrid birds, and not accepted by the British Birds Rarities Committee. However, since 2004, BBRC has regarded these birds as acceptable if they also meet the following conditions:British Birds 97(11):620‚Äì621 * the lores must be chestnut, not black or grey * the throat must be extensively chestnut coloured, without a dark malar line or pale submoustachial line * the supercilium should be chestnut or grey, but not white * there should be no yellow on the head, or anywhere else except the primary fringes Diet The pine bunting's natural food consists seeds, and when feeding young, insects. The nest is on the ground. Four to six eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of buntings.

It is an American college football rivalry game played by the California Golden Bears football team of the University of California, Berkeley and the Stanford Cardinal football team of Stanford University. Both institutions are located in the San Francisco Bay Area. First played in 1892, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States. The game is typically played in late November or early December, and its location alternates between the two universities every year. In even-numbered years, the game is played at Berkeley, while in odd-numbered years it is played at Stanford. Series history Big Game is the oldest college football rivalry in the West. While an undergraduate at Stanford, future U.S. President Herbert Hoover was the student manager of both the baseball and football teams. He helped organize the inaugural Big Game, along with his friend Cal manager Herbert Lang. Only 10,000 tickets were printed for the game but 20,000 people showed up. Hoover and Lang scrambled to find pots, bowls and any other available receptacles to collect the admission fees. By 1900 the match was already referred to as the \\"Big Game.\\" In 1898, Berkeley alumnus and San Francisco Mayor James D. Phelan purchased a casting of Douglas Tilden's The Football Players bronze sculpture and offered it as a prize to the school that could win the football game two years in a row. Berkeley responded by shutting Stanford out in 1898 and 1899, and the sculpture was installed on the Berkeley campus atop a stone pedestal engraved with the names of the players and the donor during a dedication ceremony held May 12, 1900. The 1905 Big Game played at Stanford During the 1900 Big Game, played at the Recreation Park stadium on Thanksgiving Day in San Francisco, a large group of fans were observing from the roof of the nearby S.F. and Pacific Glass Works factory. With somewhere between 600 and 1,000 spectators atop it, the rooftop collapsed, resulting in well over 100 men falling to the factory's floor and more than 60 directly onto the massive, blazing furnace. In total 22 men, mostly boys, were killed, and more than 100 severely injured.Twenty Score Persons Make Awful Plunge: Seventeen People Meet Most Awful Death: Two San Jose Men Die Amid Sizzling Shrieking Human Mass in Collapsed Factory at Big Game, The (San Jose) Evening News, (Friday 30 November 1900), p.1, p.5. To this day, the Thanksgiving Day Disaster remains the deadliest accident to kill spectators at a U.S. sporting event.Eskanazi, J., \\"Sudden Death: Boys Fell to Their Doom in S.F.'s Forgotten Disaster\\", San Francisco Weekly News, 15 August 2012. In 1906, citing concerns about the violence in football, both schools dropped football in favor of Rugby, which was played for the Big Games of 1906‚Äì14. During that time the matches were played under Union rules of rugby per an agreement between Stanford and Cal coaches along with other West coast teams, including Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911) In 1915, Cal switched back to American football. Its official reason for withdrawal from its 1915 rugby match against Stanford was the disagreement over Stanford's play of freshmen on their varsity team, however it was apparent that Cal intended to withdraw from the agreement to play rugby and instead play football against western schools that continued playing football or switched back several years earlier. Cal's Big Game was played in the years 1915‚Äì17, against Washington, games which aren't listed in Big Game records. Cal lost its 1915, home Big Game to University of Washington 72‚Äì0, while Stanford played rugby against its new Big Game opponent Santa Clara University, beating them 30‚Äì0. Stanford played rugby for two more years. The 1918 game, in which Cal prevailed 67‚Äì0, is not considered an official game because Stanford's football team was composed of volunteers from the Student Army Training Corps stationed at Stanford, some of whom were not Stanford students. In 1919, Stanford officially switched back to playing football. The first incidence of card stunts was performed by Cal fans at the halftime of the 1910 Big Game. rules of rugby union. The 1912 edition would be nicknamed the mud game California resumed playing football in 1915, but Stanford's rugby teams continued until 1917. From 1915 to 1917, California's \\"Big Game\\" was their game against Washington, while Stanford played Santa Clara as their rugby \\"Big Game\\". The game resumed as football in 1919, and has been played as such every year since, except from 1943 to 1945, when Stanford shut down its football program due to World War II. A handful of Stanford starters‚Äîincluding guards Jim Cox, Bill Hachten and Fred Boensch, running back George Quist and halfback Billy Agnew‚Äîshifted to Cal in order to continue playing. Quist returned to Stanford, playing against Cal in the 1946 Big Game. Scenes for the Harold Lloyd silent classic The Freshman were filmed at California Memorial Stadium during halftime of the 1924 Big Game. Since 1933, the victor of the game has been awarded possession of the Stanford Axe. If a game ended in a tie, the Axe stayed on the side that already possessed it; this rule became obsolete in 1996 when the NCAA instituted overtime. The Axe is a key part of the rivalry's history, having been stolen on several occasions by both sides, starting in 1899, when the Axe was introduced when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb used it at a baseball game between the two schools. In March 2007, the National Football League announced that it intended to trademark the phrase \\"The Big Game\\" in reference to the Super Bowl, but soon dropped the plan after being faced with opposition from Cal and Stanford. In 2013, the new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara was proposed as the site of the 2014 Big Game, which according to the traditional rotation should be played at Cal's Memorial Stadium. The 2015 game would then be held in Berkeley, reversing the current rotation of odd-numbered years at Stanford and even-numbered years at Cal. However, several days later Cal declined the offer. Pregame traditions 2006 Cal Big Game Bonfire Rally In the week before the game, both schools celebrate the occasion with rallies, reunions, and luncheons. Cal students hold a traditional pep rally and bonfire at the Hearst Greek Theatre on the eve of the game, while Stanford students stage the Gaieties, a theatrical production that both celebrates and pokes fun at the rivalry. The week also includes various other athletic events including \\"The Big Splash\\" (water polo), \\"The Big Spike\\" (volleyball), \\"The Big Sweep\\" (Quidditch), \\"The Big Freeze\\" (ice hockey), \\"The Big Sail\\" (sailing), and the Ink Bowl, a touch football game between the members of the two schools' newspapers. Cal celebrates in San Francisco with an annual cable car rally, hosts a tree chopping rally, has singing competitions, and night rallies through all of the dorms. =Cal= The Football Players, sculpture by Douglas Tilden, placed in the University of California, Berkeley The Big Game Bonfire Rally is a pep and bonfire rally that takes place at University of California, Berkeley in Hearst Greek Theatre on the eve of Big Game. More than 10,000 students gather to hear the history about The Stanford Axe and Big Game. The University of California Rally Committee is in charge of the planning and setting up the bonfire, as well as refueling it during the rally. Specifically, freshman members of the UC Rally Committee, as well as freshman band members are sent out with pallets to the chanting of \\"freshmen, more wood.\\" Several alumni show up to perform traditional rituals. A tradition unique to Cal is the performance of the Haka, a traditional Maori war dance/chant. Traditionally performed by an alumni Yell Leader, the Haka performed was written in the 1960s by a Cal rugby player of Maori descent. The traditional Axe Yell is also made and visits from the UC Men's Octet and Golden Overtones are always expected. The University of California Marching Band is also present, playing traditional Cal songs throughout the duration of the Rally. The highlight of the Rally is the lighting of Big Game Bonfire itself, with the fire reaching its zenith at over eight stories. The Big Game Bonfire Rally always ends with the reciting of a speech known as the \\"Andy Smith Eulogy\\" or \\"The Spirit of California\\". Written by Garff Wilson in remembrance of the fabled Cal football coach, who led the Bears to five straight undefeated seasons starting in 1919 before tragically dying of pneumonia in 1925, the speech closes the Rally annually since 1949. During the speech, candles are passed out among the attendants and are lit for the singing of the campus alma mater, \\"All Hail Blue and Gold.\\" In 2012, the Big Game Bonfire Rally was moved to Edwards Stadium and the bonfire was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict with a Bob Dylan concert. Due to TV contracts, the Pac-12 Conference rescheduled the Big Game from its traditional season-ending slot to October 20, and the Greek Theatre was already booked for the Bob Dylan concert. This was the first time the bonfire had not been held since 1892. The bonfire portion of the rally was cancelled again in 2015 due to the ongoing drought. In 2016, the Fiat Lux torch was added as a symbol of light, with, \\"For the flames of the past, spirit of the present, and light of the future\\" engraved on it. In 2018, the big game was rescheduled due to the unhealthy air quality caused by the Bay Area Campfire. All fire/pyrotechnical elements were cut from the rally. The UC Rally Committee immediately began preparations to re-invent the traditional wood burning structure, as they did not want the fire to extinguish like it had almost 30 years earlier at Stanford. In November 2019, a new sheet metal bonfire structure was unveiled. =Stanford= For decades, Stanford also held a bonfire on the dry lakebed of Lake Lagunita, but this was discontinued in the 1990s due to the lake being a habitat for the vulnerable California tiger salamander. Stanford now holds a Big Game Rally on Angell Field organized by the Stanford Axe Committee. With appearances from the senior football players and various performance groups, it serves to kick off Big Game Week. The story of The Stanford Axe is told by Hal Mickelson, and the Axe Yell is performed by the Yell Leaders of The Stanford Axe Committee. The rally ends with a performance by the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band and a fireworks show. A student- produced play called \\"Gaieties,\\" an annual Big Game week tradition since 1911, pokes fun at Cal and serves to pump students up for the Big Game. Another part of Stanford's tradition was the annual hanging of the substantial \\"Beat Cal\\" banner upon the four story Meyer Library building. This tradition came to an end in 2014 before the building was demolished. Since 2015, the banner has been hung on the western facade of Green Library. Notable games Stanford players lift the Stanford Axe after winning the 2010 Big Game =1924= Both teams came into the game unbeaten with a berth in the 1925 Rose Bowl on the line. With its star Ernie Nevers sidelined due to injuries, Stanford trailed 20‚Äì6 with under 5 minutes to go, but rallied to score twice to force a 20‚Äì20 tie and earn the Rose Bowl bid. =1947= In the 50th Big Game, winless Stanford led the 8‚Äì1 Bears with less than three minutes left in the game, but Cal scored on an 80-yard touchdown pass to clinch a 21‚Äì18 victory. =1959= Stanford quarterback Dick Norman threw for 401 yards (then an NCAA record, and still a Big Game record), but it was not enough to hold off the Bears, who won 20‚Äì17. =1972= Cal drove 62 yards in the final 1:13, culminating in a Vince Ferragamo touchdown pass to Steve Sweeney for a last-second 24‚Äì22 Cal victory. =1974= Mike Langford nailed a 50-yard field goal on the final play for a 22‚Äì20 Stanford triumph over the 19th-ranked Bears. =1982= The Play The conclusion of the 85th Big Game on November 20, 1982 would go down as perhaps the most remarkable play in college football history. Cal held a lead late in the game, but Stanford, led by John Elway, drove down the field to retake the lead, and seemingly elevate Elway to the first bowl game of his college career, since a Stanford victory would have resulted in an invitation to the Hall of Fame Bowl. In what is now known simply as \\"The Play,\\" four Cal players lateraled the ball five times on a kickoff return with four seconds left on the clock. Kevin Moen, who was also the initial ball carrier, ran for a touchdown while knocking down the final Stanford \\"defender,\\" trombone player Gary Tyrrell, who had run onto the field with the rest of the band to celebrate prematurely. The Play is often recounted with KGO radio announcer Joe Starkey's emotional call of The Play, which he hailed as \\"the most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heartrending, exciting, thrilling finish in the history of college football!\\" The legitimacy of The Play has remained controversial among some Stanford fans. The final score in the official record shows Cal winning by a score of 25‚Äì20, whereas in many Stanford publications it is recorded as Stanford 20, Cal 19 due to Stanford's contention that a Cal ball carrier had his knee down and the last lateral was actually an illegal forward pass, either of which should have resulted in the end of the play. In 2007, as part of the buildup to The Play's 25th anniversary, the Bay Area News Group asked Verle Sorgen, the Pac-10 Conference's supervisor of instant replay, to review the two disputed laterals according to modern NCAA instant replay review rules. After watching enhanced footage on a modern, large-screen monitor, Sorgen opined that the fifth lateral from Ford to Moen \\"was released at the 22 and touched at the 20-1/2. From that, it clearly appears forward.\\" Asked for his \\"ultimate call,\\" Sorgen replied, \\"I would be tempted to reverse it...then go out and get the motor running in my car.\\" Del Grande, Dave. \\"Upon further review, The Play wouldn't result in Cal win. Retrieved November 22, 2019. = 1986 = Cal was 1‚Äì9 in the conference, while Stanford was 7-2 and ranked 16th in the nation. Cal's defense dominated the game - Stanford's quarterback John Paye was sacked seven times, while Stanford's running game was held to 41 yards. Cal won the game 17‚Äì11. It was the last game of Cal's coach Joe Kapp, who also coached the Golden Bears in 1982, his first season, when Cal won the Big Game following The Play. =1988= With the score tied, Cal marched to the Stanford 3-yard line with 4 seconds remaining in the game. Called \\"the Cadillac of kickers in college football\\" by Cal coach Bruce Snyder, all Pac-10 and future all-American Robbie Keen lined up for a 21-yard field goal attempt to win the game on the final play. When the ball was snapped, Stanford redshirt freshman Tuan Van Le raced from the left end of the defensive line to block the kick and preserve a 19‚Äì19 tie. As Stanford was the holder of the Axe going into the game, the tie meant the Axe returned to the Farm for another year. The result was celebrated in the stadium as a victory by Stanford as the Axe was paraded by the Stanford Axe Committee and football players before jubilant Cardinal fans, with stunned Bears fans looking on. This was the only Big Game to end in a tie after 1953 and, under current overtime rules, may be the last Big Game to end tied. =1990= This game had echoes of the 1982 game due to late seesaw scoring, the critical role of fans on the field, and the winning points being scored as time expired. It has been called \\"The Payback\\" or \\"The Revenge of the Play\\" by Stanford fans. After trailing since the first quarter, left-footed Stanford kicker John Hopkins kicked his fourth field goal of the game with 9:56 left to give Stanford its first lead at 18‚Äì17. Cal responded with a touchdown and added a two-point conversion to lead 25‚Äì18 with 6:03 left. Stanford stopped Cal on a third and 6 on the Stanford 46 with 2:06 left to play. After Cal's punt, Stanford took its final possession on its own 13 with 1:54 left. Escaping two near interceptions and converting a 4th and 6, Stanford moved the ball to the Cal 19 with 0:17 left. Quarterback Jason Palumbis threw a touchdown pass to Ed McCaffrey in the end zone to make it 25‚Äì24. With no overtime, and despite the fact that a tie would keep the Axe at Stanford for another year, Cardinal coach Dennis Green quickly went for a two-point conversion. Palumbis' pass into the end zone was intercepted by John Hardy and Cal fans and players engulfed the field, causing a lengthy delay and resulting in a 15-yard delay of game penalty. With 12 seconds left and now kicking from the 50 yard line, Hopkins bounced the ensuing onside kick off a Cal player and, after being touched by seven players, the ball was recovered by Stanford's Dan Byers on the Cal 37. With 9 seconds left and no time outs, a pass attempt to McCaffrey to set up a field goal fell short, but Palumbis was roughed on the play moving the ball to the 22 yard line. With 5 seconds left, Hopkins connected on a 39-yard field goal into the wind, giving Stanford a 27‚Äì25 victory as time expired. This time Stanford students and players engulfed the field. The late passing and kicking excitement overshadowed two excellent running performances by Cal's Russell White (177 yards and 2 TD's) and Stanford's Glyn Milburn (196 yards and 1 TD). Milburn also led Stanford receiving with 9 receptions for 66 yards and had 117 return yards. His 379 all-purpose yards set a Pac-10 record at the time and remained Stanford's record until it was eclipsed by Christian McCaffrey's 389 all-purpose yards in the 2015 edition of the Big Game. =2000= Stanford's Casey Moore caught the winning touchdown on the final play of the first-ever Big Game to go into overtime. =2009= Cal's Michael Mohamed intercepted an Andrew Luck pass at the Cal 3-yard line with 1:36 left to preserve a Cal win over #14 Stanford, 34‚Äì28. It was also a rare Big Game where both teams were nationally ranked. =2010= Sixth-ranked Stanford, in a 48‚Äì14 victory, ties Cal's 1975 record for most points scored in a Big Game. =2013= Winning 63‚Äì13, #10 Stanford set the record for most points scored in a Big Game, shattering the previous record of 48 shared by Cal in 1975 and Stanford in 2010. The 50-point victory margin also set a Big Game record, breaking the previous record that had stood for 83 years when Stanford beat Cal 41‚Äì0 in 1930. The 76 total points scored by both teams broke the record of 66 set in 2000. With the victory, Stanford clinched the Pac-12 North Division Championship while Cal ended its season at 1‚Äì11, the most losses in one season in Cal football history. = 2018 = The 2018 Big Game was originally scheduled to be played on November 17, but was rescheduled to December 1 at 12:00 noon, because of unhealthy air quality in the Bay Area caused by the Camp Fire. Stanford continued its streak, winning for the ninth time in a row, beating Cal 23‚Äì13. = 2019 = Down 20‚Äì17 with 2:23 remaining, the Cal offense engineered a six-play, 75-yard drive culminating in a 16-yard touchdown run from quarterback Chase Garbers to give the Bears their first lead of the game. Cal linebacker Evan Weaver would seal the 24‚Äì20 victory for the Bears with a dramatic fourth-and-one stop on Cardinal running back Cameron Scarlett on the subsequent possession, setting off a raucous celebration on Stanford's home turf as the Axe would return to Berkeley after nearly a decade away.

History LSJUMB rallying fans at Stanford Stadium. The LSJUMB was formed in 1893. However, its modern era began in 1963 with the hiring of Arthur P. Barnes as interim director (he got the full-time post two years later). Previous director Julius Shuchat had been very popular, and his ouster caused several members to go on strike. However, according to band lore, Barnes immediately won the band's loyalty by ceding any meaningful control over it. As a result, the band is almost entirely student-run. In 1972, the Band went from an all- male band to co-ed. The band and its new director also clicked over his arrangement of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", which featured the striking effect of a single trumpet playing the first half of the song, joined later by soft woodwinds and tuba, and finally bringing the full power of the brass only in the final verse.

Kennedy, Barnes said, \\"I've never heard such a loud silence.\\" Empowered, the student-led band threw away the traditional marching music and military-style uniforms, eventually settling for a mostly rock and roll repertoire and a simplified uniform consisting of a white fishing hat with red trim (and as many buttons as will fit), red blazer, black pants, and \\"the ugliest tie you can get your hands on.\\" In the springtime and at non-athletic events, band members appear at performances (and sometimes even at rehearsals) wearing \\"rally\\" attire, which can range from swim suits to Halloween costumes to furniture and pets, always displaying their freedom from the usual rules of fashion. Its Badonkadonk Land Cruiser, resembling a vehicle from the Star Wars movie Return of the Jedi), is used as a band-support vehicle. Songs and shows LSJUMB pre-game show at Stanford Stadium. The band's repertoire is heavy on classic rock of the 1970s, particularly songs by Tower of Power, Santana, and The Who. In the 1990s, more modern music was introduced, including songs by Green Day and The Offspring. For many years, it has billed itself as \\"The World's Largest Rock 'n Roll Band.\\" The de facto fight song is \\"All Right Now,\\" originally performed by Free. Another frequently played song in their repertoire is \\"White Punks on Dope\\", originally by The Tubes. The band prides itself on its vast song selection, never playing the same song twice in one day (except for \\"All Right Now\\"). It has a library of over 1,000 songs at its disposal, 69 of which are in active rotation. One of the first collegiate marching bands to record and release their music, the band has produced thirteen albums since 1967. Arrangements focus on the loudest brass instruments‚Äîtrumpets, mellophones, and trombones‚Äîand percussion‚Äîone bass drum (called the Axis o' Rhythm), snare drums, and single tenor drums. This led a Rolling Stone writer to note in 1987, \\"It's hard for anyone raised on rock to imagine that a band could sound this loud without thousands of watts of amplification.\\" Many traditional band instruments like bells and glockenspiels are altogether absent. Traditional \\"marching\\" is also missing, as the band \\"scatters\\" from one formation to the next. The halftime field shows feature formations that are silly or suggestive shapes, as well as words. A team of Stanford students writes a script for the halftime show, delivered over the public address system, which provides a basic explanation for the band's formations. =Stunts and incidents= The LSJUMB (background) doing the Roman salute, some holding dollar bills, as USC's fight song is played by the Spirit of Troy in the (foreground). The LSJUMB's behavior has made them notorious. They have been criticized and disciplined for their actions on several occasions, and according to Peter Sagal of NPR in 2006, the LSJUMB is \\"the only university marching band...repeatedly fined and banned by the NCAA\\". * In 1970 on September 12 at the Stanford-Arkansas football game, the band dropped their pants during the nationally televised halftime show. https://news.stanford.edu/thedish/2013/10/14/the-stanford-band-is-celebrating- its-50th-anniversary-as-a-scatter-band-now-thatll-be-a-party/ *In the 1970s, one halftime show lampooned California student Patty Hearst's kidnapping with a formation called the Hearst Burger ‚Äî two buns and no patty. *The LSJUMB has been banned from Disneyland due to their antics, such as taking over the microphone on the Storyland Canal boats, while visiting in Anaheim for the 1972 Rose Bowl. Disneyland officials were upset with the \\"true story\\" behind the ride. Additionally the Rose Bowl committee still requires advance review if the band marches in the parade due to their plan to ride golf carts instead of marching in 1971 and their having kegs of beer on a red wagon and passing out drinks to the crowd The band also spelled out the initials SMUT (Stanford Marching Unit Thinkers ‚Äì an official acronym for the group of band members who conceive the show) on the field before the 1972 Rose Bowl. *In 1986, the University suspended the band from traveling to the UCLA football game scheduled on November 8, 1986 after incidents in previous games that season. First, on October 11, 1986, an infamous incident of public urination happened following the home football game against the Washington Huskies. Second, during the halftime show of the home USC game on October 25, 1986, the band spelled out \\"NO BALLZ\\" and formed male genitalia. Finally, they performed an anagram show and spelled out an anagram of a four-letter word (\\"NCUT\\"). After the UCLA game suspension was served, the band appeared at the Cal game wearing angel halos in an attempt to apologize and get invited to travel with the football team to a bowl game. The band attended the Gator Bowl that year, amid very close scrutiny. *In 1989, before an away game against USC, the USC Trojan Marching Band toilet-papered the Stanford tree mascot in the Coliseum tunnel before the pre-game show, resulting in a free-for-all between members of both bands and the mascot that had to be broken up by the referees. *In 1990, Stanford suspended the band for a single game after their halftime show at the University of Oregon criticized the logging of the spotted owl's habitats in the northwest United States. The band used formations in the shape of a chainsaw and in the shape of the word OWL changing to AWOL. Governor Neil Goldschmidt (a member of the Oregon Democratic Party) issued a decree that the band not return to Oregon for several years; the band did not return until 2001. After the spotted owl incident, all halftime shows were reviewed and approved by Stanford's Athletic Department. *In 1991, the University of Notre Dame banned the LSJUMB from visiting its campus after a halftime show at Stanford in which drum major Eric Selvik dressed as a nun and conducted the band using a wooden cross as a baton. (During the pregame show and first half of the game, the drum major had been dressed as an Orthodox Jew, where the wooden cross was part of a menorah-like baton.) After the halftime show, a female Notre Dame fan ran onto the field, approached from behind the unsuspecting Selvik, and forcibly ripped the nun habit off of his head. Selvik pursued and regained his habit from the attacker, who in the scuffle for the habit told the drum major he was \\"going to hell for this.\\" *In 1992, the LSJUMB was denied entrance to Disneyland after being invited there to play in connection with the Pigskin Classic III, which pitted Stanford against Texas A&M.; *In 1992, Stanford's athletic department pressured the LSJUMB to fire its announcer after one used the phrase \\"No chuppah, no schtuppa\\" at a San Jose State University game halftime show. *In 1994, the band was disciplined after nineteen members skipped a field rehearsal in Los Angeles to play outside the Los Angeles County Superior Courthouse during jury selection for the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The band's song selection included an arrangement of The Zombies' \\"She's Not There.\\" Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro described the incident to the media as \\"a new low in tasteless behavior.\\" Later that year, during the halftime show of the football game against USC (where Simpson had played football and won the 1968 Heisman Trophy), band members drove a white Ford Bronco with bloody handprints around the Stanford Stadium track, an obvious allusion to the low-speed chase in which police followed a white Bronco carrying Simpson around the Los Angeles area. *In 1997, the band was again disciplined for shows lampooning Catholicism and the Irish at a game against Notre Dame. The band put on a show entitled \\"These Irish, Why Must they Fight?\\" Besides the mocking supposedly stereotypical Irish-Catholic behavior, there was a Riverdance formation, and a Great Famine joke, drawing criticism for its \\"tasteless\\" portrayal of Catholics. Stanford President Gerhard Casper subsequently apologized for the band's behavior; the band and the athletic director also apologized. Subsequently, the band was prohibited from playing at games against Notre Dame for two years. *In 1999, when UCLA football players were caught in an ADA-accessible parking scandal, the band formed a disability-accessible symbol on the field, and wheeled the Stanford Tree in on a wheelchair. *In 2002 and 2006, the band was sanctioned for off-the-field behavior, including violations of the University alcohol policy. *In 2004, the band drew national attention and Mormon ire for joking about polygamy during a game against Brigham Young University. The Dollies appeared in wedding veils with the band manager of the time kneeling and \\"proposing\\" to each in turn as the announcer referred to marriage as \\"the sacred bond that exists between a man and a woman... and a woman... and a woman... and a woman... and a woman.\\" *The band's hijinks were given a wider audience when they became the subject of Alan Alda's appearance on the \\"Not My Job\\" segment on NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! on September 9, 2006. *In 2006, the band was suspended by Stanford administrators when their former \\"Band Shak\\" was vandalized. After moving into a new $2.8 million facility, the previous Shak, a trailer that served as a temporary home for the band, was found with broken windows and profanities spray painted on the walls. Administrators believed members of the band were responsible for the damage, as the band had believed the trailer was to be demolished the next day. The Band was placed on a provisional status for several months, and had many privileges taken away for the duration of the suspension, including the right to be freely student-run. The band was also barred from performing at halftime of the 2006 Big Game as a result. However, the University two stated that November they would not press vandalism charges. In March 2007, the University exonerated the individual Band members involved in the incident. It also charged the band $8,000 for damages (though it initially estimated damages of $50,000). In July 2007, the band was fully reinstated, and then two months later, the band's alcohol probation was also lifted. *In 2009, the band performed a field show at USC that openly criticized USC alum & Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis, drawing ire from fans with lines like, \\"USC can't take all of the credit for the successes of its students. After all, it takes a special kind of man to be wanted for sexual harassment, drug trafficking, tax evasion, prostitution, child abuse and disruptive flatulence. But that's just the kind of captain of industry Joe Francis is.\\" *Organizers of the 2011 Orange Bowl supposedly banned the band from performing their halftime show upon announcement of its theme: \\"Recent Events in the Pro Sports World in Miami\\"; this was done out of concern of hurting the feelings of athletes such as LeBron James, who had controversially joined the Miami Heat the previous summer. This was later revealed to be a misinterpretation as the game reserved halftime for the Goo Goo Dolls and the bands from both universities were limited to a pre game show. *In 2015, following a joint investigation by Stanford's Organization Conduct Board (OCB) and Title IX Office, it was announced that the band would be prohibited from performing at away athletic events for one year and would be required to adopt a number of reforms. The university initiated the joint inquiry after learning of concerns regarding several band events, including off-campus trips, that the band held for its members between 2012 and 2015. The investigation found that, on several occasions, the band violated university policies regarding alcohol, controlled substances, hazing and/or sexual harassment. Violations included a tradition in which a band member was given an alcoholic concoction intended to make that individual vomit publicly; an annual trip in which some band members used illegal substances; and a band selection process in which individuals were asked a number of inappropriate questions on sexual matters. *At halftime of the 2016 Rose Bowl Game, the band performed a show that included the jingle from the Farmersonly.com dating website, formations that included a corn maze and a sad farmer, and an enactment of \\"cow tipping\\". The performance was taken by many as insulting farmers, the state of Iowa, and the University of Iowa (Stanford's opponent in the game). However, Stanford itself is also commonly nicknamed \\"The Farm\\". The band was booed by Iowa fans, and the incident sparked outrage on social media. A transcript of the field show can be found on the band's Facebook page. *In December 2016, a Stanford Organizational Conduct Board panel found the band responsible for new violations of campus alcohol policy, the alcohol suspension and the travel ban. The OCB panel found ‚Äúa systemic cultural problem‚Äù in the band organization and concluded that ‚Äúthe outstanding issues have not been taken seriously by the band or its leadership and that nothing more will be accomplished without extreme consequences.‚Äù The band was required to stop all activities and lose its status as a registered student group. The suspension was expected to last through the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, but the band successfully appealed the decision to Provost John Etchemendy. The appeal placed the band on a \\"provisional status\\" through the end of the 2016‚Äì2017 school year. *At halftime of the 2017 Alamo Bowl, the band performed a routine that appeared to mock various things about the state of Texas, including Whataburger. Fans in attendance at the game booed the routine. =The Play= The Band's most infamous and controversial moment, however, had nothing to do with its irreverence. In the final four seconds of the 1982 Big Game against the University of California, Berkeley (Cal), band members (as well as players from Stanford) ran out onto the field, thinking the game was over after Stanford players appeared to have tackled ball-carrier Dwight Garner. Garner managed to lateral it to another player, and they continued to lateral back and forth, with Cal's Kevin Moen dodging through the band for a winning touchdown, which he ended by running over LSJUMB trombone player Gary Tyrrell in the end zone.\\"The Play\\" is celebrated by Cal fans and inspires the ire of many Stanford fans. To this day, it remains one of the most famous and controversial plays in American football history. In 2002, during the Big Game halftime show, the LSJUMB performed a humorous re- enactment of The Play. Special emphasis was placed on the allegation that California player Garner's knee touched the ground before his lateral; all band members performing the re-enactment froze in place at this stage, and a single member, carrying a large yellow arrow, ran out and repeatedly pointed at the \\"down\\" Garner. Officials at the time did not call Garner down and though no instant replay rule was in effect at the time, game tape appears inconclusive. To this day the position of Band Manager is conferred from one generation to the next with four seconds left in the Big Game in commemoration of The Play. The Dollies The Dollies, a five-member female dance group, and the Stanford Tree, the University's de facto mascot (the de jure mascot is the color cardinal), operate under the band's aegis. The Dollies were incorporated into the Band in 1953 per 1954-56 band manager Donald Wells. The Dollies appear at all sporting events and school/community rallies with the Stanford Band and Tree. The Dollies are a dance group, rather than cheerleaders in the typical sense. They are a separate entity from the Stanford Cheer team. Dollies are managed by their Dollie Daddy/Mama/Parent (the Band's assistant manager or \\"ass-man\\"/\\"ass-ma'am\\"), and they choreograph their own routines, hold their own practices, and design their own dresses and costumes. Traditional dress colors are white for the spring, red for the fall, and cardinal for the winter. The Dollies are numbered 1‚Äì5 in order of height (shortest to tallest). Dollies serve one-year terms, and each year five new dancers are chosen by previous Dollies and the band. Try-outs are held in February and culminate in \\"Dollie Day,\\" when prospective Dollies (\\"ProDos\\") demonstrate their ability in front of the entire assembled band. Each year's new Dollie cadre is revealed at the annual \\"Dollie Splash,\\" where the Dollies give their debut performance in the spring for the public followed by a dunking in the Stanford Claw.

R. R. Tolkien. Contents This volume, along with the subsequent The War of the Jewels, provides detailed writings and editorial commentary pertaining to J. R. R. Tolkien's cosmology that eventually would become The Silmarillion. This volume mentions a few characters excluded elsewhere, including Findis and Irim√´, the daughters of Finw√´. The title of this volume comes from a statement in one of the essays: \\"Just as Sauron concentrated his power in the One Ring, Morgoth dispersed his power into the very matter of Arda, thus the whole of Middle-earth was Morgoth's Ring\\". Morgoth's Ring presents source materials and editorial commentary on the following: * Later (1951) revisions of The Silmarillion, showing Tolkien's drastic revisiting and rewriting of his legends. * \\"Annals of Aman\\" ‚Äî a detailed chronology from the creation of the world through to the end of the First Age, including an explanation of time reckoning in Valian Years. * \\"Laws and Customs among the Eldar\\" ‚Äî several essays and legends on the Eldar or of the Elves, particularly their mating and naming customs, and their conceptions of the f√´a (soul) and hr√∂a (body). * \\"Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth\\" ‚Äî A discussion between two characters, Finrod Felagund, an Elven king, and Andreth, a mortal woman, about the tragedy of death and immortality, and the ways in which Elves and Men suffer their different sorrows; and about the healing of death by the Resurrection and the Incarnation, which Tolkien here hints at, but later decided not to bring into his legendarium. * \\"Tale of Adanel\\" ‚Äî the Middle-earth version of the Fall, attached to \\"Athrabeth\\". * \\"Myths Transformed\\" ‚Äî several fragments on Morgoth, Sauron, and the problem of the origin of the Orcs. This section, which proposes inconsistent solutions to the problem, is frequently cited in discussions concerning the Tolkien legendarium, and represents the author's later-evolved views on some central topics. =The Annals of Aman= The Annals of Aman date to the period following the completion of The Lord of the Rings. There are three extant versions of the text, including a carefully emended manuscript, a typescript and its carbon copy, each featuring different corrections and notes, and a typescript of the earlier sections of the text that deviates from the previous typescript. Christopher Tolkien surmises that the first typescript was composed in 1958. A reworking of the earlier Annals of Valinor (which was the working title of the manuscript until Tolkien changed it) and connected closely with the narrative of the incomplete 1937 Quenta Silmarillion, The Annals of Aman moves from a compressed narrative style to a fuller accounting of the events of the chronology. The Annals of Aman presents the history of the world from the entry of the Valar into Arda until the Hiding of Valinor after the revolt and exile of the Noldor in the form of year-by-year entries of varying lengths, much in the style of real-world annals. Tolkien attributes the work to the Noldorin lore-master and linguist R√∫mil of Tirion. According to the second typescript, The Annals of Aman were remembered by the Noldorin Exiles in Middle-earth, who transmitted their knowledge to the Men of N√∫menor, whence it eventually reached Arnor and Gondor. Title page The title page of each volume of The History of Middle-earth displays an inscription in the F√´anorian characters (Tengwar, an alphabet devised by Tolkien for High-elven), written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book.

King Biscuit Time is the longest-running daily American radio broadcast in history. The program is broadcast each weekday from KFFA in Helena, Arkansas, United States, and has won the George Foster Peabody Award for broadcasting excellence. In 2018, certain selections of King Biscuit Time from 1965 were selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\\" History and description The first broadcast of King Biscuit Time was on November 21, 1941 on KFFA in Helena, and featured blues artists Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller) and Robert Lockwood, Jr. Williamson and Lockwood played live in the studio and were the key musicians in the original studio band, the 'King Biscuit Entertainers.' Other musicians who joined the original band were Pinetop Perkins on piano and James Peck Curtis on drums. Williamson left the program in 1947, but returned for a stint in 1965 just prior to his death. The 30-minute-long live radio program is broadcast at 12:15 pm every weekday and was named after the local brand of flour, King Biscuit Flour, distributed by the Interstate Grocer Company. The distributor financed the show at the behest of Williamson in exchange for endorsements and naming rights. KFFA was the only station that would play music by African-Americans, and it reached an audience throughout the Mississippi Delta region. It inspired blues musicians including B.B. King, Robert Nighthawk, James Cotton, and Ike Turner. The show's 12:15 pm time slot was chosen to match the lunch break of workers in the Delta. King Biscuit Time celebrated its 17,000th broadcast on May 13, 2014. KBT has more broadcasts than the Grand Ole Opry and American Bandstand. From 1951 until his death in 2018, the program was hosted by the award-winning \\"Sunshine\\" Sonny PayneHelena Loses Blues Legend Helena World, February 9, 2018 who opened each broadcast with \\"pass the biscuits, 'cause it's King Biscuit Time!\\" Before Payne, the show was hosted by Hugh Smith, from 1943‚Äì1951. Over the years the biggest names in blues have been associated with the program, and important blues artists continue to perform live. Influence and related projects The popularity of the program made Helena a major blues center. Helena became a stopping place for blues musicians on their way from the Delta region to the Chicago blues nightclubs and was also convenient to Memphis, Tennessee and its lively blues culture. Several blues musicians came to Helena and made it their home, such as Little Walter Jacobs and Jimmy Rogers. King Biscuit Time was also a major breakthrough for African-American music in general. The popularity of the program and its reach into the untapped African-American demographic gained notice and spawned a host of imitators. By 1947 the first black disc jockey in the South, Early Wright, had been signed at WROX across the river. WDIA in Memphis soon became the first radio station in the South with an all black staff (including deejay B.B. King) and musical format based on the success of King Biscuit Time. Levon Helm, the late drummer and vocalist for The Band, credited King Biscuit Time, and in particular James Peck Curtis, for inspiring his musical career.Helm, Levon (2013). This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band (Updated Edition), pp. 24-27. A Cappella Books, Chicago, Illinois. . Musician King Biscuit Boy was given that stage name by Ronnie Hawkins. The King Biscuit Flower Hour is a one-hour syndicated rock and roll radio program, the name of which was derived from King Biscuit Time. In 1986, the first annual King Biscuit Blues Festival (later renamed to Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival and returned to King Biscuit Blues Festival in 2011) was held in Helena, attracting thousands of blues aficionados from around the world. A magazine spin-off, King Biscuit Time edited by Donald Wilcock, has won several awards from the Blues Foundation, including the \\"Keeping the Blues Alive Award\\", and features interviews and biographies of major blues personalities.

Similar programs include sea-grant colleges (instituted in 1966) and sun-grant colleges (instituted in 2003). Objectives The program claims the following objectives:National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program(Space Grant) 2010-2014. Retrieved March 24, 2014. * Establish and maintain a national network of universities with interests and capabilities in aeronautics, outer space, and related fields; * Encourage cooperative programs among universities, the aerospace industry, and federal, state, and local governments; * Encourage interdisciplinary training, research, and public service programs related to aerospace; * Recruit and train U.S. citizens, especially women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities, for careers in aerospace science and technology; and, * Promote a strong science, mathematics, and technology education base from elementary through secondary levels. History The National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program was established in 1988 by the US Congress following the success of similar scholarship opportunities in the oceanic Sea Grant and agricultural Land Grant fields. The catch-all term Space Grant refers back to these previous federal programs. In 1989, the program was given over to NASA, which now administers it in the same way that NOAA administers Sea Grant. The first meeting of the National Council of Space Grant Directors took place from January 16, 1990 to January 19, 1990 at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Columbia, Maryland, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California. http://national.spacegrant.org/index.php?page=history , National Council of NASA Space Grant Directors.

It is a national network of 33 Sea Grant Colleges and universities involved in scientific research, education, training, and extension projects geared toward the conservation and practical use of the coasts, Great Lakes, and other marine areas. The program is administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is based in Silver Spring, Maryland. No sea rights have actually been granted (though this was considered), only money. There are 33 university-based programs in every coastal and Great Lakes state, Puerto Rico, and Guam, called Sea Grant colleges. The program was instituted in 1966 when Congress passed the National Sea Grant College Program Act. Sea Grant colleges are not to be confused with land-grant colleges (a program instituted in 1862), space-grant colleges (instituted in 1988), or sun-grant colleges (instituted in 2003), although an institution may also be in one or more of the other programs concurrently with being a Sea Grant institution. History of the Sea Grant College Program At a 1963 meeting of the American Fisheries Society, a University of Minnesota professor, Athelstan Spilhaus, first suggested the establishment of Sea Grant colleges in universities that wished to develop oceanic work.Jim Murray and Bruce Wilkins, \\"The Philosophy: What do we do?\\", in Fundamentals of a Sea Grant Extension Program The name \\"Sea Grant\\" was chosen to draw a parallel with the land grant college program that was funded by grants of western lands to the states by the 1862 Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862. Early in the legislative process, there was consideration of leases of offshore parcels of ocean and sea bottom to fund the program by John A. Knauss and bill sponsor Claiborne Pell much like the 1862 land grants, but that plan was eventually scrapped in favor of direct congressional appropriation for the program. The 1966 Act allowed the National Science Foundation (NSF) authority to initiate and support education, research, and extension by: > Encouraging and developing programs consisting of instruction, practical > demonstrations, publications, and otherwise, by sea grant colleges and other > suitable institutes, laboratories, and public and private agencies through > marine advisory programs with the object of imparting useful information to > person currently employed or interested in the various fields related to the > development of marine resources, the scientific community, and the general > public.National Sea Grant College and Program Act of 1966. Signing of the 1966 Sea Grant College and Program Act into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson was on October 15, 1966, as Public Law 89-688. The only major subsequent change to the Sea Grant Act was with a 1970 Reorganization Plan, whereby the Office of Sea Grant was transferred from the National Science Foundation to the newly organized National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where it still resides today.

A functioning mosque, it also attracts large numbers of tourist visitors. It was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I. Its K√ºlliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice. Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque‚Äôs interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque‚Äôs five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes. It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, the principal mosque of Istanbul until the Blue Mosque's construction and another popular tourist site.  History  After the Peace of Zsitvatorok and the crushing loss in the 1603‚Äì18 war with Persia, Sultan Ahmet I decided to build a large mosque in Istanbul to reassert Ottoman power. It would be the first imperial mosque for more than forty years. While his predecessors had paid for their mosques with the spoils of war, Ahmet I procured funds from the Treasury, because he had not gained remarkable victories. The construction was started in 1609 and completed in 1616. It caused the anger of the ulama, the Muslim jurists. The mosque was built on the site of the palace of the Byzantine emperors, in front of the basilica Hagia Sophia (at that time, the primary imperial mosque in Istanbul) and the hippodrome, a site of significant symbolic meaning as it dominated the city skyline from the south. Big parts of the south shore of the mosque rest on the foundations, the vaults of the old Grand Palace.  Architecture  The Sultan Ahmed Mosque has five main domes, six minarets, and eight secondary domes. The design is the culmination of two centuries of Ottoman mosque development. It incorporates many Byzantine elements of the neighboring Hagia Sophia with traditional Islamic architecture and is considered to be the last great mosque of the classical period. The architect, Sedefk√¢r Mehmed Aƒüa, synthesized the ideas of his master Sinan, aiming for overwhelming size, majesty and splendor. The upper area is decorated with approximately 20,000 hand-painted glazed ceramic in 60 different tulip patterns. The lower stories are illuminated by 200 stained glass windows. The mosque is preceded by a forecourt with a large fountain and special area for ablution. An iron chain hangs in the court entrance on the western side. Only the Sultan was allowed to ride into the mosque horseback, and he would need to lower his head to not hit the chain, a symbolic gesture ensuring the humility of the ruler before Allah. By way of his works he left a decided mark on Istanbul. The square on which the Sultan Ahmed Mosque is situated became known as Sultanahmet. This mosque can be considered the culmination of his career. Mehmed Agha, who was the last student of Mimar Sinan, had completed his mission by adding his brighter, colorful architectural style to that of his master teacher. = Interior = Interior view, featuring the prayer area and the main dome. At its lower levels and at every pier, the interior of the mosque is lined with more than 20,000 handmade ƒ∞znik style ceramic tiles, made at ƒ∞znik (the ancient Nicaea) in more than fifty different tulip designs. The tiles at lower levels are traditional in design, while at gallery level their design becomes flamboyant with representations of flowers, fruit and cypresses. The tiles were made under the supervision of the Iznik master. The price to be paid for each tile was fixed by the sultan's decree, while tile prices in general increased over time. As a result, the quality of the tiles used in the building decreased gradually. The upper levels of the interior are dominated by blue paint. More than 200 stained glass windows with intricate designs admit natural light, today assisted by chandeliers. On the chandeliers, ostrich eggs are found that were meant to avoid cobwebs inside the mosque by repelling spiders. The decorations include verses from the Qur'an, many of them made by Seyyid Kasim Gubari, regarded as the greatest calligrapher of his time. The floors are covered with carpets, which are donated by the faithful and are regularly replaced as they wear out. The many spacious windows confer a spacious impression. The casements at floor level are decorated with opus sectile. Each exedra has five windows, some of which are blind. Each semi-dome has 14 windows and the central dome 28 (four of which are blind). The coloured glass for the windows was a gift of the Signoria of Venice to the sultan. The most important element in the interior of the mosque is the mihrab, which is made of finely carved and sculptured marble, with a stalactite niche and a double inscriptive panel above it. It is surrounded by many windows. The adjacent walls are sheathed in ceramic tiles. To the right of the mihrab is the richly decorated minber, or pulpit, where the imam stands when he is delivering his sermon at the time of noon prayer on Fridays or on holy days. The mosque has been designed so that even when it is at its most crowded, everyone in the mosque can see and hear the imam. The royal kiosk is situated at the south-east corner. It comprises a platform, a loggia and two small retiring rooms. It gives access to the royal loge in the south-east upper gallery of the mosque. These retiring rooms became the headquarters of the Grand Vizier during the suppression of the rebellious Janissary Corps in 1826. The royal loge (h√ºnk√¢r mahfil) is supported by ten marble columns. It has its own mihrab, which used to be decorated with a jade rose and gilt√ñz, T., \\"Sultan Ahmet Camii' in Vakiflar Dergisi, I, Ankara, 1938 and with one hundred Qurans on an inlaid and gilded lecterns. The many lamps inside the mosque were once covered with gold and gems.Naima M., Annals of the Turkish Empire from 1591 to 1659 of the Christian Era; Frazer, London, 1832 Among the glass bowls one could find ostrich eggs and crystal balls.Tournefort, J.P., Marquis de, Relation d'un voyage du Levant, Amsterdam, 1718 All these decorations have been removed or pillaged for museums. The great tablets on the walls are inscribed with the names of the caliphs and verses from the Quran. They were originally by the great 17th- century calligrapher Seyyid Kasim Gubari of Diyarbakƒ±r but have been repeatedly restored. It was first announced that the mosque would undertake a series of renovations back in 2016. Numerous renovation works had been completed throughout Istanbul and the restoration of the Blue Mosque was to be the final project. Renovations were expected to take place over three and a half years and be completed by 2020. = Exterior = Blue Mosque During Evening The fa√ßade of the spacious forecourt was built in the same manner as the fa√ßade of the S√ºleymaniye Mosque, except for the addition of the turrets on the corner domes. The court is about as large as the mosque itself and is surrounded by a continuous vaulted arcade (revak). It has ablution facilities on both sides. The central hexagonal fountain is small relative to the courtyard. The monumental but narrow gateway to the courtyard stands out architecturally from the arcade. Its semi-dome has a fine stalactite structure, crowned by a small ribbed dome on a tall tholobate. Its historical elementary school (Sƒ±byan Mektebi) is used as \\"Mosque Information Center\\" which is adjacent to its outer wall on the side of Hagia Sophia. This is where they provide visitors with a free orientational presentation on the Blue Mosque and Islam in general. A heavy iron chain hangs in the upper part of the court entrance on the western side. Only the sultan was allowed to enter the court of the mosque on horseback. The chain was put there, so that the sultan had to lower his head every single time he entered the court to avoid being hit. This was a symbolic gesture, to ensure the humility of the ruler in the face of the divine. = Minarets = Minarets of the mosque. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque is one of the five mosques in Turkey that has six minarets (one in the modern Sabancƒ± Mosque in Adana, the Muƒüdat Mosque in Mersin, √áamlƒ±ca Mosque in √úsk√ºdar and the Green mosque in Arnavutk√∂y). According to folklore, an architect misheard the Sultan's request for \\"altƒ±n minareler\\" (gold minarets) as \\"altƒ± minare\\" (six minarets), at the time a unique feature of the mosque of the Ka'aba in Mecca. When criticized for his presumption, the Sultan then ordered a seventh minaret to be built at the Mecca mosque. Four minarets stand at the corners of the Blue Mosque. Each of these fluted, pencil-shaped minarets has three balconies (Called ≈üerefe) with stalactite corbels, while the two others at the end of the forecourt only have two balconies. Before the muezzin or prayer caller had to climb a narrow spiral staircase five times a day to announce the call to prayer.  Pope Benedict XVI's visit  Pope Benedict XVI visited the Sultan Ahmed Mosque on 30 November 2006 during his visit to Turkey. It was only the second papal visit in history to a Muslim place of worship. Having removed his shoes, the Pope paused for a full two minutes, eyes closed in silent meditation, standing side by side with Mustafa √áaƒürƒ±cƒ±, the Mufti of Istanbul, and Emrullah Hatipoƒülu, the Imam of the Blue Mosque. The pope ‚Äúthanked divine Providence for this‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúMay all believers identify themselves with the one God and bear witness to true brotherhood.‚Äù The pontiff noted that Turkey ‚Äúwill be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West‚Äù, and he thanked the Turkish people ‚Äúfor the cordiality and sympathy‚Äù they showed him throughout his stay, saying, ‚Äúhe felt loved and understood.‚Äù Gallery File:Levni.

The technology was developed by General Instrument, which was succeeded by Motorola and subsequently by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital cable during the 2000s, during the period that broadcast television converted to the digital HDTV standard, which was incompatible with existing analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide more services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. History In 1990, General Instrument (now owned by ARRIS Group) demonstrated that it was possible to use digital compression to deliver high quality HDTV in a standard 6 MHz television channel. Using the same technology General Instrument (GI) demonstrated the digital transmission of multiple high quality standard definition programs in a 6 MHz cable channel. In the 1990s, cable providers began to invest heavily in this new multi-channel digital TV technology to expand the number of channels and services available to subscribers. Increased competition and programming choices from direct-broadcast satellite services such as DirecTV, Dish Network, and PrimeStar caused cable providers to seek new ways to provide more programming. Customers were increasingly interested in more channels, pay-per-view programming, digital music services, and high speed internet services. By 2000, most cable providers in the US were offering some form of digital cable TV to their customers. Digital cable technology has allowed cable providers to compress video channels so that they take up less bandwidth and to offer two-way communication capabilities. This has enabled providers to offer more channels, video-on-demand services that don't require a separate telephone line, telephone services, high speed internet services, and interactive television services. Digital cable implements error correction to ensure the integrity of the received signal and uses a secure digital distribution system (i.e. a secure encrypted signal to prevent eavesdropping and theft of service.) Most digital cable providers use QAM for video services and DOCSIS standards for data services. Some providers have also begun to roll out video services using IPTV or Switched video. Channels Digital cable technology can allow many TV channels to occupy the frequency space that would normally be occupied by a single analog cable TV channel. The number of channels placed on a single analog frequency depends on the compression used. Many cable providers are able to fit about 10 digital SD channels or 2 digital HD channels on a single analog channel frequency. Some providers are able to squeeze more channels onto a single frequency with higher compression, but often this can cause the video quality of the channel to degrade. The addition of this capability complicates the notion of a \\"channel\\" in digital cable (as well as in over-the-air ATSC digital broadcasts). The formal names for the two numbers that now identify a channel are the physical channel and the subchannel. The physical channel is a number corresponding to a specific 6 MHz frequency range. See: North American cable television frequencies. The subchannel is a logical channel of data within the physical channel. Technically there can be up to 1024 subchannels in a physical channel, though in practice only a few are used (as the bandwidth must be divided among all the subchannels). There are two ways providers try to make this easier for consumers. The first, accomplished through PSIP, is where program and channel information is broadcast along with the video, allowing the consumer's decoder (set-top box or display) to automatically identify the many channels and subchannels. The second (also accomplished through PSIP) is where, in an effort to hide subchannels entirely, many cable companies map virtual channel numbers to underlying physical and sub-channels. For example, a cable company might call channel 5-1 \\"channel 732\\" and channel 5-2 \\"channel 733\\". This also allows the cable company to change the frequency of a channel without changing what the customer sees as a channel number. In such arrangements, the physical/sub-channel numbers are called the \\"QAM channel\\", and the alternative channel designation is called the \\"mapped channel\\", \\"virtual channel\\", or simply \\"channel\\". In theory, a set-top box can decode the PSIP information from every channel it receives and use that information to build the mapping between QAM channel and virtual channel. However, cable companies do not always reliably transmit PSIP information. Alternatively, CableCards receive the channel mapping and can communicate that to the set-top box. Technical information The standard for signal transmission over digital cable television systems in the United States is now fixed as both 64-QAM and 256-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), which is specified in SCTE 07, and is part of the DVB standard (but not ATSC). This method carries 38.47 Mbit/s using 256-QAM on a 6 MHz channel, which can carry nearly two full ATSC 19.39 Mbit/s transport streams. Each 6-MHz channel is typically used to carry 7-12 digital SDTV channels (256-QAM, MPEG2 MP/ML streams of 3-5 Mbit/s). On many boxes with QAM tuners (most notably the DVR boxes), high definition versions of local channels, and some cable channels are available. Digital cable allows for the broadcast of EDTV (480p) as well as HDTV (720p, 1080i, and eventually 1080p). By contrast, analog cable transmits programs solely in the 480i format (the lowest television definition in use today). The Advanced Television Systems Committee standards include a provision for 16-VSB transmission over cable at 38.4 Mbit/s, but the encoding has not yet gained wide acceptance. Some MATV systems may carry 8-VSB and QAM signals, mostly in apartment buildings and similar facilities that use a combination of terrestrial antennas and cable distribution sources (such as HITS or \\"Headend in the Sky\\", a unit of Comcast that delivers digital channels by satellite to small cable systems). Digital cable channels typically are allocated above 552 MHz, the upper frequency of cable channel 78. (Cable channels above channel 13 are at lower frequencies than UHF broadcast channels with the same number, as seen in North American cable television frequencies.) Between 552 and 750 MHz, there is space for 33 6-MHz channels (231-396 SDTV channels); when going all the way to 864 MHz, there is space for 52 6-MHz channels (364-624 SDTV channels). In the U.S., digital cable systems with 750 MHz or greater activated channel capacity are required to comply with a set of SCTE and CEA standards, and to provide CableCARDs to customers that request them.

The Barbizon school was active roughly from 1830 through 1870. It takes its name from the village of Barbizon, France, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, where many of the artists gathered. Most of their works were landscape painting, but several of them also painted landscapes with farmworkers, and genre scenes of village life. Some of the most prominent features of this school are its tonal qualities, color, loose brushwork, and softness of form. The leaders of the Barbizon school were: Th√©odore Rousseau, Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, Jules Dupr√©, Constant Troyon, Charles Jacque, and Narcisse Virgilio D√≠az. Jean-Fran√ßois Millet lived in Barbizon from 1849, but his interest in figures with a landscape backdrop sets him rather apart from the others. Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was the earliest on the scene, first painting in the forest in 1829, but \\"his work has a poetic and literary quality which sets him somewhat apart\\".Osborne, 106-107, 107 quoted Other artists associated with the school, often pupils of the main group, include: Henri Harpignies, Albert Charpin, Fran√ßois-Louis Fran√ßais, and √âmile van Marcke. Many of the artists were also printmakers, mostly in etching but the group also provided the bulk of the artists using the semiphotographic clich√© verre technique. The French etching revival began with the school, in the 1850s.Salsbury, Britany. ‚ÄúThe Etching Revival in Nineteenth-Century France.‚Äù In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2014, online History Th√©odore Rousseau, Becquigny, Somme, c. 1857 In 1824 the Salon de Paris exhibited works of John Constable, an English painter. His rural scenes influenced some of the younger artists of the time, moving them to abandon formalism and to draw inspiration directly from nature. Natural scenes became the subjects of their paintings rather than mere backdrops to dramatic events. During the Revolutions of 1848 artists gathered at Barbizon to follow Constable's ideas, making nature the subject of their paintings. The French landscape became a major theme of the Barbizon painters.Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline The Gleaners. Jean-Fran√ßois Millet. 1857. Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris. Millet extended the idea from landscape to figures -- peasant figures, scenes of peasant life, and work in the fields. In The Gleaners (1857), for example, Millet portrays three peasant women working at the harvest. Gleaners are poor people who are permitted to gather the remains after the owners of the field complete the main harvest. The owners (portrayed as wealthy) and their laborers are seen in the back of the painting. Millet shifted the focus and the subject matter from the rich and prominent to those at the bottom of the social ladders. To emphasize their anonymity and marginalized position, he hid their faces. The women's bowed bodies represent their everyday hard work. In the spring of 1829, Jean- Baptiste-Camille Corot came to Barbizon to paint in the Forest of Fontainebleau, he had first painted in the forest at Chailly in 1822. He returned to Barbizon in the autumn of 1830 and in the summer of 1831, where he made drawings and oil studies, from which he made a painting intended for the Salon of 1830; \\"View of the Forest of Fontainebleau'\\" (now in the National Gallery in Washington) and, for the salon of 1831, another \\"View of the Forest of Fontainebleau\\"'. While there he met the members of the Barbizon school: Th√©odore Rousseau, Paul Huet, Constant Troyon, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, and the young Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny.Pomar√©de, Vincent, Le ABCdaire de Corot et le passage fran√ßais (1996), Flammarion, Paris, () During the late 1860s, the Barbizon painters attracted the attention of a younger generation of French artists studying in Paris. Several of those artists visited Fontainebleau Forest to paint the landscape, including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley and Fr√©d√©ric Bazille.Heilbrunn Timeline, Metropolitan Museum of Art In the 1870s those artists, among others, developed the art movement called Impressionism and practiced plein air painting. In contrast, the main members of the school made drawings and sketches on the spot, but painted back in their studios.Osborne, 107 The Post-Impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh studied and copied several of the Barbizon painters as well, including 21 copies of paintings by Millet. He copied Millet more than any other artist. He also did three paintings in Daubigny's Garden. Both Th√©odore Rousseau (1867) and Jean-Fran√ßois Millet (1875) died at Barbizon. Influence in Europe Jules Dupr√©, Fontainebleau Oaks, c 1840 Painters in other countries were also influenced by this art. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, many artists came to Paris from Austria-Hungary to study the new movements. For instance, the Hungarian painter J√°nos Thorma studied in Paris as a young man. In 1896 he was one of the founders of the Nagyb√°nya artists' colony in what is now Baia Mare, Romania, which brought impressionism to Hungary. In 2013 the Hungarian National Gallery opens a major retrospective of his work, entitled, 'J√°nos Thorma, the Painter of the Hungarian Barbizon, 8 February - 19 May 2013, Hungarian National GalleryJ√°nos Thorma, the Painter of the Hungarian Barbizon, 8 February - 19 May 2013, Hungarian National Gallery Karl Bodmer, originally Swiss, settled in Barbizon in 1849. L√°szl√≥ Pa√°l, another Hungarian, lived in Barbizon in the 1870s. Influence in America The Barbizon painters also had a profound impact on landscape painting in the United States. This included the development of the American Barbizon school by William Morris Hunt. Several artists who were also in, or contemporary to, the Hudson River School studied Barbizon paintings for their loose brushwork and emotional impact. A notable example is George Inness, who sought to emulate the works of Rousseau. Paintings from the Barbizon school also influenced landscape painting in California. The artist Percy Gray carefully studied works by Rousseau and other painters which he saw in traveling exhibitions to inform his own paintings of California hills and coastline. The influence of the Barbizon painters may be seen in the extraordinary sporting dog paintings of Percival Rosseau (1859-1937), who grew up in Louisiana and studied at the Academie Julien.

He belonged to a noble family (De Ansso) of Spanish origin, and took his surname from a village in the neighbourhood. In 1773, he published the Homeric Lexicon of Apollonius the Sophist from a manuscript in the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. In 1778, his edition of Longus's Daphnis and Chlo√´ was published. He went to Venice in 1781, and spent three years there examining the library, his expenses being paid by the French government. His chief discovery was a 10th-century manuscript of the Iliad‚Äîthe famous codex Venetus A, with ancient scholia and marginal notes, indicating supposititious, corrupt or transposed verses. After leaving Venice, he accepted an invitation of the duke of Saxe-Weimar to come to his court. Some of the fruits of his research in the library of the palace were collected into a volume, Epistolae Vinarienses (1783), dedicated to his royal hosts. Hoping to find a treasure similar to the Venetian Homer in Greece, he returned to Paris to prepare for a journey to the east. He visited Constantinople, Smyrna, the Greek islands, and Mount Athos, but the results did not meet his expectation. In 1786, de Villoison returned to Paris, and in 1788 brought out the Venetus A of Homer, which created a sensation in the learned world. When the French Revolution broke out, being banished from Paris, he lived in retirement in Orl√©ans, occupying himself chiefly with the transcription of the notes in the library of the brothers Valois (Valesius). Upon the restoration of order, having returned to Paris, he accepted a professorship of modern Greek established by the government, and held it until it was transferred to the Coll√®ge de France as the professorship of the ancient and modern Greek languages. He died in 1805, soon after his appointment. Another work of some importance, Anecdota Graeca (1781), from the Paris and Venice libraries, contains the Ionia (violet garden) of the empress Eudocia, and several fragments of the Neoplatonists Iamblichus and Porphyry, Procopius of Gaza, Choricius, and the Greek grammarians. Materials for an exhaustive work he was contemplating on ancient and modern Greece are preserved in the royal library of Paris.

The other species of the genus Bucorvus found in Africa is the Abyssinian ground hornbill, B. abyssinicus. Southern ground hornbills are carnivorous and mostly hunt on the ground, where they find the majority of their food. This food ranges from insects to small animals. Their nests are often found in high in tree cavities or other shallow cavities, such as rock holes in cliff faces. These birds are a long lived species, having lifespans in the range of 50‚Äì60 years, and up to 70 in captivity. In relation to their long lives, they do not reach sexual maturity until 4‚Äì6 years old, and begin breeding around 10 years old. Their sex can be identified by the color of their throats, where the male's is pure red and the female's is a deep violet-blue. Southern ground hornbills are a culturally pervasive and important species in southern Africa.

The southern ground hornbill is characterized by black coloration and vivid red patches of bare skin on the face and throat (yellow in juvenile birds), which are generally believed to keep dust out of the birds eyes while they forage during the dry season. The white tips of the wings (primary feathers) seen in flight are another diagnostic characteristic. The beak is black and straight and presents a casque, more developed in males. Female southern ground hornbills are smaller and have violet-blue skin on their throats. Juveniles to six years old lack the prominent red pouch, but have a duller patch of grey in its place. Habitat and diet Head of female at Philadelphia Zoo Southern ground hornbills can be found from northern Namibia and Angola to northern South Africa and southern Zimbabwe to Burundi and Kenya. They require a savanna habitat with large trees for nesting and dense but short grass for foraging.Krook, K., Bond, W.J., and Hockey, P.A.R.; ‚ÄúThe effect of grassland shifts on the avifauna of a South African savanna‚Äù; Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology 2007, 78 (2) : 271‚Äì279 The southern ground hornbill is a vulnerable species, mainly confined to national reserves and national parks. They live in groups of 5 to 10 individuals including adults and juveniles. Often, neighbouring groups are engaged in aerial pursuits. They forage on the ground, where they feed on reptiles, frogs, snails, insects and mammals up to the size of hares.Maclean, Gordon Lindsay. Roberts' Birds of South Africa, 6th Edition; pp. 399‚Äì400. Southern ground hornbills very rarely drink.''‚ÄúBucorvus leadbeateri‚Äù''. Ewt.org.za. Retrieved on 2012-08-24. Their range is limited at its western end by the lack of trees in which to build nests. Southern ground hornbill groups are very vocal: contact is made by calls in chorus which can usually be heard at distances of up to .‚ÄúGround Hornbill (Bromvo√´l)‚Äù. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-08-24. The calls allow each group to maintain its territories, which must be as large as even in the best habitat. Breeding and life cycle The southern ground hornbill is an obligate cooperative breeder, with each breeding pair always assisted by at least two other birds. It is known via experiments in captivitySweeney, Roger; ‚ÄúCaptive Management of Ground Hornbills for a Sustainable Population‚Äù by Capstone Project Report that birds without six years experience as helpers at the nest are unable to breed successfully if they do become breeders. This suggests that unaided pairs cannot rear young and that helping skill as a juvenile is essential for rearing young as an adult. In captivity, a maximum lifespan of 70 years is recorded, and it is generally believed that the life expectancy of a bird that survives long enough to fledge is as high as thirty years or more,Skutch; Alexander Frank (author) and Gardner, Dana (illustrator) Helpers at birds' nests : a worldwide survey of cooperative breeding and related behavior pp. 69‚Äì71. Published 1987 by University of Iowa Press. which is comparable to more famously long-lived birds like the wandering albatross. Ground hornbills are believed to reach maturity at six to seven years, but very few breed at this age. Nests are almost always deep hollows in very old trees, though there exist reports ground hornbills have on occasions nested on rock faces. One to three eggs are laid at the beginning of the wet season but siblicide ensures that only one nestling is ever fledged. The eggs measure by and are pure white in colour but very rough in texture. The period of parental dependence following a 40 to 45-day incubation period and an 85-day fledging period is between one and two years depending on climatic conditions before young are independent of parents and helpers, which is the longest of any bird. This means that ground hornbills can normally breed successfully only every third year. Triennial breeding is extremely rare in birds: probably the only other bird which breeds on a triennial basis is the ornate hawk-eagle of Neotropical rainforests.Madrid M, J. A., H. D. Madrid M., S. H. Funes, J. L√≥pez, R. Botzoc G., and A. Ramos (1991). [Reproductive biology and behavior of the Ornate Hawk-Eagle in Tikal National Park (Spizaetus ornatus)]. pp. 93‚Äì113 in D. F. Whitacre, W. A. Burnham, and J. P. Jenny (eds.) , Maya Project: use of birds of prey and other fauna as environmental indicators for design, management, and monitoring of protected areas and for building local capacity for conservation in Latin America, Progress Report IV. The Peregrine Fund, Inc., Boise, ID. Conservation The southern ground hornbill is classed as vulnerable to extinction globally; however, in South Africa, where most studies on the species have been carried out, it is listed as endangered.The 2014 Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland; ‚Äú2015 Checklist of Birds - List of Threatened Species‚Äù They have also been classified as endangered in Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. Southern ground hornbills in these countries, along with Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique, require conservation interventions to help increase their numbers. The bird's classification as endangered is heavily tied to its slow reproductive rates and other, numerous environmental factors. Habitat loss, changes due to the agriculture, deforestation, electrocution from power lines, accidental poisoning, and persecution are the major factors that affect their populations. Persecution and hunting of the southern ground hornbill by human populations has continued to be a complex issue. Recent studies have found the species has been hunted more than previously believed, including in protected areas. The majority of this hunting has likely been opportunistic. Overall, hunting is likely not a key driver for their lowering numbers. Although it is still a factor to be aware when considering conservation efforts, especially due to their low reproductive rates and an incomplete knowledge about local hunting habits in their natural regions. Furthermore, the southern ground hornbill faces persecution due to behaviors like destroying windows in response to seeing their reflection. Annoyed homeowners in urban areas in South Africa have been known to kill birds that destroy property. The role of southern ground hornbills in a variety of cultural beliefs also influence conservation efforts. Some of these beliefs actually benefit their preservation. An example is the Ndebele, who believe killing southern ground hornbills is taboo due to their negative associations. However, the birds are also used in traditional cultural practices and medicines which can be harmful. In some marketplaces and cultures, southern ground hornbills are used in traditional medicines, which often rely upon harvesting specific parts of the bird. To date, research suggests that cultural uses do not have a significant impact on their populations. For example, the Ndebele healers use the bird for traditional medicine, but must follow a strict ritual process that could take months or years to prepare. Additional research documents plant alternatives to southern ground hornbill use for cultural belief uses. While investigation into traditional medicine trade of the southern ground hornbill has occurred, the bushmeat trade remains poorly understood, and it has only been seen to occur in areas of Malawi. This bird species is especially threatened by the loss of trees and general habitat loss, as they require vast amounts of space for their territories. The removal of large trees for agriculture or wood harvesting, disturbances near nesting grounds, agricultural changes, all deeply affect the ability of southern ground hornbills to flourish properly. Due to the encroachment of human populations, it is not unheard of to see a group's territory encompass a variety of areas, from pristine habitats to commercial agricultural lands. Southern ground hornbills can have clutches ranging from one to three eggs, but only one of these are raised. With only one egg being raised, conservationists have taken it as an opportunity to raise the remaining eggs in captivity. Rehabilitation projects, such the Mabula Ground Hornbill Project, have been hand-rearing these left behind chicks with goals to reintroduce them to the wild. Although reintroduced southern ground hornbills have proven challenging. Southern ground hornbill in a Tokyo zoo, 2009 In culture The southern ground hornbill's loud voice and large size have made it a focal point in many traditional African cultures. They have inspired a variety of cultural beliefs throughout many peoples that are within its vast historical range. However, the extent of these beliefs and whether they will persist into the future are uncertain, especially due to the modernization of Africa. = Associations with death = In several cultures, it has been found that the southern ground hornbill is associated with death and unluckiness. Broadly speaking, some view them as a sign, or bringer, of death, destruction, loss, and deprivation. These beliefs have been most prevalent in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi; spread across many countries and peoples. Some residents of Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique associate the bird as ‚Äú[an] unlucky and an aggressive bird associated with evil and death.‚Äù Some in Tanzania also believe it to host angry spirits. Others in Zimbabwe believe it can bring misfortune and should not be approached. This has led to a range of reactions to the southern ground hornbill, from avoidance to killing. More specifically, the Taveta people have a cultural belief that killing a southern ground will bring a fatal illness upon anyone who were to kill one. For the Ndebele people, killing them is considered taboo and will bring death upon the killer. Furthermore, the Ndebele believe an elderly person will die if a southern ground hornbill comes near the home. The AmaXhosa people also have a taboo against killing them, as they may be messengers of death sent by a witch-doctor. = Associations with weather = The southern ground hornbill is well known for its associations with rain, drought, lightning and general weather forecasts. It is believed by some, such as the Ndebele and those who live in coastal Tanzania, that its early morning calls are a sign of rain. Cultures such as the AmaXhosa believe the southern ground hornbill can be used to bring rain and end droughts. This association has attributed the southern ground hornbill with the ability to provide protection from weather related problems. It is believed that if the proper traditional ritual is used, the bird can protect against lightning and drought. Rituals differ per culture and necessity for protection, as such a variety of parts may be needed from the bird, and may also involve dancing and singing. This particular usage has been seen within areas of South Africa and Mozambique. Due to their association with rain and drought, some cultures rely upon the southern ground hornbill as a timekeeper as well. They can mark both seasonal and daily changes, such as a change from the wet to dry season. Slight variations are found country to country. In Malawi, some believe that sightings of southern ground hornbills means the fields should be prepared. Some in Kenya and Tanzania use the bird as a marker for the dry season and thus time when to move cattle. Within areas of South Africa, their calls are associated with the start of the rainy season. These beliefs generally do not carry harmful consequences for southern ground hornbills, but killing, displacing, or otherwise using them to end or start rainy seasons has been reported. However, climate change has begun to affect the southern ground hornbill's ability to call out at the correct time, confusing those that may rely upon it for determining the weather. = Associations with altered perceptions = Possibly influenced by the southern ground hornbill ability to spot and hunt small creatures within tall grass, it has been associated with the ability to alter human perceptions. Though traditional rituals, the bird can be utilized to improve or change a human's ability to alter reality, create illusions, and expand awareness. It has been seen in Zimbabwe, Malawi and South Africa that the bird can be used improve a human's ability to find food, creatures and even enemies. Furthermore, it's believed by some that the southern ground hornbill can be used to alter the perceptions of oneself. Thus, it has lent itself to be used through rituals to provide authority for leaders in certain cultures. The following are other cultural uses seen in numerous areas, but not deeply explored via research: * Ridding bad or evil spirits * Revenge on others or to instigate fights * Empowering a person * Causing dreams to become reality Gallery Southern Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) (14013856052).jpgA foraging male Southern Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri) male (11451032976).jpgCatching beetles in dung Bromvo√´l 2007.JPGForaging after a burn Bucorvus leadbeateri -Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga, South Africa -juvenile-8.jpgJuvenile bird with pale facial skin Juvenile Southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), Kruger National Park, South Africa (28588027803).jpgHead of an immature bird Southern Ground Hornbill on Termite Mound.jpgPerched on a termite mound Southern ground hornbill landing (7913321272).jpgContrasting primaries and secondaries seen upon landing Three Southern Ground Hornbills in Flight.jpgA group taking flight  References  External links * (Southern) Ground Hornbill ‚Äì Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds. * Southern ground hornbill videos, photos & sounds on the Internet Bird Collection * Southern ground hornbill Bucorvus cafer on BirdLife.org southern ground hornbill Category:Birds of Southern Africa southern ground hornbill Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Taxa named by Nicholas Aylward Vigors ","title":"Southern ground hornbill"},{"id":"343760","text":"Ocyceros is a genus of birds in the family Bucerotidae.

Biography  Born into a Jansenist family, √âtienne and his mother, who knew Latin, had to go into hiding in the countryside when his father, a clothing merchant made a member of the French nobility by king Louis XV of France with the mention by the king to continue in his trading and shop keeping however, was executed in 1793 during the French Revolution.Irwin, 148 Later he studied Arabic under Silvestre de Sacy, (1758‚Äì1838), a member of the French nobility since 1813 and the son of a public notary with Jewish roots, becoming later a rector at the University of Paris, in the School of Living Oriental Languages. Employed in 1807 in the manuscript department of the imperial library, he passed to the chair of Greek in the university of Rouen in 1809, entered the Academy of Inscriptions in 1815, taught Hebrew and Aramaic in the Coll√®ge de France from 1819, and finally in 1838 became professor of Persian in the School of Living Oriental Languages, on the death of Silvestre de Sacy. Quatrem√®re's first work was Recherches ... sur la langue et la litt√©rature de l'Egypte (1808), showing that the language of ancient Egypt must be sought in Coptic. His M√©moires g√©ographiques et historiques sur l'√âgypte‚Ä¶ sur quelques contr√©es voisines was published in 1811. This publication forced Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, the famous decoder of the Rosetta stone, to publish, prematurely, an \\"Introduction\\" to his L'√âgypte sous les pharaons. Since both works concern the Coptic names of Egyptian towns, and Champollion's was published later, Champollion was accused by some of plagiarism. In fact \\"neither he nor Quatrem√®re had copied from one another, and very obvious differences of approach were apparent in their publications\\".Adkins & Adkins, 97-8 Quatrem√®re edited and translated part of Al-Maqrizi's, (1364‚Äì1442), Arabic History of the Memaluke Sultans (2 vols., 1837‚Äì41), \\"not because he had all that much interest in the history of Mamluk Egypt, but rather because he was fascinated by the vocabulary of fifteenth-century Arabic and particularly in those lexicographic nuggets that had not been defined in the standard of Arabic dictionaries\\". He published among other works M√©moires sur les Nabat√©ens (1835); a translation of Rashid-al-Din Hamadani's, (1247‚Äì1318), Histoire des Mongols de la Perse (1836); M√©moire g√©ographique et historique sur l'Egypte (1810); the text of Ibn Khaldun's (1332‚Äì1406) Prolegomena; and a vast number of useful memoirs in the Journal asiatique. His numerous reviews in the Journal des savants are also worth mention. Quatrem√®re made great lexicographic collections in Oriental languages, fragments of which appear in the notes to his various works. His manuscript material for Syriac was utilized in Robert Payne Smith's Thesaurus; of the slips he collected for a projected Arabic, Persian and Turkish lexicon some account is given in the preface to Dozy, Suppl√©ment aux dictionnaires arabes. They were moved to the Munich library. A biographical notice by Barth√©lemy Sainte-Hilaire is prefixed to Quatrem√®re's M√©langes d'histoire et de philologie orientale (1861).

The USSR and later Russia have transported 49 citizens of 18 other nations on the Soyuz vehicle, usually as part of a commercial arrangement, including seven space tourists flying through the Space Adventures contract. Since 2001, the Soyuz has been used to transport ESA, JAXA, and NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. These space travelers are not always referred to as \\"cosmonauts\\", especially if they belong to another space program; e.g., NASA employees are almost always referred to as \\"astronauts\\", even if they are flying on a Russian vehicle. =Africa= * South Africa: Mark Shuttleworth (Space Adventures) ‚Äî Soyuz TM-34/33 =Americas= * Brazil: Marcos Pontes ‚Äî Soyuz TMA-8 * Canada: ** Guy Lalibert√© (Space Adventures) ‚Äî Soyuz TMA-16/14 ** Chris Hadfield ‚Äî Soyuz TMA-07M ** Robert Thirsk ‚Äî Soyuz TMA-15 * United States: ** Joseph M.

Commentators on the British Constitution sometimes draw a distinction between the Labour Party (which was created outside Parliament and later achieved office) and the Conservative and Liberal parties (which began as parliamentary factions). The term Parliamentary Labour Party refers to the party in Parliament, whereas the term Labour Party refers to the entire Labour Party, the parliamentary element of which is the PLP. A similar body for the Conservative Party is the 1922 Committee. An organisation for former members, the PLP in exile, was established after the 2010 general election. Role The PLP holds regular meetings behind closed doors to question the Leader and to discuss its concerns. Labour MPs elect three of their number to Labour's National Executive Committee. Originally, the Leader of the Labour Party was elected by the PLP. Now, however, the party operates on a one-member, one vote system, where all members are awarded a single vote, as well as affiliated organizations (trade unions and socialist societies) and temporary registered supporters. The Alternative Vote is used to conduct the election. Labour MPs retain the power to trigger an extraordinary or \\"special\\" Labour Party Conference to choose a new leader if they lose confidence in their existing leader.This would require 20% of the PLP to nominate a named member of the PLP prior to the annual party conference. Chair The Chair of the PLP chairs meetings of the Parliamentary party. He or she is elected by Labour MPs at the start of each annual session of Parliament. By tradition, only elections at the start of each Parliament, following a general election, are competitive. From 1921 to 1970, the Chair of the PLP was also the leader of the party as a whole (before 1921, leadership of the party was arguably split between the Chairman of the PLP, the General Secretary and the Party Chairman). When the leaders of the Labour Party joined coalition governments during the First and Second World Wars, an acting chair was appointed to lead the rump of the party in Opposition. When the Party was in government, a liaison committee was elected to facilitate communications between the cabinet and Labour backbenchers ‚Äì the chair of this committee also chaired meetings of the PLP as a whole during these periods. In 1970, the positions of Leader of the Labour Party and Chair of the PLP were permanently split. * Keir Hardie (1906‚Äì08) * Arthur Henderson (1908‚Äì10) * George Barnes (1910‚Äì11) * Ramsay MacDonald (1911‚Äì14) * Arthur Henderson (1914‚Äì17) ** John Hodge (1915‚Äì16) ‚Äì in Opposition ** George Wardle (1916‚Äì17) ‚Äì in Opposition * William Adamson (1917‚Äì21) * J.

Socialist Society stall Labour Party Conference 2004 The best-known and oldest socialist society is the Fabian Society, founded in 1884, some years before the creation of the Labour Party itself (in which the Society participated). The Society's membership is relatively small (around 7000) but it exerts much influence in Labour circles. The Co-operative Party is not strictly a \\"socialist society\\" in the context of the Labour Party. It is in fact a separate political party with an electoral agreement with the Labour Party. It acts as a socialist society for the most part although it has certain additional rights. Affiliation means that the socialist societies - like a number of British trade unions - pay an affiliation fee to the Labour Party, and the affiliates' members become affiliated supporters of the Labour Party (a different status from full member), unless they specifically choose otherwise. In return the societies receive a formal role in Labour decision- making, and the affiliated supporters can take part in all-member ballots in certain circumstances. For example, they can participate in the election of Labour Party leaders and deputy leaders, have delegates and votes at Annual Conference. Socialist societies also elect a delegate (currently James Asser) to the Labour National Executive Committee and can affiliate at a local level to Constituency Labour Parties. A second seat was allotted to BAME Labour in early 2007, when its membership rose above 2,500. The Socialist Societies also elect three representatives to the National Policy Forum; currently, these are Emma Burnell, Ash McGregor and Melanie Smallman. Since the 2011 'refounding Labour' process, seats on the NPF have also been allocated to LGBT+ Labour and the Disability Labour. Each Socialist Society can nominate, and since 2015 Socialist Society members can vote individually, in the Labour leader and deputy leader elections. The socialist societies are also involved in the Labour Party's policy reviews, and the work of the Socialist Societies is co- ordinated by the Socialist Societies Executive. This is a regular meeting of the chairs and key officers of all the societies to share ideas and co- ordinate work. These meetings also co-ordinate regular meetings with senior Labour Party officials and MPs. As a collective, the societies try to co- ordinate campaigning work and hold a joint event at Labour Party conference. A small group of officers are elected to co-ordinate this work. The current committee is: * Chair - Catherine Atkinson (Society of Labour Lawyers) * Vice- chair (Development) - Vacant * Vice-chair (Policy) - Ash McGregor (Chinese for Labour) * Secretary - Heather Staff (Christians on the Left) * Treasurer - Martin Dore (Socialist Educational Association) Current socialist societies As of January 2020, there are 20 affiliated socialist societies: * Black, Asian Minority Ethnic Labour (BAME Labour) (formerly Labour Party Black Sections and Black Socialist Society) * Chinese for Labour * Christians on the Left (formerly The Christian Socialist Movement) * Disability Labour (formerly Labour Party Disabled Members Group) * Fabian Society * Jewish Labour Movement, (formerly Poale Zion) * Labour Animal Welfare Society * Labour Business (formerly Labour Finance and Industry Group) * Labour Campaign for International Development * Labour Housing Group * Labour Movement for Europe * Labour Party Irish Society * Labour Women's Network * LGBT+ Labour * National Union of Labour and Socialist Clubs * Scientists for Labour * Socialist Educational Association * Socialist Environment and Resources Association (SERA) - Labour's Environmental Campaign * Socialist Health Association * Society of Labour Lawyers There are other organisations, such as Labour Arts Alliance, Muslims for Labour and Labour Humanists, which are not formally affiliated to the Labour Party but act as campaign groups for Labour Party members in the same way as the affiliates, but have yet to apply for affiliation or have decided not to do so.

The party was created by the trade unions and socialist societies in 1900 as the Labour Representation Committee and the unions have retained close institutional links with it. Affiliated unions pay an annual fee to the Labour Party; in return, they elect twelve of the thirty-two members of Labour's National Executive Committee and fifty per cent of the delegates to Labour Party Conference. Local union branches also affiliate to Constituency Labour Parties and their members who are also individual members of the Party may represent the union as delegates on Labour Party structures. Individual members may opt out of paying into a union's political fund which is used to finance the affiliation. Since 1994, affiliated trade unions have organised themselves into TULO - The Trade Union & Labour Party Liaison Organisation, with a small number of staff to manage the relationship between the unions and the Party. A national TULO committee, with the unions' general secretaries, the Party Leader and Deputy Leader, General Secretary and NEC Chair and MPs' representatives, meets regularly to co-ordinate work and policy. Until 1995, each union exercised a block vote at party conferences; since then, multiple delegates of a single union get an equal share of its voting allocation. Affiliated unions As of April 2017, the trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party are: *Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) *Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) *Community (formerly KFAT & ISTC) *Communication Workers Union (CWU) *Fire Brigades Union (FBU) *GMB *Musicians Union (MU) *National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) *Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) *UNISON (The Public Services Union) *Unite (general workers in public and private sectors) *Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) The General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU) represents its members, seven of the smaller unions, on many of the committees if they cannot send a delegate. In 2015, Unity merged into the GMB. In January 2017, the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU) merged with Prospect, a trade union that represents certain grades in the civil service and other professionals. Because Prospect represents civil servants, they are politically neutral and so BECTU disaffiliated from the Labour Party as a condition of the merger. In January 2017, the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT) merged into Unite. Former affiliates During Tony Blair's leadership of the Labour Party, the RMT and Fire Brigades Union severed their links. However, the Fire Brigades Union re-affiliated to the Labour Party in November 2015. Formerly, there were many more small trade unions in the UK, and many of them affiliated to the Labour Party.

He was the first Director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, from 1945 to 1980. Early life and education Lovell was born at Oldland Common, Gloucestershire (outside Bristol) in 1913,GRO Register of Births: DEC 1913 5c 885 KEYNSHAM ‚Äì Alfred CB Lovell, mmn = Adams the son of Gilbert and Emily Laura Lovell. His childhood hobbies and interests included cricket and music, mainly the piano. He had a Methodist upbringing and attended Kingswood Grammar School.  Career and research  Lovell studied physics at the University of Bristol obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in 1934, and a PhD in 1936 for his work on the electrical conductivity of thin films.Index to Theses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Theses.com (3 August 2012). Retrieved on 2012-08-21. At this time, he also received lessons in music from Raymond Jones, a teacher at Bath Technical School and later an organist at Bath Abbey. The church organ was one of the main loves of his life, apart from science. Lovell worked in the cosmic ray research team at the University of Manchester until the outbreak of the Second World War. At the beginning of the war, Lovell published his first book, Science and Civilization. During the war he worked for the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) developing radar systems to be installed in aircraft, among them H2S. In June 1942 he was involved in the recovery of a highly secret cavity magnetron from the wreckage of a Handley Page Halifax that had crashed killing a number of his colleagues, including EMI engineer Alan Blumlein, while on a test flight. At the end of the Second World War, Lovell attempted to continue his studies of cosmic rays with an ex-military radar detector unit, but suffered much background interference from the electric trams on Manchester's Oxford Road. He moved his equipment to a more remote location, one which was free from such electrical interference, and where he established the Jodrell Bank Observatory, near Goostrey in Cheshire. It was an outpost of the university's botany department and had been a searchlight station during the war. In the course of his experiments, he was able to show that radar echoes could be obtained from daytime meteor showers as they entered the Earth's atmosphere and ionised the surrounding air. He was later able to determine the orbits of meteors in annual meteor showers to show they were in solar orbit and not of interstellar origin. With university funding, he constructed the then-largest steerable radio telescope in the world, which now bears his name: the Lovell Telescope. Over 50 years later, it remains a productive radio telescope, now operated mostly as part of the MERLIN and European VLBI Network interferometric arrays of radio telescopes. Reginald Gray, 1966, for the New York Times In 2009, Lovell claimed he had been the subject of a Cold War assassination attempt during a 1963 visit to the Soviet Deep-Space Communication Centre (Eupatoria). Lovell alleged that his hosts tried to kill him with a lethal radiation dose because he was head of the Jodrell Bank space telescope when it was also being used as part of an early warning system for Soviet nuclear attacks. Lovell wrote a full account of the incident which, at his determination, was only published after his death. =Lectures= In 1958, Lovell was invited by the BBC to deliver the annual Reith Lectures, a series of six radio broadcasts called The Individual and the Universe, in which he examined the history of enquiry into the solar system and the origin of the universe. In 1959, he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject \\"Radio Astronomy and the Structure of the Universe\\". In 1965 he was invited to co-deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on Exploration of the Universe. In 1975 he gave the presidential address (In the Centre of Immensities) to the British Association meeting in Guildford.  Awards and honours Lovell won numerous awards including: * 1946 ‚Äì Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for his work on H2SBernard Lovell telling his life story at Web of StoriesArticle about Bernard Lovell's life, by John Bromley Davenport in The Daily Telegraph, 19 April 2011.Imperial War Museum Interview *1955 ‚Äì Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society * 1960 ‚Äì Royal Medal * 1961 ‚Äì Knight Bachelor for his important contributions to the development of radio astronomy * 1967 ‚Äì Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science), University of BathHonorary Graduates 1966 to 1988  University of Bath.

Beyond professional recognition, Lovell has a secondary school named after him in Oldland Common, Bristol, which he officially opened. A building on the QinetiQ site in Malvern is also named after him, as was the fictional scientist Bernard Quatermass, the hero of several BBC Television science-fiction serials of the 1950s, whose first name was chosen in honour of Lovell. Personal life In 1937, Lovell married Mary Joyce Chesterman (d. 1993) and they had two sons and three daughters. Their son Dr. Bryan Lovell is a geologist at the University of Cambridge. In later life Lovell was physically very frail; he lived in quiet retirement in the English countryside, surrounded by music, his books and a vast garden filled with trees he himself planted many decades before.

Walker, Exploring an Islamic Empire: Fatimid History and its Sources (London, I.B. Tauris, 2002), p. 164. The material for updating this article is taken from Walker's account of al-Maqrizi. Life Al-Maqrƒ´zƒ´ was born in Cairo and spent most of his life in Egypt. When he presents himself in his books he usually stops at the 10th forefather although he confessed to some of his close friends that he can trace his ancestry to Al-Mu‚Äòizz li-Dƒ´n AllƒÅh ‚Äì first Fatimid caliph in Egypt and the founder of al-Qahirah ‚Äì and even to Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was trained in the Hanafite school of law. Later, he switched to the Shafi'ite school and finally to the Zahirite school.Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Inba al-Ghumar bi-Anba al-'Umr.Nasser Rabbat, \\"Who was al-Maqrizi?\\" pg. 13. Taken from Maml≈´k Studies Review, Vol. 7, Part 2. Middle East Documentation Center, University of Chicago, 2003. Maqrizi studied theology under one of the primary masterminds behind the Zahiri Revolt,Al-Maqrizi, Tajrid al-Tawhid al- Mufid, pg. 33 of the introduction of Sabri bin Salamah Shahin. Riyadh: Dar al- Qubs, 2005. and his vocal support and sympathy with that revolt against the Mamluks likely cost him higher administrative and clerical positions with the Mamluk regime.Rabbat, pg. 15. The name Maqrizi was an attribution to a quarter of the city of Baalbek, from where his paternal grandparents hailed. Maqrizi confessed to his contemporaries that he believed that he was related to the Fatimids through the son of al-Muizz. Ibn Hajar preserves the most memorable account: his father, as they entered the al-Hakim Mosque one day, told him \\"My son, you are entering the mosque of your ancestor.\\" However, his father also instructed al-Maqrizi not to reveal this information to anyone he could not trust; Walker concludes: :Ultimately it would be hard to conclude that al- Maqrizi conceived any more than an antiquarian interest in the Fatimids. His main concern seems more likely to be the meaning they and their city might have for the present, that is, for Mamluk Egypt and its role in Islam. (p. 167) In 1385, he went on the Islamic pilgrimage, the Hajj. For some time he was secretary in a government office, and in 1399 became inspector of markets for Cairo and northern Egypt. This post he soon gave up to become a preacher at the Mosque of 'Amr ibn al 'As, president of the al-Hakim Mosque, and a lecturer on tradition. In 1408, he went to Damascus to become inspector of the Qalanisryya and lecturer. Later, he retired into private life at Cairo. In 1430, he again went on Hajj with his family and travelled for some five years. His learning was great, his observation accurate and his judgement good, but his books are largely compilations, and he does not always acknowledge the sources upon which he relied.

Succession and family legacy were very important; therefore Romans needed ways of passing down their fortune and name when unable to produce a male heir. Adoption was one of the few ways to guarantee succession, so it became a norm to adopt young males into the homes of high ranking families. Due to the Roman inheritance laws (Falcidia Lex), women had very little rights or the ability to inherit fortunes. This made them less valuable for adoption. However, women were still adopted and it was more common for them to be wed to an influential family. Causes One of the benefits of a male heir was the ability to create ties among other high-ranking families through marriage. Senators throughout Rome had the responsibility of producing sons who could inherit their family‚Äôs title and estate. Childbirth was so unpredictable during these times and there was no way of knowing gender before birth. This caused many children to be lost in the years directly after and it was hard for the senators to control the situation. With the cost of children being high and average families having very few children, this posed a challenge for the senators. Without a male heir, their title and estate could be forfeited. This was the leading cause for adoption in ancient Rome. It is important to note that adoption in ancient Rome was used for a number of reasons and not exclusively by senators. The use by senators guaranteed them a son; this gave senators the freedom to produce children more freely knowing a male heir could always be adopted if unable to produce one naturally. This also created new benefits for female babies enabling them to be given away for adoption into higher ranked families. With the reduced risk of succession issues this created opportunities for males children to marry into other high-ranking families to create powerful ties among the upper class. In the case of the lower classes, raising a large family was quite challenging. Due to the cost, this allowed them to put their children up for adoption. It would benefit both the families and the child. One famous example of this is when Lucius Aemilius put his own two sons up for adoption. Practice In Rome, the person in charge of adoption was the male head of the household called the paterfamilias. Adoption would result in an adoption of power for the adopted child as the status of the adopting family was immediately transferred to the child. This was almost always an increase in power due to the high cost of adoption. Publius Clodius Pulcher famously used this loophole for political power in his attempt to gain control over the plebs. During the Roman Republic, the same laws stood in place with only one difference; the requirement of the Senate's approval. The actual adoption was often operated like a business contract between the two families. The adopted child took the family name as his own. Along with this, the child kept his/her original name through the form of cognomen or essentially a nickname. The adopted child also maintained previous family connections and often leveraged this politically. Due to the power disparity that normally existed between the families involved in adoption, a fee was often given to the lower family to help with replacing (in most cases) the first-born son. Another case similar to adoption was the fostering of children; this effectively took place when a paterfamilias transferred his power to another man to be left in their care. Adoption of women Throughout Roman history many adoptions took place but very few accounts of female adoption were recorded and preserved throughout history. With men holding the spotlight in history books and articles, it is possible that adoption of girls was more popular. However, because most of the famous adoptions were male children, female adoptions could have been wrongfully accounted. Additionally, because the legal impacts of women in ancient Rome were so minimal, it is possible that adoptions could have been more informal and therefore less accounted for in history. One of the most well known was Livia Augusta who gained this name after her adoption into the Julian family. Known mainly as the wife of Augustus. Livia played a key role during this time in the Roman Empire both as a political symbol and a role model for Roman households. Livia earned herself an honorable place among history as a great mother however some of the rumors related to potential heirs have survived throughout history. Imperial succession Julio Claudian Family Tree Many of Rome‚Äôs famous emperors took the throne through adoption, either because their predecessors had no natural sons or simply to ensure a smooth transition for the most capable candidate. The first emperor, Augustus, owed much of his success to having been adopted into the gens Julia in the will of his great uncle, Julius Caesar. However, the office of emperor did not exist at that time; Octavian inherited Caesar's money, name and auctoritas but not the office of dictator. As Augustus's central role in the principate solidified, it became increasingly important for him to designate an heir. He first adopted his daughter Julia's three sons by Marcus Agrippa, renaming them Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar and Marcus Julius Caesar Agrippa Postumus. After the former two died young and the latter was exiled, Augustus adopted his stepson Tiberius Claudius Nero on condition that he adopt his own nephew, Germanicus (who was also Augustus's great nephew by blood). Tiberius succeeded Augustus and on Tiberius's death Germanicus's son Caligula became emperor. Claudius adopted his stepson Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who changed his name to Nero Claudius Caesar and succeeded Claudius as the emperor Nero. =The Adoptive Emperors= The Nerva-Antonine dynasty was also united by a series of adoptions. Nerva adopted the popular military leader Trajan. Trajan in turn took Hadrian as his prot√©g√© and, although the legitimacy is debatable, Hadrian claimed to have been adopted and took the name Caesar Traianus Hadrianus when he became emperor. Hadrian adopted Lucius Ceionius Commodus, who changed his name to Lucius Aelius Caesar but predeceased Hadrian. He then adopted Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus, on condition that he adopt both the natural son of the late Lucius Aelius and a promising young nephew of his wife. They ruled as Antoninus Pius, Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius respectively. This era of adoptive emperors came to an end when Marcus Aurelius names his biological son, Commodus, as his heir. Niccol√≤ Machiavelli described them as The Five Good Emperors and attributed their success to having been chosen for the role: See also *Roman culture *Adrogation References External links * Ancient Roman Family Category:Adoption history Category:Family law in ancient Rome ","title":"Adoption in ancient Rome"},{"id":"343817","text":"The National Executive Committee (NEC) is the governing body of the UK Labour Party, setting the overall strategic direction of the party and policy development. Its composition has changed over the years, and includes representatives of affiliated trade unions, the Parliamentary Labour Party, constituency Labour parties (CLP), and socialist societies, as well as ex officio members such as the Party Leader and Deputy Leader and several of their appointees.  History  During the 1980s, the NEC had a major role in policy-making and was often at the heart of disputes over party policy. In the Tony Blair era, the committee's role declined and its membership was reformed, but it remains the administrative authority of the party. Its former policy development function is now largely carried out by the National Policy Forum. One of its committees has disciplinary powers including the ability to expel members of the party who have brought it into disrepute or to readmit previously expelled members. Up until 1997, Members of Parliament could stand for CLP section seats on the NEC, but thereafter MPs and MEPs could not stand in this section. The 2017 Conference saw the creation of four additional NEC seats: one in the trade union section and three in the CLP section. Although the additional union seat was elected at Conference, the extra CLP seats were not elected until January 2018.

He was an Orientalist scholar of Arabic language, history and literature. Biography The Dozys, like other contemporary French families, emigrated to the Low Countries after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, but some of the former appear to have settled in the Netherlands as early as 1647. Dozy studied at the University of Leiden, obtained the degree of doctor in 1844, was appointed an extraordinary professor of history in 1850, and professor in 1857. Dozy was a correspondent of the Royal Institute between 1848 and 1851. He became a member of the successor institute, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 1855. Works In 1847 Reinhart Dozy's extensive studies in Oriental literature, Arabic language and history, resulted in his first publication, The History of the Almohads, preceded by a Sketch of the History of Spain from the time of the conquest till the reign of Yusuf ibn Tashfin, and of the history of the Almoravids. This translation of an original thirteenth century Arabic history, titled \\"Kitab al-mujib fi talkhis akhbar ahl al-Maghrib\\" (Book of Response: A Short History of the Maghreb) by the Almohad historian Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi, was reprinted in 1881 and 1968.

It is said to most resemble the sound of the human voice ‚Äì able to imitate vocal ornaments such as gamaks (shakes) and meends (sliding movements).  History  Surjeet Singh tuning his Sarangi Sarangi derives its name from the bow of lord Vishnu and probably as it is played with a bow it is named as sarangi. According to some musicians, the word sarangi is a combination of two words ‚Äòseh‚Äô(Persian equivalent of three) and ‚Äòrangi‚Äô (Persian equivalent of coloured) corrupted as sarangi. The term seh-rangi represents the three melody strings. However the most common folk etymology is that sarangi is derived from 'sol rang' (a hundred colours) indicating its adaptability to many styles of vocal music, its flexible tunability, and its ability to produce a large palette of tonal colour and emotional nuance. The repertoire of sarangi players is traditionally very closely related to vocal music. Nevertheless, a concert with a solo sarangi as the main item will sometimes include a full-scale raag presentation with an extensive alap (the unmeasured improvisatory development of the raga) in increasing intensity (alap to jor to jhala) and several compositions in increasing tempo called bandish. As such, it could be seen as being on a par with other instrumental styles such as sitar, sarod, and bansuri. It is rare to find a sarangi player who does not know the words of many classical compositions. The words are usually mentally present during the performance, and a performance almost always adheres to the conventions of vocal performances including the organisational structure, the types of elaboration, the tempo, the relationship between sound and silence, and the presentation of khyal and thumri compositions. The vocal quality of sarangi is in a separate category from, for instance, the so-called gayaki-ang of sitar which attempts to imitate the nuances of khyal while overall conforming to the structures and usually keeping to the gat compositions of instrumental music. (A gat is a composition set to a cyclic rhythm.) The Nepali Sarangi is also a traditional stringed musical instrument of Nepal, commonly played by the Gaine or Gandarbha ethnic group but the form and repertoire of sarangi is more towards the folk music as compared to the heavy and classical form of the repertoire in India. In Nepal, Sarangi is viewed as an iconic musical instrument to identify the Gandarbha people.  Structure  A sarangi laid flat Carved from a single block of tun (red cedar) wood, the sarangi has a box-like shape with three hollow chambers: pet (stomach), chaati (chest) and magaj (brain). It is usually around long and around wide though it can vary as there are smaller as well as larger variant sarangis as well. The lower resonance chamber or pet is covered with parchment made out of goat skin on which a strip of thick leather is placed around the waist (and nailed on the back of the chamber) which supports the elephant-shaped bridge that is made of camel or buffalo bone usually (made of ivory or Barasingha bone originally but now that is rare due to the ban in India). The bridge in turn supports the huge pressure of approximately 35‚Äì37 sympathetic steel or brass strings and three main gut strings that pass through it. The three main playing strings ‚Äì the comparatively thicker gut strings ‚Äì are bowed with a heavy horsehair bow and stopped not with the fingertips but with the nails, cuticles, and surrounding flesh. Talcum powder is applied to the fingers as a lubricant. The neck has ivory or bone platforms on which the fingers slide. The remaining strings are resonance strings or tarabs, numbering up to around 35‚Äì37, divided into 4 choirs having two sets of pegs, one on the right and one on the top. On the inside is a chromatically tuned row of 15 tarabs and on the right a diatonic row of 9 tarabs each encompassing a full octave, plus 1‚Äì3 extra surrounding notes above or below the octave. Both these sets of tarabs pass from the main bridge to the right side set of pegs through small holes in the chaati supported by hollow ivory/bone beads. Between these inner tarabs and on either side of the main playing strings lie two more sets of longer tarabs, with 5‚Äì6 strings on the right set and 6‚Äì7 strings on the left set. They pass from the main bridge over to two small, flat, wide, table-like bridges through the additional bridge towards the second peg set on top of the instrument. These are tuned to the important tones (swaras) of the raga. A properly tuned sarangi will hum and cry and will sound like melodious meowing, with tones played on any of the main strings eliciting echo-like resonances. A few sarangis use strings manufactured from the intestines of goats.

Widely regarded as one of the leading competitive sport climbers in the world during the late 1980s and early 1990s, she is famous for making the first free ascent of the difficult sheer rock face of The Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, and for repeating it the next year in less than 24 hours. She has been described as both one of the best female climbers in the world and one of the best climbers of all time. One of the first successful women in the sport, Hill shaped rock climbing for women and became a public spokesperson, helping it gain wider popularity and arguing for sex equality. Hill has publicized climbing by appearing on television shows and documentaries and writing an autobiography, Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World. Hill was a gymnast early in life, nearly broke a world record lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to climbing at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and became a part of the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses. Early years =Childhood= Born in Detroit, Michigan, Hill grew up in Fullerton, California. She is the fifth of seven children; her mother was a dental hygienist and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls \\"had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor\\". Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling \\"resistant to rules\\", an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: \\"My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow\\". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls‚Äîthe boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge. =Introduction to climbing= In 1975, her sister and her sister's fianc√©, Chuck Bludworth, took Hill on her first climbing trip; she was hooked, leading from the first day. For Hill, this activity became an escape from the emotional turmoil of her parents' divorce, and \\"by her late teens she identified less with her imperfect family in Orange County than with an 'imperfect family of friends' at climbing areas\\". Hill took her first trip to Yosemite, a central destination for climbers, at the age of 16, where she was introduced to the climbers at Camp 4. There she met Charlie Row, her first boyfriend. Their romance flourished; with him she climbed her first 5.11 and first big wall. As a young teenager, Hill climbed in southern California, primarily in Joshua Tree National Park. She earned money for day trips out to the park by working at a Carl's Jr. Bludworth initially taught her climbing culture; he subscribed to magazines and read books which Hill then devoured. She was influenced in particular by Yvon Chouinard's ethic of \\"leaving no trace\\" on the rock. Moreover, the climbing of Beverly Johnson captured her imagination, particularly Johnson's 10-day solo of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan. As Hill explains in her autobiography, \\"I was awed, but not just by the know-how and hard work she'd put into her ascent. It was the courage and confidence that it took to put herself on the line, to do something on the cutting edge‚Äîto climb one of the world's greatest big walls in one of the most challenging ways possible: solo. She had succeeded and she'd given women climbers like me enormous confidence to be ourselves and not feel limited by being a minority in a male-dominated sport.\\" Hill spent her earliest years climbing in Joshua Tree National Park. Hill attended Fullerton College in the late 1970s, but she did not have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976‚Äì78 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the search and rescue team. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as \\"a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies\\". As Hill describes it, climbing in the late 1970s and early 1980s was \\"something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists\\". As she had earlier, Hill worked in order to be able to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and left-over food from tourists. However, Hill remembers \\"these dirt-poor days ... [as] among the best and the most carefree of my life, and though my friends were often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly.\\" Beverly Johnson had previously started to bridge the gender gap at Camp 4, but it remained strongly male-dominated. The community was particularly homosocial; its major historian calls it \\"edgy\\" rather than \\"oppressive\\" and argues that there was pressure on women to perform to men's standards and that \\"women had to contend with an army of men trying to maintain Camp 4 as a guy's domain\\". There was no coherent female climbing community; rather, female climbers tended to adopt the masculine attitudes of their compatriots. In her autobiography, Hill writes that climbing \\"back then was directed by a fraternity of men, and there was little encouragement of, or frankly, inclination for women to participate. Yet women climbers were out there.\\" For example, from age 18 to 22, Hill climbed with Mari Gingery every weekend, completing an ascent of The Nose and then the first female-only ascent of The Shield on El Capitan over a period of six days. Hill learned the essence of her climbing technique from the Stonemasters group during this time. She adopted the attitudes of traditional climbing, a style of climbing which emphasizes using removable protection rather than bolts (which scar the rock) and rewards climbers who climb a new route from bottom to top without stopping or starting over. She also became a dedicated free climber, which emphasizes climbing an entire route without hanging on the rope or relying on equipment to skip difficult sections. Early on she was a fearless climber but after \\"a few death-defying experiences on routes with long run-outs\\" she learned to be wary of falling. Hill climbed with and became involved with climber John Long at the end of the 1970s. Their relationship began in the summer of 1978 when she heard him recite a poem he had written about a female climber and what kind of man she wanted.Hill and Long climbed together and worked out together, lifting weights and running. It was at his suggestion that she attempted to break the world record for the bench press in her weight class (); however, while she could easily lift while training, in competition she froze. Hill and Long spent the winter of 1981 in Las Vegas, Nevada climbing during the day and working nights at \\"dead end jobs\\" like pizza waitress. The following year Hill and Long moved from Las Vegas to Santa Monica, California where she attended Santa Monica College (SMC) and majored in biology. She was recruited by the track coach even though she had no competitive running experience. After training for a few months, she placed third in the 1500 meters and fourth in the 3000 meters at the state meet, helping SMC to win the state championship. To make ends meet, she worked at an outdoor store, as a gym teacher, and occasionally appeared on daredevil television shows. In 1983, Hill was interviewed by Ultrasport. They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview and as part of the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning for some new challenges, she decided to stay and moved to New Paltz, New York. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to Borneo and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends. After moving to New York, Hill attended the State University of New York at New Paltz and graduated with a degree in biology in 1985. Climbing career The Gunks. (Another person pictured) Hill started to participate in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but one of her first significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said \\"that's when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent\\". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates the reason for this is that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: \\"The big lesson for me ... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping ... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all.\\" Living near the Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free climbing routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals was the most difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it \\"one of the boldest leads I've ever seen ... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out‚Äîwhen you see someone totally on the edge.\\" It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, \\"In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy ... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived.\\" That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, \\"perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time\\". She was arguably \\"the best climber in the Gunks\\", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and \\"no man was climbing significantly better\\" than her. =Competitive career= As a result of Hill's impressive climbs in The Gunks, she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986. The French Alpine Club invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the Verdon Gorge, Fontainebleau, and Buoux. Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing. She particularly enjoyed climbing on the limestone common in France because it has many pockets and edges, producing \\"wildly acrobatic climbs\\" with low risk. Moreover, these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature, like Hill. She tried sport climbing in France for the first time that year. Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture, she returned later and took part in Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia '86, the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition, which later became the Rock Master annual event. The event was divided into two stages, one in Arco and one in Bardonecchia, Italy. She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes, gaining points for style and speed. She lost to Catherine Destivelle in a \\"disputed ruling\\" but won in the following year. Destivelle in her autobiography, reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning, as speed was decisive in case of equality, which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition. In an interview, Hill has said that this first competition was \\"disorienting\\" because she did not understand the language, the \\"format\\" or the \\"judging\\" nor did the organizers of the competition. \\"There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of nationalism and disorganization. The rules seemed to change during the event. I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women. The only response I got was, 'If the women climb without their tops, then we'll pay them the same.'\\" However, she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with \\"other strong women\\". In one interview, Hill said that \\"if there wasn't a Catherine Destivelle or Luisa Iovane ... or whoever there, then it would be anticlimactic.\\" Destivelle became Hill's main competition in the late 1980s while Isabelle Patissier emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s. She became a professional climber in 1988 and the subsequent interviews, photoshoots and media appearances led to her becoming a spokesperson for climbing. As Hill explained, competition climbing is \\"such a different activity than going out and climbing on rock ... You're in front of all these people ... You're there to perform.\\" From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing. For example, she pointed out in an interview that some competition organizers would chop down trees and alter rocks just for the sake of a competition; she could foresee that competitions would all eventually take place on artificial walls for environmental reasons. Throughout the early 1980s, Hill had remained a traditionalist, but after her 1986 trip to Europe, she started adopting many sport climbing techniques. For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging on the rope at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of Vandals, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a \\"Great Debate\\" in 1986 at the American Alpine Club at which a panel of all-star participants‚Äîincluding Hill‚Äîwere invited to discuss the merits of the two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that \\"the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. You work on yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock ... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible ... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places‚Äîto do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others\\". Hill fell 85 ft (25 m) while climbing at the cliffs at Buoux, Haute Provence, but was back on the rock only six weeks later. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's top sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall‚Äîand the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, \\"at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female\\". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition‚ÄîIsabelle Patissier‚Äîreceived information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). \\"It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top ... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of‚Äîa lot of the best men had fallen off that route.\\" As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships. In January 1990, Hill set another landmark by becoming the first woman to redpoint a 5.14 (that is, she practiced free climbing the route before she was able to successfully climb it), Masse Critique in Cima√Ø, France. J.B. Tribout, who first ascended the route, challenged Hill, saying no woman would ever be able to climb it‚ÄîHill completed it in fewer tries than Tribout, after \\"nine days of exhausting effort\\". In 1992, it was described as the hardest rock climb ever made by a woman. Hill has experienced only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting to tie a safety rope, she fell 85 ft (25 m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing for a few months to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing. =The Nose= The Nose on El Capitan has a vertical gain. Hill did not regard sport climbing to be real climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 and went back to traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, \\"the thing I didn't like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and that's not really ever something that I wanted to do as a full-time profession\\". In her autobiography, she also comments on the \\"bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions\\". She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) The Nose, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley. Asked why she was motivated to climb The Nose, Hill has said: Hill first attempted to free climb The Nose in 1989 with Simon Nadin, a climber she had met at the World Cup that year. Although he had never climbed big walls, she felt at ease around him and both had a background in traditional climbing; they both shared a desire to free climb The Nose and agreed within hours of meeting to try the feat together. Their attempt to free climb The Nose failed. Four years later, in 1993, together with her partner Brooke Sandahl, she became the first person, male or female, to free climb the route. Hill's original climbing grade for the \\"Free Nose\\" was 5.13b. One of the most difficult pitches‚ÄîChanging Corners‚Äîshe rated at a 5.13b/c, but she wrote in her autobiography that \\"rating the difficulty of such a pitch is almost impossible\\" and \\"the most accurate grade would be to call it 'once, or maybe twice, in a lifetime'\\". The rock face is nearly blank and there are next to no holds; to ascend the section, Hill had to use a \\"carefully coordinated sequence of opposite pressures between [her] feet, hands, elbows, and hips against the shallow walls of the corner\\" as well as turn her body completely around. The next year, in 1994 she surpassed this achievement, by becoming the first person to free climb the entire route in a single 24-hour period. Usually the climb takes four to six days (Hill had previously done it in four) and most climbers are aid climbing; that is, most climbers allow themselves to use mechanical aids to assist their climbing rather than just their own skill and bodies. Hill wanted to join her effort with that of making a film that \\"would convey the history and spirit of climbing\\". Hill started endurance training in the spring for her summer ascent of The Nose, aiming to be able to on-sight a 5.13b after climbing all day. She trained in Provence and tested herself against Mingus in the Verdon Gorge, making the first on-sight free ascent of the route without a fall while simultaneously being the first woman to on-sight a 5.13b. In her autobiography, Hill explains how she had \\"underestimated\\" how complicated climbing The Nose in a day would be with a film crew. Endless complications arose, such as the American coproducer backing out at the last minute, the soundman and cameraman refusing to rappel down the summit because they were afraid, and minor technical problems such as dead batteries. Hill herself had to coordinate many of the logistics because the producer had abandoned the project. Her first attempt to free climb The Nose in a day was plagued with problems. She ran out of chalk after 22 pitches, very nearly ran out of water and was taxed by the intense heat. She tried again soon after. On September 19 at 10pm, she and her partner Steve Sutton, began the ascent again, this time without a film crew. After 23 hours, she had free climbed the entire route. In his book on the changing culture of Yosemite climbers, Joseph Taylor explains that Hill's ascent of The Nose demonstrates how climbing in the Yosemite Valley had altered from its origins in 1960s counterculture to become a \\"consumable experience\\". Hill staged what he describes as a \\"spectacle\\", filming the event \\"to capture the spontaneity of her one-day ascent\\", but she was only successful when not surrounded by a film crew. The \\"Free Nose\\" and the \\"Free Nose in a day\\" remained unrepeated over 10 years after Hill's first ascents‚Äîdespite numerous attempts by some of the best big wall climbers in the world. Over time, a consensus grade of 5.14a/b has emerged for the most difficult pitch, known as pitch 27 or Changing Corners, a fact which cements her Free Nose ascents as two of the most impressive achievements in climbing history. At the time, climbing legend Yvon Chouinard called it \\"the biggest thing that has ever been done on rock\\" and Alexander Huber later wrote that this climb \\"passed men's dominance in climbing and left them behind\\". He also regarded her statement upon completing the climb of \\"It goes, boys!\\" as reasonable although other climbers regarded it as provocative. The Nose saw a second free ascent in 1998, when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort. Then, on October 14, 2005, the team of Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden also free climbed The Nose, and on October 16, 2005, Caldwell did it in less than 12 hours. =World traveler= Hill videoing a climber at Hueco Tanks as part of Lynn Hill Climbing Camp In 1995, Hill joined The North Face climbing team and was paid to travel around the world to climb. She first visited Kyrgyzstan's Karavshin Valley to climb with Alex Lowe, Kitty Calhoun, Jay Smith, Conrad Anker, Greg Child, Dan Osman, and Chris Noble. They camped for a month and were cut off from the world, without even a radio. In her autobiography, Hill writes that \\"such isolation made me feel vulnerable\\". Hill was not used to mountain climbing (as opposed to rock climbing) and the unpredictability of it unnerved her, with its increased risk of storms and rock slides. Furthermore, she liked focusing on the style of ascending rather than just summitting; she realized on this trip that her style of free climbing was not conducive to summitting or mountain climbing. Rather than pursue ever higher climbs, therefore, she chose to climb in new places, such as Morocco, Vietnam, Thailand, Scotland, Japan, Madagascar, Australia, and South America; many of these climbs were filmed and helped promote climbing in general. Hill started offering climbing camps in five locations in the United States in 2005, with plans for more. For US$2,000, participants received five days of an \\"immersive adventure camp\\", including one-on-one coaching from Hill and other famous climbers. As of 2012 Hill was living in Boulder, Colorado and still travelling widely. From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various climbing gear companies. As of 2013, Hill was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company. While Hill used to easily obtain sponsorships, in 2010 she said in an interview that she was \\"too old\\" to obtain shoe sponsorships. =Gender politics= Hill repeatedly tells a story from when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. \\"I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I not to be able to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex.\\" Long an advocate for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued that men and women can climb the same routes: \\"I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing\\". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men \\"spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women\\". In answer to a question about whether or not women \\"will ever equal or surpass men in climbing\\", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing \\"favors people with high strength-to- weight ratios[s]\\", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women \\"have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance\\". She explained that \\"theoretically somebody as short as me could be the best in the world because it doesn't depend so much on height now ... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing.\\" Hill experienced discrimination throughout her climbing career and in an interview with John Stieger in Climbing, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that \\"there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is\\". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the \\"tomboy\\" she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do. Hill has been credited with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it and in part because Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt \\"responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, that gives them a sense of passion\\".Interview by John Martin Meek. 2 December 1995. American Alpine Club. Retrieved 13 December 2012. Climber John Long explains that Hill \\"was a prodigy and everyone knew as much ... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off‚Äîwhich she did with maddening frequency‚Äîfolks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite's superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes‚Äîor maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose.\\" Media Hill in 2006 Hill has participated in various television productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for the men in the competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She \\"became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led me very much into a man's world\\". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as \\"perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did\\". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing. In 1999, Hill appeared in Extreme, an IMAX film on adventure sports. For that production, she and Nancy Feagin had been filmed the previous May crack climbing in Indian Creek Valley in Utah. She also appeared in Vertical Frontier, a documentary about competitive climbing in California's Yosemite Valley. In 2002, Hill collaboratively wrote an autobiography, Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World, with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, published by W.W. Norton & Company. As she describes the process, \\"He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was.\\" Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to \\"convey the history and culture of free climbing\\", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: \\"And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point [sic], because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there.\\" Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared. Personal life Hill met fellow Gunks climber Russ Raffa on her first trip to New York and by 1984 he had become \\"her constant companion\\". On October 22, 1988, the two married; however, their relationship ended in March 1991 in part because Hill wanted children and because the couple rarely saw each other. At the same time, Hill moved to Grambois, France, to pursue her climbing career; she settled there because of the world-class climbing areas in the Lub√©ron region and the many friends she had there. While living and climbing in Europe, Hill became fluent in both French and Italian. Hill met her partner as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a climbing trip in Moab, Utah, and at the age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, \\"I feel that right now, it doesn't have to be all about me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made.\\" In 2015 she was inducted into the Boulder (Colorado) Sports Hall of Fame.

Mowers of the type displayed usually vary in width from 20 to 24 inches. \\"ride-on\\" mower. A battery- powered robotic lawn mower. A non-motorized multiple blade reel push mower. A lawn mower (also known as mower, grass cutter or lawnmower) is a machine utilizing one or more revolving blades to cut a grass surface to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by the design of the mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels. The blades may be powered by manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin, or the machine may have a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common self-contained power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically one cylinder) internal combustion engine. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; \\"walk-behind\\" mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled \\"walk-behind\\" types, or more often, are \\"ride-on\\" mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it. A robotic lawn mower (\\"lawn-mowing bot\\", \\"mowbot\\", etc.) is designed to operate either entirely on its own, or less commonly by an operator by remote control. Two main styles of blades are used in lawn mowers. Lawn mowers employing a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as rotary mowers, while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or reel mowers (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar). There are several types of mowers, each suited to a particular scale and purpose. The smallest types, non-powered push mowers, are suitable for small residential lawns and gardens. Electrical or piston engine-powered push-mowers are used for larger residential lawns (although there is some overlap). Riding mowers, which sometimes resemble small tractors, are larger than push mowers and are suitable for large lawns, although commercial riding lawn mowers (such as zero-turn mowers) can be \\"stand-on\\" types, and often bear little resemblance to residential lawn tractors, being designed to mow large areas at high speed in the shortest time possible. The largest multi-gang (multi-blade) mowers are mounted on tractors and are designed for large expanses of grass such as golf courses and municipal parks, although they are ill-suited for complex terrain.  History  = Invention = The lawn mower was invented by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830 in Brimscombe and Thrupp, just outside Stroud, in Gloucestershire, England. Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.; see pg 1, col 2. For a copy, see Google Patents copy. This source indicates the patent number as \\"6,080\\". According to \\"British patent numbers 1617 ‚Äì 1852 (old series) \\", the patent number would have been assigned sometime after 1852 and taken the form of \\"6080/1830\\". An early cylinder (reel) mower, showing a fixed cutting blade in front of the rear roller and wheel-driven rotary blades. Budding's first machine was wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast-iron gear wheels transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray- like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along. Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding dated May 18, 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of enlarging the small blades, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Without patent, Budding and Ferrabee were shrewd enough to allow other companies to build copies of their mower under license, the most successful of these being Ransomes of Ipswich, which began making mowers as early as 1832. His machine was the catalyst for the preparation of modern-style sporting ovals, playing fields (pitches), grass courts, etc. This led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including for football, lawn bowls, lawn tennis and others.Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National Ockham's Razor, first broadcast 6 June 2010. = Further improvements = A horsedrawn lawn mower on an Australian golf course in the 1930s. The first gasoline-powered lawn mower, 1902. It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be drawn by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. In the 1850s, Thomas Green & Son of Leeds introduced a mower called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain drive to transmit power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder. These machines were lighter and quieter than the gear-driven machines that preceded them, although they were slightly more expensive. The rise in popularity of lawn sports helped prompt the spread of the invention. Lawn mowers became a more efficient alternative to the scythe and domesticated grazing animals. Manufacture of lawn mowers took off in the 1860s. By 1862, Ferrabee's company was making eight models in various roller sizes. He manufactured over 5000 machines until production ceased in 1863. The first grass boxes were flat trays but took their present shape in the 1860s. James Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893. His machine burned petrol and/or paraffin (kerosene) as fuel. These were heavy machines that took several hours to warm up to operating pressure. After numerous advances, these machines were sold by the Stott Fertilizer and Insecticide Company of Manchester and Sumner. The company they both controlled was called the Leyland Steam Motor Company. Around 1900, one of the best known English machines was the Ransomes' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models. Numerous manufacturers entered the field with petrol (gasoline) engine-powered mowers after the start of the 20th century. The first was produced by Ransomes in 1902. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after World War I, produced a range of very popular chain-driven mowers. About this time, an operator could ride behind animals that pulled the large machines. These were the first riding mowers. The first United States patent for a reel lawn mower was granted to Amariah Hills on January 12, 1868. In 1870, Elwood McGuire of Richmond, Indiana designed a human-pushed lawn mower, which was very lightweight and a commercial success. John Burr patented an improved rotary-blade lawn mower in 1899, with the wheel placement altered for better performance. Amariah Hills went on to found the Archimedean Lawn Mower Co. in 1871. In the United States, gasoline-powered lawn mowers were first manufactured in 1914 by Ideal Power Mower Co. of Lansing, Michigan, based on a patent by Ransom E. Olds. Ideal Power Mower also introduced the world's first self-propelled, riding lawn tractor in 1922, known as the \\"Triplex\\". The roller-drive lawn mower has changed very little since around 1930. Gang mowers, those with multiple sets of blades to cut a wider swath, were built in the United States in 1919 by the Worthington Mower Company.  Atco Ltd and the first motor mower  Commercial lawn mower in use April 1930 in Berlin. In the 1920s one of the most successful companies to emerge during this period was Atco, at that time a brand name of Charles H Pugh Ltd. The Atco motor mower, launched in 1921 was an immediate success. Just 900 of the 22-inch-cut machines were made in 1921, each costing ¬£75. Within five years, annual production had accelerated to tens of thousands. Prices were reduced and a range of sizes was available, making the Standard the first truly mass- produced engine-powered mower. = Rotary mowers = Rotary mowers were not developed until engines were small enough and powerful enough to run the blades at sufficient speed. Many people experimented with rotary blade mowers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and Power Specialties Ltd. introduced a gasoline-powered rotary mower. Kut Kwick replaced the saw blade of the \\"Pulp Saw\\" with a double-edged blade and a cutter deck, converting the \\"Pulp Saw\\" into the first ever out-front rotary mower. One company that produced rotary mowers commercially was the Australian Victa company, starting in 1952. Its mowers were lighter and easier to use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa mowers were made at Mortlake, an inner suburb of Sydney, by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa mowers were then manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa Mowers Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953. The venture was so successful that by 1958 the company moved to much larger premises in Parramatta Road, Concord, and then to Milperra, by which time the mower incorporated an engine, designed and manufactured by Victa, which was specially designed for mowing, rather than employing a general-purpose engine bought from outside suppliers. Two Victa mowers, from 1958 and 1968 respectively, are held in the collection of the National Museum of Australia. The Victa mower is regarded as something of an Australian icon, appearing en masse, in simulated form, at the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000. The hover mower, first introduced by Flymo in 1964, is a form of rotary mower using an air cushion on the hovercraft principle.  Types  = By rotation =  Cylinder or reel mowers  A cylinder mower or reel mower carries a fixed, horizontal cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over this is a fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the blade cylinder forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder. Of all the mowers, a properly adjusted cylinder mower makes the cleanest cut of the grass, and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted cylinder mower is straight and definite, as if cut with a pair of scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. Lawn cut with a cylinder mower is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is not necessary for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar. If the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass blades, a clean cut can still be made. If more, however, the grass will slip through. Reel mowers also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain. There are many variants of the cylinder mower. Push mowers have no engine and are usually used on smaller lawn areas where access is a problem, where noise pollution is undesirable and where air pollution is unwanted. As the mower is pushed along, the wheels drive gears which rapidly spin the reel. Typical cutting widths are . Advances in materials and engineering have resulted in these mowers being very light and easy to operate and manoeuvre compared with their predecessors while still giving all the cutting advantages of professional cylinder mowers. Their distinct environmental benefits, both in noise and air pollution, are also strong selling points, something not lost on many international zoos, animal sanctuaries and exclusive hotel groups. The basic push mower mechanism is also used in gangs towed behind a tractor. The individual mowers are arranged in a \\"v\\" behind the tractor with each mower's track slightly overlapping that of the mower in front of it. Gang mowers are used over large areas of turf such as sports fields or parks. A gasoline engine or electric motor can be added to a cylinder mower to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers. One type of reel mower, now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a belt. The wheels in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower. Professional ride-on mower with 4 raisable reels- clearly showing the cylinders of helical blades and the bed knives Greens mowers are used for the precision cutting of golf greens and have a cylinder made up of at least eight, but normally ten, blades. The machine has a roller before and after the cutting cylinder which smooths the freshly cut lawn and minimizes wheel marks. Due to the weight, the engine also propels the mower. Much smaller and lighter variants of the roller mower are sometimes used for small patches of ornamental lawns around flower beds, and these have no engine. Riding reel mowers are also produced. Typically, the cutting reels are ahead of the vehicle's main wheels, so that the grass can be cut before the wheels push the grass over onto the ground. The reels are often hydraulically powered. The main parts of a cylinder or reel mower are: * Blade reel/cylinder: Consists of numerous (3 to 7) helical blades that are attached to a rotating shaft. The blades rotate, creating a scissor-like cutting motion against the bed knife. * Bed knife: The stationary cutting mechanism of a cylinder/reel mower. This is a fixed horizontal blade that is mounted to the frame of the mower. * Body frame: The main structural frame of the mower onto which the other parts of the mower are mounted. * Wheels: Help propel the mower in action. Generally, reel mowers have two wheels. * Push handle: The \\"power source\\" of a manually operated reel mower. This is a sturdy T-shaped, rectangular, or trapezoidal handle that is connected to the frame, wheels and blade chamber. * Motor: The power source of a reel mower that is powered by gasoline or electricity.  Rotary mowers  A rotary mower (viewed from underneath), with a mulching blade that rotates around the center. A rotary mower rotates about a vertical axis with the blade spinning at high speed relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends to result in a rougher cut and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most rotary mowers need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller to provide a more formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower (13 mm) than a standard four- wheeled rotary. The main parts of a rotary mower are: * Cutter deck housing: Houses the blade and the drive system of the mower. It is shaped to effectively eject the grass clippings from the mower. * Blade mounting and drive system: The blade of a rotary mower is usually mounted directly to the crankshaft of its engine, but it can be propelled by a hydraulic motor or a belt pulley system. * Mower blade: A blade that rotates in a horizontal plane (about a vertical axis). Some mowers have multiple blades. The blade features edges that are slightly curved upward to generate a continuous air flow as the blade rotates (as a fan), thus creating a sucking and tearing action. * Engine/motor: May be powered by gasoline or electricity. * Wheels: Generally four wheels, two front and two rear. Some mowers have a roller in place of the rear wheels. = By energy source =  Gasoline (petrol)  Extensive grass trimming was not common before the widespread application of the vertical shaft single cylinder gasoline/petrol engine. In the United States this development paralleled the market penetration of companies such as the Briggs & Stratton company of Wisconsin. Most rotary push mowers are powered by internal combustion engines. Such engines are usually four-stroke engines, used for their greater torque and cleaner combustion (although a number of older models used two-stroke engines), running on gasoline (petrol) or other liquid fuels. Internal combustion engines used with lawn mowers normally have only one cylinder. Power generally ranges from four to seven horsepower. The engines usually have a carburetor and require a manual pull crank to start them, although an electric starter is offered on some models, particularly large riding and commercial mowers. Some mowers have a throttle control on the handlebar with which the operator can adjust the engine speed. Other mowers have a fixed, pre-set engine speed. All are equipped with a governor (often centrifugal/mechanical or air vane style) to open the throttle as needed to maintain the pre-selected speed when the force needed to cut the thicker or taller grass is encountered. Gasoline mowers have the advantages over electric mowers of greater power and distance range. They do create a significant amount of pollution due to the combustion in the engine, and their engines require periodic maintenance such as cleaning or replacement of the spark plug and air filter, and changing the engine oil.\\"Instruction Manual\\", web: MMHome- PDF .\\"OM, Black Bear ZTR\\", 2008, web: Dztr-manual.  Electricity  Electric mowers are further subdivided into corded and cordless electric models. Both are relatively quiet, typically producing less than 75 decibels, while a gasoline lawn mower can be 95 decibels or more. Corded electric mowers are limited in range by their trailing power cord, which may limit their use with lawns extending outward more than 100‚Äì150 feet (30‚Äì45 m) from the nearest available power outlet. There is the additional hazard with these machines of accidentally mowing over the power cable, which stops the mower and may put users at risk of receiving a dangerous electric shock. Installing a residual- current device (GFCI) on the outlet may reduce the shock risk. Cordless electric mowers are powered by a variable number (typically 1‚Äì4) of 12-to-80-volt rechargeable batteries. Typically, more batteries mean more run time and/or power (and more weight). Batteries can be in the interior of the lawnmower or on the outside. If on the outside, the depleted batteries can be quickly swapped with recharged batteries. Cordless mowers have the maneuverability of a gasoline-powered mower and the environmental friendliness of a corded electric mower, but they are more expensive and come in fewer models (particularly the self-propelling type) than either. The eventual disposal of worn-out batteries is problematic (though some manufacturers offer to recycle them), and the motors in some cordless mowers tend to be less powerful than gasoline motors of the same total weight (including batteries).

File:CC500BAT.pngCordless and rechargeable rotary lawn mower, in mulch mode, removable battery located above rear wheels Image:Electric mower-250px.jpgCorded rotary lawn mower, with rear grass catcher (note the red cord attached at the handle).  Propane  Lawn mowers powered by propane were also manufactured by Lehr.  By hand  In hand-powered lawn mowers, the reel is attached to the mower's wheels by gears, so that when the mower is pushed forward, the reel spins several times faster than the plastic or rubber-tired wheels turn. Depending on the placement of the reel, these mowers often cannot cut grass very close to lawn obstacles. = Other notable types = Hover mowers are powered rotary push lawn mowers that use an impeller above the spinning blades to drive air downward, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower above the ground. The operator can then easily move the mower as it floats over the grass. Hover mowers are necessarily light in order to achieve the air cushion and typically have plastic bodies with an electric motor. The most significant disadvantage, however, is the cumbersome usability in rough terrain or on the edges of lawns, as the lifting air-cushion is destroyed by wide gaps between the chassis and the ground. Hover mowers are built to operate on steep slopes, waterfronts, and high-weeded areas, so they are often used by golf course greenskeepers and commercial landscapers. Grass collection is often available, but can be poor in some models. The quality of cut can be inferior if the grass is pushed away from the blade by the cushion of air. A robotic mower is contained by a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to of grass. Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are usually self-docking and contain rain sensors, nearly eliminating human interaction for mowing grass. Multiple robotic mowers can be used to mow an even larger area. Tractor pulled mowers are usually in the form of an attachment to a tractor. The attachments can simply function by the movement of the tractor similar to manual push cylinder mowers, but also sometimes may have powered moving blades. They are commonly mounted on either the side or the back of the tractor. Riding mowers (U.S. and Canada) or ride- on mowers (U.K. and Canada) are a popular alternative for large lawns. The operator is provided with a seat and controls on the mower and literally rides on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of ride-on mower is the lawn tractor. These are usually designed to resemble a small agricultural tractor, with the cutting deck mounted amidships between the front and rear axles. The drives for these mowers are in several categories. The most common transmission for tractors is a manual transmission. The second most common transmission type is a form of continuously variable transmission, called the hydrostatic transmission. These transmissions take several forms, from pumps driving separate motors, which may incorporate a gear reduction, to fully integrated units containing a pump, motor and gear reduction. Hydrostatic transmissions are more expensive than mechanical transmissions, but they are easier to use and can transmit greater torque to the wheels compared to a typical mechanical transmission. The least common drive type, and the most expensive, is electric. There have been a number of attempts to replace hydrostatic transmissions with lower cost alternatives, but these attempts, which include variable belt types, e.g. MTD's \\"Auto Drive\\", and toroidal, have various performance or perception problems that have caused their market life to be short or their market penetration to be limited. Riding lawn mowers can often mount other devices, such as rototillers/rotavators, snow plows, snow blowers, yard vacuums, occasionally even front buckets or fork-lift tines (these are more properly known as \\"lawn tractors\\" in this case, being designed for a number of tasks). The ability to tow other devices is because they have multiple gears, often up to 5 or 6 and variable top speeds. The deck of a rotary mower is typically made of steel. Lighter steel is used on less expensive models, and heavier steel on more expensive models for durability. Other deck materials include aluminium, which does not rust and is a staple of higher priced mowers, and hard composite plastic, which does not rust and is lighter and less expensive than aluminium. Electric mowers typically have a plastic deck. Riding mowers typically have an opening in the side or rear of the housing where the cut grass is expelled, as do most rotary lawn mowers. Some have a grass catcher attachment at the opening to bag the grass clippings. Mulching mowers use special mulching blades which are available for rotary mowers. The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin blades to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing of grass clippings while reducing lawn waste in such a way that also creates convenient compost for the lawn, forgoing the expense and adverse environmental effect of fertilizer. Mower manufacturers market their mowers as side discharge, 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or side discharging and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and side discharge. Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some side discharge mower manufacturers also sell separate \\"mulching plates\\" that will cover the opening on the side discharge mower and, in combination with the proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening on the back of the mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the side discharge to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some ride-on mowers, the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected. Rotary mowers with internal combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced mowers use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter steel decks. These mowers are targeted at the residential market and typically price is the most important selling point. Professional grass-cutting equipment (used by large establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities) usually take the form of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a \\"gang-mower\\"). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade type cutters, although high-quality mowed surfaces demand the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade mowers which have decks extended to either side, many to . These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower's width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high speed over the grass surface, and rapid turnaround at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.

Image:Riding-mower- hbs.jpgA zero-turn mower  Safety issues  Rotary mowers can throw out debris with extreme velocity and energy. Additionally, the blades of a self- powered push mower (gasoline or electric) can injure a careless or inattentive user; consequently many come equipped with a dead man's switch to immediately disable the blade rotation when the user is no longer holding the handle. In the United States, over 12,000 people per year are hospitalized as a result of lawn mower accidents. In 2016, 86,000 adults and 4,500 children were admitted to the emergency room for lawnmower injuries. The vast majority of these injuries can be prevented by wearing protective footwear when mowing. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be at least 12 years old before they are allowed to use a walk-behind lawn mower and at least 16 years of age before using a riding mower and that they \\"should not operate lawn mowers until they have displayed the necessary levels of judgment, strength, coordination, and maturity\\". Persons using a mower should wear heavy footwear, eye protection, and hearing protection in the case of engine-powered mowers.  Environmental and occupational impact  Noise level from a lawn mower measured using the NIOSH Sound Level Meter app A 2001 study showed that some mowers produce the same amount of pollution (emissions other than carbon dioxide) in one hour as driving a 1992 model vehicle for .Mindfully.org (2001) Grass Cutting Beats Driving in Making Air Pollution Another estimate puts the amount of pollution from a lawn mower at four times the amount from a car, per hour, although this report is no longer available.RCEQ Reducing Pollution from Small, Gas-Powered Engines Beginning in 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency set standards for lawn equipment emissions and expects a reduction of at least 35 percent. Lawn mowers produce GHG emissions. A minimum-maintained lawn management practice with clipping recycling, and minimum irrigation and mowing, is recommended to mitigate global warming effects from urban turfgrass system Mowers can create significant noise pollution, and could cause hearing loss if used without hearing protection for prolonged periods of time. Lawn mowers also present an occupational hearing hazard to the nearly 1 million people who work in lawn service and ground- keeping. A recent study assessed the occupational noise exposure among groundskeepers at several North Carolina public universities and found noise levels from push lawn mowers measured between 86-95 decibels (A-weighted) and from riding lawn mowers between 88 and 96 dB(A); both types exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit of 85 dB(A). To reduce the possibility of developing hearing loss and reduce noise pollution, users might consider the use of reel mowers or newer \\"green\\" or battery-operated mowers. Appropriate hearing protection such as earplugs or earmuffs will also help reduce the amount of sound that the user hears, which in turn can reduce hearing loss caused by lawn mowers. It is possible for a lawn mower to damage the underlying soil, the grass'es roots, and the mower itself if the blades cut through the grass and collide with the underlying ground. Therefore, it is important to adjust mower height properly and choose the right tires for lawn mower to prevent any marking or digging.

She is also known for her 11-year run with Hoda Kotb, on the fourth hour of NBC's Today show (2008‚Äì2019). She has received 11 Daytime Emmy nominations and won her first Daytime Emmy in 2010 as part of the Today team. Gifford's first television role had been as Tom Kennedy's singer/sidekick on the syndicated version of Name That Tune only in the 1977‚Äì1978 season. She also occasionally appeared on the first three hours of Today and was a contributing NBC News correspondent. Kathie Lee married Paul Johnson, a composer/arranger/producer/publisher of Christian music, in 1976. After their divorce in 1982, she married sportscaster and former NFL player Frank Gifford in 1986. He died in 2015. Kathie Lee has released studio albums and written books. Early life and beginnings Gifford was born Kathryn Lee Epstein in Paris, France, to American parents, Joan (born Cuttell; January 20, 1930 ‚Äì September 12, 2017), a singer, and Aaron Epstein (March 19, 1924 ‚Äì November 19, 2002), a musician and former US Navy Chief Petty Officer. Aaron Epstein was stationed with his family in France at the time of Gifford's birth. Gifford grew up in Bowie, Maryland, and attended Bowie High School. Gifford's paternal grandfather was a Russian Jew from Saint Petersburg and her paternal grandmother was of Native American ancestry. Her mother, a relative of writer Rudyard Kipling, was of French Canadian, German and English descent. After seeing the Billy Graham‚Äìproduced film The Restless Ones at age 12, Gifford became a born-again Christian. She told interviewer Larry King, \\"I was raised with many Jewish traditions and raised to be very grateful for my Jewish heritage.\\"\\"What's Next for Kathie Lee?\\", Transcripts.cnn.com During high school, Gifford was a singer in a folk group, \\"Pennsylvania Next Right\\", which performed frequently at school assemblies. After high school graduation in 1971, Gifford attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, studying drama and music. During a summer in the early 1970s, she was a live-in secretary/babysitter for Anita Bryant at her home in Miami. Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee On June 24, 1985, Kathie Lee replaced Ann Abernathy as co- host of The Morning Show on WABC-TV with Regis Philbin.

Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee were jointly nominated eight consecutive years in a row (1993 to 2000) for Outstanding Talk Show Host during the Daytime Emmy Awards. Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda  On March 31, 2008, NBC announced that Gifford was to join its morning show, Today, as co-host of the fourth hour titled Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda, alongside Hoda Kotb. This marked her return to morning television; in many markets, she aired directly after her old show, currently called Live with Kelly and Ryan. Because the fourth hour of Today airs live at 10:00 am ET, and Live with Kelly and Ryan airs live at 9:00 am ET, Gifford's hour did not compete directly with her former show in most markets. Kotb and Gifford replaced Ann Curry and Natalie Morales. In the weeks prior to Gifford's arrival, ratings indicated 1.9 million viewers of the fourth hour of Today. As of 2014, the fourth hour of Today with Gifford and Kotb has averaged 2.15 million total viewers, an increase of 13 percent over the 2008 ratings.\\"TODAY is the No. 1 Morning Program for 797 Weeks Straight and Counting\\" On December 11, 2018, it was announced that she would be leaving Today in April 2019.

It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1971.  Name  The area now known as Garden of the Gods was first called Red Rock Corral by the Europeans. Then, in August 1859, two surveyors who helped to set up Colorado City explored the site. One of the surveyors, M. S. Beach, suggested that it would be a \\"capital place for a beer garden\\". His companion, the young Rufus Cable, awestruck by the impressive rock formations, exclaimed, \\"Beer Garden! Why, it is a fit place for the Gods to assemble. We will call it the Garden of the Gods.\\" The name \\"Garden of the Gods\\" was also later given to a section of the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., filled with large sandstone rock formations, because of the area's resemblance to Colorado's Garden of the Gods. The story goes that back in the early days of Hollywood, a movie producer seeking a rocky filming location made a comment to the effect of, \\"Who needs to go all the way to Colorado -- we have our own 'Garden of the Gods' here!\\" The Iverson family took the comment to heart and began calling their own collection of rock formations the \\"Garden of the Gods,\\" and the name stuck. Today the main section of Chatsworth's Garden of the Gods has also been preserved as a park.  History  Balanced Rock presents a popular photo opportunity The Garden of the Gods' red rock formations were created during a geological upheaval along a natural fault line millions of years ago. Archaeological evidence shows that prehistoric people visited Garden of the Gods about 1330 BC. At about 250 BC, Native American people camped in the park; they are believed to have been attracted to wildlife and plant life in the area and used overhangs created by the rocks for shelter. Many native peoples have reported a connection to Garden of the Gods, including Apache, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, Lakota, Pawnee, Shoshone, and Ute people. Multiple American Indian Nations traveled through Garden of the Gods. The Utes' oral traditions tell of their creation at the Garden of the Gods, and petroglyphs have been found in the park that are typical of early Utes. The Utes found red rocks to have a spiritual connection and camped near Manitou Springs and the creek near Rock Ledge Ranch bordering Garden of the Gods. The Old Ute Trail went past Garden of the Gods to Ute Pass and led later explorers through Manitou Springs. Starting in the 16th century, Spanish explorers and later European American explorers and trappers traveled through the area, including Lt. John C. Fr√©mont and Lt. George Frederick Ruxton, who recorded their visits in their journals. In 1879 Charles Elliott Perkins, a friend of William Jackson Palmer, purchased 480 acres of land that included a portion of the present Garden of the Gods. Upon Perkins' death, his family gave the land to the City of Colorado Springs in 1909, with the provision that it would be a free public park. Palmer had owned the Rock Ledge Ranch and upon his death it was donated to the city. Helen Hunt Jackson wrote of the park, \\"You wind among rocks of every conceivable and inconceivable shape and size... all bright red, all motionless and silent, with a strange look of having been just stopped and held back in the very climax of some supernatural catastrophe.\\" In 1995 the Garden of the Gods Visitor and Nature Center was opened just outside the park.  Geological formations  The outstanding geologic features of the park are the ancient sedimentary beds of deep-red, pink and white sandstones, conglomerates and limestone that were deposited horizontally, but have now been tilted vertically and faulted into \\"fins\\" by the immense mountain building forces caused by the uplift of the Rocky Mountains and the Pikes Peak massif. The following Pleistocene Ice Age resulted in erosion and glaciation of the rock, creating the present rock formations. Evidence of past ages can be read in the rocks: ancient seas, eroded remains of ancestral mountain ranges, alluvial fans, sandy beaches and great sand dune fields. The resulting rocks had different shapes: toppled, overturned, stood-up, pushed around and slanted. Balanced Rock, composed of the Fountain Formation, is a combination of coarse sand, gravel, silica and hematite. It is hematite that gives the large Balanced Rock its red hue. Balanced Rock was formed as erosive processes removed softer layers near its base, eventually leaving the precarious-looking formation seen today. The Gateway Rocks, Three Graces, and other outcroppings are sedimentary layers that had been pushed up vertically. The largest outcroppings in the park, \\"North Gateway\\", \\"South Gateway\\", \\"Gray Rock\\", and \\"Sleeping Giant\\" are composed primarily of Lyons Formation, a stone made of fine sand from ancient sand dunes.

Ecology  The Garden of the Gods Park is a rich ecological resource. Retired biology professor Richard Beidleman notes that the park is \\"the most striking contrast between plains and mountains in North America\\" with respect to biology, geology, climate, and scenery. The skull of a dinosaur was found in the park in 1878, and was identified as a unique species, Theiophytalia kerri, in 2006. A subspecies of honey ant not previously recorded was also discovered in 1879 and named after the park. Mule deer, bighorn sheep and fox are common. The park is also home to more than 130 species of birds including white-throated swifts, swallows and canyon wrens.  Recreation  The Garden of the Gods Park is popular for hiking, technical rock climbing, road and mountain biking and horseback riding. It attracts more than two million visitors a year, making it the city's most visited park. There are 21 miles of trails. Annual events including summer running races, recreational bike rides and Pro Cycling Challenge Prologue also take place in this park. The main trail in the park, the 1.5-mile Perkins Central Garden Trail, is paved and wheelchair-accessible, running \\"through the heart of the park's largest and most scenic red rocks\\". The trail begins at the North Parking lot, the main parking lot off of Juniper Way Loop. Because of the unusual and steep rock formations in the park, it is an attractive destination for rock climbers. Rock climbing is permitted, with annual permits obtained at the City of Colorado Springs' website. Climbers are required to follow the \\"Technical Climbing Regulations and Guidelines\\", which includes using proper equipment, climbing in parties of two or more, and a ban on staining chalks. Precipitation makes rocks unstable and therefore climbing is not allowed when the rocks are wet or icy. There are fines for unregistered climbers and possibly rescue costs. Several fatalities have occurred over the years, often when unlawful climbers fail to use proper safety equipment, or, more rarely, when a lawful climber falls due to equipment failure or user error.  Visitor and nature center  The Garden of the Gods Visitor and Nature Center is located at 1805 N. 30th Street and offers a view of the park. The center's information center and 30 educational exhibits are staffed by Parks, Recreation and Culture employees of the City of Colorado Springs. A short movie, How Did Those Red Rocks Get There?, runs every 20 minutes. A portion of the proceeds from the center's privately owned store and cafe support the non- profit Garden of the Gods Foundation; the money is used for maintenance and improvements to the park. Natural history exhibits include minerals, geology, plants and local wildlife, as well as Native Americans who visited the park. Programs include nature hikes and talks, a Junior Ranger program, narrated bus tours, movies, educational programs and special programs. Hours and admission Both the Garden of the Gods Park and the Visitor and Nature Center are free to the public. As of July, 2013, the park hours are 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. from May 1 to October 31; 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. from November 1 to April 30. The Visitor and Nature Center is open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend; the remainder of the year it is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Designations  * National Natural Landmark in 1971 * Great American Public Place of 2011 by the American Planning Association. The Great American Places are defined by many criteria, including architectural features, accessibility, functionality and community involvement.

She created over 400 gardens in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States, and wrote over 1,000 articles for magazines such as Country Life and William Robinson's The Garden.Bisgrove, Richard. The Gardens of Gertrude Jekyll.London: Frances Lincoln, 2006. Jekyll has been described as \\"a premier influence in garden design\\" by British and American gardening enthusiasts.  Early life  Jekyll was born at 2 Grafton Street, Mayfair, London, the fifth of the seven children of Captain Edward Joseph Hill Jekyll, an officer in the Grenadier Guards, and his wife Julia Hammersley. Her younger brother, Walter Jekyll (an Anglican priest; sometime Minor Canon of Worcester Cathedral and Chaplain of Malta), was a friend of Robert Louis Stevenson, who borrowed the family name for his famous novella Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. In 1848 her family left London and moved to Bramley House, Surrey, where she spent her formative years. She never married and had no children.  Themes  Jekyll was one half of one of the most influential and historical partnerships of the Arts and Crafts movement, thanks to her association with the English architect Edwin Lutyens, for whose projects she created numerous landscapes and who designed her home Munstead Wood, near Godalming in Surrey.Tankard, Judith B. and Martin A. Wood. Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood. Bramley Books, 1998. (In 1900, Lutyens and Jekyll's brother Herbert designed the British Pavilion for the Paris Exposition.) Jekyll is remembered for her outstanding designs and subtle, painterly approach to the arrangement of the gardens she created, particularly her \\"hardy flower borders\\". Her work is known for its radiant colour and the brush-like strokes of her plantings; it is suggested by some that the Impressionistic-style schemes may have been due to Jekyll's deteriorating eyesight, which largely put an end to her career as a painter and watercolourist. Her artistic ability had been evident when she was a child and she had trained as an artist. She was one of the first of her profession to take into account the colour, texture, and experience of gardens as aspects of her designs. Jekyll's theory of how to design with colour was influenced by painter J.M.W. Turner and by Impressionism, and by the theoretical colour wheel. Her focus on gardening began at South Kensington School of Art, where she became interested in the creative art of planting, and more specifically, gardening. Jekyll later returned to her childhood home in the village of Bramley, Surrey to design a garden in Snowdenham Lane called Millmead. Not wanting to limit her influence to teaching the practice of gardening, Jekyll incorporated in her work the theory of gardening and an understanding of the plants themselves.Wood, Martin. The Unknown Gertrude Jekyll.London: Frances Lincoln, 2006. Her writing was influenced by her friend Theresa Earle who had published her \\"Pot-pourri\\" books. In works like Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden (reprinted 1988) she put her imprint on modern uses of \\"warm\\" and \\"cool\\" flower colours in gardens. Her concern that plants should be displayed to best effect even when cut for the house, led her to design her own range of glass flower vases. Later in life, Jekyll collected and contributed a vast array of plants solely for the purpose of preservation to numerous institutions across Britain. At the time of her death, she had designed over 400 gardens in Britain, Europe and a few in North America. Jekyll was also known for her prolific writing. She wrote over fifteen books, ranging from Wood and Garden and her most famous book, Colour in the Flower Garden, to memoirs of her youth. She was also interested in traditional cottage furnishings and rural crafts, and concerned that they were disappearing. Her book Old West Surrey (1904) records many aspects of 19th-century country life, with over 300 photographs taken by Jekyll.

More than half were directly commissioned, but many were created in collaboration with architects such as Lutyens and Robert Lorimer. Most of her gardens are lost. A small number have been restored, including her own garden at Munstead Wood, the gardens of Hestercombe House, and those of Woolverstone House and the Manor House in Upton Grey that she designed for the magazine editor Charles Holme.Betty Massingham (2006 [1975]). Gertrude Jekyll: An Illustrated Life of Gertrude Jekyll, 1843‚Äì1932. Princes Risborough: Shire Press. p. 44.  Awards  Jekyll was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1897 and the Veitch Memorial Medal of the society in 1929. Also in 1929, she was given the George Robert White Medal of Honor of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.Michael Tooley (2004). Jekyll, Gertrude (1843‚Äì1932). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press.  Burial  Jekyll family memorial in Busbridge Church churchyard Jekyll is buried in the churchyard of Busbridge Church, formerly known as St John the Baptist, Busbridge, Godalming, next to her brother, Herbert Jekyll, and his wife, the artist, writer and philanthropist Agnes Jekyll. The Jekyll family memorial was designed by Edwin Lutyens. Legacy In 1911 the Corporation of Guildford, UK, built an extension to Guildford Museum to house the now internationally important collection of traditional household items that she collected during her life and that she gifted to Surrey Archaeological Society. Some artefacts associated with her life and work are also housed there. On November 29, 2017, which would have been Jekyll's 174th birthday, a Google Doodle was released honouring her.

Habitat Though lizards of the genus Acanthodactylus prefer dry and sparsely vegetated regions, they are not strictly tied to an arid terrain; so it is not uncommon to come across them in various environments. Description Members of the genus Acanthodactylus possess the following combination of traits: *Lacking occipital scales, *Flat ventral scales, *Fingers with three or four series of scales, *Toes with comb- like projections, *Femoral pores present, *Parietal foramen present. The coloration and pattern of spots of Acanthodactylus is extremely variable, so it is unsurprising that zoologists have, at one time or another, classified every variety as a separate species. Behavior Every saurian of the genus Acanthodactylus is very aggressive and gets continuously involved in skirmishes with other members of its species. The males strenuously defend the borders of their territories. Reproduction Acanthodactylus are oviparous. The number of eggs in a clutch ranges from 3 to 7.

The common name of these lizards is Keel-bellied Lizards.Spawls et al. 2002 Habitat and natural history Not much is known but all species of this genus are diurnal, arboreal and often secretive. They inhabit forests, woodland and thicket of coastal plains from sea level to 2000 m altitude. Usually they live high up in the trees 10 m or more above ground level and hide in holes or under loose bark. For sun-basking and feeding (insects and other arthropods, also smaller lizards) they move on branches using their prehensile tails as balancing organs. Eggs are laid in moist tree holes. Gastropholis prasina is known to produce clutches of five-ten eggs. At 26-29 ¬∞C incubation temperature the eggs hatched after 61 days.Ashe & Ashe 1999 Diagnosis Gastropholis shares with the other genera of Equatorial African lacertids (EAL; Adolfus, Congolacerta, Holaspis) the consistently absent parietal foramen, the parietal scale extending to the edge of the parietal table and a single postnasal scale. The species of Gastropholis are characterized by a high ventral scale count (10-14 rows, other EAL only 6 rows transversely), keeled ventrals (smooth in all other EAL), and a long prehensile tail. Gastropholis species are the largest of the EAL clade with adult snout-vent lengths of 80‚Äì110 mm. They are well adapted for climbing with their long limbs, hooked claws and long tails. For a key to the species of Gastropholis see Arnold (1989).

Werner, 1895 Holaspis guentheri Gray, 1863 Hind foot of Holaspis guentheri Holaspis is a genus of equatorial African lizards in the family Lacertidae. These lizards are capable of gliding flight for distances of 30 meters (98 feet). Etymology The New Latin word \\"Holaspis \\" is derived from the Greek words \\" aspis\\", ·ºÄœÉœÄŒØœÇ (= a buckler, or round shield) and \\" holos\\", ·ΩÖŒªŒøœÇ, ·ΩÖŒªœâœÇ (= whole, all, complete). It refers to the head scalation with frontoparietal and occipital scales all fused. Description In morphology-based parsimony and compatibility analyses Arnold (1989) recognized a clade called the \\"Equatorial African group\\" including Adolfus, Gastropholis, and Holaspis. In all lacertids of this clade the parietal foramen is consistently absent, the parietal scale extends to the edge of the parietal table, and the postnasal scale is single. In Holaspis the head and body are very depressed, frontoparietal and occipital scales are all fused to shields, the tail is depressed with lateral fringes of scales, and the third and fourth toes of the forefoot are fused for nearly their entire joint. There are two longitudinal rows of smooth broad band-like scales down the vertebral line of the back and on the tail. The ventral scales are smooth. The collar is composed of 9 to 15 small scales. 16 to 24 femoral pores are present, more developed in males. Maximum total length (including tail) in both species is , and maximum snout-vent-length (SVL) is . There is no sexual dimorphism in SVL, but males have larger heads and their tail base is wider.Boulenger 1921Kroniger & Bosch 2001Kroniger 2004 Dorsally the ground colour is black. On the head from the tip of the snout to the nape of the neck there is a yellow to yellow greenish median line. On each side of the back outside the large dorsal scales there runs a turquoise to sky blue longitudinal stripe which fuses on the tail base. From there it travels as a clear blue stripe partly interrupted onto the tip of the tail. The pattern of the flanks differs in the two species: In H. guentheri there are two yellowish brown to greyish lines on the flanks while in H. laevis there runs only one broader yellowish brown to red brown or usually beige stripe from the tip of the snout to the hind limb. The wide tail scales on the sides are yellow to orange-coloured. The number of light or dark stripes is the only known external morphological difference between the two species. As Arnold (1989) wrote: H. guentheri: \\"A dark vertebral stripe on body and three dark stripes on each side\\". H. laevis: \\"A dark vertebral stripe and two dark stripes on each side\\". Ventrally the lizards are coloured yellow or orange to greenish-orange, partly with a mother-of-pearl shimmer. Males are often more brightly coloured. Juveniles resemble their parents but the coloured dorsal stripes are narrower and less intensely coloured. Ventrally the juveniles are pitch-black in contrast to the adults. Habitat and natural history Holaspis are diurnal, arboreal, extremely agil lacertids and able to move on vertical and overhanging surfaces with body and tail pressed closely to the surface. They live on larger trees at least above the forest floor in primary forest, man-influenzed areas and even in Eucalyptus forest with smooth bark but are not found in closed forest. The serrated tail is considered as an additional tree climbing adaption to increase grip.Arnold 1989Spawls et al. 2002Kroniger & Bosch 2001Kroniger 2004Dunger 1967 They are active hunters of small insects and other arthropods like ants, grasshoppers and spiders, often investigating crevices in which they also frequently hide. Not much is known about the reproduction in nature. More than one clutch/year is produced. Females lay two eggs under loose bark or in leaf litter. Specimen from northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo laid eggs in June and females from Nyasaland caught on 3 August held two well developed eggs.Loveridge 1953 Flight The species of Holaspis are unique among lacertids in being capable of gliding flight between trees up to 30 m distance. Adaptions for gliding are the flat body and tail, the fused fingers and their low body mass. Their bones are packed full of air spaces, making the lizard's skeleton feather light for gliding. Photo shows H. laevisVanhooydonck et al. 2009Arnold 2002Schi√∏tz & Vols√∏e 1959Schmidt 1919 They are less specialized for flight than species of the agamid genus Draco or gekkonid genus Ptychozoon. Vivarium keeping Holaspis species are occasionally kept as pets. But Holaspis guentheri and H. laevis are often confused in pet trade or generally named H. guentheri because H. laevis was formerly only a subspecies of H. guentheri. Nearly all Holaspis in the pet trade are H. laevis. For discrimination of the two species see \\"Description\\". Captive breeding resulted in an increase of information on the biology of Holaspis. Photo shows H. laevisMeyer 2000 Species Two species are recognized as being valid.

Species of this genus are distributed in Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Zambia, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania) but one subspecies (Latastia longicaudata andersonii) lives in Yemen.The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Collectively, they are known as long-tailed lizards. Etymology Jacques von Bedriaga named this genus in honor of French herpetologist Fernand Lataste.Bedriaga 1884. Diagnosis Species of Latastia are medium to large-sized lacertids with long cylindrical tails. The unregenerated tail is up to 3.2 times longer than head and body. Eyes with movable lids. The nostril is surrounded by 3-5 scales and usually reaches the first supralabial. The collar is well marked. Ventral plates smooth and in 6 longitudinal series (sometimes 8-10 with outer plates small). The dorsal scales are homogenous, small and granular or imbricate. There are no expanded scales along the mid-back line as in Philochortus. Femoral pores are present on the inside of the thighs, more prominent in males. Tail base in males much broader than in females.Boulenger 1921 Habitat and natural history Most long-tailed lizards of the genus Latastia inhabit well vegetated sandy or gravelly plains and large wadis in western and eastern Africa. They can be found in semidesert scrubland and deciduous Acacia-Commiphora bushland where scrubby undergrowth is plentiful,Baha El Din 2006 in moist savanna and high grassland Spawls et al. 2002 or in millet fields.Dunger 1967 Latastia boscai boscai and L. b. burii are known to occur in stony and rocky localities.Loveridge 1936 Species of Latastia are distributed from sea level to 2000 m altitude.Parker 1942 They are diurnal, heliophilous and terrestrial, extremely wary fast-running lacertids which wander over large territories but forage mostly within vegetation cover during the heat of the day. They dart out into the sun to capture insects and other arthropods, after which they retreat into shady areas beneath bushes (thermoregulation). All species lay eggs but clutch details are known only for L. longicaudata. The population in Senegal (L. l. longicaudata) produces clutches of 5-7 eggs between July and September Ciss√©, M. & Karns, D.R. 1978 while females of L. l. revoili in southeastern Kenya lay only 3-4 eggs/clutch. Hatchlings appear during the wet season. Species 342x342px The genus is composed of 10 recognized species.

Species of this genus are distributed in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Mali, Niger, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. Etymology Philochortus means grass-loving (Greek: philos = friend, chortos = grass).Schleich et al. 1996 The common name of Philochortus species is therefore grass-loving lizards, or shield-backed ground lizards because of their typical back scalation and terrestrial habitat. Diagnosis Species of Philochortus are medium to large-sized lacertids with long cylindrical tails. The unregenerated tail is up to 3.25 times longer than head and body. Eyes with movable lids. The nostril is pierced between two shields and usually bordered by the first supralabial or narrowly separated from it. The collar is well marked. The ventral plates are smooth, feebly imbricate and arranged in 6 longitudinal series. The dorsal scales are smooth or keeled. Back with 2 to 6 longitudinal series of enlarged plate-like scales along the dorsal mid-line. This is the main difference to Latastia. Femoral pores are present on the inside of the thighs, more prominent in males. Tail base in males much broader than in females.Boulenger 1921 Habitat and natural history The natural history of all species of Philochortus is only poorly known. Many of the species inhabit semiarid, arid or hyperarid regions, mountainous areas as well as plains from sea level up to 1500 m altitude (P. neumanni ). Most species prefer sparsely vegetated, open and sandy or fairly rocky localities (P. neumanni ) and can be found in Acacia-Commiphora deciduous bushland and semidesert bushland vegetation types. But P. zolii and P. neumanni can be found also in marginal unattended cultivated areas with Desmostachya bipinnata grass and other scrub and well vegetated natural habitats.Parker 1942Spawls et al. 2002Baha El Din 2006 The species of Philochortus are diurnal, sun-loving active predators on insects and other arthropods, egg-laying and terrestrial but P. zolii is an avid climber. The long stiff tail is aiding in balance on vegetation. They dig burrows in the soil below clumps of grasses or small bushes.

Its members look very similar to lizards of the genus Lacerta, to which they were considered to belong until the 1970s. While similar externally and ecologically, Podarcis form a distinct group differing from Lacerta by the construction of the skull and the hemipenis, and by the processes of the caudal vertebrae. They are commonly known as wall lizards. They are native to Europe and northern Africa, and most species are restricted to the Mediterranean region.

The genus Poromera is monotypic, containing the single species, Poromera fordii, commonly known as the West African striped lizard. The species is endemic to western Central Africa. Etymology Poromera is derived from the Greek words \\"p√≥ros\\" ( œÄœåœÅŒøœÇ) which means \\"pore\\" or \\"duct\\" and \\"mƒìr√≥s\\" ( ŒºŒ∑œÅœåœÇ) which means \\"thigh\\". Poromera refers to the long series of femoral pores on the thighs of this species. The specific name, fordii, is in honor of Dr. Henry A. Ford, a medical missionary in Gabon, who collected specimens for the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Poromera fordii, p. 92). Description The body of P. fordii is moderately or rather feebly depressed, the head feebly depressed. The head-shields are normal. The nostril is pierced between the nasal, two postnasals, and the first upper labial. The lower eyelid is scaly. The distinct collar contains 12-14 pointed, strongly keeled plates. The back is covered with large, platelike, subimbricate scales with strong keels forming 6 or 8 continuous lines, the sides with small juxtaposed scales. The ventral plates are pointed, imbricate, keeled and arranged in 8 (or 10) longitudinal and 22-27 transversal rows. Males have a large preanal plate which is bordered by a semicircle of pointed keeled scales, while in females the preanal region is covered with pointed keeled scales (sexual dimorphism). The digits are slightly compressed, with tubercular lamellae interiorly. The 10-15 femoral pores on each side form a long series and are more developed in males. The caudal scales are pointed and very strongly keeled. The tail is cylindrical and very long, 2 to 2.5 times as long as the head and body.Boulenger 1921.Boulenger 1887. Snout-vent-length is up to ; total length is almost .Schmidt 1919. The ground colour of the body is dark olive above, often turning to bronze or copper-coloured posteriorly. Two light dorsal streaks, bright greenish or bluish white, sometimes edged with black anteriorly originate from the middle of the posterior border of the parietal shield. The streaks often disappear on the posterior part of the back. The back between the light streaks is sometimes blackish, which shade is continued as a stripe to the base of the tail. On the posterior back and tail base traces of a light vertebral streak are sometimes present in the young. The upper lip is bluish green. The tail is uniform brownish or reddish brown in the young, sometimes with a dorsal series of black spots. The lower parts of body are coloured greenish white in front and salmon-pink behind. Geographic range and habitat P. fordii is distributed in westerns parts of Cameroon,LeBreton 1999. Equatorial Guinea (Fernando Po Island),Mertens 1968. GabonPauwels et al. 2004. and south to Democratic Republic of Congo (western Bas-Congo)Nagy et al. 2013. from almost sea level up to altitude in Cameroon. It is a diurnal, semiarboreal forest species that can be found in flimsy, grassy and lower vegetation often near permanent streams. Reproduction The West African striped lizard presumably lays eggs.Freyhof 1994.Orriols 2011. Diet The diet of P. fordii consists of insects and other arthropods.

The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Common names for the genus are false sand lizards or racerunners.Spawls et al. 2002. Distribution Species of this genus are distributed from southeastern Egypt (Gebel Elba region) along coastal regions of the Red Sea in Sudan to Eritrea, eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia and northern Kenya. The center of the diversification of this genus is Somalia. Diagnosis Pseuderemias are small to medium-sized dorso-laterally compressed lacertids with very narrow snouts. Each nostrils is surrounded by four nasal scales and is not reached by the first supralabial. The upper head shields are smooth, rugose or pitted. The eyes have movable lids. There is no vertebral series of enlarged scales down the middle of the back, the dorsal scales are roughly homogenous. A collar is present. The ventral scales are smooth and arranged in six to ten longitudinal rows. The toes are strongly compressed and the subdigital lamellae are keeled. The tail is long, up to three times as long as head and body. Femoral pores are present. The ground colour is greyish or light brown to brownish red, brick red, dark brown or almost black. On the back there are usually some creme or whitish stripes and/or dots which are arranged in longitudinal lines. Some species like P. erythrosticta lack stripes and are spotted with dark dots. Hatchlings are generally more intensely striped than adults.Boulenger 1921. Habitat and natural history Only one species (P. mucronata) reaches north to Egypt and inhabits along the Red Sea coastal dunes and sandy plains with fairly good vegetation cover.Baha El Din 2006. Other species are distributed in low-lying, arid Somali-Masai Acacia-Commiphora deciduous bushland and semi-desert shrubland vegetation in eastern Africa. Little is known of the natural history of Pseuderemias species. They are small diurnal, active, terrestrial lacertids that feed on small insects and other arthropods and lay eggs.

They are covered with small, non-overlapping, bead-like scales, with osteoderms on the undersides of their bodies. All species are dark in color, with yellowish or pinkish markings. Heloderma is the only living genus of the family Helodermatidae. Beaded lizards are venomous.http://herpetology.com/helobite.txt Venom glands are located in their lower jaws, unlike snakes' venom glands, which are located in their upper jaws. Also, unlike snakes, beaded lizards lack the musculature to inject venom. The venom is typically used only in defense, rather than in subduing prey, and the lizard must chew its victim to work the venom into the flesh. Venom glands are believed to have evolved early in the lineage leading to the modern helodermatids, as their presence is indicated even in the 65-million- year-old fossil genus Paraderma.Richard L. Cifelli, Randall L. Nydam. 1995. Primitive, helodermatid-like platynotans from the Early cretaceous of Utah. Herpetologica. 51(3):286-291. Venom production among lizards was long thought to be unique to this genus, but researchers studying venom production have proposed many others also produce some venom, all placed in the clade Toxicofera, which includes all snakes and 13 other families of lizards.. However, except for snakes, helodermatids, and possibly varanids, envenomation is not considered medically significant for humans. Helodermatids are carnivorous, preying on rodents and other small mammals, and eating the eggs of birds and reptiles. They are oviparous, laying large clutches of eggs. Taxonomy Family Helodermatidae * Genus Heloderma ** H. alvarezi Bogert & Martin del Campo, 1956; Chiapan beaded lizard ** H. charlesbogerti Campbell & Vannini, 1988; Guatemalan beaded lizard ** H. exasperatum Bogert & Martin Del Campo, 1956; Rio Fuerte beaded lizard ** H. horridum (Wiegmann, 1829); Mexican beaded lizard ** H. suspectum Cope, 1869; Gila monster Members of the genus Heloderma have many extinct relatives in the Helodermatidae whose evolutionary history may be traced back to the Cretaceous period, such as Estesia. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (8,000-10,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizards and the Gila monster appear closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicates they are better placed in a separate family. Mexican beaded lizard skeleton (Museum of Osteology) The type species is Heloderma horridum, which was first described in 1829 by Arend Weigmann. Although he originally assigned it the generic name Trachyderma, he changed it to Heloderma six months later, which means \\"studded skin\\", from the Ancient Greek words h√™los (Œ∑ŒªŒøœÇ)--the head of a nail or stud--and derma (Œ¥ŒµœÅŒºŒ±), meaning skin.  In captivity  H. horridum, H. exasperatum, and H. suspectum are frequently found in captivity and are well represented in zoos throughout much of the world. They are often bred for the exotic pet trade and can command high prices. The other two species of Heloderma, H. alvarezi and H. charlesbogerti, are extremely rare, and only a few captive specimens are known. A Chiapan beaded lizard in captivity.

It is the length of time between placement into service of a single item and that item's onset of wearout. Another use of the term design life deals with consumer products. Many products employ design life as one factor of their differentiation from competing products and components. A disposable camera is designed to withstand a short life, whilst an expensive single-lens reflex camera can be expected to have a design life measured in years or decades. (Clearly in this example there are other differentiators.) Long design lives Some products designed for heavy or demanding use are so well-made that they are retained and used well beyond their design life. Some public transport vehicles come into this category, as do a number of artificial satellites and spacecraft. In general, entry-level products--those at the lowest end of the price range fulfilling a certain specification--will tend to have shorter design lives than more expensive products fulfilling the same function, since there are savings to be made in using designs that are cheaper to implement, or, conversely, costs to be passed onto the customer in engineering to provide a safe margin leading to an increased working life. This economic truism leads to the phenomenon of products designed (or appearing to be designed) to last only so long as their warranty period. Obsolescence Design life is related to but distinct from the concept of built-in obsolescence. The latter is the somewhat more nebulous notion that products are designed so as to become obsolete--at least in the eyes of the user--before the end of their design life. Two classic examples here are digital cameras, which become genuinely obsolete as a result of the very rapid rate of technological advances, although still in perfect working order; and non-digital cameras, which are perceived as obsolete after a year or so as they are no longer \\"the latest design\\" although actually capable of years of useful service.

In 2009, de Zayas in collaboration with Justice Jakob M√∂ller published the book United Nations Human Rights Committee Case Law 1977-2008. The first Chairman of the Human Rights Committee, Andreas Mavrommatis, wrote a preface for the handbook. In a review published in the UN Special magazine by former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bertrand Ramcharan, the latter offered the following description of the book: \\"It is staggering how much the Human Rights Committee has influenced the human rights jurisprudence of the world, as is striking from reading this exceedingly important book.... From the outset of its work in 1977 there have been two Secretariat pioneers in developing the case law of the Committee when it considers petitions from individuals claiming violations of their rights: Jakob M√∂ller (Iceland) and Alfred de Zayas (USA). M√∂ller was the first Chief of the Petitions branch of what is today the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and de Zayas was his colleague, who eventually succeeded him as Chief. ...Every lawyer, every judge, every public- spirited citizen will want to consult this fascinating book, because it tells us what is legally right and legally wrong, how to judge our governments, our societies, our United Nations and ourselves.\\" De Zayas has written scholarly articles that were published in the Harvard International Law Journal, the UBC Law Review,37 U.B.C.Law Review 277-341 (2004) the International Review of the Red Cross, the Criminal Law Forum, the Refugee Survey Quarterly,Refugee Survey Quarterly, volume 16, 1997 the Netherlands International Law Review, The International Commission of Jurists Review,The Follow-up procedure of the UN Human Rights Committee, No. 47, December 1991, pp. 28-35 the Historical Journal, Politique internationale,\\"Les Armeniens et le Droit au Recours\\", Dossier Special 2015, pp. 143-154 the German Yearbook of International Law, Canadian Human Rights YearbookThe uncertain scope of Article 15(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\\" 1983, pp. 237-255 and the East European Quarterly,\\"The Legality of Mass Population Transfers\\" vol XII, No. 1 (1978) pp. 1-24, vol.

De Zayas has published chapters in books Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe co-edited by Steven V√°rdy and Hunt Tooley.Columbia University Press, New York, 2003 In International Humanitarian Law: Origins, edited by John Carey, de Zayas wrote the chapter \\"Ethnic Cleansing, Applicable Norms, Emerging Jurisprudence, Implementable Remedies\\". His chapter in Spanish \\"El crimen contra la paz\\" was published in the book La Declaraci√≥n de Luarca sobre el Derecho Humano a la Paz, edited by Carmen Rosa Rueda Casta√±√≥n and Carlos Vill√°n Dur√°n. =On the 1944-50 expulsion of Germans= De Zayas' work into the expulsion of Germans from their areas in eastern Germany and Eastern Europe at the end of World War II is extensive.Zayas, Alfred-Maurice de: A Terrible Revenge: The Ethnic Cleansing of the Eastern European Germans 1944‚Äì1950, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1994 In 1975, he published a study in the Harvard International Law Journal, questioning the legality of the expulsion of possibly as many as 15 million Germans from their homes after World War II, invoking the Atlantic Charter, the Hague Conventions, and the Nuremberg Principles. The article was followed by his first book Nemesis at Potsdam (Routledge und Kegan Paul, 1977) which focused on what, if any, responsibility the British and U.S. governments had for decisions which purportedly led to the expulsions of these ethnic Germans. The book had a preface by Dwight Eisenhower's political advisor, Robert Daniel Murphy, a participant at the Potsdam conference. British historian Tony Howarth reviewed it in the Times Educational Supplement as \\"a lucid, scholarly and compassionate study\\". Nuremberg prosecutor Ben Ferencz wrote in the American Journal of International law that it was \\"a persuasive commentary on the suffering which becomes inevitable when humanitarianIsm is subordinated to nationalism\\". The New Statesman said that \\"in his well researched, closely reasoned work, de Zayas leaves little doubt that there have been few historical parallels to this record of modern mass atrocity\\". In the same year, an enlarged German edition was published by the legal publisher C. H. Beck, becoming a bestseller. In this book, Zayas took an interdisciplinary approach to the phenomenon of \\"population transfers\\" and examined the situation of the ethnic Germans from both a historical and legal perspective. De Zayas was reportedly the first American historian to address this topic. Deutsche Welle reported in 2007: \\"He wrote the first scholarly work on German expellees to appear in English, breaking what had long been a taboo topic.\\" The German Federal Minister Heinrich Windelen wrote in the foreword to de Zayas's book Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung: \\"It is thanks to De Zayas that the debate on The Expulsion has been reopened [...] In the subsequent period, a number of authors have drawn on the work of De Zayas. Thus, he has contributed significantly to the fact that discussion of The Expulsion is no longer considered taboo.\\"Heinrich Windelen, \\"Foreword\\" in A. de Zayas, Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung der Deutschen aus dem Osten, Kohlhammer Verlag, 1993; According to a doctoral thesis on the historiography of the expulsion, \\"de Zayas was one of the earliest 'respectable' academics to take up the cause of the expellees... De Zayas does not mention the Holocaust, the Jews, or any other minority ethnic groups that suffered under the Nazis except in passing.\\"Robert Bard, \\"Historical Memory of the Expulsion of Ethnic Germans in Europe 1944‚Äì1947\\" , University of Hertfordshire, July 2009. However, Professor Doerr in the Dalhousie Review notes: \\"De Zayas does not ignore the enormity of the crimes committed by Germans during the course of the war, nor does he deny that an anti-German feeling was natural and that punishment was justified, He does, however, question whether one set of crimes justified a second... whether revenge ... was not only extended to the guilty but to the innocent, whether expulsion itself was a crime ...While critical of western leadership, de Zayas leaves no doubt about the agents of the crime-- the Soviet leaders. ...Praised must be de Zayas's reopening of this largely neglected aspect of modern German history.\\"Dalhousie Review, vol. 57, No. 3, Autumn 1977, pp. 582‚Äì584. The 1999 University of Hertfordshire doctoral dissertation of Robert Bard, Historical Memory of the expulsion of ethnic Germans in Europe 1944‚Äì1947, cites de Zayas 58 times and comments approvingly on the historical analysis of Nemesis at Potsdam and A Terrible Revenge. He notes:\\"De Zayas' senior position with the UN Human Rights Commission, his position as a United States citizen (not a German) and his indisputable humanitarian credentials meant that de Zayas' work was taken seriously in Germany and America.\\" His second book, written with Walter Rabus, The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, was published in Germany by Universitas/, in 1979, and the English translation by de Zayas himself by the University of Nebraska Press in 1989. This describes some of the work of the Wehrmacht- Untersuchungsstelle, a special section of the legal department of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, which investigated Allied and German war crimes. The authors argue that the Bureau carefully investigated war crimes and was largely free of Nazi ideology. De Zayas was the first researcher to work with the 226 extant volumes (about half of the total, the rest apparently having been burned in Langensalza, Germany, near the end of the war.Zayas, Alfred- Maurice de, The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939‚Äì1945, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, 1989, pp. xiii‚Äìxiv.). The book was savagely attacked in the media of the Soviet Union and its satellites.Eugeniusz Guz,Trybuna Ludo, 30. VIII. 1980, Nr. 179.\\"Zdumiewajacy obiektywizm Zayasa\\". Glos Szczecinski, 5. 3. 1980. In a review of the book in the Cambridge Law Journal, Professor of International Law at the University of Cambridge and judge at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Christopher Greenwood considered the book to be \\"excellent\\" and that \\"the authors deserve the gratitude of all those interested in the laws of war but unable to read German for bringing out an English edition.\\" He goes on to add that \\"Throughout the book the authors emphasize that all the cases they examined have to be seen against the background of the Holocaust and the atrocities committed by the German armed forces and SS.\\" In the Fletcher Forum, Alfred Rubin stated that \\"De Zayas is undoubtedly one of the world's leading legal scholars addressing forced population transfers ... [his] work provides massive confirmation of the truism that atrocities are committed in war by all sides, that many go unpunished, and some are part of national policy....the possibility that truth might be misused in argument by the devil is not a reason to suppress truth. I have no personal doubt that this book is a useful attempt to preserve an important truth. By writing it, the author -- whose own humanitarian sympathies are beyond question, as is Levie's scholarly detachment --has done a service to scholarship.\\" Dieter Fleck, in Archiv des Voelkerrechts, underlined that \\"this well-written book is based on thorough research of original sources.\\" The British novelist Philip Kerr took the WUSt functionaries as subject of his novel A Man without Breath, published 2013 by Penguin; in the \\"Author's note\\" (p. 463) Kerr writes: \\"The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau continued to exist until 1945. Anyone who wishes to know more about its work should consult the excellent book of the same name by Alfred de Zayas.\\"Philip Kerr, \\"A Man without breath\\", New York, Penguin 2013, . In the Historical Journal (Cambridge), vol. 35, 1992, de Zayas published a detailed analysis of the working methods of \\"The Wehrmacht Bureau on War Crimes\\". The FAZ favourably reviewed the article: \\"Following careful study of the records, cross-checking in foreign archives and more than three hundred interviews with surviving witnesses and military judges, de Zayas arrives at the conclusion that the investigations are reliable.\\"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 9 December 199. p. N5. The International Committee of the Red Cross has republished parts of The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau in its teaching manual \\"How does Law Protect in War\\", edited by Marco Sassoli and Antoine Bouvier His third book was A Terrible Revenge, The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans, 1944‚Äì1950, published in the United States in 1993 by Palgrave Macmillan and in Germany in 1986. According to PhD candidate Robert Bard, this book \\"was, as [de Zayas] says, written 'to generate interest in this hitherto ignored tragedy [the German ethnic expulsions] and lead to a new respect for these forgotten victims and to more compassion and understanding for our neighbours.' De Zayas in his introduction states that the book originated in a 1981 'prime-time television broadcast in Germany' which dealt with the expulsions, and in which he took part.\\" The book was described as \\"problematic\\" by historians Konrad Jarausch and Michael Geyer.Konrad H. Jarausch, Michael Geyer Shattered Past: Reconstructing German Histories Princeton University Press, 24 March 2009 p.210 Historians Dan Diner and Joel Golb write that the tendency of \\"allow[ing] the Germans to perceive themselves also as victims\\" is \\"manifest in the work of the best-selling author Alfred- Maurice de Zayas\\". Nottingham Trent University Bill Niven writes that de Zayas is \\"often cited in support of the comparability thesis\\", i.e. the argument that crimes committed by Germany during the war were equivalent to crimes committed against it. A review of his The German Expellees in the scholarly journal Central European History describes it as having a \\"distinctively revisionist flavour\\". By contrast, Andreas Hillgruber wrote in the Historische Zeitschrift: \\" His succinct and incisive recounting of the events are summarized in ten historical and six international law theses, that precisely because of their lucidity and balance deserve a permanent place in the historiography of the expulsions.\\" Gotthold Rhode wrote in the FAZ: \\"de Zayas lets the victims themselves tell their story, providing reports that were hitherto unknown... the book has the character of a new 'Documentation on the Expulsions' and contains descriptions of cruelties and suffering that four decades after the events boggle the mind.\\"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 23 Mai 1987, S. 11. Henry Stanhome in the London Times wrote: \\"De Zayas's moving plea is that one's home should be a human right. As frontiers once more shift in Eastern Europe and families flee in Bosnia, he could hardly have chosen a better moment to deliver it.\\" (18 November 1993) Publishers Weekly: \\"This relatively unknown holocaust claimed more than two million lives...De Zayas... has uncovered testimony in German and American archives detailing these atrocities, adding a new chapter to the annals of human cruelty. His carefully documented book serves as a reminder that many different peoples have been subjected to 'ethnic cleansing'\\". (July 1994). Twenty years later Matthias Stickler reviewed a revised edition in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \\"Es vermittelt anschaulich, gut lesbar, quellenorientiert und ohne Polemik Grundwissen zu einem nach wie vor wichtigen Thema\\" (the book imparts knowledge on a still very relevant topic vividly, in straightforward language, based on reliable sources and without polemics).\\" Historian Ernest Fisher reviewed it in the US Army magazine Army: \\"The author has given the history of these expulsions a dramatic immediacy through a series of eyewitness accounts ... The remarkable sequel to this recital of inhumanity is that this displaced population has, in the 50 years since the war, managed to find a new home in a reunited Germany where nearly 20 percent of the population is made up of first- or second-generation descendants of these exiled millions.\\" De Zayas' book Nemesis at Potsdam likewise received a positive review in the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung by historian Patrick Sutter. His 2011 book V√∂lkermord als Staatsgeheimnis (Genocide as State Secret) with a substantive preface by Karl Doehring, Director of the Max Planck Institute for International Law in Heidelberg, explored the issue of who knew what when about the Holocaust. He is the first historian to have reviewed the issue in the light of published and unpublished Nuremberg documents, and in the light of interviews with Nuremberg prosecutors and defense attorneys, Holocaust survivors as well as German military judges and politicians. He argued that the policy of exterminating the Jews was \\"geheime Reichssache\\", and treated pursuant to Hitler's Order Nr. 1 (F√ºhrerbefehl Nr. 1) as a \\"state secret\\". Accordingly, although there were diffuse rumours about killings, no one except a very limited number of persons knew exactly what was going on, neither the industrialization of the killing nor the number of victims. German historian Martin Moll wrote that de Zayas' book ignored the fact that in other research, scholars have found convincing evidence that knowledge of murders was partial but present. Overall, he found the book to be \\"a hard-to-read, confusing, poorly argued book that lags far behind the differentiated state of research represented primarily by [Peter] Longerich\\". The review by Bernward D√∂rner in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described it as an \\"attempt to deny contemporary perceptions of genocide\\", while the French-German Historian Alfred Grosser strongly criticized the D√∂rner review as political and \\"completely one-sided\\", accusing the reviewer of ideological bias and unhistorical approach. Grosser cited the reviewer's own words on \\"stragegy\\": \\"The question of contemporary perception of the Holocaust is of strategic importance. Because if it had actually been the case that the genocide could have remained secret, this would severely limit the shared responsibility of the German population in the genocide.\\" In other words, as the title of Grosser's article implies (\\"the return of collective guilt\\"), it is a question of instrumentalizing guilt for political purposes, and Zayas was not playing the game. On the other hand, the Journal of Hebrew University's Holocaust Institute, Genocide Prevention Now, observed in its review \\"As the footnotes abundantly manifest, de Zayas is keenly aware of the secondary literature in the field. He takes issue with some of the conclusions of historians like Goldhagen, Gellately, Longerich and Bankier, and tends to agree with the analysis of Michael Marrus, Gordon Craig, Peter Hoffmann and Hans Mommsen. But while he carefully considers the opinions of other scholars, he does not rehash what is already in the secondary literature ‚Äì he takes a fresh look at the evidence, poses new questions ‚Äì and proposes possible answers, avoiding guessing and extrapolation. He places the evidence in historical context, avoiding the anachronisms that some historians indulge in.\\"Genocide Prevention Now, Issue 8, Winter 2011 Memberships * Amnesty International * Geneva- based Club de la Presse * International Association of American Minorities * Acad√©mie Internationale de Droit Constitutionel (Tunis) * Corps Rhenania T√ºbingen * German World Alliance * United Nations Christian Association * P.E.N.

ASIG pressed for the entry of Switzerland into the United Nations and assisted internationals in their integratation to Swiss society. Since the 1990s, he has also focused on the genocides, which were relatively little known, against the Armenians, Greeks of Pontos and Assyro-Chaldeans under the Ottoman Empire before, during, and after the First World War. He participated in a genocide conference at the University of Pittsburgh in March 2000 and published the chapter \\"The first genocide of the twentieth century\\" in the Columbia University book \\"Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth Century Europe\\" edited by Professor Steven Vardy, in 2005 he spoke at the American University in Yerevan, Armenia, a lecture which resulted in Zayas' book \\"the Genocide against the Armenians.\\" In 2007 he published an article on \\"The Istanbul Pogrom of September 1955.\\" He advocates the creation of a Constitutional Convention for Cyprus and published a proposal together with Professors Malcolm Shaw and Andreas Auer and published relevant articles in the Cyprus Yearbook of International Law 2006 and 2007. In 2011 he published a chapter on the Ottoman genocide of Christian Minorities in the 2011 book edited by Tessa Hofmann, \\"the Genocide of the Ottoman Greeks\\" (Caratzas, New York, pp. 311‚Äì 341), and in 2019 participated in the international genocide conference in Athens, where he delivered two papers He is an active member of many NGOs and has been in the avant-garde of the movement to recognize the human right to peace. For decades, de Zayas has taken on the causes of \\"unsung victims\\", such as the Mujahedin of Iran, particularly the MEK members held in camps Ashraf I, II and III. In July 2019, Zayas joined European dignitaries in showing their solidarity with the victims of the Mullahs. He has also been on several UN Panels dealing with the human rights situation of the Iranian people and condemning decades of impunity. He has called for a peaceful solution to the dispute between India and Pakistan in accordance with pertinent UN resolutions and the right of self-determination of the Kashmiris. He has advocated the rights of many minorities and indigenous peoples to autonomy and self- determination in United Nations fora and before parliamentarians in the European Parliament, including the Armenians of Nagorno Karabagh, the Saharaoui population of Western Sahara, the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the Bubis of the Island of Bioko/Equatorian Guinea, the Catalans of Spain, and the Igbos and Ogonis of Nigeria. de Zayas is an advocate of reviewing certain decolonization issues in the light of the UN Charter and General Assembly resolutions. In particular, he has criticized the Spanish amalgamation of the distinct Bubi people of Bioko Island with the people of another Spanish colony, Equatorial Guinea. Spain amalgamated the two just before \\"decolonization\\". The result was that the Bubis were denied self-determination and instead of having Spain as the \\"master\\", now they have Equatorial Guinea. Since his early retirement from the UN in 2003, de Zayas has become a vocal critic of the 2003 Iraq War indefinite detention in Guantanamo, secret CIA prisons, and extreme poverty. On 29 September 2017, de Zayas, alongside another UN independent commissioner, David Kaye, issued a statement in which they considered the attitude of the Spanish government as \\"violating fundamental individual rights, limiting the flow of public information at such a critical moment for the Spanish democracy\\" during the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. De Zayas is a registered Republican voter, although he supported Bernie Sanders in 2016. Writing in 2018 in the Canadian magazine \\"Humanist Perspectives\\", he warned about the growing radicalism of the Antifa movement in Germany, reminiscent of the Nazi SA of the 1930s: \\" A new wave of totalitarianism is sweeping through Germany with the collusion of the mainstream media, which ... seldom criticize Antifa\\" and downplay their anti- democratic violence. On several occasions de Zayas has been invited as an expert before German courts\\"Stellungnahme vor dem Rechtsausschuss des Deutschen Bundestages zu den Drucksachen 13/353 und 13/354\\", in Humanit√§res V√∂lkerrecht, No. 1, 1996, pp. 18-28\\" and before the Rechtsausschuss (legal committee) of the German Bundestag, invited by the CDU/CSU. In 2019 he spoke as an expert before the Menschenrechtsausschuss (Human Rights Committee) of the Bundestag, in March on the issue of humanitarian aid, in September on the issue of impunity. On this occasion de Zayas was invited as an expert by the AfD to speak on multilateralism in the 21st century, a lecture which he gave in the aula maxima of the University of Tuebingen in May 2019. United Nations Independent Expert In 2012, de Zayas was elected as the Independent Expert by the Human Rights Council, after being nominated by the President of the Council, Laura Dupuy Lasserre. He presented his first report to the UN Human Rights Council at its 21st session in September 2012, calling for uniform application of international law.Report of the Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, Alfred- Maurice de Zayas , United Nations Human Rights Council. On 2 November 2012, he presented his interim report to the UN General Assembly in New York. Doc. A/67/277. On 10 September 2013 he presented his second report to the Human Rights Council A/HRC/24/38, and, in October 2013 his second report to the GA . A/68/284, to the UN General Assembly exploring initiatives and enforcement mechanisms to further advance a democratic and equitable international order. The Swiss cartoonist Philippe Becquelin (Mix&Remix;) devoted one of his cartoons to Alfred de Zayas. On 10 September 2014, de Zayas presented his third report on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order to the Human Rights Council. During its 27th session in September 2014 the Human Rights Council extended his mandate through 2018 pursuant to resolution A/HRC/RES/27/9. On 27 October 2014, he presented his third report to the General Assembly on the right to self-determination (A/69/272) In the press release issued the following day, he stated: \\"The realization of the right of self-determination is essential to maintaining local, regional and international peace and must be seen as an important conflict-prevention strategy.\\" On 10 September 2015 he presented his fourth report to the council on the adverse human rights impacts of free trade and investment agreements on a democratic and equitable international order, and on 26 October 2015 to the General Assembly on the issue of investor state dispute settlement. The main observations of these reports were reported by news outlets such as Reuters, The Guardian, The Huffington Post, Russia Today (RT), and The Independent. In 2015, the US based magazine of global politics, Foreign Policy, consulted with the UN Independent Expert on the application of the right to self- determination in the Indonesian region of West Papua. During his mandate, he addressed multiple contemporary world issues, welcoming the Arms Trade Treaty and urging States to regulate not only trade but also production of arms. In 2015, following a press release, de Zayas urged trade negotiators to address the Doha Round commitments to promote equal and fair trade at the Tenth Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya.The Guardian published his op-ed on adverse human rights impacts of free trade and investment agreements. In the following year, the UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order submitted his report on the adverse impact of World Bank policies on human rights and the realisation of a democratic and equitable international order to the UN Human Rights Council. On 21 July 2017, de Zayas presented his last report to the UN General Assembly on the human rights impact of IMF policies and practice. The report was sent to the UN Human Rights Council on 25 January 2018. On 15 March 2018, he formulated his 23 principles of international order. In 2017, a 1982 photo of de Zayas in blackface which he had posted on his website was described as \\"racist and offensive\\" by UN Watch. On his website, the photo caption reads: \\"Ten years later Mardi Gras in Geneva, 1982 ‚Äì imitating Al Jolson,the jazz singer, celebrating UNESCO world intangible heritage of mankind ‚Äì Colombia's inter- racial Carneval de los Negros y los Blancos. On 25 February 2018, The UN Independent Expert issued a memorandum that states: \\"I have come to understand that the lawful political status of the Hawaiian Islands is that of a sovereign nation-state in continuity; but a nation state that is under a strange form of occupation by the United States resulting from an illegal military occupation and fraudulent annexation. As such, international laws (The Hague and Geneva Conventions) require that governance and legal matters within the occupied territory of the Hawaiian Islands must be administered by the application of laws by the occupied state (in this case, the Hawaiian Kingdom) not the domestic laws of the occupier (the United States).\\" =Report on Venezuela= In late 2017, de Zayas was the first UN rapporteur to visit Venezuela in 21 years. For the report, he interviewed 12 Venezuelan government ministers, opposition politicians, 35 NGOs working in the country, academics, church officials, activists, chambers of commerce and regional UN agencies., also available via reliefweb The report, published in August 2018, found internal overdependence on oil, poor governance and corruption had damaged the Venezuelan economy (see Crisis in Venezuela), but that ‚Äúeconomic warfare‚Äù practised by the US, EU and Canada were major factors in the crisis and recommended economic sanctions be investigated by the International Criminal Court as possible crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. The report was received positively by the Venezuelan government. De Zayas later noted that the published comments of the government on the report acknowledged the efforts of the rapporteur to meet all relevant stakeholders and convene UN and other agencies with a view to addressing the economic and emigration crisis. The comments indicate that the government accepts most of the expert's recommendations, record that in December 80 detainees were released and that new cooperation agreements with UN agencies were signed, as proposed by the expert. At the presentation of the report on 10 September 2018, Fundalatin, the oldest Venezuelan human rights non-governmental organization, established in 1978, welcomed the report and its findings. Its President, Mar√≠a Eugenia Russian, stated: ‚ÄúWe share the warning of this expert from the UN who has been able to confirm that the issue of the humanitarian crisis is a technical term that is being used unduly and irresponsibly ‚Äì through an intense media campaign ‚Äì as a pretext to justify a military intervention in Venezuela‚Äù. Other NGOs, including the Grupo Sures (which groups some fifty Venezuelan NGOs), and the Red Nacional de Derechos Humanos, endorsed the report. The findings and conclusions of Zayas were well received by economists Jeffrey Sachs and Mark Weisbrot, who in April 2019 published a study for the thinktank Center for Economic and Policy Research on the human rights impact of sanctions on Venezuela. In January 2019, the Third World Network published an updated article by de Zayas on the issues. The call of de Zayas for the lifting of sanctions against Venezuela has been echoed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, and by many other UN rapporteurs including Idriss Jazairy, Alena Douha and Hilal Elver. De Zayas' report has also been criticised. More than eighty Venezuelan organizations questioned de Zayas' conclusions that there was not a humanitarian crisis in the country. During the 167th session of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, during a discussion of health and nutrition in Venezuela, the Venezuelan state representative screened an interview by state broadcaster Telesur with de Zayas, in which he assured the audience there was not a humanitarian crisis in the country and that to solve the economic problems the \\"economic war\\" must end and that the \\"economic sanctions placed by the U.S., Canada and the European Union\\" should be lifted. Nutrition expert , advisor to PROVEA and Caritas Organization of Venezuela, voiced her concern, noting that de Zayas was only one out of forty rapporteurs, and declaring that during his visit to the country and after meeting with civil society organizations, de Zayas only took pictures of the counter of the charcuterie in front of his hotel. Raffalli also added that by then, four United Nations rapporteurs declared about the \\"grave\\" situation in the country. On 29 November 2018 de Zayas lectured at the University of Lund, Sweden, on the adverse human rights impacts of sanctions on Venezuela.{{cite weburl=https://issuu.com/theperspectivemagazine/docs/magazine_no_3_2018_issue_2e292acfe30dc0date=17 December 2017website=Issuulanguage=engaccess-date=16 January 2019 One of the masters' students wrote his thesis on the subject, relying on Zayas and UN reports by the rapporteurs on sanctions, the right to food, the right to health, focusing also on the adverse impacts during the Covid-19 pandemic.The dissertation was published 2020 by Lund University under the title 'Starving for Justice'.

The site was originally launched as TeacherRatings.com and converted to RateMyProfessors in 2001. RMP was acquired in 2005 by Patrick Nagle and William DeSantis.Wired Magazine - 2005 Nagle and DeSantis later resold RMP in 2007 to Viacom's MTVU, MTV's College channel. Viacom owned and operated RateMyProfessors.com for a decade. Cheddar announced its acquisition of RMP from Viacom in 2018. RMP is the largest online destination for professor ratings. The site includes 8,000+ schools, 1.7 million professors, and over 19 million ratings.  Ratings and reviews  Users who have or are currently taking a particular professor's course may post a rating and review of any professor that is already listed on the site. Furthermore, users may create a listing for any individual not already listed. To be posted, a rater must rate the course and/or professor on a 1-5 scale in the following categories: \\"overall quality\\" and \\"level of difficulty\\". The rater may also share if they would take the professor again, if the class was taken for credit, if attendance is mandatory, if the textbook is used, what grade they received in the course, and include comments of up to max 350 characters in length. Raters may also select up to 3 tags that describes the professor from a list of 20.http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/AddRating.jsp?tid=1458112http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/help.jsp#tally According to the website's help page, \\"a professor‚Äôs Overall Quality rating should reflect how well a professor teaches the course material, and how helpful he/she is both inside and outside of the classroom\\".http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/help.jsp The professor's Overall Quality rating determines whether his/her name is accompanied by a smiley face (meaning \\"Good Quality\\"), a frowny face (\\"Poor Quality\\"), or an in-between, expressionless face (\\"Average Quality\\").  Correlation with in-class student evaluations  = RateMyProfessors.com versus formal in-class student evaluations = Using data for 426 instructors at the University of Maine, [researchers] examined the relationship between RMP indices and formal in- class student evaluations of teaching (SET). This study found that the two primary RMP indices correlated significantly with their respective SET items. First, RMP \\"overall quality\\" showed a correlation of r = .68 with SET item \\"Overall, how would you rate the instructor?\\" Second, RMP \\"ease\\" showed a correlation of r = .44 with SET item \\"How did the work load for this course compare to that of others of equal credit?\\" Further, RMP \\"overall quality\\" (r = .57) and RMP \\"ease\\" (r = .51) were each correlated with its corresponding SET factor derived from a principal components analysis of all 29 SET items. The researchers concluded \\"While these RMP/SET correlations should give pause to those who are inclined to dismiss RMP indices as meaningless, the amount of variance left unexplained in SET criteria limits the utility of RMP.\\".  Criticism  =Stanford Law School and Reputation Protection= Two Stanford law professors argue that a legal framework for protecting online platform reputation should be responsive to the changing set of practices ushered in by the Internet and capable of resolving conflicts in a fair and satisfactory way. In light of recent failed lawsuits against online content providers, the professors advocate for \\"a new regime requiring such platforms to formulate an appropriate information policy providing transparency rules, including disclosing how aggregate evaluations are made and providing for a right to respond, to achieve a new body of communication ‚Äúnetiquette‚Äù for social evaluation in the online era.\\"Anne SY Cheung and Wolfgang Schulz, \\"Reputation Protection on Online Rating Sites,\\" 21 STAN. TECH. L. REV. 310 (2018) =Positive correlation between ease of class and rating of professor= Research on in-class evaluations shows that professor ratings increase when students rate the course as easy.Mau, Ronald R., & Opengart, Rose A. (2012). Comparing Ratings: In-Class (Paper) vs. out of Class (Online) Student Evaluations. Higher Education Studies, 2(3), 55-68. The same relationship has been shown for RMP. In an article in the journal Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education, Clayson investigated what RMP actually rates and concluded that \\"students will give higher evaluations to instructors they judge as being easy. There is also a suggestion in these Ô¨Åndings that, if students like an instructor (for whatever reason), then the easiness of the class becomes relatively irrelevant.\\".Dennis E. Clayson (2013) What does ratemyprofessors.com actually rate?, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 39:6, 678-698, DOI: 10.1080/02602938.2013.861384 Clayson concluded that \\"the majority of the evidence indicates that [ratemyprofessors.com] is biassed by a halo effect, and creates what most accurately could be called a 'likeability' scale.\\" Other analyses of RMP class ratings have come to similar conclusions,Legg, Angela & H. Wilson, Janie. (2012). RateMyProfessors.com offers biased evaluations. Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education. 37. 89-97. 10.1080/02602938.2010.507299.http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/features/2007/ratings.aspxCastro, Daniel, and Robert Atkinson. ‚ÄúWhy it‚Äôs time to disrupt higher education by separating learning from credentialing‚Äù.

Koper, John Mitchell, and Michael Stinson. Attractiveness, easiness and other issues: student evaluations of professors on ratemyprofessors.com. Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 33(1):45‚Äì61, 2008 Felton et al. evaluated RMP ratings and found that \\"the hotter and easier professors are, the more likely they‚Äôll get rated as a good teacher.\\"David Epstein, \\"‚ÄòHotness‚Äô and Quality\\", Inside Higher Ed, 8 May 2006, accessed 10 May 2008. =Evaluation bias issues= A frequent criticism of RMP is that there is little reason to think that the ratings accurately reflect the quality of the professors rated. Another criticism is that ratings have been shown to reflect gender bias toward the professors evaluated. Furthermore, at RMP, \\"easiness\\", \\"clarity\\", and \\"helpfulness\\" are the only components taken into consideration and are not considered well- designed evaluations.See Fritz Machlup and T. Wilson, cited in Paul Trout, \\"Deconstructing an Evaluation Form\\", The Montana Professor, Vol. 8 No. 3, Fall 1998, accessed 7 May 2008. Edward Nuhfer argues that both Pickaprof.com and RMP \\"are transparently obvious in their advocacy that describes a 'good teacher' as an easy grader. Additionally, presenter Phil Abrami ... rated RMP as 'The worst evaluation I've seen' during a panel discussion on student evaluations at the 2005 annual AERA meeting.\\"Edward B. Nuhfer, 2005, \\"A Fractal Thinker Looks at Student Evaluations\\", accessed 10 May 2008. =Multiple ratings per person= Single individuals are able to make multiple separate ratings of a single professor on RMP.Gabriela Montell, \\"The Art of the Bogus Rating\\", Chronicle of Higher Education, September 27, 2006 RMP admits Pfeiffer, \\"Ratings sites flourish behind a veil of anonymity\\". that while it does not allow such multiple ratings from any one IP address, it has no control over raters who use several different computers, or those that \\"spoof\\" IP addresses. Also, there is no way of knowing that those who rate a professor's course have actually taken the course in question, making it possible for professors to rate themselves and each other.Montell, \\"The Art of the Bogus Rating\\", Chronicle of Higher Education. =Rating relevancy= Critics stated that a number of the ratings focus on qualities they see as irrelevant to teaching, such as physical appearance. In late June 2018, several academics criticized the website's \\"hotness\\" score for contributing to sexism in academia. On 28 June, RateMyProfessors responded that while the feature was intended to \\"reflect a dynamic/exciting teaching style,\\" it was often misused; the hotness rating was removed immediately. It is common at universities and colleges for faculty (especially junior faculty) to be called on by their departments to teach courses on topics that are not within their area(s) of expertise, which can earn them poor ratings at RMP that do not reflect the ability of those professors to teach courses on subjects that they are much more qualified to teach. RateMyProfessors, though it lets the student identify the course that they took with the professor, combines the ratings for all courses taught by each professor, instead of providing separate ratings averages for each course taught. =Permanent vs adjunct faculty= Adjunct faculty are not always readily identifiable nor verifiable, as such professors may work at multiple universities, change universities frequently, or maintain employment outside an academic setting.  Data breach  On January 11, 2016, RMP notified its users via email (and with a small notification link on its website) that a decommissioned version of RMP's website suffered a data breach affecting email addresses, passwords, and registration dates. According to the California Department of Justice website, the security breach occurred six weeks earlier on or about November 26, 2015.https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-59576  Website features  =Professor Notes= After mtvU took over the website, a notes feature was added that allows professors to register with the website (using a \\".edu\\" e-mail address) in order to reply to students' comments. Another option, called \\"Professors Strike Back\\", featured videos of professors responding to their ratings on RMP.Professors Strike Back on mtvU - As Seen on Rate My Professors Additionally, in 2015, the site debuted a new series \\"Professors Read Their Ratings\\"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/blog/video/albion-college-professors- read-their-ratings-part-2/ in which professors read and react to their RMP ratings. Students may also submit videos to RMP.http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/blog/video/submit-to-ratemyprofessors-com =School ratings= Students can also comment on and rate their school by visiting their school's RMP school page. School Ratings categories include Academic Reputation, Location, Campus, School Library, Food, Clubs & Activities, Social Events, and Happiness. =Top Lists= RMP annually compiles Top Lists of the Highest Rated Professors and Top Schools in the U.S. based on ratings and comments from students.http://toplists.ratemyprofessors.com/ For the first time, along with the release of their 2011-2012 Top Lists, RMP debuted its \\"Fun Lists.\\" =Recognition= In 2008 RMP was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 50 best websites of 2008. In 2008, student evaluations of Professors from RMP accounted for 25% of a school's rating in Forbes annual \\"America's Best Colleges\\" listing. However, this is no longer true.https://www.forbes.com/sites/cartercoudriet/2017/08/02/top- colleges-2017-the-methodology/ In 2015, the site won two People's Choice Webby Awards after an extensive site overhaul.http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/blog/buzzpost/weve-won-two-peoples- voice-webby-awards/ =Competitors= The rating company has a variety of competitors.

Heavy bombers are bomber aircraft capable of delivering the largest payload of air-to-ground weaponry (usually bombs) and longest range of their era. Archetypal heavy bombers have therefore usually been among the largest and most powerful military aircraft at any point in time. In the second half of the 20th century, heavy bombers were largely superseded by strategic bombers, which were often smaller in size, but had much longer ranges and were capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Because of advances in aircraft design and engineering ‚Äî especially in powerplants and aerodynamics ‚Äî the size of payloads carried by heavy bombers has increased at rates greater than increases in the size of their airframes. The largest bombers of World War I, the four engine aircraft built by the Zeppelin-Staaken company in Germany, could carry a payload of up to of bombs. By the middle of World War II even a single-engine fighter-bomber could carry a bomb load, and such aircraft were taking over from light and medium bombers in the tactical bombing role. Advancements in four-engine aircraft design enabled heavy bombers to carry even larger payloads to targets thousands of kilometres away. For instance, the Avro Lancaster (introduced in 1942) routinely delivered payloads of (and sometimes up to 22,000 lb/10,000 kg) and had a range of . The B-29 (1944) delivered payloads in excess of and had a range of . By the early 1960s, the jet-powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, travelling at speeds of up to (i.e., more than double that of a Lancaster), could deliver a payload of , over a combat radius of . During World War II, mass production techniques made available large, long-range heavy bombers in such quantities as to allow strategic bombing campaigns to be developed and employed. This culminated in August 1945, when B-29s of the United States Army Air Forces dropped atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The arrival of nuclear weapons and guided missiles permanently changed the nature of military aviation and strategy. After the 1950s intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines began to supersede heavy bombers in the strategic nuclear role. Along with the emergence of more accurate precision-guided munitions (\\"smart bombs\\") and nuclear-armed missiles, which could be carried and delivered by smaller aircraft, these technological advancements eclipsed the heavy bomber's once-central role in strategic warfare by the late 20th century. Heavy bombers have, nevertheless, been used to deliver conventional weapons in several regional conflicts since World War II (e.g., B-52s in the Vietnam War). Heavy bombers are now operated only by the air forces of the United States, Russia and China. They serve in both strategic and tactical bombing roles. World War I The first heavy bomber was designed as an airliner. Igor Sikorsky, an engineer educated in St Petersburg, but born in Kiev of Polish-Russian ancestry designed the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets to fly between his birthplace and his new home. It did so briefly until August 1914, when the Russo-Balt wagon factory converted to a bomber version, with British Sunbeam Crusader V8 engines in place of the German ones in the passenger plane. By December 1914 a squadron of 10 was bombing German positions on the Eastern Front and by summer 1916 there were twenty. It was well-armed with nine machine guns, including a tail gun and initially was immune to German and Austro-Hungarian air attack.Winchester, Jim. \\"Sikorsky Ilya Muromets.\\" Biplanes, Triplanes and Seaplanes (Aviation Factfile). London: Grange Books 2004. The Sikorsky bomber had a wingspan just a few feet shorter than, with a bomb load only 3% of, a World War II Avro Lancaster.David, Donald ed. The complete encyclopaedia of world aircraft. Noble and Barnes, New York 1977. The Handley Page Type O/100 owed a lot to Sikorsky's ideas; of similar size, it used just two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines and could carry up to of bombs. The O/100 was designed at the beginning of the war for the Royal Navy specifically to sink the German High Seas Fleet in Kiel: the Navy called for ‚Äúa bloody paralyser of an aircraft‚ÄùThetford, Owen, British Naval Aircraft Since 1912: 1991 Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD Entering service in late 1916 and based near Dunkirk in France, it was used for daylight raids on naval targets, damaging a German destroyer.Bowyer, Chaz. Handley Page Bombers: 1992 Aston Publications Bourne End, Bucks, England: But after one was lost, the O/100 switched to night attacks. The uprated Handley Page Type O/400 could carry a bomb, and wings of up to 40 were used by the newly formed, independent Royal Air Force from April 1918 to make strategic raids on German railway and industrial targets.Bruce, J. M. Handley Page 0/100 and 0/400: Historic Military Aircraft No.4. Flight ;27 February 1953,Vol. LXIII. issue No. 2301 A single O/400 was used to support T. E. Lawrence's Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The Imperial German Air Service operated the Gotha bomber, which developed a series of marques. The Gotha G.IV operated from occupied Belgium from the Spring of 1917. It mounted several raids on London beginning in May 1917. Some reached no further than Folkestone or Sheerness on the Kent Coast. But on June 13, Gothas killed 162 civilians, including 18 children in a primary school, and injured 432 in East London. Initially defence against air attack was poor, but by May 19, 1918, when 38 Gothas attacked London, six were shot down and another crashed on landing.Cole, Christopher and E.F. Cheesman. The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914‚Äì1918. London: Putnam, 1984. German aircraft companies also built a number of giant bombers, collectively known as the Riesenflugzeug. Most were produced in very small numbers from 1917 onwards and several never entered service. The most numerous were the Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI of which 13 saw service, bombing Russia and London: four were shot down and six lost on landing. The R.VIs were larger than the standard Luftwaffe bombers of World War II.G.W. Haddow & Peter M. Grosz The German Giants, The Story of the R-planes 1914‚Äì1919, Putnam & Company Limited, London 1962 The Vickers Vimy, a long-range heavy bomber powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, was delivered to the newly formed Royal Air Force too late to see action (only one was in France at time of the Armistice with Germany). The Vimy's intended use was to bomb industrial and railway targets in western Germany, which it could reach with its range of and a bomb load of just over a ton. The Vickers Vimy is best known as the aircraft that made the first Atlantic crossing from St John's Newfoundland to Clifden in Ireland piloted by the Englishman John Alcock and navigated by Scot Arthur Whitten Brown on June 14, 1919.Andrews, C.F. and Eric B. Morgan. Vickers Aircraft since 1908, Second edition. London: Putnam, 1988. Strategic bomber theory Between the wars, aviation opinion fixed on two tenets. The first was that ‚Äúthe bomber will always get through.‚Äù The speed advantage of biplane fighters over bombers was insignificant, and it was believed that they would never catch them. Furthermore, there was no effective method of detecting incoming bombers at sufficiently long range to scramble fighters on an interception course. In practice, a combination of new radar technology and advances in monoplane fighter design eroded this disadvantage. Throughout the war, bombers continually managed to strike their targets, but suffered unacceptable losses in the absence of careful planning and escort fighters. Only the later de Havilland Mosquito light bomber was fast enough to evade fighters. Heavy bombers needed defensive armament for protection, which reduced their effective bomb payload.Tate, Dr. James P. The Army and its Air Corps: Army Policy toward Aviation 1919‚Äì1941.] Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama: Air University Press, 1998. . The second tenet was that strategic bombing of industrial capacity, power generation, oil refineries, and coal mines could win a war. This was certainly vindicated by the firebombing of Japanese cities and the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, as Japan's fragile housing and cottage industry made themselves easily vulnerable to attack, thus completely destroying Japanese industrial production (see Air Raids on Japan). It was less evident that it held true for the bombing of Germany. During the war, German industrial production actually increased, despite a sustained Allied bombing campaign. As the German Luftwaffe's main task was to support the army, it never developed a successful heavy bomber. The prime proponent of strategic bombing, Luftwaffe Chief of Staff General Walther Wever, died in an air crash in 1936 on the very day that the specification for the Ural bomber (later won by the Heinkel He 177 which saw only limited use against the Soviet Union and England) was published. After Wever's death, Ernst Udet, development director at the Air Ministry steered the Luftwaffe towards dive bombers instead. World War II When Britain and France declared war on Germany in September 1939, the RAF had no heavy bomber. The Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster both originated as twin engine bombers, but were rapidly redesigned for four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines and rushed into service once the technical problems of the larger Rolls-Royce Vulture emerged. The Halifax joined squadrons in November 1940 and flew its first raid against Le Havre on the night of 11‚Äì12 March 1941. British heavy bomber designs often had three gun turrets with a total of 8 machine guns. In January 1941, the Short Stirling reached squadrons. It was based on the successful Short Sunderland flying boat and shared its Bristol Hercules radial engines, wing, and cockpit. The hull of the flying boat was replaced by a lower fuselage. It carried up to of bombs ‚Äî almost twice the load of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress ‚Äî but over just a radius. Due to its thick, short wing it was able to out-turn the main German night fighters, the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the Junkers Ju 88. Heavy bombers still needed defensive armament for protection, even at night. The Stirling's low operational ceiling of just ‚Äî also caused by the thick wing ‚Äî meant that it was usually picked on by night fighters; within five months, 67 of the 84 aircraft in service had been lost. Due to the absence of British heavy bombers, 20 United States Army Air Corps Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses were lent to the RAF, which during July 1941 commenced daylight attacks on warships and docks at Wilhelmshaven and Brest. These raids were complete failures. After eight aircraft were lost due to combat or breakdown and with many engine failures, the RAF stopped daylight bombing by September.Chant, Christopher. Warplanes of the 20th century. London: Tiger Books International, 1996. It was clear that the B-17C model was not combat ready and that its five machine guns provided inadequate protection. Combat feedback enabled Boeing engineers to improve the aircraft; when the first model B-17E began operating from English airfields in July 1942, it had many more defensive gun positions including a vitally important tail gunner. Eventually U.S. heavy bomber designs, optimized for formation flying, had 10 or more machine guns and/or cannons in both powered turrets and manually operated flexible mounts to deliver protective arcs of fire. These guns were located in tail turrets, side gun ports either just behind the bombardier's clear nose glazing as \\"cheek\\" positions, or midway along the rear fuselage sides as \\"waist\\" positions. U.S. bombers carried .50 caliber machine gun, and dorsal (spine/top of aircraft) and ventral (belly/bottom of aircraft) guns with powered turrets. All of these machine guns could defend against attack when beyond the range of fighter escort; eventually, a total of 13 machine guns were fitted in the B-17G model.Bowers, Peter M. Fortress In The Sky, Granada Hills, California: Sentry Books, 1976. . In order to assemble combat boxes of several aircraft, and later combat wings formed of a number of boxes, assembly ships were used to speed up formation. Even this extra firepower, which increased empty weight by 20% and required more powerful versions of the Wright Cyclone engine, was insufficient to prevent serious losses in daylight. Escort fighters were needed but the RAF interceptors such as the Supermarine Spitfire had very limited endurance. An early raid on Rouen-Sotteville rail yards in Brittany on August 17, 1942, required four Spitfire squadrons outbound and five more for the return trip.Bowers, Peter M. Fortress In The Sky, Granada Hills, California: Sentry Books, 1976. The USAAF chose to attack aircraft factories and component plants. On August 17, 1943, 230 Fortresses attacked a ball-bearing plant in Schweinfurt and again two months later, with 291 bombers, in the second raid on Schweinfurt. The works was severely damaged but at huge cost: 36 aircraft lost in the first raid, 77 in the second. Altogether 850 airmen were killed or captured; only 33 Fortresses returned from the October raid undamagedCraven. Wesley, James Cate The Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume Two: Europe, Torch to Pointblank, August 1942 to December 1943 Chicago: University of Chicago 1954 With the arrival of North American P-51 Mustangs and the fitting of drop tanks to increase the range of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt for the Big Week offensive, between February 20‚Äì25, 1944, bombers were escorted all the way to the target and back. Losses were reduced to 247 out of 3,500 sorties, still devastating but accepted at the time. The B-24 and later version of the Fortress carried even more extensive defensive armament fitted into Sperry ball turrets. This was a superb defensive weapon that rotated a full 360 degrees horizontally with a 90-degree elevation. Its twin M2 Browning machine guns had an effective range of . The Liberator was the result of a proposal to assemble Fortresses in Consolidated plants, with the company returning with its own design of a longer-range, faster and higher-flying aircraft that could carry an extra ton of bombs. Early orders were for France (delivered to the RAF after the fall of France) and Britain, already at war, with just a batch of 36 for the USAAF.Birdsall, Steve. The B-24 Liberator. New York: Arco Publishing Company, Inc., 1968. . Neither the USAAF nor the RAF judged the initial design suitable for bombing and it was first used on a variety of VIP transport and maritime patrol missions. Its long range, however, persuaded the USAAF to send 177 Liberators from Benghazi in Libya to bomb the Romanian oilfields on August 1, 1943, in Operation Tidal Wave. Due to navigational errors and alerted German flak batteries and fighters, only half returned to base although a few landed safely at RAF bases in Cyprus and some in Turkey, where they were interned. Only 33 were undamaged. Damage to the refineries was soon repaired and oil production actually increasedDugan, James and Carrol Stewart: The Ploesti Raid: the great air-ground battle of August 1, 1943, Brassey's, Washington DC. 1998 By October 1942, a new Ford Motor Company plant at Willow Run Michigan was assembling Liberators. Production reached a rate of over one an hour in 1944 helping the B-24 to become the most produced US aircraft of all time. It became the standard heavy bomber in the Pacific and the only one used by the RAAF. The SAAF used Liberators to drop weapons and ammunition during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.cite Davies, Norman; Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw. 2004 Pan Macmillan London The Avro Manchester was a twin engine bomber powered by the ambitious 24-cylinder Rolls-Royce Vulture, but was rapidly redesigned for four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines due to technical problems with the Vulture which caused the aircraft to be unreliable, under-powered and hastened its withdrawal from service. Reaching squadrons early in 1942, the redesigned bomber with four Merlin engines and longer wings was renamed Avro Lancaster; it could deliver a load of bombs or up to with special modifications. The Lancaster's bomb bay was undivided, so that bombs of extraordinary size and weight such as the 10-ton Grand Slam could be carried.Jacobs, Peter. The Lancaster Story. London: Arms & Armour Press, 1996. Barnes Wallis, deputy chief aircraft designer at Vickers, spent much time thinking about weapons that might shorten the war. He conceived his ‚ÄúSpherical Bomb, Surface Torpedo‚Äù after watching his daughter flip pebbles over water. Two versions of the 'bouncing bomb' were developed: the smaller Highball was to be used against ships and attracted essential British Admiralty funding for his project. A flying torpedo, of which half was Torpex torpedo explosive, it was developed specifically to sink the Tirpitz which was moored in Trondheim fjord behind torpedo nets. Development delays in the 'bouncing bomb' meant that another Barnes Wallis invention, the 5-ton Tallboy was deployed instead; two Tallboys dropped by Avro Lancasters from altitude hit at near-supersonic speed and capsized the Tirpitz on November 12, 1944. Upkeep, the larger version of the bouncing bomb, was used to destroy the Mohne and Eder dams by Lancasters from the specially recruited and trained 617 Squadron, often known as the Dambusters, under Wing Commander Guy Gibson.Holland, James:.Dam Busters Bantam Press, 2012 In March and April 1945, as the war in Europe was ending, Lancasters dropped Grand Slams and Tallboys on U-boat pens and railway viaducts across north Germany. At Bielefeld more than of railway viaduct was destroyed by Grand Slams creating an earthquake effect, which shook the foundations.Flower, Stephen. \\"Barnes Wallis‚Äô Bombs.\\" 2004; Tempus , Strood. The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was a development of the Fortress, but a larger design with four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone engines of much greater power, enabling it to fly higher, faster, further and with a bigger bomb load. The mammoth new Wright radial engines were susceptible to overheating if anything malfunctioned, and technical problems with the powerplant seriously delayed the B-29's operational service debut. The aircraft had four remotely operated twin-gun turrets on its fuselage, controlled through an analog computer sighting system; the operator could use any of a trio of Perspex ball stations. Only the tail gunner manually controlled his gun turret station in the rear of the airplane.Willis, David. \\"Boeing B-29 and B-50 Superfortress\\". International Air Power Review, Volume 22, 2007, Westport, Connecticut: AIRtime B-29s were initially deployed to bases in India and China, from which they could reach Japan; but the logistics (including transport of fuel for the B-29 fleet over the Himalayan range) of flying from these remote, primitive airfields were complicated and costly. The island of Saipan in the Marianas was assaulted to provide Pacific air bases from which to bomb Japanese cities. Initial high- level, daylight bombing raids using high-explosive bombs on Japanese cities with their wood and paper houses produced disappointing results; the bombers were then switched to low-level, nighttime incendiary attacks for which they had not originally been designed (one variant, the B-29B was specially modified for low altitude night missions by removal of armament and other equipment). Japan burned furiously from the B-29 incendiary raids. On August 6, 1945, B-29 Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Three days later, B-29 Bockscar dropped another on Nagasaki. The war ended when Japan announced its surrender to the Allies on August 15, and the Japanese government subsequently signed the official instrument of surrender on September 2, 1945.Willis, David. \\"Boeing B-29 and B-50 Superfortress\\". International Air Power Review, Volume 22, 2007, Connecticut: AIRtime After World War II Soviet/Russian Tu-95, Tu-22M, Tu-160 heavy bombers After World War II, the name strategic bomber came into use, for aircraft that could carry aircraft ordnances over long distances behind enemy lines. They were supplemented by smaller fighter-bombers with less range and lighter bomb load, for tactical strikes. Later these were called strike fighters, attack aircraft and multirole combat aircraft. When North Korea attacked South Korea in 1950 the USAF responded with daylight bomber raids on supply lines through North Korea. B-29 Superfortresses flew from Japan on behalf of the United Nations. But the supply to North Korea's army from the Soviet Union was physically and politically out of reach. There were no worthwhile strategic targets in North Korea. The Soviet mentored Northern forces easily routed the South Korean army.Malkasian, Carter, The Korean War 1950‚Äì53. Essential Histories. Fitzroy Dearborn London, Chicago 2001. The distance to North Korea was too great for fighter escorts based in Japan. So the B-29s flew alone. In November, Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-15s flown by Soviet pilots started to intercept the US bombers, over North Korea. The MiG-15 was specifically designed to master US heavy bombers, with nuclear weapons. It could out-perform any fighter deployed by United Nations air forces until the capable F-86 Sabre was produced in greater numbers and brought to Korea. After 28 B-29s were lost, the bombers were restricted to night interdiction and concentrated on destroying supply routes, including the bridges over the Yalu river into China.Yefim, Gordon, The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, Midland Publishing, Leicester, UK 2005 By the 1960s, manned heavy bombers could not match the intercontinental ballistic missile in the strategic nuclear role. More accurate precision-guided munitions (\\"smart bombs\\"), nuclear-armed missiles or bombs were able to be carried by smaller aircraft such as fighter-bombers and multirole fighters. Despite these technological innovations and new capabilities of other contemporary military aircraft, large strategic bombers such as the B-1, B-52 and B-2 have been retained for the role of carpet bombing in several conflicts. The most prolific example (in terms of total bomb tonnage) is the U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress during the 1960s‚Äìearly 1970s Vietnam War era, in Operation Menu, Operation Freedom Deal, and Operation Linebacker II. In 1987 the Soviet Tu-160 ‚Äî the heaviest supersonic bomber/aircraft ever built ‚Äî entered service; it can carry twelve long-range cruise missiles. The 2010 New START agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation defined a \\"heavy bomber\\" by two characteristics: *range greater than *equipped for long- range nuclear \\"air-launched cruise missiles\\" (ALCMs), defined as an air-to- surface cruise missile of a type flight-tested from an aircraft or deployed on a bomber after 1986.

Frederick Bourne St Dunstan's, Mayfield in Mayfield, East Sussex was founded in 960 CE by St Dunstan, who was then Archbishop of Canterbury. It is reported as being originally a log church which lasted until it was replaced by a stone structure in the 12th century by the Normans. In 1389 this church was virtually destroyed by fire. Only the tower, the lancet window in the west wall and the base of the north aisle survive to this day. The local congregation probably used the private chapel at the Archiepiscopal Palace nearby until the church was rebuilt between 1410 and 1420. Further work was carried out during the reign of Henry VIII: the nave roof was raised and the clerestory was added. In 1657 a clock was installed by Thomas Punnett. In the South Porch moulded corbels support a quadripartite rib vault. A newel staircase gives access to the Parvise Room above. This was used as either an oratory for a chantry priest, or as a sacristan. During the 19th century it was used as a cloakroom for the girls' school held in the church. The nave has four tomb slabs of Sussex iron. The best preserved belongs to Thomas Sands, a wine cooper of London. The font dates from 1666 and the initials of the vicar at the time, Robert Peck is carved on the octagonal bowl. The 17th century pulpit is decorated with Jacobean strap-carvings. While many of the choir stalls dated back to the 16th century, some repair work was carried out by the Mayfield School of Carving in the early 20th century. They also provided the Lady Chapel screen, which is an excellent example of linenfold carving. The choir stall were replaced in 2016 by new movable stalls in oak and at the same time the east end was reordered. The perpendicular east window has Munich glass donated by the Treherne family in 1869. In 1894 the old reredos carved by Walter Gale, the village schoolmaster in 1750 was replaced. The pope was said to enjoy this eastern facing window as it represented to him, a gateway between eastern and western culture. During the 1970s cracks in the tower walls meant that it was forbidden to ring all the bells at once. It was fourteen years before the tower could be restored at a cost of ¬£140,000. The bells were retuned at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The oldest bell had been founded by Thomas Giles in 1602 and other founders included Brian Eldredge, Richard Phelps, John Waylett and John Taylor. Many of the memorials in the church belong to the Baker and Kirby families. These were local ironmaster families.

The company operates five free-to-air terrestrial television channels in Hong Kong, with TVB Jade as its main Cantonese language service, and TVB Pearl as its main English service. TVB is headquartered at TVB City at the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate. It began operations on 19 November 1967. The company was registered on 26 July 1965C.R. No:0011781ÔºàTelevision Broadcasts LimitedÔºâ‚ÄîThe Cyber Search Centre of the Integrated Companies Registry Information System and was co-founded by Sir Run Run Shaw, who was chairman from 1980 to 2011, together with Sir Douglas Clague and Harold Lee Hsiao-wo of the Lee Hysan family. When TVB first began broadcasting it was commonly known and promoted as \\"Wireless Television\\" () in Chinese to distinguish it from the then cable television broadcaster, Rediffusion Television (È∫óÁöÑÂëºËÅ≤), which later became ATV. It is still usually referred to with that name, although ATV later switched to \\"wireless\\" (free-to-air) broadcasting as well (‰∫ûÊ¥≤ÈõªË¶ñ). TVB is known primarily for its dramas, and produces the Miss Hong Kong and Miss Chinese International pageants. It has historically been the most dominant broadcaster in Hong Kong. TVB, which also produces news program and operates a 24-hour news channel, received a credibility rating of 5.88 in 2016, ranking the bottom among major electronic media in Hong Kong, and a credibility rating of 4.45 in 2019, 2.25 below the average rating and remained to be seen as the least credible electronic media, according to surveys conducted by the Centre for Communication and Public Opinion Survey of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. History Temple Hill. TVB was Hong Kong's first ‚Äúwireless‚Äù, or free-to-air television station. = Origins = The government set up a working party in the early 1960s to study the idea of setting up a second television station in Hong Kong, where the only television at that time was the wired, subscription- supported Rediffusion Television. There was debate as to whether the second station should be set up as a Crown corporation, as with the BBC; a purely commercial enterprise; or a combination of the two. Another challenge lay in procuring enough content for the new station. In 1962, Director of Information Services J.L. Murray stated that while English programming could be purchased from other countries, \\"no country is producing a mass of suitable pre-recorded material in Chinese\\". Even though Hong Kong was already regarded as a centre for film production, it was considered a challenge to source enough Chinese language content for another television station, as most of it would need to be produced in Hong Kong. Regardless, there was commercial interest in the concept. A government franchise for a new wireless (free-to-air) television station was opened for tenders on 6 February 1965 and closed on 6 August 1965. On 25 January 1966 it was announced that Television Broadcasts Limited had won the franchise. = Opening = The new Television Broadcasts Limited station on Broadcast Drive in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon was officially opened by Governor David Trench on 19 November 1967. The governor spoke of the potential for television to better society, stating that the new station would play a significant role in \\"helping and enlighting our people\\", calling television \\"one of the most potent means of disseminating information there is\\". The first images shown on the station were a live transmission of the Macao Grand Prix, which began broadcasting at 9:00 am that day and was interrupted by footage of the opening of the new station. The first colour broadcast was then made, a feature called \\"London Calling Hongkong\\" which constituted greetings from former governors Alexander Grantham and Robert Black. Following this was a piano recital by Chiu Yee-ha, who had also performed at the opening of the Hong Kong City Hall. The new station broadcast both Cantonese-language and English-language channels. The Cantonese channel, called TVB Jade, began regular service on 4:30 pm that day on Channel 21, while the English service (TVB Pearl) began at 6:00 pm on Channel 25. The inaugural programming lineup included Enjoy Yourself Tonight, a Chinese language variety show, and Meet The Press, an English current affairs programme. = Infrastructure development = Hong Kong's mountainous topography posed a challenge to TVB, which was Hong Kong's first television station broadcast wirelessly, using a terrestrial television transmitter instead of a complex coaxial cable network. A network of transmitters, built atop various mountains, helped provide coverage to the territory. The main transmitter was built at Temple Hill, above Kowloon, to reach most of the main populated centre of Hong Kong as well as parts of the New Territories. Two broadcast relay stations were came into operation on 15 May 1968: one at Lamma Island expanded coverage to Pok Fu Lam, Aberdeen, Repulse Bay, and parts of Stanley, while another at Castle Peak covered Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, and Ping Shan. A third booster station, located on Cloudy Hill, was activated in June 1968 and brought TVB reception to Fanling, Taipo, and Sheung Shui.  Development  * TVB receives praise for its programming from a wide range of demographics, including the middle class, as was the case with its 2004 historical drama series War and Beauty. Its programme line-up features a steady stream of soap operas, variety shows and other populist fare. * TVB has been criticised for signing exclusive contracts with many local celebrities which restrict them from appearing on other local television stations. Hong Kong's Cable T.V. claims it is unfair competition (although Asia Television, another major television station in Hong Kong, disagrees). In fact, many artists do not have exclusive contracts with TVB and are free to show up in programmes produced by other local television stations or out- sourcing production houses. * The annual TVB Music Awards ceremony is one of the biggest for Cantopop personalities. It is widely rumoured that TVB distributes the awards to those who are obedient to the company's demands, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption has investigated the arrangement of the awards. It ruled that three TVB staff members under scrutiny were not guilty. Afterwards, TVB reformed its music programmes in a bid to reestablish their authority. * On the other hand, TVB was awarded the National Association of Broadcasters's (NAB) International Broadcasting Excellence Award in 2001. The award recognised the company's outstanding contributions to the community through a wide range of charitable programmes and activities. Hong Kong thus becomes the first city in Asia to receive this prestigious award in this area. * In 2005, TVB, in association with the Hong Kong Jockey Club, organised the biggest fund-raising campaign in the company's history in response to South- East Asia's devastating tsunami. It raised over one hundred million Hong Kong Dollars to assist those affected. * In 2000, TVB Australia was established for the Australian market with a 17 channel (14 Chinese and 3 Vietnamese Channel) satellite service. Which has over 25,000 households and over 1,500 commercial outlets with an audience of over 130,000 daily. * From 31 March 2008, TVBS- Europe launched their \\"Multi-channel\\" package in Europe. It consists of 5 different channels which include the existing TVBS-Europe Channel plus the addition of TVBN, TVB Entertainment News, TVB Classic and TVB Lifestyle.Chinese Channel Home Page  Location  TVB Clear Water Bay headquarters in 2002 TVB City in Tseung Kwan O TVB was originally located on Broadcast Drive in Kowloon Tong, and was neighbours with RTHK and ATV. By the late 1980s, the company had out-grown the facility at Broadcast Drive, and built a new studio complex, named T.V. City, at 220 Clear Water Bay Road in November 1988.[ShawMovieTown Shaw Brothers History] The first TVB City was in fact the old Shaw Movie Town complex used by Shaw Brothers since 1958. The old Broadcast Drive headquarters was later converted into apartments. The first TVB City is now used by Celestial Pictures. To cope with future development and expansion, TVB began planning in 1998 to develop a replacement facility at the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate. The new HK$2.2 billion TVB City came into full operation in October 2003. The new headquarters are built on by far the largest piece of land ever leased by the then Hong Kong Industrial Estates Corporation and the first service-providing company in the area. It has a building area of over 110,000 square metres, 30% more than that of the previous facilities at Clear Water Bay. Studio 1 in TVB City, which can seat an audience of six hundred and thirty, is the largest television production studio among commercial television stations in Asia.  News operation  TVB broadcasts several news programmes, such as News at 6:30 (Jade) and News at 7:30 (Pearl). It also operates its own news channel, TVBN.

Controversy and criticism  Since the 2009 June 4 rally, TVB news has been increasingly criticised for its pro- China bias. Netizens of HKGolden and LIHKG have called it \\"CCTVB\\", as a reference to China's state-controlled broadcaster CCTV. During the 2014 and 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, TVB's programmes, most especially its news reports were accused of providing biased coverage of the protests, with a pro-China slant. As a result of public boycotts, numerous brands officially pulled out of advertising contracts with TVB, including Pocari Sweat and Pizza Hut.  Decline  On 29 June 2018, the South China Morning Post quoted insider information that TVBI and the Broadcast Operation Department had laid off 100 people for two consecutive days. By July, a cutdown by 30 in the sports department was announced, leaving only 5 people. The long-established show \\"Sports World\\" aired its final episode on 7 July 2018. myTV SUPER sports channel will end on 15 August. By July, the \\"Hong Kong Animation Information Network\\" Facebook page stated that the dubbing group of about 70 people had been cut to 4 , and there would be large-scale layoffs. Netizens expressed anger at this. TVB's General Manager Shin Keong Cheong said he did not renew his contract and denied the layoffs. By August, in the interim results of TV broadcasting, the print version of TVB Weekly had been suspended and switched to an online version. The TVB8 and TVB Galaxy websites serving overseas ceased service in September 2018. MyTV Super's TVB Sports Channel and live news station had also stopped broadcasting with the TVB Travel Channel. It is reported that TVB will lay off 800 people. On October 5, the same year, TVB announced the reduction of about 150 employees from TVB Weekly, the Production Coordination Department, the Arts Division and non-drama productions, which took effect on the same day. The layoffs included at least one producer and two directors of \\"Pleasure & Leisure\\". In December 2019, Pro-government broadsheet Sing Tao Daily reported that TVB's current chairman, Charles Chan, is about to withdraw from his shares and intends to resign as chairman to leave TV Broadcasting Co., Ltd. On December 16, Chief Executive Mark Lee issued an internal notice stating that about 350 employees would be cut, accounting for about 10% of the company's remaining employees.

Polish PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ, a medium bomber. The Japanese Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\", a medium bomber. A medium bomber is a military bomber aircraft designed to operate with medium-sized bombloads over medium range distances; the name serves to distinguish this type from larger heavy bombers and smaller light bombers. Mediums generally carried about two tons of bombs, compared to light bombers that carried one ton, and heavies that carried four or more. The term was used prior to and during World War II, based on available parameters of engine and aeronautical technology for bomber aircraft designs at that time. After the war, medium bombers were replaced in world air forces by more advanced and capable aircraft. History In the early 1930s many air forces were looking to modernize their existing bomber aircraft fleets, which frequently consisted of older biplanes. The new designs were typically twin-engined monoplanes, often of all-metal construction, and optimized for high enough performance and speed to help evade rapidly evolving fighter aircraft designs of the time. Some of these bombers, such as the Heinkel He 111, Junkers Ju 86, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Douglas B-18, and Armstrong Whitworth Whitley were developed from or in conjunction with existing airliners or transport aircraft. The World War II- era medium bomber was generally considered to be any level bomber design that delivered about of ordnance over ranges of about . Typical heavy bombers were those with a nominal load of or more, and light bombers carried up to 2,000 lb (907 kg). These distinctions were beginning to disappear by the middle of World War II, when the average fighter aircraft could now carry a 2,000 lb (907 kg) bombload. Advances in powerplants and designs eventually allowed light bombers, tactical bombers, and later jet fighter-bombers to take over the roles performed by mediums. After the war, use of the term generally vanished; some of this was due to mass demobilization of the participant air forces' existing equipment, and the fact that several of the most-produced medium bomber types were now technologically obsolescent. Although a number of later aircraft were designed in this performance and load-carrying range, they were henceforth referred to as tactical bombers or strike aircraft instead. Examples of post-war mediums include the English Electric Canberra (along with its derived U.S. counterpart, the Martin B-57) and the Soviet Ilyushin Il-28 \\"Beagle\\". Subsequent to World War II, only the U.S. Strategic Air Command ever used the term \\"medium bomber\\" in the 1950s to distinguish its Boeing B-47 Stratojets from somewhat larger contemporary Boeing B-52 Stratofortress \\"heavy bombers\\" in bombardment wings (older B-29 and B-50 heavy bombers were also redesignated as \\"medium\\" during this period).Boeing RB-47H Stratojet ‚Äì National Museum of the United States Air ForceEighth Air Force History: U.S. Air Force Fact Sheet Strategic-Air-Command.com, 509th Composite Group, 509th Bombardment Wing This nomenclature was purely semantic and bureaucratic, however as both the B-47 and B-52 strategic bombers were much larger and had far greater performance and load-carrying ability than any of the World War II-era heavy or medium bombers. Similarly, the Royal Air Force referred at times to its V bomber force as medium bombers,The National Archives but this was in terms of range rather than load-carrying capacity. Although the term is no longer used, development of aircraft that fulfil a 'medium bomber' mission in all but name continued and these have been employed in various post-World War II conflicts; examples include dedicated tactical bombers such as the Su-24 and F-111 which have greater payload and range capability than fighter- bombers, but less than heavier strategic bombers.

Other than the Wolfsschanze (\\"Wolf's Lair\\"), his headquarters in East Prussia for the invasion of the Soviet Union, he spent more time here than anywhere else during World War II. It was also one of the most widely known of his headquarters, Chapter 11. which were located throughout Europe. The Berghof was rebuilt and renamed in 1935 and was Hitler's vacation residence for ten years. It was damaged by British bombs in late April 1945, and again in early May by retreating SS troops, and it was looted after Allied troops reached the area. The Bavarian government demolished the burned shell in 1952. History The Berghof began as a much smaller chalet called Haus Wachenfeld, a holiday home built in 1916 (or 1917) by Kommerzienrat Otto Winter, a businessman from Buxtehude. This was located near the Platterhof, the former Pension Moritz where Hitler had stayed in 1922‚Äì23. By 1926, the family running the pension had left, and Hitler did not like the new owner. He moved first to the Marineheim and then to a hotel in Berchtesgaden, the Deutsches Haus, where he dictated the second volume of Mein Kampf in the summer of 1926. Hitler met his girlfriend at that time, Maria Reiter, who worked in a shop on the ground floor of the hotel, during another visit in autumn 1926. In 1928, Winter's widow rented Haus Wachenfeld to Hitler, and his half-sister Angela came to live there as housekeeper, although she left soon after her daughter Geli's 1931 death in Hitler's Munich apartment. By 1933, Hitler had purchased Haus Wachenfeld with funds he received from the sale of his political manifesto Mein Kampf. The small chalet-style building was refurbished and much expanded by architect Alois Degano during 1935‚Äì36, when it was renamed The Berghof (English: \\"Mountain Court\\"). A large terrace was built and featured big, colourful, resort-style canvas umbrellas. The entrance hall \\"was filled with a curious display of cactus plants in majolica pots.\\" A dining room was panelled with very costly cembra pine. Hitler's large study had a telephone switchboard room. The library contained books \\"on history, painting, architecture and music.\\" A great hall was furnished with expensive Teutonic furniture, a large globe, and an expansive red marble fireplace mantel. Behind one wall was a projection booth for evening screenings of films (often, Hollywood productions, including Mickey Mouse). A sprawling picture window could be lowered into the wall to give a sweeping, open air view of the snow-capped mountains in Hitler's native Austria. The house was maintained much like a small resort hotel by several housekeepers, gardeners, cooks, and other domestic workers. \\"This place is mine,\\" Hitler was quoted as saying to a writer for Homes & Gardens magazine in 1938. \\"I built it with money that I earned.\\" The \\"Great Hall\\" Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun with their dogs at the Berghof. The British Homes & Gardens magazine described Hitler as \\"his own decorator, designer, and furnisher, as well as architect\\", and the chalet as \\"bright and airy\\" with \\"a light jade green colour scheme\\"; caged Harz Roller canaries were kept in most of the rooms, which were furnished with antiques, mostly German furniture from the 18th century. Old engravings hung in the guest bedrooms, along with some of Hitler's small watercolour sketches. His personal valet Heinz Linge stated that Hitler and his longtime companion Eva Braun had two bedrooms and two bathrooms with interconnecting doors, and Hitler would end most evenings alone with her in his study drinking tea. Though Hitler did not smoke, smoking was allowed on the terrace. His vegetarian diet was supplied by nearby kitchen gardens and, later, a greenhouse. A large complex of mountain homes for the Nazi leadership, with a landing strip and many buildings for their security and support staff, were constructed nearby. To acquire the land for these projects, many neighbours were compelled to sell their properties and leave. A Kehlsteinhaus, nicknamed Eagle's Nest by Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, a French diplomat, was built in 1937‚Äì38 on the mountaintop above the Berghof, but Hitler rarely went there. Venus and Amor by Paris Bordone, that adorned the \\"Great Hall\\", was ceded after the war to the National Museum in Warsaw. The area became a German tourist attraction during the mid-1930s. Visitors gathered at the end of the driveway or on nearby public paths in the hope of catching a glimpse of Hitler. This led to the introduction of severe restrictions on access to the area and other security measures. A large contingent of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was housed in barracks adjacent to the Berghof. Under the command of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Bernhard Frank, they patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone that encompassed the nearby homes of the other Nazi leaders. With the outbreak of war extensive anti-aircraft defences were also installed, including smoke generating machines to conceal the Berghof complex from hostile aircraft. The nearby former hotel \\"T√ºrken\\" was turned into quarters to house the Reichssicherheitsdienst (Reich Security Service; RSD) SS security men who patrolled the grounds of the Berghof. It was later occupied by the Generalmajor of the Police. (The hotel was rebuilt in 1950 and reopened as a hotel before Christmas, the Hotel zum T√ºrken. Visitors can still explore the historic underground hallways and tunnels that had been used by the Nazis.) Whenever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and F√ºhrerbegleitkommando (F√ºhrer Escort Command; FBK) were present. While the RSD men patrolled the grounds, the FBK men provided close security protection for Hitler. Several Wehrmacht mountain troop units were also housed nearby. Hence, the British never planned a direct attack on the compound. =Guests= Guests at the Berghof included political figures, monarchs, heads of state, and diplomats along with painters, singers, and musicians. The important visitors personally greeted on the steps of the Berghof by Hitler included David Lloyd George (3 March 1936), the Aga Khan (20 October 1937), Duke and Duchess of Windsor (22 October 1937), Kurt von Schuschnigg (12 February 1938), Neville Chamberlain (15 September 1938), and Benito Mussolini (19 January 1941). At the end of July 1940, Hitler summoned his military chiefs from OKW and OKH to the Berghof for the 'Berghof Conference' at which the 'Russian problem' was studied. On 11 May 1941, Karlheinz Pintsch visited the Berghof to deliver a letter from Rudolf Hess informing him of his illegal flight to Scotland. Adolf Hitler greets British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain on the steps of the Berghof Hitler's social circle at his Berghof retreat ‚Äì which his intimates referred to as \\"on the Berg\\" ‚Äì included Eva Braun and her sister Gretl, Herta Schneider and her children, Eva's friend Marion Sch√∂nmann, Heinrich Hoffmann, and the wives and children of other Nazi leaders and Hitler's staff who would all pose for an annual group photograph on the occasion of Hitler's birthday. The social scene at the Berghof ended on 14 July 1944, when Hitler left for his military headquarters in East Prussia, never to return. Silent colour films shot by Eva Braun survived the war and showed Hitler and his guests relaxing at the Berghof. Antonia Yamin interviewed the Former maid to Adolf Hitler - on her life at his private estate. In 2006, computer lip reading software identified several parts of their conversations. Among those identified in the films were Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Albert Speer, and Karl Wolff. Two guests planned to use a visit to the Berghof as an opportunity to assassinate Hitler. On 11 March 1944, Captain Eberhard von Breitenbuch arrived with a concealed pistol with the intention of shooting Hitler in the head, but guards would not allow him into the same room. On 7 June 1944, Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg planned to detonate a bomb at a meeting there, but his fellow conspirators would not give him approval to do so because Himmler and Hermann G√∂ring were not also present. =British assassination plan= The Allies rejected suggestions about derailing Hitler's train to Obersalzberg and using poison in the train's drinking water, but the British developed a plan named Operation Foxley in 1944. This called for a sniper to kill Hitler on his daily 15‚Äì20 minute walk from the Berghof residence to the Teehaus on the Mooslahnerkopf Hill, which had been revealed by a prisoner of war. The operation would be undertaken by a German-speaking Pole and a British sniper wearing German uniforms after being parachuted into Austria. They would be housed and led to the area by an anti- Nazi, identified as \\"Heidentaler\\" who lived nearby in Salzburg. The Foxley plan did not proceed, due to a dispute as to whether killing Hitler was a prudent idea and the lack of intelligence about his exact daily routine. By the time that the plan might have proceeded, Hitler had stopped visiting his mountain retreat; he never returned to the compound after 14 July 1944. Post-war ruins The remnants of the Berghof in 2009 View out of the \\"Great Window\\", 2018 Remains of the left wall of the driveway to the main entrance The Obersalzberg was bombed by hundreds of British RAF Lancaster heavy bombers, including aircraft from No. 617 Squadron RAF (the \\"Dambusters\\"), which attacked Obersalzberg on 25 April 1945. At least two bombs struck the Berghof and did considerable damage to the building. Retreating SS troops set fire to the villa on 4 May, four days after Hitler's suicide in Berlin. Only hours later, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division arrived at Berchtesgaden along with the French 2nd Armored Division. Herman Louis Finnell of the 3rd Division stated that he and Private Fungerburg were the first to enter Berghof and the secret passages below the structure. Finnell stated that the hallway below the structure had rooms on either side filled with destroyed paintings and evening gowns, as well as destroyed medical equipment and a wine cellar. The American troops reportedly confused Berchtesgaden with the Berghof, and a French Army captain and his driver were the first Allied military personnel to reach the still-smoldering chalet. A French tank crew soon joined them, and Allied soldiers thoroughly looted and stripped the house over the next few days. The American 1st Battalion of the 506th Infantry Regiment arrived on 8 May. The 3rd Battalion of the 506th came into Berchtesgaden by a different route and sustained casualties in a skirmish with the crews of two German 88mm anti- aircraft/anti-tank guns. One of the most notable artifacts taken by American soldiers was the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders, known more commonly as \\"Hitler's Globe\\". The teahouse on Mooslahnerkopf hill was unscathed in the April 1945 bombing raid, but the Bavarian government knocked it down by 1951 because of its link with Hitler. For 55 years, the ruins lay in the woods by the 13th hole of the Gutshof golf course, but these were taken away altogether during the summer of 2006. The Berghof's shell survived until 1952, when the Bavarian government demolished it with explosives on 30 April. The Berghof, the houses of G√∂ring and Bormann, the SS barracks, the Kampfh√§usl, and the teahouse were all destroyed. This had been part of an agreement under which the Americans handed the area back to the Bavarian authorities. There was fear that the ruins would become a neo-Nazi shrine and tourist attraction. More than 50 Obersalzberg Nazi buildings were destroyed. The Platterhof had been a nearby hostel for visitors to the area, and it was turned into the General Walker Hotel for American troops after the war. It was demolished in 2001. Location of the Berghof and Hitler's other headquarters The Berghof was one of the headquarters used by Hitler during the war. There were about 14 known completed F√ºhrer Headquarters.Raiber, Richard, \\"Guide to Hitler's Headquarters\\", After the Battle, No. 19, Special Edition, Battle of Britain International Ltd, 1977, London, p. 2.

It was used exclusively by members of the Nazi Party for government and social meetings. It was visited on 14 documented instances by Adolf Hitler, who disliked the location due to his fear of heights, the risk of bad weather, and the thin mountain air. Today it is open seasonally as a restaurant, beer garden, and tourist site.  Construction  Map showing the location of the Kehlsteinhaus (labelled \\"Eagle's Nest\\") and F√ºhrer Headquarters throughout occupied Europe The Kehlsteinhaus sits on a ridge atop the Kehlstein, a subpeak of the Hoher G√∂ll that rises above the town of Berchtesgaden. It was commissioned by Martin Bormann in the summer of 1937. Paid for by the Nazi Party, it was completed in 13 months. Twelve workers died during its construction.\\"Adolf Hitler\\", Current Biography 1941, p384 A wide approach road climbs over ; it includes five tunnels and one hairpin turn, and cost RM 30 million to build (about ‚Ç¨150 million inflation-adjusted for 2007). Hitler's birthday in April 1939 was considered a deadline for the project's completion, so work continued throughout the winter of 1938, even at night with the worksite lit by searchlights. From a large car park, a entry tunnel leads to an ornate elevator that ascends the final to the building. The tunnel is lined with marble and was originally heated, with warm air from an adjoining service tunnel. However it was normal for visiting high-officials to be driven through the tunnel to the elevator. Their driver would then have to reverse the car for the entire length of the tunnel as there was no space to turn. The inside of the large elevator is surfaced with polished brass, Venetian mirrors, and green leather. The building's main reception room is dominated by a fireplace of red Italian marble presented by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, which was damaged by Allied soldiers chipping off pieces to take home as souvenirs. The building had a completely electric appliance kitchen, which was unusual in 1937, but was never used to cook meals; instead meals were prepared in town and taken to the kitchen on the mountain top to be reheated. The building also has heated floors, with heating required for at least two days before visitors arrived. A MAN submarine diesel engine and an electrical generator were installed in an underground chamber close to the main entrance, to provide back-up power. Much of the furniture was designed by Paul L√°szl√≥. Use Hitler first visited on September 16, 1938, and returned to inaugurate it on April 20, 1939, his 50th birthday‚Äîthough it was not intended as a birthday gift. There are two ways to approach and enter the building: the road and the Kehlsteinhaus elevator. Hitler did not trust the elevator, continually expressed his reservations of its safety, and disliked using it; his biggest fear was that the elevator's winch mechanism on the roof would attract a lightning strike. Bormann took great pains to never mention the two serious lightning strikes that occurred during construction. The Kehlsteinhaus lies several miles directly above the Berghof, Hitler's summer home. In a rare diplomatic engagement, Hitler received departing French ambassador Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet on October 18, 1938, here. It was he who coined the name \\"Eagle's Nest\\" for the building while later describing the experience; this has since become a commonly used name for the Kehlsteinhaus. A wedding reception for Eva Braun's sister Gretl was held there following her marriage to Hermann Fegelein on June 3, 1944. While Hitler more often than not left the entertaining duties to others, he believed the house presented an excellent opportunity to entertain important and impressionable guests. Referred to as the \\"D-Haus\\", short for \\"Diplomatic Reception Haus\\", the Kehlsteinhaus is often conflated with the tea house on Mooslahnerkopf hill near the Berghof, which Hitler walked to daily after lunch. The teahouse was demolished by the Bavarian government after the war, due to its connection to Hitler. 1945 photo of the entrance tunnel leading to the elevator going up to the Kehlsteinhaus, visible at top  Allied capture  The Kehlsteinhaus was an aiming point for the April, 25 1945 Bombing of Obersalzberg. This was a Royal Air Force bombing raid conducted by No. 1, No. 5, and No. 8 Group and No. 617 Squadron. The small house proved an elusive target for the force of 359 Avro Lancasters and 16 de Havilland Mosquitoes, which bombed and severely damaged the Berghof area instead. It is uncertain which Allied military unit was the first to reach the Kehlsteinhaus. The matter is compounded by popular confusion of it and the town of Berchtesgaden taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division of XV Corps of the U.S. Seventh Army of the Sixth Army Group.World War II: Race to Seize Berchtesgaden HistoryNet 12 June 2006United States Army in World War II, Special Studies, Chronology 1941-1945 \\"In U.S. Seventh Army's XV Corps area, 7th Inf of 3d Div, crossing into Austria, advances through Salzburg to Berchtesgaden without opposition\\". Reputedly, members of the 7th went as far as the elevator to the Kehlsteinhaus, with at least one person claiming that he and a partner continued on to the top.Library of Congress: Veterans History Project: Interview with Herman Finnell: Herman Louis Finnell of the 3rd Division, 7th Regiment, Company I, stated that he and his ammo carrier, Pfc. Fungerburg, were the first to enter the Eagle's Nest, as well as the secret passages below the structure. Finnell stated that the hallway below the structure had rooms on either side filled with destroyed paintings, evening gowns, as well as destroyed medical equipment and a wine cellar. In a Library of Congress interview and more recent interviews, Herman Louis Finnell of the 3rd Infantry Division said that his regiment entered the Berghof, not the Kehlsteinhaus. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Also, elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis, and Paul R√©piton-Pr√©neuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of U.S. command.Georges Buis and Jean Lacouture, Les Fanfares perdues: Entretiens avec Jean Lacouture, √âditions du Seuil, 1975. and so say the numerous testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them. Undamaged in the April 25 bombing raid, the Kehlsteinhaus was subsequently used by the Allies as a military command post until 1960, when it was handed back to the State of Bavaria.  Today  Today the building is owned by a charitable trust, and serves as a restaurant offering indoor dining and an outdoor beer garden. It is a popular tourist attraction to those who are attracted by the historical significance of the \\"Eagle's Nest\\". The road has been closed to private vehicles since 1952 because it is too dangerous, but the house can be reached on foot (in two hours) from Obersalzberg, or by bus from the Documentation Center there. The Documentation Centre currently directs visitors to the coach station where tickets are purchased. The bus ticket is ostensibly an entry ticket as it permits the holder entry to the building's elevator. The buses have special modifications to take on a slight angle, as the steep road leading to the peak is too steep for regular vehicles. The Kehlsteinhaus itself does not mention much about its past, except in the photos displayed and described along the wall of the sun terrace that documents its pre-construction condition until now. Informal tours of the Kehlsteinhaus are available to be booked through the official website. Due to concern about neo-Nazis and post-war Nazi sympathizers, no external guides are permitted to conduct tours. The lower rooms are not part of the restaurant but can be visited with a guide. They offer views of the building's past through plate-glass windows. Graffiti left by Allied troops is still clearly visible in the surrounding woodwork. The red Italian marble fireplace remains damaged by Allied souvenir hunters, though this was later halted by signage posted that the building was U.S. government property, and damage to it was cause for disciplinary action. Hitler's small study is now a storeroom for the cafeteria. A trail leads above the Kehlsteinhaus towards the Mannlgrat ridge reaching from the Kehlstein to the summit of the Hoher G√∂ll. The route, which is served by a Klettersteig, is regarded as the easiest to the top. Gallery File:Kehlsteinhaus1.JPGFireplace in the Kehlsteinhaus, a present from Mussolini.

Recent Award winners include Rabbis Arik Ascherman and Ehud Bandel of Rabbis for Human Rights (2011), Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! (2012), Bill McKibben of 350.org (2013), Medea Benjamin of Code Pink (2014), Tom B.K. Goldtooth (2015), Kathy Kelly of Voices for Creative Nonviolence (2015), Omar Barghouti (2017), Ralph Nader (2017), and Jackson Browne.(2018) Since 1960, when the first Award was accepted by Eleanor Roosevelt, the Award has been presented in person to \\"peace heroes\\" who have exemplified to the members of Promoting Enduring Peace the courage of nonviolent resistance to abusive power, to armed conflict, to violent oppression, and to environmental negligence. The Award is also intended to recognize individuals for having made significant contributions, through cooperative and non-violent means in the spirit of Gandhi, to the struggle to achieve a sustainable world civilization founded on enduring international peace. In the 21st Century the Award is especially intended by its presenters to honor those whose lives and works exemplify the principle that international peace, universal socioeconomic justice, and planetary environmental harmony are interdependent and inseparable, and all three are essential to the survival of civilization. The Award itself is symbolized by a heavy medallion and a certificate with an inscription summing up the recipient's work. The medallion, forged from Peace Bronze (a metal rendered from decommissioned nuclear missile command systems, evoking \\"swords into plowshares\\"), features Gandhi's profile and his words \\"Love Ever Suffers/Never Revenges Itself\\" cast in bronze. The Award has been presented at a ceremony held typically once a year in New York or New Haven at which the recipient is invited to present a message of challenge and hope.  History  The Gandhi Peace Award was conceived by the founder of Promoting Enduring Peace, Yale Professor Jerome Davis. Davis first proposed the award to the board of Promoting Enduring Peace on 13 March 1959, with the name intended to pay tribute to the modern era's foremost advocate of nonviolent resistance, and partly to help rectify the failure of the Nobel Committee to award its Peace Prize to Gandhi before his death in 1948. The Award has been issued since 1960, when it was first presented to Eleanor Roosevelt, and consists of a certificate, a ceremony, and the presentation of a bronze medallion inscribed with a quotation by Gandhi: \\"Love Ever Suffers / Never Revenges Itself.\\" A prominent New York sculptor, Don Benaron/Katz, was commissioned to create a work of art to serve as the symbol of the Award. He researched Gandhi at the library of the India House in New York City and by 1960 had carved a striking bas-relief portrait in wood of the founder of the century‚Äôs international movement for nonviolent change. He wrote of the medallion he also created, ‚ÄúI carved the Gujarati word for peace on one side, and on the other a symbolic plowshare and pruning hook inspired by Isaiah 2:4...‚Ä≥ ::They shall beat their swords into plowshares ::and their spears into pruning hooks; ::nation shall not lift up sword against nation, ::neither shall they learn war any more. Since 2011 the Award has included a cash prize. The presentation ceremony is held in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. At present the laureates are and have been North Americans and British subjects. A book about the Award from its inception through 1997, In Gandhi's Footsteps: The First Half Century of Promoting Enduring Peace, was written and published by James Clement van Pelt.

It is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, as a border town, it is almost equidistant from Sheffield to Rotherham, and about from Worksop. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Dinnington is the principal settlement in the civil parish of Dinnington St John's, which also includes the small satellite hamlets of Throapham and St John's. The Dinnington St John's parish is the most populous constituent of the St John's ward, which also includes the parishes of Laughton-en-le-Morthen, Firbeck, Letwell and Gildingwells. In 2001 this ward had a population of 11,476, with Dinnington St John's itself making up 9,161 of that figure.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rotherham Retrieved 28 August 2009 The population of the ward at the 2011 Census had increased to 12,517. Dinnington is about above sea level. History Excavations show Dinnington to have been inhabited since at least Neolithic times, and it has been suggested that the settlement takes its name from a local barrow, though a more traditional interpretation of \\"Dinnington\\" would be \\"Dunn's Farmstead\\", or \\"Town of Dunn's People\\". Dinnington was originally a small, isolated farming community, based around the New Road area of the town. Quarrying in the area helped expand the population, but it was the sinking of the Dinnington Main Colliery in 1905 that led to the real growth of the settlement. The census of 1911 shows a twenty-fold increase in population since 1901, from 250 to 5,000. The coal miners initially lived in a prefabricated shanty town in Laughton Common, colloquially known as \\"Tin Town\\" or \\"White City\\" but later moved into colliery-built terrace houses around the central shopping area of Laughton Road. Dinnington was an ancient parish which became a civil parish in 1866. In 1954 the civil parish was abolished and merged with the civil parish of St Johns with Throapham, to form the civil parish of Dinnington St John's. Dinnington continued to expand throughout the 20th century, largely through the growth of commuter living that followed the Second World War. As the housing estates spread, Dinnington began to merge seamlessly into the neighbouring settlements of Throapham and North Anston. The result is a strip of urban development that mainly acts as a commuter base for Sheffield, Rotherham and Worksop, although with the closure of coal mines and steel mills, the area has seen a rapid decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s and despite steady growth, still boasted the highest level of unemployment in the UK in 2001. Dinnington Colliery was closed in 1992. This damaged the local community, and had a large negative impact on the local economy with initial job losses and knock-on effect closures to local business. In 1995, Dinnington was featured in an episode of the BBC1 TV documentary series Everyman, entitled Simon's Cross. The programme described the life of Dinnington parish priest, the Rev Simon Bailey, detailing his life, work and reflections while living with AIDS, and the way members of the parish of Dinnington came to terms with it and supported him. Scarlet Ribbons: A Priest with AIDS, an account of his story, was written by Simon Bailey's sister, Rosemary Bailey and published by Serpent's Tail in 1997. In 2003 Dinnington was declared a town as part of an attempt to attract more investment and improve the local economy. Dinnington, in the fog. Controversy arose in the village over plans to redevelop the Miners' Welfare. The Welfare buildings and sports fields were provided originally for the miners at the local colliery by CISWO in 1926. The property had been leased to Rotherham Borough Council and was used for Safe@Start programmes up until 2007. It has remained empty since that date and has been subject to vandalism and lack of repairs. Controversy over development resulted in the formation of a local residents' group opposing the development plans and asking for the regeneration of the site as an amenity for local people. Dinnington had a population of 9,077 in the 2011 census, which makes it slightly larger than Wath-upon-Dearne. Here are the three areas known as Dinnington: * Dinnington Civil Parish (town proper) population 9,077 * Dinnington Ward population 12,517 * Built up area (contains Dinnington, Anston and Throapham) population 20,152 Community Dinnington's two further education establishments are Rotherham College of Arts and Technology and the sixth form at Dinnington High School. Dinnington's high street and main shopping areas include Tesco, Savers, Fulton's Foods, Dominos pizza and Aldi stores, as well as small traders, including several take-aways, a haberdashery and an indoor market. Manor Motorsport, known in Formula One as Virgin Racing from 2010 to 2011, Marussia F1 from 2012 to 2014 and currently known as Manor Marussia F1 were once based in the town. The town's only football club Dinnington Town F.C. play at Phoenix Park, situated at the Dinnington Resource Centre.

He belonged to a generation of composers, including Johann Adolph Hasse, Giovanni Battista Sammartini, and C. P. E. Bach, whose works are emblematic of the prevailing galant music that developed in Europe throughout the 18th century. He achieved international success, spending periods of his career in Vienna, London and Saint Petersburg, but his main base remained Venice, where he held a succession of leading appointments. In his early career Galuppi made a modest success in opera seria, but from the 1740s, together with the playwright and librettist Carlo Goldoni, he became famous throughout Europe for his comic operas in the new dramma giocoso style. To the succeeding generation of composers, he was known as \\"the father of comic opera\\". Some of his mature opere serie, for which his librettists included the poet and dramatist Metastasio, were also widely popular. Throughout his career Galuppi held official positions with charitable and religious institutions in Venice, the most prestigious of which was maestro di cappella at the Doge's chapel, St Mark's Basilica. In these various capacities he composed a large amount of sacred music. He was also highly regarded as a virtuoso performer on and composer for keyboard instruments. In the latter half of the 19th century, Galuppi's music was largely forgotten outside of Italy, and Napoleon's invasion of Venice in 1797 resulted in Galuppi's manuscripts being scattered around Western Europe, and in many cases, destroyed or lost.Burde, Ines (2008). Die venezianische Kirchenmusik von Baldassare Galuppi. Frankfurt am Main: Lang. Galuppi's name persists in the English poet Robert Browning's 1855 poem \\"A Toccata of Galuppi's\\", but this has not helped maintain the composer's work in the general repertoire. Some of Galuppi's works were occasionally performed in the 200 years after his death, but it was not until the last years of the 20th century that his compositions were extensively revived in live performance and on recordings.  Biography  =Early years= Statue of Galuppi in the main square of Burano, the Piazza Galuppi Galuppi was born on the island of Burano in the Venetian Lagoon, and from as early as age 22 was known as \\"Il Buranello\\", a nickname which even appears in the signature on his music manuscripts, \\"Baldassare Galuppi, called 'Buranello'.\\"Monson, Dale E. \\"Galuppi, Baldassare\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 September 2011 His father was a barber, who also played the violin in theatre orchestras, and is believed to have been his son's first music teacher. Although there is no documentation, oral tradition as related to Francesco Caffi in the nineteenth century says that the young Galuppi was trained in composition and harpsichord by Antonio Lotti, the chief organist at St Mark's Basilica.Caffi, Francesco, Storia della musica sacra nella gi√† Cappella Ducale di S. Marco in Venezia (1854). At the age of 15 Galuppi composed his first opera, Gli amici rivali, which, according to Caffi, was performed unsuccessfully at Chioggia and equally unsuccessfully in Vicenza under the title La fede nell'incostanza. From 1726 to 1728, Galuppi was harpsichordist at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence. On his return to Venice in 1728, he produced a second opera, Gl'odi delusi dal sangue, written in collaboration with another Lotti pupil, Giovanni Battista Pescetti; it was well received when it was presented at the Teatro San Angelo.Anderson, Keith (2011). \\"Baldassare Galuppi (1706‚Äì1785)\\", Notes to Naxos CD 8.572490 The collaborators followed it with an opera seria, Dorinda, the next year. This, too, was modestly successful, and Galuppi began to receive commissions for operas and oratorios. In 1740, Galuppi was appointed director of music at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti in Venice, where his duties ranged from teaching and conducting to composing liturgical music and oratorios. In his first year of service at the Mendicanti, he composed 31 works: 16 motets, 13 settings of the Salve Regina, and two psalm settings.Arnold, Denis. \\"Galuppi's Religious Music\\", The Musical Times, 1 January 1985, pp. 45‚Äì47 and 49‚Äì50 Although he became internationally known as an operatic composer, he maintained a steady output of sacred music throughout his career. =London and return to Venice= The King's Theatre, Haymarket, London In 1741 Galuppi was invited to work in London. He petitioned the Mendicanti authorities for leave of absence, to which they agreed. He was in England for 18 months, supervising productions for the Italian opera company at the King's Theatre. Of the 11 operas under his direction, at least three are known to have been his own compositions, Penelope, Scipione in Cartagine and Sirbace; a fourth was presented shortly after he left London to return to Venice. Rival composer Handel attended one of these productions. Galuppi also attracted attention as a keyboard virtuoso and composer. His contemporary, the English musicologist Charles Burney, wrote that \\"Galuppi had had more influence on English music than any other Italian composer\\".Salter, Lionel. \\"Galuppi (rev. Gallico), L'Arcadia in Brenta, Gramophone, October 1982, p. 80 However, in Burney's view Galuppi's skills were still immature during his spell in London. Burney wrote, \\"He now copied the hasty, light and flimsy style which reigned in Italy at this time, and which Handel's solidity and science had taught the English to despise.\\"Burney (1789), p. 448 On his return to Venice in May 1743, Galuppi returned to his employment with the Mendicanti, and to composing for the opera houses. The operatic fashion in Venice was on the point of changing from opera seria to a new style of comic opera, dramma giocoso. Full-length comic operas from Naples and Rome were becoming fashionable; Galuppi adapted three of them for Venetian audiences in 1744, and the following year composed one of his own, La forza d'amore, which was only a mild success. He continued to compose serious operas, sometimes in partnership with the librettist Metastasio. Most biographers have overlooked the journey that Galuppi made to Vienna in 1748/49, where he was called to the court of Maria Theresa in order to celebrate the birthday of the empress at the Burgtheater on 14 May 1748.Piovano, Francesco. 1908. Baldassare Galuppi. Note bio-bibliografiche. Torino: Fratelli Bocca. The libretto Artaserse, by the imperial poet Metastasio was chosen for Galuppi to set to music. Metastasio's text was known verbatim by Viennese opera lovers from its previous settings by Vinci, Hasse, Graun, and Gluck, among others, and the audience was surprised to find the four arias that end the first act compressed into one a single dramatic ensemble piece, in which the protagonist Arbace is confronted and disowned first by his father, then his ruler, then his lover. This unprecedented choice by Galuppi was a breakthrough that strengthened the relationship of the music to the drama, heightened the intensity of the finale, and gave the work an unprecedented degree of compositional unity. Daniel Heartz observes that, while ensembles in opera were not unusual, \\"pieces in which the stage action is written into the music, in which the music becomes the action, are exceedingly rare.\\"Heartz, Daniel, and John A. Rice. 2004. From Garrick to Gluck: essays on opera in the age of Enlightenment. Hillsdale, N.Y.: Pendragon Press. Metastasio, who expected the music to remain subservient to his words, was scandalized. He later wrote to Farinelli, \\"When [Galuppi] writes he thinks as much about the words as you think of becoming pope; and if he did think about them more, I doubt he would do better.\\"Heartz, Daniel, \\"Hasse, Galuppi, and Metastasio\\" in Venezia e il melodramma del Settecento, ed. by M. T. Muraru (Florence, 1978) However, others strongly disagreed with Metastasio. German composer, pedagogue and theorist Abb√© Georg Joseph Vogler, in his Betrachtungen der Mannheimer Tonschule marveled at the new heights to which Galuppi had elevated the marriage between text, music and dramatic intent. He devoted an entire section to examining Galuppi's style and innovation, complete with an analysis of Galuppi's aria, \\"Se cerca, se dice\\" from Metastasio's L'Olimpiade. Vogler writes, \\"The incisiveness in the characters, that which is farcical in its personages, the volatile contrasts, the diversity in the multi-voiced finales, with which the first section or act ends, to put it succinctly, everything that we labelled operetta or intermezzo must regard the great Galuppi as its musical father.\\"Georg Joseph Vogler, Betrachtungen der Mannheimer Tonschule, (Mannheim, 1778‚Äì1781). I, 5te und 6te Lieferungen, 129. The librettist Carlo Goldoni offered this assessment of Galuppi's ensemble finales: \\"In fact when Buranello writes one can only bow and take off his hat. Never in my life have I enjoyed music so full of grace and spirit. Open mouthed until the end, I remained delighted and excited‚Ä¶ Listen to the trio. Oh, what a trio! It is a sublime piece and reason enough by itself, I promise, for attending the opera‚Ä¶ When the opera was over, what a racket, what applause burst out for Buranello!\\"Goldoni, Carlo, Tutte le opere, ed. Giuseppe Ortolani, (Milan 1935‚Äì56) Nevertheless, the joint work of Galuppi and Metastasio prospered, and was staged in other countries. In Vienna, their Demetrio and Artaserse were great successes, and \\"Artaserse\\" in particular generated a great deal of profit for its investors. Galuppi's best-known librettists, Metastasio, top, and Carlo Goldoni In May 1748 Galuppi was appointed vice-maestro of the Doge's chapel, St Mark's. In time this would lead to a large body of religious compositions, but for the present Galuppi was chiefly engaged in operatic work. It is not clear to Denis Arnold why he accepted the post at St Mark's. The musicologist writes, \\"He was already a very successful opera composer and with his duties at the Mendicanti he must have had enough to do. The salary at St Mark's was only 120 ducats. ... At this time it was not a very distinguished cappella. The choir probably numbered about 30; but since their posts continued up to death, a fair proportion of the singers were old.\\" However, Daniel Heartz points out that Galuppi's salary eventually increased to 400 ducats per annum, and then to 600 ducats. In addition to the prestige of the position, Galuppi was given a house near the basilica in which he and his family lived rent-free, and as he had very few firm obligations as vice-maestro, the position left him with the flexibility to compose for other venues, including opera houses in Venice, Vienna, London, and Berlin. By the time of his death, Galuppi and Gluck were two of the highest paid composers of the 18th century. (See Heartz, 2003)Heartz, Daniel. 2003. Music in European Capitals: the Galant Style, 1720‚Äì1780. New York: W.W. Norton. Galuppi was fortunate that when he turned once more to comic opera in 1749 he collaborated with Carlo Goldoni. Although an established and eminent playwright by the time he worked with Galuppi, Goldoni was happy for his libretti to be subservient to the music.Luisi, Francesco (2001). \\"Galuppi: Il mondo alla roversa\\", Notes to Chandos CD CHAN 0676 He was as warm in his regard for Galuppi as Metastasio was cold. Their first collaboration was Arcadia in Brenta followed by four more joint works within a year. They were enormously popular at home and abroad, and to meet the demand for new drammi giocosi and opere serie Galuppi had to resign his post at the Mendicanti in 1751. By the middle of the 1750s he was, in the words of musicologist Dale Monson, \\"the most popular opera composer anywhere\\". For the next ten years, Galuppi remained in Venice, with occasional sorties elsewhere for commissions and premieres, producing a series of secular and religious works. His operas, serious or comic, were in demand across Europe. Of the British premiere of Il filosofo di campagna in 1761 Burney wrote, \\"This burletta surpassed in musical merit all the comic operas that were performed in England, till the Buona Figliuola.\\"Burney (1789), p. 474 In April 1762 Galuppi was appointed to the leading musical post in Venice, maestro di capella of St Mark's, and in July of the same year he was also appointed maestro di coro (choir master) at the Ospedale degli Incurabili. At St Mark's, he set about reforming the choir. He persuaded the Basilica authorities, the Procurators, to be more flexible in payments to singers, allowing him to attract performers with first-rate voices such as Gaetano Guadagni and Gasparo Pacchiarotti. =Saint Petersburg= Catherine the Great Early in 1764 Catherine the Great of Russia made it known through diplomatic channels that she wished Galuppi to come to Saint Petersburg as her court composer and conductor. There were prolonged negotiations between Russia and the Venetian authorities before the Senate of Venice agreed to release Galuppi for a three- year engagement at the Russian court. The contract required him to \\"compose and produce operas, ballets and cantatas for ceremonial banquets\\", at a salary of 4,000 rubles and the provision of accommodation and a carriage.Ritzarev, p. 81 Galuppi was reluctant, but Venetian officials assured him that his post and salary as maestro di cappella at St. Mark's were secure until 1768 as long as he supplied a Gloria and a Credo for the Basilica's Christmas mass each year.Rossi, Franco (2003). \\"Galuppi: Mass for St Mark's, 1766\\", Notes to Chandos CD CHAN 0702 In June 1764 the senate granted Galuppi formal leave to go. He resigned his post at the Incurabili, made provision for his wife and daughters (who were to remain in Venice, while his son travelled with him), and set off for Russia. He made detours on his journey, visiting C.P.E. Bach in Berlin and encountering Giacomo Casanova by happenstance outside of Riga, before arriving in Saint Petersburg on 22 September 1765. For the empress's court, Galuppi composed new works, both operatic and liturgical, and revived and revised many others. He wrote one opera there, Ifigenia in Tauride (1768), and two cantatas, La virt√π liberata (1765) and La pace tra la virt√π e la bellezza (1766), the latter to words by Metastasio. In addition to the work for which he had been contracted, Galuppi gave weekly recitals at the harpsichord, and sometimes conducted orchestral concerts. To improve standards he was a hard taskmaster to the court orchestra, but was from the outset enormously impressed by the court choir. He is reported to have exclaimed, \\"I'd never heard such a magnificent choir in Italy\\".Ritzarev, p. 88 Galuppi took pride in his prestigious appointments; the title page of his 1766 Christmas mass for St Mark's describes him as: \\"First Master and Director of all the Music for Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of all the Russias, etc. etc. and First Master of the Ducal Chapel of St. Mark's in Venice.\\" In 1768, as had been agreed, he returned to Venice, detouring again on his journey, this time to visit Johann Adolph Hasse in Vienna. =Later years= Ospedale degli Incurabili, Venice, where Galuppi was in charge of music 1762‚Äì1765 and 1768‚Äì1776 On his return to Venice, Galuppi resumed his duties at St Mark's and successfully applied for reappointment at the Incurabili, holding the post until 1776, when financial constraints obliged all the ospedali to cut back their musical activities. In his later years he wrote more sacred than secular music. His output continued to be considerable in both quantity and quality. Burney, who visited him in Venice, wrote in 1771: Galuppi told Burney his definition of good music: vaghezza, chiarezza, e buona modulazione (beauty, clearness, and good modulation)\\".Burney (1771), p. 185 Burney commented on Galuppi's prodigious workload that in addition to his duties at St Mark's and the Incurabili, \\"he has a hundred sequins a year as domestic organist to the family of Gritti, and is organist of another church, of which I have forgotten the name\\".Burney (1771), pp. 186‚Äì187 The last opera by Galuppi was La serva per amore, premiered in October 1773. In May 1782 he conducted concerts to mark a papal visit to Venice by Pope Pius VI. Thereafter he continued to compose, despite declining health. His last known completed work is the 1784 Christmas mass for St Mark's. After a two-month illness, Galuppi died on 3 January 1785. He was buried in the church of San Vitale, and, much mourned, was commemorated by a requiem mass \\"solemnized in the church of Santo Stefano, paid for by professional musicians, at which the actors of the Teatro S Benedetto sang\\".Letter of Luigi Ballarini to Daniele Dolfin, Venetian Ambassador in Paris, 12 February 1785, quoted in Arnold (1985) Music =Operas= Arias from Galuppi's 1743 opera, Enrico, to a libretto by Francesco Vanneschi According to The Musical Times Galuppi, with 109 operas, was the sixth most prolific opera composer. His output was exceeded by his contemporaries Draghi, Piccinni, Paisiello, Guglielmi, and the most prolific of all, with 166 operas, Wenzel M√ºller; the only composer of later generations who approached his output was Offenbach 100 years later.Towers, John. \\"Who composed the greatest number of operas?\\" The Musical Times, 1 August 1911, p. 527 Like most of his contemporaries, Galuppi did not hesitate to re-use his own music, sometimes simply transplanting it and at other times reworking it substantially.Talbot, Michael. \\"Studien zur Opera seria von Baldassare Galuppi\\", Music & Letters, Vol. 67, No. 2 (April 1986), pp. 202‚Äì203 Wiesend, Reinhard. 1984. Studien zur opera seria von Baldassare Galuppi: Werksituation und √úberlieferung, Form und Satztechnik, Inhaltsdarstellung : mit einer Biographie und einem Quellenverzeichnis der Opern. He was called \\"the father of comic opera\\" by musicians of the generation that followed him. The 21st- century editor and musicologist Francesco Luisi writes that although this description is not strictly accurate, the Galuppi‚ÄìGoldoni operas were \\"a genuinely new beginning for musical theatre\\". In Luisi's view these works fundamentally changed the nature of opera by making the music part of the drama and not merely a decoration. Galuppi's contemporary Esteban de Arteaga wrote approvingly that the composer was able to \\"illumine the personalities of the characters and the situations in which they find themselves by selecting the most appropriate type of voice and style of singing\\". As well as his general contribution to the essentials of comic opera, establishing the music as at least as important as the words, Galuppi's (and Goldoni's) more specific legacy to comic opera was the large-scale buffo finale to end the acts. Hitherto acts had ended in short choruses or ensembles, but the elaborate and substantial finales introduced by Galuppi and his librettist set the pattern for Haydn and Mozart. Galuppi's music for his comic operas is described by Luisi as \\"largely syllabic ‚Ä¶ designed to enhance the intelligibility of the text ‚Ä¶ without impairing the fluidity of the melodic lines.\\" In his opere serie he observed the convention of the da capo aria, but used it sparingly in his comic works. In performances of his serious operas, leading soloists would as a matter of course interpolate arias written by other composers: the \\"opus integer\\" ‚Äì a complete work not to be tampered with ‚Äì was not the rule in 18th- century opera seria.Hunter, Mary. \\"Galuppiana 1985: studi e ricerche: atti del convegno internazionale\\", Music & Letters, Vol. 69, No. 2 (April 1988), pp. 257‚Äì258 Musicians' gallery in St Mark's, by Canaletto Vocal melismata for solo soprano in Galuppi's 1771 In convertendo Dominum for SATB choir and soloists =Sacred music= Among the corpus of Galuppi's authenticated sacred works are at least 284 works: 52 masses and movements pertaining to the mass, 73 settings of psalms and music for the offices, 8 motets, and 26 uncategorized works, including hymns, versetti, a setting of St. John's Passion for women's voices, and a Baccanale for the church of San Rocco.Burde, ines, Werkverzeichnis zu die venezianische Kirchenmusik von Baldassare Galuppi, Frankfurt am Main [u.a.], Lang, 2008 The largest repository of manuscripts outside of Italy is the S√§chsische Landesbibliothek ‚Äì Staats- und Universit√§tsbibliothek in Dresden, but manuscripts are also found in collections in Munich, Paris, Prague, Vienna, and New York, among others.Passadore, Francesco, and Franco Rossi. 1994.

In recent years Ines Burde, Franco Passadore, and Franco Rossi have all made progress toward a comprehensive catalogue of Galuppi's sacred music, but a complete inventory is still out of reach due to the large number of lost or missing manuscripts, spurious attributions, and forgeries.Muraro, Maria Teresa, and Franco Rossi. 1986.

It was then the custom to incorporate into new church music the stile antico with smooth vocal lines in the tradition of Palestrina and a good deal of counterpoint. However, Galuppi applied the stile antico sparingly, and when he felt constrained to write contrapuntal music for the choir he would balance it with a bright modern style for the orchestral accompaniment. His masses and psalm settings for St Mark's exploit all the resources available to a modern composer in the mid-18th century, with choir supported by an orchestra of strings and some or all of flutes, oboes, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and organ. In his tutti choral writing, Galuppi generally leaned toward syllabic settings, reserving the technically demanding melismatic passages for soloists. Monson notes that the church music composed by Galuppi in Saint Petersburg had a lasting influence on Russian church music: \\"His 15 a cappella works on Russian texts for the Orthodox liturgy proved to be a watershed. Their Italian, light contrapuntal style joined with native melodic idioms was continued by Traetta and Sarti and maintained by, among others, D.S. Bortnyans'ky, his pupil.\\" Marina Ritzarev comments that the Italian Vincenzo Manfredini was Galuppi's predecessor as Russian court composer, and may have paved the way for his successor's innovations.Ritzarev, p. 83 Several works long attributed to Galuppi by publishers were shown to be the work of Vivaldi. In 2003, a Nisi Dominus previously thought to be by Galuppi was reattributed to Vivaldi. The music of the latter, a generation earlier than Galuppi, had gone out of fashion after his death, and unscrupulous copyists and editors found that Galuppi's name on the title page increased a work's appeal.Talbot, Michael (2004). Notes to Hyperion CD 66849Wigmore, Richard. \\"Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus RV 807\\", The Daily Telegraph, 3 June 2006 Three other works in the Saxon State Collection have also been reattributed from Galuppi to Vivaldi: a Beatus Vir, a Dixit Dominus\\"For the Record\\", Gramophone, Awards Issue 2005, p. 10 and a Laetatus sum.\\"Another Vivaldi Work Falsely Attributed to Galuppi by Iseppo Baldan: A New \\"Laetatus sum\\" for Choir and Strings in Dresden\\" =Instrumental works= Galuppi was much admired for his keyboard music. Few of his sonatas were published in his lifetime, but many survive in manuscript.Anderson, Keith (2011). \\"Baldassare Galuppi (1706‚Äì1785)\\", Notes to Naxos CD 8.572263 Some of them follow the Scarlatti single-movement model; others are in the three-movement form later adopted by Haydn, Beethoven and others. Galuppi's skill as keyboard player is well documented. Hillers W√∂chentliche Nachrichten in 1772 made this mention of Galuppi's reputation in Saint Petersburg: \\"Chamber concerts were held every Wednesday in the antechamber of the imperial apartments, in order to enjoy the special style and fiery accuracy of the clavier playing of this great artist; thus did the virtuoso earn the overall approval of the court.\\"Hiller, Johann Adam, W√∂chentliche Nachrichten und Anmerkungen, die Musik betreffend (Leipzig, 1772) It is no surprise that a number of Galuppi's keyboard works should make it into print during his lifetime, including two sets of 6 sonatas, published in London as opus 1 (1756) and opus 2 (1759) respectively.Franco Rossi, Catalogo tematico delle composizioni di Baldassare Galuppi (1706‚Äì1785) ‚Äì Parte I: Le opere strumentali, Edizioni de I Solisti Veneti, Padova, 2006 Felix Raabe mentions the round number of 125 \\"sonatas, toccatas, divertimenti and etudes\\" for keyboard, based on Fausto Torrefranca's 1909 thematic catalogue of Galuppi's cembalo works.Raabe, Felix. 1929. Galuppi als Instrumentalkomponist. Frankfurt a.d. Oder: M√ºller. However, given some of the outrageous assertions on this topic that Torrefranca makes elsewhere (such as the claim that classical sonata form was created by Italian keyboard composers) the accuracy of this figure must be accepted only cautiously.Torrefranca, Fausto. La Creazione della sonata dramatica moderna rivendicata all'Italia. Rivista Musicale Italiana, 1910 Galuppi's 7 experimental Concerti a quattro are particularly innovative chamber music pieces that foreshadow the development of the classical string quartet.Finscher, Ludwig. 1974. Studien zur Geschichte des Streichquartetts. Kassel: B√§renreiter. Each of the concerti is a three- movement work for two violins, viola and cello that integrates the counterpoint of the sonata da chiesa with daring chromatic twists and harmonic detours that become more pronounced as the set progresses quartet by quartet. Innovations such as the chromatically raised 5th that Burney singled out in Galuppi's arias of the 1740s appear, and many harmonic features of the late- classical period are foreshadowed, such as the final deceptive cadence in which an augmented sixth chord is substituted before the ultimate resolution.Galuppi, Baldassare, and Horst Heussner. 1981. Concerti a quattro. Wien: Doblinger. Among other instrumental compositions by Galuppi, Grove's Dictionary lists sinfonias, overtures, trios and string quartets, and concerti for solo instruments and strings. Legacy Burano's Piazza Galuppi is named for the composer Robert Browning's poem A Toccata of Galuppi's refers to Galuppi and his work. It is not known whether Browning was thinking of any one piece by Galuppi; in Galuppi's time, the terms \\"toccata\\" and \\"sonata\\" were less clearly differentiated than they later became, and were used interchangeably. A number of pieces have been suggested as Browning's inspiration, but as Charles van den Borren wrote in The Musical Times, \\"every poet has the right to evade the prosaic minutiae of fact\\", and it is impossible to state with confidence that one Galuppi piece has more claim than another to be the inspiration for the poem.Borren, Charles van den, trans. Richard Capell. \\"Round about A Toccata of Galuppi's\\", The Musical Times, 1 May 1923, pp 314‚Äì316 The poem inspired a 1989 setting, in modern idiom but with musical quotations from Galuppi's works, by the composer Dominick Argento.Colwitz, p. ix Browning's poem was followed by a few revivals of Galuppi works, and the composer's music was played at memorials for the poet, both in church and in the concert hall.\\"Mr. Clifford Harrison's Recitals\\", The Times, 5 October 1897, p. 11, and \\"Robert Browning Commemoration Service\\", The Times, 14 December 1897, p. 6 But performances of Galuppi's music remained sporadic.

The headquarters, Fo Guang Shan Monastery is located in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, and is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. The organization is also one of the largest charity organizations in Taiwan. The organization's counterpart for laypeople is known as the Buddha's Light International Association. Founded in 1967 by Hsing Yun, the order promotes Humanistic Buddhism and is known for its efforts in the modernization of Chinese Buddhism. The order is famous for its use of technology and its temples are often furnished with the latest equipment. Hsing Yun's stated position for Fo Guang Shan is that it is an \\"amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism\\" (). The Fo Guang Shan order has an associated college, Fo Guang University, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in both Buddhist Studies and secular fields. In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is popularly referred to as one of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" and Fo Guang Shan is considered one of the \\"Four Great Mountains\\" or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwanese Buddhism, along with Dharma Drum Mountain, Tzu Chi, and Chung Tai Shan.  History  In 1967, Hsing Yun purchased more than 30 hectares in Dashu Township, Kaohsiung County as the site for the construction of a monastery. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 16 May 1967. Fo Guang Shan embarked on many construction projects, including university buildings, shrines, and a cemetery. In 1975, Fo Guang Shan's 36-metre tall statue of AmitƒÅbha Buddha was consecrated. In 1981, 15 years after its establishment, the Great Hero Hall was built. During these times, many other Fo Guang Shan temples outside the order's mother monastery were also built.left In May 1997, Hsing Yun announced that he would close the mountain gate of Fo Guang Shan to the general public. His reason in closing the monastery was to give monastics the cloistered atmosphere they need for their Buddhist practice. In practice, many Chinese monasteries have also closed their mountain gates to give a cloistered atmosphere to the temple residents. At the end of 2000, then President Chen Shui-bian of the Republic of China and government officials from Kaohsiung visited Fo Guang Shan, bringing with them the wish from their constituents that Fo Guang Shan reopen its mountain gate. After due consideration, Fo Guang Shan decided to reopen the monastery to some extent, thereby providing the public a place to practice Pure Land Buddhism. On top of its headquarters being the largest monastery in Taiwan, it has a network of over 300 branches throughout Taiwan. Fo Guang Shan entered mainland China in the early 21st century, focusing more on charity and Chinese cultural revival rather than Buddhist propagation in order to avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist Party, which opposes religion. Fo Guang Shan's presence in China increased under the presidency of General Secretary Xi Jingping after he started a program to revive traditional Chinese faiths. As of 2017, the order had over 1,000 monks and nuns, and over 1 million followers worldwide, with branches in fifty countries.  Activities  Temples and organizations have been established in 173 countries throughout the world, and now encompasses more than 3,500 monastics. The organization emphasizes education and service, maintaining universities, Buddhist colleges, libraries, publishing houses, translation centres, Buddhist art galleries, teahouses, and mobile medical clinics. It has also established a children's room, retirement home, high school and television station. = Social and medical programs = The social and medical programs of Fo Guang Shan include a free medical clinic with mobile units that serve remote villages, an annual winter relief program organized to distribute warm clothing and food supplies to the needy, a children's and seniors' home, wildlife conservation areas to protect living creatures, and a cemetery for the care of the deceased. Fo Guang Shan's social work focuses primarily on helping the poor in remote areas. The organization also runs orphanages, homes for the elderly, and drug rehabilitation programs in prisons. Fo Guang Shan has also been involved in some international relief efforts. = Educational programs = leftThe educational programs of Fo Guang Shan include four Buddhist colleges, three regular colleges, and various community colleges. The Fo Guang University was established in 2000. It focuses mainly on the humanities and social sciences. The Chinese Buddhist research institute is subdivided into four separate departments; a women's and men's college, and an international and English Buddhist studies department. Tuition fees and lodging are provided by Fo Guang Shan, free of charge. Other prominent universities the order has established include Nanhua University in Taiwan and the University of the West in the United States. The organization also operates Pu-Men High School in Taipei, Jiun Tou Elementary and Junior High School, Humanities Primary and Junior High School, which provides regular curriculum for students. Fo Guang Shan also has nursery schools, kindergartens, and Sunday schools for children. Along with Tzu Chi, Fo Guang Shan is the only major Buddhist organization in Taiwan that offers some form of strictly secular education, as opposed to purely religious. In mainland China, Fo Guang Shan operates numerous cultural education programs and has built several libraries, even having gotten several books published through state controlled media. = Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum = Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum Building plans for the Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum (formerly called the Buddha Memorial Center) started with support from the Taiwanese government. The museum's Jade Buddha Shrine is purported to hold tooth relics of the historic Buddha. The site is situated immediately adjacent to the main monastery and covers more than 100 hectares. The complex faces east and is built along a central axial line. Beyond the Welcoming Hall are eight Chinese- styled pagodas on either side of the main avenue leading up to the Bodhi Square, about which are statues of the Buddha's main disciples and of the founders of the principal schools of Chinese Buddhism. The path leads onto the Memorial Hall, which holds several shrines including the Jade Buddha Shrine. Above the hall are four stupas that symbolize the Four Noble Truths. Standing behind but separate from it, there is an enormous seated metal Shakyamuni Buddha 108 meters high. The Center was opened at an international ceremony on 25 December 2011 and the first anniversary celebrated on Christmas Day 2012.Lovelock, Yann, A Buddhist Christmas = Religious Affairs Committee = In 1972, Hsing Yun established a nine-member council, known as the Fo Guang Shan Religious Affairs Committee. These nine members govern the monastery and the order. The members are elected prior to the resignation, death, or the ending of a term of an abbot. Once elected by members of Fo Guang Shan, the votes are openly counted. The nine members then nominate their next abbot. Eight members of the council are ordained monastics, and one is a layperson.  Abbots  Unlike a traditional Mahayana Buddhist monastery, where the incumbent abbot usually selects his successor, Fo Guang Shan directly elects an abbot to head the Order and its temple branches worldwide. The head of the FGS order and all of its branches is the abbot of Fo Guang Shan Monastery. The abbot is the chairperson of the Religious Affairs Committee, serving a term of six years, with one reappointment by popular vote and, under exceptional circumstances, a second reappointment by two-thirds vote. The abbot is elected by all members of Fo Guang Shan through public vote. The abbot-elect then begins to use their \\"inner name\\", in place of his/her own dharma name, with the first character being Hsin (\\"ÂøÉ\\", xin, or heart). In fact, all monastics of Fo Guang Shan have such a name, and several Elders also use theirs publicly. At the beginning of the year, the abbot-elect is inaugurated as the new director of Fo Guang Shan through a dharma transmission ceremony, receiving the robe and bowl. Hsing Yun is the only abbot to have served as such for more than two terms, and was not elected by the RAC. In the case of Venerable Hsin Ping (who was originally Venerable Zhizong), he was also not officially elected, as he was Hsing Yun's designated heir apparent. After Hsin Ping died, the vice director of Fo Guang Shan, Hsin Ting (originally Venerable Zhidu), was immediately elevated to serve the remaining years of Hsin Ping's term. Abbots have been elected according to FGS's constitution since then. As with Hsing Yun, former abbots do not leave the order when they retire. They continue to make Dharma talks throughout the world and become head teachers of the order in their later years.  Dharma propagation  alt= Dharma programs of Fo Guang Shan include lectures given in prisons and factories; programs on television and radio, large-scale public lectures in Taiwan and overseas, and the five precepts initiation given twice a year at the monastery. All branches of Fo Guang Shan organize pilgrimages to bring devotees to the monastery from different parts of Taiwan and overseas. Once pilgrims arrive, they are free to make use of all of the different activities that are open to the general public. In mainland China, the order focuses on cultural exchange rather than religion as a way to introduce Buddhist ideas, as preaching is illegal in China. Fo Guang Shan's approach to Dharma propagation focuses on simplifying Buddhism in order to make it more appealing to the masses. The organization is known for utilizing modern marketing techniques and methods to preach such as the use of laser shows and multimedia displays. Fo Guang Shan temples have no entrance fee, and do not allow many of the practices commonly found in other Chinese temples, such as fortune-telling or the presence of sales vendors. Despite the popularity of the organization, Fo Guang Shan has received criticism for being \\"too focused on commercialism, expanding its membership base, and building large temples.\\" (Schak and Hsiao)  Objectives  * To propagate Buddhist teachings through cultural activities * To foster talent through education * To benefit society through charitable programs * To purify human hearts and minds through Buddhist practice  Mottos  = Official motto = BLIA logo, a statue of Maitreya, and the statue of Amitabha in far right. = The Four Verses of Fo Guang Shan and BLIA = *May kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity pervade all worlds; *May we cherish and build affinities to benefit all beings; *May Chan, Pure Land, and Precepts inspire equality and patience; *May our humility and gratitude give rise to great vows.http://fgsihb.org/dictionary-info.asp?id=19509 = BLIA guidelines = * Offer others confidence * Offer others joy * Offer others hope * Offer others convenience  Abbots and directors  File:ÊòüÈõ≤Â§ßÂ∏´2009IBPS.jpgHsing Yun (1967‚Äì1985) File:No image.svgHsin Ping (1985‚Äì1995) File:Venerable Hsin Ting At Hsi Lai Temple, 2012.pngHsin Ting (1997‚Äì2005) File:ÂøÉÂüπÂíåÂ∞ö.JPGHsin Pei (2005‚Äì2013) File:2010Jul11ÊÖßÊøüÊ≥ïÂ∏´.JPGHsin Bao (2013‚Äìpresent)  Branches  *Fo Guang Shan Mabuhay Temple *Zu Lai Temple *Chung Tian Temple *Hsi Lai Temple *Nan Hua Temple *Nan Tien Temple *Fo Guang Shan Temple, Auckland *Fo Guang Shan Temple, Toronto *Guang Ming Temple *London Fo Guang Shan Temple  See also  *Linji school  References   Bibliography  * Chandler, Stuart (2002).

He is the founder of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order as well as the affiliated Buddha's Light International Association in Taiwan. Hsing Yun is considered to be one of the most prominent proponents of Humanistic Buddhism and is considered to be one of the most influential teachers of modern Taiwanese Buddhism. In Taiwan, he is popularly referred to as one of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, along with his contemporaries: Master Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain, Master Cheng Yen of Tzu Chi and Master Wei Chueh of Chung Tai Shan. Fo Guang Shan Hsing Yun's first exposure to Buddhism came from his grandmother, a practicing Buddhist and meditator. He entered the monastic life at the age of 12. Hsing Yun was first inspired by Buddhist modernism in 1945 while studying at Jiaoshan Buddhist College. There he learned about Buddhist teacher Taixu's calls for reform in Buddhism and the Sangha. He fled mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 following the communist victory in the civil war but was arrested along with several other Buddhist monastics. Hsing Yun and the others were released after 23 days and Hsing Yun spent the next several years developing a large following and founding numerous temples. In 1966, Hsing Yun bought some land in Kaohsiung and started building a large monastery. After partial completion, the temple opened in 1967 and would later become the headquarters of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist organization.

Fo Guang Shan's presence in China increased under the premiership of General Secretary Xi Jingping after he started a program to revive traditional Chinese faiths. According to Hsing Yun, his goal in mainland China is to work with the mainland government to rebuild China's culture following the destruction of the Cultural Revolution, rather than promote Buddhism in the mainland. The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan in Kaohsiung is currently the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. On top of that, the order has a network of over 300 branches throughout Taiwan, as well as several branches worldwide in at least fifty countries. Politics In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is notable for his activity in political affairs, particularly as a supporter of the One-China policy as well as government legislation supported by the Kuomintang, and has been criticized for his views by those in favor of Taiwan independence and by religious figures, as being overtly political and \\"considerably far afield from traditional monastic concerns\\".[s.n.] (4 June 2008).

The foundation has several sub- organizations such as the Tzu Chi International Medical Association (TIMA) and also the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association (Tzu Ching) (. Tzu Chi volunteers and relief workers are mostly recognizable by their blue and white uniforms called, in , l√°ntiƒÅn b√°iy√∫n, (lit. 'blue sky, white clouds'). The foundation's work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work such as recycling. It is operated by a worldwide network of volunteers and employees and has been awarded a special consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council.O'Neill, Mark (2010), Tzu Chi: Serving With Compassion, John Wiley & Sons The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded by Master Cheng Yen, a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, or bhikkhuni, in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The organization began as a group of thirty housewives who saved money for needy families. Tzu Chi gradually expanded its services over time, opening a free medical clinic in 1972 and building its first hospital in 1986. The organization underwent a rapid expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with a surge of popularity in Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan. In the 1990s the organization started major international disaster relief efforts. Tzu Chi is known for undertaking long-term projects such as building new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. As of 2013, the organization was estimated at over 10 million members worldwide throughout 47 countries. Tzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, however Dharma teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the \\"Four Great Mountains\\", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan along with Fo Guang Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, and Chung Tai Shan. History The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded as a charity organization with Buddhist origins by the Buddhist nun Master Cheng Yen in 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan after Cheng Yen saw the humanitarian work of Christian missionaries in Taiwan in the post World War II period. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master Yin Shun (Âç∞È†ÜÂ∞éÂ∏´, Y√¨n Sh√πn d«éoshƒ´) a proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, who exhorted her to \\"work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings\\". The organization began with a motto of \\"instructing the rich and saving the poor\\" as a group of thirty housewives who saved fifty cents (US$0.02) every day and stored them in bamboo savings banks to donate to needy families. Tzu Chi experienced modest growth in the first two decades of its establishment, it grew to 293 members in 1968 and by 1986 had just 8,000 members. The foundation gradually expanded its services since starting as a group of thirty housewives, raising money for disaster relief after a small fire in 1970 that destroyed 43 buildings and opening its first free medical clinic in 1972. In 1986 the foundation established its first hospital in Hualien City. With the surge in popularity of Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan in the late 1980s and 1990s, and the publicity from fundraising to build its first hospital, Tzu Chi enjoyed a rapid expansion in membership alongside several other major Taiwanese Buddhist organizations during this time. From 1987 to 1991, Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994, it boasted a membership of 4 million members. Tzu Chi's expanded its aid work to the People's Republic of China in 1991, during the eastern China floods. In 1993, the foundation created a bone marrow registry, an effort that eventually caused Taiwan to alter its bone marrow laws, and organized a nationwide volunteer program for Taiwan in 1996. The foundation achieved much media attention in Taiwan in 2015 with a plan to develop a plot of land in Neihu District into a disaster relief center and cultural park which led to the destruction of parts of the Neihu conservation zone. The incident led to widespread critical coverage of Tzu Chi by the Taiwanese media, and scrutiny into its finances. During this time several unsubstantiated reports circulated in Taiwan about the foundation, including unfounded claims that the foundation invested in tobacco and weapons companies. Despite authorities not finding any illicit activity with its finances, calls for greater transparency were made. Tzu Chi has grown to become a significant actor in civil society, Tzu Chi is not only the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan, but also Taiwan's largest owner of private land. As of 2013, the organization was estimated to have approximately 10 million members worldwide, and chapters in 47 countries.  Organization  Main hall at Tzu Chi Foundation The four major causes of Tzu Chi are Charity, Medicine, Education, and Humanity, as highlighted by the official motto, or concept of \\"Four endeavors, eight footprints\\" (). The eight footprints are charity causes, medical contributions, education development, humanities, international disaster assistance, bone-marrow donation, community volunteerism, and environmental protection. The official website for the organization states that the organization started with Charity, and then extended its aims to include Medicine, Education and Culture. Its stated goal is to promote \\"sincerity, integrity, trust, and honesty\\". Tzu Chi is notably distinct from the other Four Great Mountains in respect to three main unique characteristics. First of all, the founder of the organization is a female. Secondly, the founder is not a Buddhist scholar who promotes a specific interpretation of Buddhism nor started any kind of religious movement. And finally, the organization is officially a charitable organization and Tzu Chi itself focuses primarily on humanitarianism and community service rather than Buddhist spiritual development. =Logo= Consisting of a ship that also simultaneously bears the lotus fruit and flower, the Tzu Chi logo symbolizes that the world can be made a better place by planting good karmic seeds. Followers believe that these \\"seeds\\" are required for flowers to bloom and bear fruit, or in other words, that a better society can be created with good actions and pure thoughts. The ship represents Tzu Chi steering a ship of compassion, representing their goal in saving all beings that suffer, while the Eight Petals represent the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism, which Tzu Chi uses as their guide. The Noble Eightfold Path consists of: # Right View # Right Thought # Right Speech # Right Action # Right Livelihood # Right Effort # Right Mindfulness # Right Focus =Tzu Chi's Ten Precepts= Tzu Chi Foundation's depiction of the Buddha on a wall mural. The image is known as \\"The Great Awakened of the Universe (ÂÆáÂÆôÂ§ßË¶∫Ëëó)\\".Tzu Chi also has its own customized version of the Buddhist Precepts as formulated by Master Cheng-Yen. The Ten Precepts of Tzu Chi are: #No killing # No stealing # No fornication # No lying # No drinking # No smoking or use of narcotics or betel nuts # No gambling # Practice filial piety and develop pleasant manners and speech # Abide by traffic laws # No participation in political activities or demonstrations Master Cheng-Yen has stated that she developed these rules based on the new needs of modern society.  Medical Mission  One of the first major initiatives Tzu Chi took part in was the \\"Tzu Chi Medical Mission\\". This effort was inspired in 1970 after Cheng Yen noticed a link between poverty and illness after spending six years among the poor of eastern Taiwan. Tzu Chi's first medical outreach occurred in 1972 when a free clinic was opened in Hualien. = Tzu Chi Hospital = Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien in 2011 The Foundation established its first Tzu Chi Hospital in Hualien in 1986. A 600-bed general hospital had been planned in 1979 to service the impoverished eastern coast of Taiwan. A primary concern for Cheng Yen was that the area was isolated and the people in the area were cut off from aid during disasters. Despite setbacks both in funding for the hospital and finding an acceptable site. Ground was broken on the site eventually chosen on 5 February 1983 at a ceremony officiated by then Provincial Governor (later President) Lee Teng-Hui. However, two weeks after ground was broken, Cheng Yen received a notice from the military telling her that the property was needed by the military and that construction would have to stop. A new site was obtained for the hospital with help from Minister of the Interior Lin Yang-kang. A second groundbreaking occurred on 2 April 1984 at the new site. The publicity of the project to build the hospital led to a significant increase in the number of Tzu Chi volunteers, with Tzu Chi membership increasing six-fold by the time of the second groundbreaking since the announcement of the project in 1979. Construction was completed and the hospital opened on 17 August 1986. Tzu Chi has since built hospitals in Yuli, Hualien County; Dalin, Chiayi County; Guanshan, Taitung County; Tanzi District, Taichung City; and Xindian, New Taipei City. In addition to building hospitals the Tzu Chi College of Nursing was founded on 17 September 1989 in Hualien in order to address the shortage of nurses on Taiwan's east coast, with a focus on serving the poor. It was the first private nursing college in Taiwan to waive tuition for selected courses, in addition to providing full scholarships for qualified Taiwan aborigine students. = Bone Marrow registry = Main building at Tzu Chi University Tzu Chi created a bone marrow registry, the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow Bank, in 1993 after a young follower of Cheng Yen was diagnosed with Leukemia. Cheng Yen referred to the concept of bone marrow donation as a way to \\"save a life without harming yourself.\\" This effort to register bone marrow donors from an organization with such massive membership like Tzu Chi caused Taiwan to change its laws regarding organ donations. This registry became a division of the new Tzu Chi Stem Cells Center, which was founded to improve research and treatment capabilities. By 2007 the program had saved the lives of almost 1,500 people in 25 different countries. By 2008, Tzu Chi had registered more than 307,657 bone marrow donors. = College of Medicine = Tzu Chi established the Tzu Chi College of Medicine in 1994. This college became Tzu Chi University in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for body donations surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country. In 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.  Disaster relief  Tzu Chi Culture and Communications building Tzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide. In carrying out these projects, Tzu Chi has a policy that forbids public gatherings for the sole purpose of specific political, economic, and religious groups. Tzu Chi volunteers are not to discuss business, politics, or preach religion while giving aid. One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long-term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non- Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. =People's Republic of China= Tzu Chi's involvement with providing aid in the People's Republic of China was difficult at first. Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in China as \\"Building a Bridge of Love.\\" The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the political tensions between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince Taiwanese to help the Chinese, and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi. Tzu Chi's involvement in the People's Republic of China began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after severe floods hit central and eastern China. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China. Since then, the foundation has built schools, nursing homes and entire villages, including infrastructure in poor inland areas, such as Guizhou province. Over the past twenty years, Tzu Chi expanded their humanitarian work and influence to 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Projects include relief work after major disasters like the Sichuan earthquake; distribution of rice and goods to the poor; social programs like regular visits to the needy; scholarship programs to the less privileged students; medical missions like bone marrow donation and free clinics; and educational outings of environmental protection and recycling activities. In March 2008, Tzu Chi became the first organization represented by a non-Mainland resident to be registered with the Chinese government. In the aftermath of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Tzu Chi sent food, blankets and medical aid to survivors, while volunteers in China set out for the disaster zone. Tzu Chi was also one of the few organizations the Chinese government allowed to bring in aid workers from overseas to join the relief effort. With the motto \\"First to arrive, last to leave,\\" the organization has continued with long-term reconstruction work in Sichuan, and by 2010, had rebuilt thirteen schools in the region. In August 2010, Tzu Chi became the first overseas NGO to receive permission from the Ministry of Civil Affairs to set up a nationwide charity foundation. Normally, overseas organizations must register with the Ministry of Commerce as businesses. The foundation received the China Charity Award from the Ministry of Civil Affairs for its work in charity and promoting the well-being of society in 2006 and again in 2008. = Aid in Taiwan = In 1996, Tzu Chi started a nationwide volunteer program where volunteers are registered according to where they live with the goal of \\"neighbors helping neighbors.\\" The community volunteer initiative began as a disaster relief effort started in response to Typhoon Herb. Tzu Chi tent at rescue site Tzu Chi volunteers were one of the first responders in the Chi-Chi earthquake (known in Taiwan as the 921 earthquake) of 1999, mobilizing within 2 hours to provide thousands of sets of food and relief supplies to victims. The volunteers followed a strict system of organization where commissioners and teams of volunteers were assigned to specific townships, and teams were assigned to specific areas within the townships. This organizational structure was what allowed the volunteers to be mobilized so quickly and efficiently. The earthquake prompted Cheng Yen to start \\"Project Hope\\", a long-term project to rebuild 51 schools for those effected by the disaster. Tzu Chi raised more relief funds for the earthquake than any other religious organization in Taiwan, raising nearly sixty times as much funds for the relief effort than the next largest fund raiser, Fo Guang Shan. The 921 earthquake was credited for prompting Tzu Chi to create a disaster relief coordination center at its headquarters to organize quicker disaster response services. Tzu Chi was also active in providing aid after Typhoon Nepartak struck Taiwan in 2016, providing relief supplies, rebuilding communities, and providing medical care through its medical support staff in Taimali, Taiwan which have been holding medical outreach free clinics in the area since 2006. = International Disaster Relief = Tzu Chi has participated in numerous other relief projects around the world, including sending teams to Indonesia and Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake as well as to Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake in their northern mountains. The later was done despite poor relations between the governments of the two countries. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the organization announced on 18 November 2012 a donation of $10 million in the form of $300 and $600 Visa debit cards to those affected in the New York and New Jersey area. Volunteers handed out these cards in parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Tzu Chi was also active in providing aid following the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Tzu Chi was also active in relief efforts during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the group provided aid, as well as cash gifts for those who helped the community during the disaster. In 2016, the organization distributed in the United States over $2 million in cash cards to disaster victims. As of 2015, Tzu Chi has provided disaster relief aid to over 85 countries worldwide. Global presence Tzu Chi's headquarters is in Hualien County, Taiwan.

The organization builds and operates many hospitals and schools, with outreach efforts that range from visits to nursing homes to providing bone marrow surgery, as well as offering items such as washing machines to struggling single mothers. The television \\"Da Ai\\" network operates with its own news and television programming. Chinese schools have also been established abroad, such as in Australia and the United States, which apart from teaching Chinese and sign language also guides students in ways of compassion and community service. 2010 Haitian earthquake =Recycling= A significant fraction of funds raised by Tzu Chi revolves around environmentally friendly goals in encouraging the recycling of items such as water bottles as well as using reusable items or reusing items to reduce waste. As of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations. One of the foundation's projects is the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles for the production of textiles. The project, which was started in 2006, collects PET plastic bottles and recycles them into cloth.Tzu Chi Quarterly, Winter 2008 The project is handled by the Tzu Chi sponsored non-profit Da Ai Technology Co. The products are all designed by members of the paid staff and recycled plastic bottles make up about half of the raw materials for the products. The project collects about 2,000 tons of plastic bottles each year. Tzu Chi's recycling centers have been a source of criticism however, with critics arguing that Tzu Chi's recycling efforts result in lost income for poor trash collectors. Since 2007, the foundation has produced over 460,000 polyester blankets out of recycled plastic bottles, many of which have been distributed as part of Tzu Chi's disaster relief programs throughout the world. Other items made with the recycled resins include thermal underwear, T-shirts, hospital bed sheets, medical gowns, suitcases, stuffed animals and uniforms for Tzu Chi volunteers. While the project relies on recycled plastic bottles for the production of its products, its leaders have stated that it is still best for people to not use plastic bottles at all. Inside the main hall of Tzu Chi Foundation =Dharma= The teachings of the Buddha and founder Master Cheng Yen play a core role in the workings of the organization. \\"Tzu Chi Day\\" is celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May which generally coincides with the Buddha's birthday (Vesak Day), and Mother's Day (as recognised in Taiwan). Celebrations during Tzu Chi Day include the bathing of the Buddha ceremony, the tradition's message is that it is the people that need cleansing before they become better individuals. Tzu Chi promotes many of the teachings of Buddhism, in particular the Lotus Sutra, and also has sutra adaptations through the use of sign language on the Sutra of the Innumerable Meanings, which teaches that sentient existence is challenging and filled with disasters in the absence of observations of virtue, as well as the Sutra of the Water Repentance, which advocates and symbolizes the need to repent karmic transgressions. Despite these activities, Tzu Chi has a policy of not proselytizing religion directly at its public activities. Apart from being non-proselytist, Tzu Chi's adaptation of Buddhist principles is apolitical. In disaster regions where a particular religious faith is prominent, Tzu Chi regularly works together with local religious organizations. Tzu Chi has re- built mosques and churches in disaster zones where faith plays an important role in local society. Tzu Chi nuns (bhikkhunis) do not rely on donations for their livelihood, something uncommon among most Buddhist orders. In earlier days, the nuns sustained themselves by farming, weaving and other handicrafts. More recently, they sustained themselves by the manufacture of electrical circuit breakers and other products. =International branches= Tzu Chi has branches in 47 countries and regions including USA, Canada, Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and various locations in Asia, Europe and Africa. Building for Tzu Chi's Buddhist Satellite station, Da Ai Television =Television and Satellite Network= On 17 August 1999, a television network was formed in Taiwan under the Tzu Chi Foundation of the Culture of Communication, Inc with the slogan \\"Love to make the world light up\\". Formally known as Da Ai Television, the network grew into a global broadcasting presence with offerings of a radio service, Tzu Chi Channel 1, Tzu Chi Channel 2, Da Ai TV Indonesia, Da Ai TV Thailand, and Da Ai TV Egypt. Live streaming of Channel 1 and 2 can also be found on YouTube. =Jing Si Books & Caf√©= Jing Si Books & Caf√© is a chain of non-profit bookstores and cafes operated by Tzu Chi offering Tzu Chi merchandise and publications by Cheng Yen. Youth The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (ÊÖàÊøüÂ§ßÂ∞àÈùíÂπ¥ËÅØË™ºÊúÉ) is the Foundation's college youth organization, and was officially established in Taiwan on 31 May 1992. With chapters at universities worldwide, its goal is to allow university students (known as Tzu Ching or ÊÖàÈùí, literally \\"compassionate youth\\") to be involved with Tzu Chi's activities. Tzu Ching volunteers are given the opportunity to participate in large-scale events such as disaster relief and international NGO conferences such as the annual UN Youth Assembly. Master Cheng Yen encourages the Tzu Ching volunteers to actively communicate with each other, with the goals of learning and improving. Each year an international Tzu Ching officer training retreat camp is held at the foundation headquarters in Hualien. Tzu Shao (ÊÖàÂ∞ë) is the Tzu Chi branch for youths under the age of 18. People in this group do community services such as free clinics, soup kitchens, and nursery homes. Year End Ceremonies Each year Tzu Chi conducts a Year End Ceremony attended by Tzu Chi workers, volunteers and members in January or February where Master Cheng Yen distributes blessings in the form of red packets that embosses a coin in Taiwanese currency together with auspicious words for the coming year.

Galt has been called the first political novelist in the English language, due to being the first novelist to deal with issues of the Industrial Revolution. Galt was the first superintendent of the Canada Company (1826-1829). The company had been formed to populate a part of what is now Southern Ontario (then known as Upper Canada) in the first half of the 19th century; it was later called \\"the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history\\". In 1829, Galt was recalled to Great Britain for mismanagement of the Canada Company (particularly incompetent bookkeeping), and was later jailed for failing to pay his son's tuition. Galt's Autobiography, published in London in 1833, includes a discussion of his life and work in Upper Canada. He was the father of Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt of Montreal, Quebec. Life Born in Irvine, in Ayrshire, Galt was the son of a naval captain involved in the West Indies trade. He was a first cousin of Captain Alexander Allan. His father moved to Greenock in 1780. The family visited regularly but did not permanently rejoin him until 1789. John was educated at Irvine Grammar School alongside Henry Eckford, who was a lifetime friend, and William Spence.Annals of the Parish: The Life of John Galt Galt spent a few months with the Greenock Custom House, at age 17, then became an apprentice and junior clerk under his uncle, Mr. Ewing, also writing essays and stories for local journals in his spare time. He moved to London in 1804 to join his father and seek his fortune. In 1809 he began studying law at Lincoln's Inn. During a subsequent trip to Europe, Galt met and befriended Lord Byron in Gibraltar. He traveled with Byron and his companion, John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton to Malta. He met them again in Greece. Parting company, Galt continued alone to Constantinople, Adrianople and then Sophia. He returned to Greenock via Ireland. He then embarked to London to pursue business plans, but these did not come to fruition and he took to writing. Galt wrote an account of his travels, which met with moderate success. Decades later, he would also publish the first full biography of Lord Byron. He also published the first biography of the painter Benjamin West, The Life and Studies of Benjamin West (1816, expanded 1820). In 1813, Galt attempted to establish a Gibraltarian trading company, in order to circumvent Napoleon's embargo on British trade; however, Wellington's victory in Spain made this no longer necessary. Galt then returned to London and married Elizabeth Tilloch, daughter of Alexander Tilloch. They had three boys. In 1815, he became Secretary of the Royal Caledonian Asylum in London. He also privately consulted in several business ventures. Galt started to submit articles to Blackwood's Magazine in late 1819, and in March 1829 he sent Blackwood the publishers the plan for \\"The Ayrshire legatees\\". Concentrating on his writing for the next several years, Galt lived at times in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere, writing fiction and a number of school texts under the pseudonym Reverend T. Clark. Around 1821 he moved his family from Greenock to Eskgrove near Musselburgh. In addition to moving his residence frequently during this period, Galt also switched publishers several times, moving from Blackwood's Magazine to Oliver and Boyd and then back again. In 1821 Annals of the parish was published as were two instalments of The steam boat and he started work on the novel Sir Andr√© Wylie. Annals of the parish established Galt's reputation overnight. Sir Andrew Wylie was published in 1822 Canada Company Office 1834 In 1824, Galt was appointed Secretary of the Canada Company, a charter company established to aid in the colonization of the Huron Tract in Upper Canada along the eastern shore of Lake Huron. After the company was incorporated by royal charter on August 19, 1826, Galt traveled across the Atlantic on the man-of-war HMS Romney, arriving at New York City and then traveling by road. Sadly, soon after arriving, word was sent that his mother had suffered a stroke. He returned to her (in Musselburgh) in 1826 and she died a few months later. He returned to Canada in 1826. While in Canada, Galt lived in York in Upper Canada (now Ontario), but located the headquarters of the Canada Company at Guelph, a town he also founded in 1827. Later that year, he co-founded the town of Goderich with Tiger Dunlop. The community of Galt, Ontario was named after him. His three sons played prominent roles in Canadian politics; one of them, Alexander, later became one of the 'Fathers of the Confederation', and Canada's first Minister of Finance. During his tenure with the Canada Company, Galt ran afoul of several colonial authorities, including Sir Peregrine Maitland, who was Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada at the time. He was heavily criticised by his employers for his lack of basic accounting skills and failure to carry out their established policies. This resulted in his dismissal and recall to Great Britain in 1829. Soon after his return to Great Britain, he spent several months in King's Bench Prison for failure to pay debts. One of Galt's last novels, The Member, has political corruption as its central theme. In 1831 he moved to Barn Cottage in Old Brompton. Despite failing health (following a trip over a tree root whilst in Canada), Galt was involved in another colonial business venture, the British American Land Company, which was formed to develop lands in the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada (now Quebec). Galt served as secretary but was forced to resign in December 1832 because of his health. By this stage his spinal injury was not only crippling him but also affecting his speech and handwriting. The old Greenock cemetery entrance from Inverkip Street, with a plaque, commemorating John Galt, and in the immediate background John Galt House The Galt family tomb, inscribed to John Galt, \\"Author of The Annals of the Parish &c; &c.;\\" In 1834 he moved to Edinburgh following the publishing of his two-volume Autobiography in 1833. Galt here met the travel writer Harriet Pigott. Pigott persuaded Galt to edit her Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage. She received some criticism for this as it was suspected that she was just taking advantage of Galt. However, her unfinished biography of him which is in the Bodleian Library implies that it was more of mutual respect than her critics allowed. Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage had an introduction by Galt, and this three-volume work was published in 1839. He retired to his old home in Greenock in August 1834 following the departure of three of his sons to Canada. Finding the accommodation unsuitable he lived temporarily in Gourock before returning to a more comfortable house in December 1834. Galt died on 11 April 1839. He was buried in the family tomb of his parents in the New Burying Ground in Greenock (now called the Inverkip Street Cemetery). = Huron Tract = The area, known as the Huron Tract on the eastern shore of Lake Huron, was in size and had been acquired from the Ojibwe (Chippewa) by the British government. The company surveyed and subdivided this massive area, built roads, mills, and schools and advertised it at affordable prices to buyers in Europe. The company then assisted in the migration of new settlers, bringing them to the area by means of a boat, which the company also owned. Initially settling in York (Toronto, Ontario) he selected what later became Guelph, Ontario as the company's headquarters, and began to develop a town there. Galt is also considered to be the founder of Goderich, Ontario with his colleague William \\"Tiger\\" Dunlop. Legacy John Galt memorial fountain at Greenock Esplanade In Greenock, John Galt is commemorated by the John Galt memorial fountain on the Esplanade, and by a plaque at the old cemetery where he is buried. Sheltered housing (for seniors) built next to the cemetery in 1988, on the site of the old Greenock Royal Infirmary, is named John Galt House in his honour. He is also commemorated in Makars' Court, outside The Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh and In 2006, the community of Guelph proclaimed the first Monday in August, \\"John Galt Day.\\" The city of Galt, Ontario was named after John Galt, but was absorbed into Cambridge, Ontario in 1973. His original home in Guelph, known as the \\"Priory\\" (built 1827-1828), stood on the banks of the Speed River near the current River Run Centre for performing arts. The building later became the first CPR station in the city; the conversion was completed in 1888. The building was no longer required by the CPR which built a new station in 1910. A photograph from 1914 depicts it as boarded up. In spite of attempts by various individuals in Guelph to save the structure, it was torn down in 1926. A historical plaque commemorates Galt's role with the Canada Company in populating the Huron Tract, calling it \\"the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history\\".

As a child, Nyro taught herself piano, read poetry, and listened to her mother's records by Leontyne Price, Nina Simone, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, and classical composers such as Debussy and Ravel. She composed her first songs at age eight. With her family, she spent summers in the Catskills, where her father played trumpet at resorts. She credited the Sunday school at the New York Society for Ethical Culture with providing the basis of her education; she also attended Manhattan's High School of Music & Art. Nyro was close to her aunt and uncle, artists Theresa Bernstein and William Meyerowitz, who helped support her education and early career.Kort, Michele. Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro. New York: St. Martin's Press, Kindle Version, 157/5869Kort, Michele. Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro. New York: St. Martin's Press, Kindle Version, 4790/5869„ÄÇ While in high school, she sang with a group of friends in subway stations and on street corners. She said, \\"I would go out singing, as a teenager, to a party or out on the street, because there were harmony groups there, and that was one of the joys of my youth.\\" Nyro commented: \\"I was always interested in the social consciousness of certain songs. My mother and grandfather were progressive thinkers, so I felt at home in the peace movement and the women's movement, and that has influenced my music.\\" =Early career= Louis Nigro's work brought him into contact with record company executive Artie Mogull and his partner Paul Barry, who auditioned Laura in 1966 and became her first managers. However, Nigro later said he did \\"not even once\\" mention Laura to any of his clients, adding \\"they would have laughed at me if I did.\\" As a teenager, Laura went by various surnames. She just happened to be using \\"Nyro\\" at the time she was discovered, and it stuck. Mogull had negotiated her a recording and management contract, and she recorded her debut album, More Than a New Discovery, for the Verve Folkways label (later re-named Verve Forecast). Later, other songs from the album became hits for The 5th Dimension, Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Barbra Streisand. On July 13, 1966, Laura Nyro recorded ‚ÄúStoney End‚Äù and ‚ÄúWedding Bell Blues‚Äù, as well as an early version of ‚ÄúTime and Love‚Äù, as part of More Than A New Discovery at Bell Sounds Studios, 237 West 54th Street, Manhattan. About a month later, she sold \\"And When I Die\\" to Peter, Paul, and Mary for $5,000. On September 17, 1966, Laura Nyro and Verve- Folkways released ‚ÄúWedding Bell Blues\\"/\\"Stoney End‚Äù as a single. \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" became a minor hit, especially on the west coast. She completed More Than A New Discovery in New York on November 29, 1966 and, starting on January 16, 1967, Laura Nyro made her first extended professional appearance at age 19, performing nightly for about a month at the \\"hungry i\\" coffeehouse in San Francisco. In February 1967, Verve Folkways released More Than A New Discovery. On March 4, 1967, Laura Nyro appeared on Clay Cole's Diskoteck, Episode 7.23, along with Dion and the Belmonts and others, but unfortunately the recording of that episode is lost. On March 21, 1967, she appeared on TV Show Where the Action Is, Episode 3.140 with videos of ‚ÄúWedding Bell Blues‚Äù (partially extant), ‚ÄúBlowin' Away‚Äù (lost), and \\"Goodbye Joe\\" (lost). On June 17, 1967, Nyro appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival. Although some accounts described her performance as a fiasco that culminated in her being booed off the stage,Harrington, Joe S. Sonic Cool: The Life and Death of Rock 'n' Roll. Hal Leonard (2002), p. 231. . recordings later made publicly available contradict this version of events. Soon afterwards, David Geffen approached Mogull about taking over as Nyro's agent. Nyro successfully sued to void her management and recording contracts on the grounds that she had entered into them while still a minor. Geffen became her manager, and the two established a publishing company, Tuna Fish Music, under which the proceeds from her future compositions would be divided equally between them. Geffen also arranged Nyro's new recording contract with Clive Davis at Columbia Records, and purchased the publishing rights to her early compositions. In his memoir Clive: Inside the Record Business, Davis recalled Nyro's audition for him: She'd invited him to her New York apartment, turned off every light except that of a television set next to her piano, and played him the material that would become Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. Around this time, Nyro considered becoming lead singer for Blood, Sweat & Tears, after the departure of founder Al Kooper, but was dissuaded by Geffen. Blood, Sweat & Tears would go on to have a hit with a cover of Nyro's \\"And When I Die\\". The new contract allowed Nyro more artistic freedom and control. In 1968, Columbia released Eli and the Thirteenth Confession, her second album, which received high critical praise for the depth and sophistication of its performance and arrangements, which merged pop structure with inspired imagery, rich vocals, and avant-garde jazz, and is widely considered to be one of her best works. Eli was followed in 1969 by New York Tendaberry, another highly acclaimed work which cemented Nyro's artistic credibility. \\"Time and Love\\" and \\"Save the Country\\" emerged as two of her most well-regarded and popular songs in the hands of other artists. During the weekend after Thanksgiving in November 1969, she gave two concerts at Carnegie Hall.Tom King, The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood, p. 125, Broadway Books (New York 2001). Her own recordings sold mostly to a faithful cadre of followers. This prompted Clive Davis, in his memoir, to note that her recordings, as solid as they were, came to resemble demonstrations for other performers. In 1969 Verve re-issued Nyro's debut album as The First Songs. The same year Geffen and Nyro sold Tuna Fish Music to CBS for $4.5 million. Under the terms of his partnership with Nyro, Geffen received half of the proceeds of the sale, making them both millionaires. Nyro's fourth album, Christmas and the Beads of Sweat, was released at the end of 1970. The set contained \\"Upstairs By a Chinese Lamp\\" and \\"When I Was a Freeport and You Were the Main Drag\\" and featured Duane Allman and other Muscle Shoals musicians. The following year's Gonna Take a Miracle was a collection of Nyro's favorite \\"teenage heartbeat songs\\", recorded with vocal group Labelle (Patti Labelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash) and the production team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. With the exception of her attribution of \\"D√©siree\\" (originally \\"Deserie\\" by The Charts), this was Nyro's sole album of wholly non-original material, featuring such songs as \\"Jimmy Mack\\", \\"Nowhere to Run\\", and \\"Spanish Harlem\\". During 1971, David Geffen worked to establish his own recording label, Asylum Records, in part because of the difficulties he had encountered in trying to secure a recording contract for another of his clients, Jackson Browne (with whom Nyro was in a relationship at the time). Geffen invited Nyro to join the new label and announced that she would be Asylum's first signing, but shortly before the official signing was due to take place, Geffen discovered that Nyro had changed her mind and re-signed with Columbia instead, without giving him prior notice of her decision. When interviewed about the matter for a 2012 PBS documentary on his life, Geffen, who considered Nyro his best friend, described Nyro's rejection as the biggest betrayal of his life up until that point, noting that he \\"cried for days\\" afterwards.Lacy, Susan. American Masters. Inventing David Geffen, PBS, 2012. By the end of 1971, Nyro was married to carpenter David Bianchini. She was reportedly uncomfortable with attempts to market her as a celebrity and she announced her retirement from the music business at the age of 24. In 1973 her Verve debut album was reissued as The First Songs by Columbia Records. =Later career= By 1976, her marriage had ended, and she released an album of new material, Smile. She then embarked on a four-month tour with a full band, which resulted in the 1977 live album Season of Lights. After the 1978 album Nested, recorded when she was pregnant with her only child, she again took a break from recording, this time until 1984's Mother's Spiritual. She began touring with a band in 1988, her first concert appearances in 10 years. The tour was dedicated to the animal rights movement. The shows led to her 1989 release, Laura: Live at the Bottom Line, which included six new compositions. Her final album of predominantly original material, Walk the Dog and Light the Light (1993), her last album for Columbia, was co-produced by Gary Katz, best known for his work with Steely Dan. The release sparked reappraisal of her place in popular music, and new commercial offers began appearing. She turned down lucrative film-composing offers, although she contributed a rare protest song to the Academy Award-winning documentary Broken Rainbow, about the unjust relocation of the Navajo people. Nyro performed increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s with female musicians, including her friend Nydia \\"Liberty\\" Mata, a drummer, and several others from the lesbian-feminist women's music subculture, such as members of the band Isis. During this period, Nyro made appearances at such venues as the 1989 Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and the 1989 Newport Folk Festival, of which a CD containing portions of her performance was released. On July 4, 1991, she opened for Bob Dylan at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts.Jim Sullivan, Boston Globe, July 5, 1991, p. 10. Among her last performances were at Union Chapel, Islington, London, England in November 1994; The New York Bottom Line Christmas Eve Show in 1994; and at McCabe's in Los Angeles February 11 and 12, 1995. Both The Tonight Show and the Late Show with David Letterman staffs heavily pursued Nyro for a TV appearance during this period, yet she turned them down as well, citing her discomfort with appearing on television (she made only a handful of early TV appearances and one fleeting moment on VH-1 performing the title song from Broken Rainbow on Earth Day in 1990). According to producer Gary Katz, she also turned down a request to be the musical guest on the 1993 season opener of Saturday Night Live.Denny Sanders, \\"Meet the Man Behind 'the Dan'\\" (Gary Katz interview), The Telos Alliance, July 12, 2016. She never released an official video, although there was talk of filming some The Bottom Line appearances in the 1990s. =Personal life= Nyro was bisexual, though this fact was only known to her closest friends.https://ew.com/article/1997/04/25/laura-nyros-legacy-passion/ She had a relationship with singer/songwriter Jackson Browne in late 1970 to early 1971. Browne was Nyro's opening act at the time.Kort, Michele. Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 122-123. Nyro married Vietnam War veteran David Bianchini in October 1971Lawson, Dawn. \\"Nyro, Laura\\", American National Biography Online June 2000 Update. Retrieved July 31, 2014. after a whirlwind romance and spent the next three years living with him in a small town in Massachusetts. The marriage ended after three years, during which time she had grown accustomed to rural life, as opposed to the life in the city, where she had recorded her first five records. After Nyro split from Bianchini in 1975, she suffered the trauma of the death of her mother Gilda to ovarian cancer at the age of 49. She consoled herself largely by recording a new album, enlisting Charlie Calello, with whom she had collaborated on Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. In 1978, a short-lived relationship with Harindra Singh produced a son, Gil Bianchini (also known as musician Gil-T), who she gave the surname of her ex-husband. In the early 1980s, Nyro began living with painter Maria Desiderio (1954‚Äì1999),Connecticut Department of Health. Connecticut Death Index, 1949‚Äì2001 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2003. a relationship that lasted 17 years, the rest of Nyro's life. Nyro was a feminist and openly discussed it on a number of occasions, once saying, \\"I may bring a certain feminist perspective to my songwriting, because that's how I see life.\\" By the late 1980s, Nyro had become an animal rights activist and vegetarian, and began to offer literature on the subject at her concerts. =Death= In late 1996, Nyro, like her mother, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After the diagnosis, Columbia Records, with Nyro's involvement, prepared a two-CD retrospective of material from her years at the label. She lived to see the release of Stoned Soul Picnic: The Best of Laura Nyro in 1997. She died of ovarian cancer in Danbury, Connecticut, on April 8, 1997, at 49, the same age at which her mother died. Her ashes were scattered beneath a maple tree on the grounds of her house in Danbury.Kort, Michelle. Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 262. Legacy =Posthumous releases= Nyro's posthumous releases include Angel In The Dark (2001), which includes her final studio recordings made in 1994 and 1995, and The Loom's Desire (2002), a set of live recordings with solo piano and harmony singers from The Bottom Line Christmas shows of 1993 and 1994. =Influence= Nyro's influence on popular musicians has also been acknowledged by such artists as Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Tori Amos, Patti Smith, Kate Bush, Diamanda Galas, Bette Midler, Rickie Lee Jones, Elton John, Jackson Browne, Alice Cooper, Elvis Costello, Cyndi Lauper, Todd Rundgren, Steely Dan, Sarah Cracknell, Melissa Manchester, Lisa Germano, and Rosanne Cash. Todd Rundgren stated that once he heard her, he \\"stopped writing songs like The Who and started writing songs like Laura.\\" Cyndi Lauper acknowledged that her rendition of the song \\"Walk On By\\", on her Grammy Award-nominated 2003 cover album At Last, was inspired by Nyro. Elton John and Elvis Costello discussed Nyro's influence on both of them during the premiere episode of Costello's interview show Spectacle. When asked by the host if he could name three great performer/songwriters who have largely been ignored, he cited Nyro as one of his choices. Elton John also addressed Nyro's influence on his 1970 song \\"Burn Down the Mission\\", from Tumbleweed Connection, in particular. \\"I idolized her,\\" he concluded. \\"The soul, the passion, just the out and out audacity of the way her rhythmic and melody changes came was like nothing I've heard before.\\" Bruce Arnold, leader of the pioneering soft rock group Orpheus was a fan of Nyro's music and like her, worked with legendary studio drummer Bernard Purdie. While recording with Purdie, Arnold mentioned his love of Nyro's music; the drummer responded with a story about Nyro: At Nyro's home one night in the late 1970s, Purdie mentioned that he had been the uncredited drummer for Orpheus. Nyro got excited and brought him into a room where she kept her record collection. She pulled out well-worn copies of every Orpheus LP, as well as copies sealed for posterity. Diane Paulus and Bruce Buschel co-created Eli's Comin', a musical revue of the songs of Nyro, which, among others, starred Anika Noni Rose. Louis Greenstein and Kate Ferber wrote \\"One Child Born: The Music of Laura Nyro,\\" a one-woman show featuring Ferber and directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt. \\"One Child Born\\" was developed at CAP21 in New York City and has sold out Joe's Pub and the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York, World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, and other venues. The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the National Ballet of Canada have also included her music in their performances; notably, \\"Been On A Train\\" from Christmas and the Beads of Sweat, in which a woman describes watching her lover die from a drug overdose, comprises the second movement of Ailey's 1971 solo for Judith Jamison, Cry. On October 2, 2007, three-time Tony nominee Judy Kuhn released her new album Serious Playground: The Songs of Laura Nyro. The album, which debuted as a concert to a sold-out house at Lincoln Center's American Songbook Series in January 2007, includes several of Nyro's biggest hits (\\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\", \\"Stoney End\\") as well as some of her lesser known gems. In 1992, English shoegaze/Britpop band Lush released a song about Laura Nyro (\\"Laura\\") on their first full-length album Spooky. Several of the band's songs (specifically those written by Emma Anderson) have echoed Nyro's music in their titles ‚Äì \\"When I Die\\", \\"Single Girl\\". More recently, in 2012, Anderson has referred to Laura Nyro as \\"wondrous\\" on her Twitter account. On her 2006 album Build a Bridge, the operatic/Broadway soprano Audra McDonald included covers of Nyro's songs \\"To a Child\\" and \\"Tom Cat Goodbye\\". The musical theater composer Stephen Schwartz credits Nyro as a major influence on his work. Alice Cooper has mentioned on his syndicated radio show that Laura Nyro is one of his favorite songwriters. Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley, when promoting her 2006 solo album Rabbit Fur Coat repeatedly cited Nyro's 1971 album Gonna Take a Miracle as a big influence on her music. Lewis performed the first track on that album \\"I Met Him on a Sunday\\" on the Rabbit Fur Coat tour. On the 2004 drama film A Home at the End of the World can be heard Nyro's recordings of \\"D√©siree\\" and \\"It's Gonna Take a Miracle\\", both songs from the album Gonna Take a Miracle. Paul Shaffer, bandleader for the CBS Orchestra and sidekick on the Late Show with David Letterman, stated that his desert island album would be Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. Paul Stanley of Kiss has mentioned on several occasions that he is a big admirer of Nyro's music. Exene Cervenka of the punk rock band X listed Nyro as one her favorite songwriters. =Biographies, analyses and tributes= On October 27, 1997, a large-scale tribute concert was produced by women at the Beacon Theatre in New York. Performers included Rickie Lee Jones, Sandra Bernhard, Toshi Reagon, and Phoebe Snow. Michele Kort, Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro, Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press, 2002 And a World To Carry On, an original tribute show celebrating the music and life of Laura Nyro, written by Barry Silber and Carole Coppinger, was first performed in 2008 (2nd performance late August 2015) at Carrollwood Players Theatre in Tampa, Fla. To Carry On, an original tribute show celebrating the music and life of Laura Nyro, starring Mimi Cohen, is in its second return engagement as of January 19, 2011, at Cherry Lane Theatre in Manhattan. A biography of Nyro, Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro, written by Michele Kort, was published in 2002 by Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press. An analysis of Nyro's music by music theorist Ari Shagal was written at the University of Chicago in 2003, linking Nyro's work to the Great American Songbook by demonstrating the similarities between her chordal language and those of Harold Arlen, Harry Warren, and George Shearing. Nyro's life and music were celebrated in a 2005 BBC Radio 2 documentary, Shooting Star ‚Äì Laura Nyro Remembered, which was narrated by her friend Bette Midler and included contributions from her one-time manager David Geffen, co-producers Arif Mardin and Gary Katz, and performers Suzanne Vega and Janis Ian. It was rebroadcast on April 4, 2006. Janis Ian, who attended the High School of Music and Art in New York at the same time as Nyro, discussed her friendship with Nyro during the late 1960s in her autobiography, Society's Child. Ian described her as looking like a \\"Morticia Addams\\" caricature with her long, dark hair, and called her a \\"brilliant songwriter\\" but \\"oddly inarticulate\\" in terms of musical terminology. Ian was a fan of Nyro's work with producer Charlie Calello and chose him as the producer of her 1969 album Who Really Cares on the basis of his work with Nyro.Ian, Janis. Society's Child: My Autobiography. New York: Tarcher, 2008, p. 99. Comedian, writer, and singer Sandra Bernhard has spoken extensively of Laura Nyro as an ongoing inspiration. She dedicated a song, \\"The Woman I Could've Been\\" on Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One), to her. She also sang Nyro's \\"I Never Meant to Hurt You\\" in her film Without You I'm Nothing. Rickie Lee Jones's album Pirates and songs such as \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Living It Up\\" are reminiscent of early Laura Nyro songs, and Jones acknowledged Nyro's influence. Todd Rundgren has also acknowledged the strong influence of Nyro's 1960s music on his own songwriting. While a member of the pop group Nazz, his great admiration for Nyro led him to arrange a meeting with her (which took place shortly after she had recorded the Eli and the Thirteenth Confession LP). Nyro invited Rundgren to become the musical director of her backing group, but his commitments to Nazz obliged him to decline. Rundgren's debut solo album Runt (1970) includes the strongly Nyro- influenced \\"Baby Let's Swing\\" which was written about her and mentions her by name. Rundgren and Nyro remained friends for much of her professional career and he subsequently assisted her with the recording of her album Mother's Spiritual. On April 14, 2012, Laura Nyro was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction speech was delivered by singer Bette Midler and the award was accepted by her son, Gil Bianchini. The song \\"Stoney End\\" was performed by singer Sara Bareilles at the induction ceremony. A hybrid daylily named for Laura Nyro was introduced in 2000. The Scottish band Cosmic Rough Riders released a touching tribute song, \\"Laura Nyro,\\" on their 2001 album Pure Escapism. The song \\"Mean Streets\\" by the band Tennis is a tribute to Nyro. On July 22, 2014, composer/arranger Billy Childs released Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro. The album features ten Laura Nyro songs performed by a long list of stars including Rickie Lee Jones, Shawn Colvin, Alison Krauss, Dianne Reeves, and Wayne Shorter. The album was nominated for three Grammys, with the \\"New York Tendaberry\\" track featuring Renee Fleming and Yo-Yo Ma winning for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals. In 2015, The Christine Spero Group released \\"Spero Plays Nyro\\", the Music of Laura Nyro along with a highly acclaimed live tour. The album features eleven of Nyro's songs and an original song, \\"Laura and John\\" by Christine Spero, a tribute to Laura Nyro and John Coltrane, whom Nyro admired.

Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins. It allows the co-mingling of physical reality with virtual reality (VR) and human intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI). Individuals may find themselves, for different reasons, more in tune or involved with the hyperreal world and less with the physical real world. Some famous theorists of hyperreality/hyperrealism include Jean Baudrillard, Albert Borgmann, Daniel J. Boorstin, Neil Postman and Umberto Eco. Origins and usage The postmodern semiotic concept of \\"hyperreality\\" was contentiously coined by French sociologist Jean Baudrillard in Simulacra and Simulation. Baudrillard defined \\"hyperreality\\" as \\"the generation by models of a real without origin or reality\\"; hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. According to Baudrillard, the commodities in this theoretical state do not have use-value as defined by Karl Marx but can be understood as signs as defined by Ferdinand de Saussure. He believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard borrows, from Jorge Luis Borges' \\"On Exactitude in Science\\" (already borrowed from Lewis Carroll), the example of a society whose cartographers create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape. He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal. Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by phenomenology, semiotics, and Marshall McLuhan. Baudrillard and Eco explained that it is \\"the unlimited existence of \\"hyperreal\\" numbers or \\"non-standard reals\\", infinite and infinitesimal, that cluster about assumedly fixed or real numbers and factor through transference differentials.\\" Baudrillard, however, challenges McLuhan's famous statement that the 'medium is the message', by suggesting that information devours its own content. He also suggested that there is a difference between the media and reality and what they represent. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies.Zompetti, J. P., & Moffitt, M. A. (2008). Revisiting Concepts of Public Relations Audience Through Postmodern Concepts of Metanarrative, Decentered Subject, and Reality/Hyperreality. Journal of Promotion Management, 14(3/4), 275-291. doi:10.1080/10496490802623762. However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: \\"There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined\\".Laughey, D. (2010). Key themes in media theory. Maidenhead: Open University Press. American author Micah Dunham explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real. Linked to contemporary western culture Umberto Eco and post-structuralists would argue, that in current cultures fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular sign-systems.  Significance  Hyperreality is significant as a paradigm to explain current cultural conditions. Consumerism, because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word), fulfillment or happiness is found through simulation and imitation of a transient simulacrum of reality, rather than any interaction with any \\"real\\" reality. While hyperreality is not a relatively new concept, its effects are more relevant today than when it was first conceptualized. This is attributed to the way it effectively captured the postmodern condition, particularly how people in the postmodern world seek stimulation by creating unreal worlds of spectacle and seduction and nothing more. There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. Daniel J. Boorstin cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, \\"we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great\\". He bemoans the loss of old heroes like Moses, Ulysses S. Grant, Aeneas, Jesus, Julius Caesar, Muhammed, Joan of Arc, William Shakespeare, George Washington, Napoleon, and Abraham Lincoln, who did not have public relations (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves. The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism. The danger in the pursuit of stimulation and seduction emerge not in the lack of meaning but, as Baudrillard maintained, \\"we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us.\\" Hyperreality, some sources point out, may provide insights into the postmodern movement by analyzing how simulations disrupt the binary opposition between reality and illusion but it does not address or resolve the contradictions inherent in this tension. Key relational themes Simulation/Simulacra: The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by Jean Baudrillard in his book Simulacra and Simulation. The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality. =Simulation= Simulation is characterized by a blending of 'reality' and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; \\"It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.\\" Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc. =Simulacrum= The simulacrum is often defined as a copy with no original, or as Gilles Deleuze (1990) describes it, \\"the simulacrum is an image without resemblance\\". Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right. He created four steps of reproduction: (1) basic reflection of reality, (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretense of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which \\"bears no relation to any reality whatsoever\\".  Definitions  * \\"A real without origin or reality\\" ‚Äì Jean BaudrillardBaudrillard, Simulacra and Simulation, p. 1. * \\"The authentic fake.\\" ‚Äì Umberto Eco  Quotations  \\"Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory‚Äîprecession of simulacra‚Äîit is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map.\\" ‚Äî Jean Baudrillard, \\"The Precession of Simulacra,\\" Simulacra and Simulation  Examples  = Disneyland = Both Umberto Eco and Jean Baudrillard refer to Disneyland as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look \\"absolutely realistic\\", taking visitors' imagination to a \\"fantastic past\\".Umberto Eco, Travels In Hyperreality, New York, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986, p. 43. This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere \\"can give us more reality than nature can\\".Eco, Travels In Hyperreality, p. 44. The \\"fake nature\\" of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life. The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour. When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy \\"the real thing\\" and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland's doors.Eco, Travels In Hyperreality, p. 48. In his work Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard argues the \\"imaginary world\\" of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as \\"imaginary\\" to make people believe that all its surroundings are \\"real\\". But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called \\"real\\". This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and \\"concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle.\\"Jean Baudrillard, \\"Simulacra and Simulations,\\" in Selected Writings, Mark Poster, ed. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988, pp. 166-184. > \\"The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence > machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. > Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary.

It was the founding member of the university's modern collegiate system, and its non-denominationalism contrasted with contemporary colleges such as Trinity College and St. Michael's College, both of which later became part of the University of Toronto. University College is one of two places in the University of Toronto that has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada, along with Annesley Hall of Victoria College. It is home to the oldest student government in Canada, the Literary and Athletic Society.  History  University College, c. 1860 Shortly after taking power in the first responsible government of the Province of Canada, Reformist politicians led by Robert Baldwin wrested control of King's College from the Church of England in 1849 and renamed it the University of Toronto. Baldwin envisioned that denominational colleges would soon decide to affiliate themselves under the secular University of Toronto \\"with some vague status, perhaps as divinity halls\\".Friedland, p. 24 His hopes were dashed when the Presbyterian Queen's College in Kingston opted to stay independent. Baldwin resigned as premier in 1851, leaving his successor, Francis Hincks, to find another way to persuade the denominational colleges. Hincks decided that the university should adopt the collegiate university governance model, used for centuries at Oxbridge and more recently at the University of London. On 22 April 1853, University College was created as the Provincial College, and it retains that designation in the current University of Toronto Act. It was the first constituent college of the University of Toronto, inheriting the teaching functions and resources of the former King's College, while the university itself became an examination body. Frederick William Cumberland was appointed in 1856 as the university architect to design and oversee the construction of the college's new building, completed in 1859. Until Wycliffe College joined the university in 1889, University College was the only member college within the University of Toronto, and therefore the principal of the college was also the de facto chief of the entire university. The following year, Knox College and Victoria College also joined the University of Toronto. The University College fire of 1890, Dominion Illustrated University College was severely damaged by a fire that gutted the entire eastern wing and the college library on 14 February 1890. The fire spread rapidly when servants accidentally dropped two kerosene lamps on a wooden staircase at around 7 p.m. while preparing the illumination for an annual college exhibition. In Ottawa, Edward Blake, the university's chancellor and a member of parliament, interrupted his speech to inform the House of Commons, \\"The great institution, the crown and glory, I may be permitted to say, of the educational institutions in our country is at the moment in flames ... and is now, so far as its material fabric goes, a ruin tottering to the ground.\\"Friedland, p. 149 Only about 100 books were rescued before the fire consumed more than 33,000 volumes at the college library. Despite the initial fears, University College recovered from the fire with remarkable ease and speed.Friedland, p. 157 Wycliffe College and Knox College both offered space for classes to accommodate displaced students.Friedland, p. 152 The board of trustees commissioned a swift restoration of the structure with insurance compensations and additional investments. Within two years, the library was replenished with donations from institutions throughout the British Empire. The main building of University College, a National Historic Site since 1968 On 15 February 1895, more than seven hundred University College students attended what was then described as the \\"largest mass meeting in the history of the University\\" to discuss the government's dismissal of William Dale, the popular professor of Latin at the college.Q&A;: What made the \\"blood fairly boil\\" in U of T student and future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1895? William Lyon Mackenzie King, a senior undergraduate who would later become Prime Minister of Canada, introduced a successful motion at the meeting to \\"abstain from attendance at lectures at University College until a proper investigation be granted by the provincial government into the difficulties existing at the university.\\" During the boycott of classes, professor of history George MacKinnon Wrong wrote to Chancellor Blake in England that only one student turned up at one of his lectures. The strike continued until 20 February, when students voted to return to classes after the government agreed to call a commission of inquiry. In 1968, University College was designated a National Historic Site, in recognition of its historical role in creating the collegiate system at the University of Toronto, and as one of the earliest examples of the collegiate model at universities in the Commonwealth.Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada, Minutes, June 1968 and 1970.University College, 15 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Formally Recognized: 1968/11/28 ID 9520  Grounds and architecture  Croft Chapter House The main building of University College was built between 1856 and 1859, designed by architects Frederick William Cumberland and William George Storm. The selection of architectural styles was the result of \\"a tangle of disagreements and concessions, political as well as artistic\\",Bissell p. 22 including the college's emphasis on freedom from denominational control.Bissell p. 132Simmins p. 93 Cumberland met the requirements asked of him after taking part on a research and experience based trip to Europe in February 1856: \\"This course of action was consistent with Victorian architectural practice when new public buildings were being planned, which was to carefully study applicable building forms and adapt them, to the requirements of the job at hand.Simmins p. 95 The design committee led by Cumberland initially designed a Gothic structure, but Governor General Edmund Walker Head disliked the style and suggested Italian instead, later changing his preference to Byzantine.Friedland p. 57 Detail of an ornate arch over the south entrance The East Wing was swiftly restored after suffering extensive fire damage in 1890. The design committee would eventually include Norman, Romanesque Revival, and \\"faint traces of Byzantium and the Italian palazzo\\" styles in the design. In particular, the Byzantine, Norman and early English styles were deemed \\"fitting for educational institutions\\".Bissell p. 23 Cumberland chose Norman Romanesque as the main influence because he thought it was the most appreciate for the topography in Canada. To achieve a picturesque approach, Cumberland ignored the classical symmetry and deliberately gave an asymmetrical architectural expression. The building was an unconventional combination of varied parts incorporating British design for educational structures in England and Ireland. Like most Romanesque buildings, University College has extremely thick masonry walls, built of many types of brick and stone layered upon each other. The main materials include wood, stone, brick, slate, iron, mortar, and tile. Only about one third of the exterior is stone, with the rest being a very pale yellow brick produced at a brickyard on Yonge Street.Friedland p. 62 University College has the characteristic arched and rounded windows as well as huge, cavernous facades. A major feature of University College is arches laid out in series and sets. The arches are semicircular, and consist of small columns that provide the structural support to hold up vaults on the side of walkways. There is much ornamentation, especially in the form of stone carvings, liberally applied on the walls, arches, columns and fa√ßades of the building. Carved images include nature, animals, mysterious creatures as well as the college shield and motto. The building also features several stained glass windows, including the rose window by Robert McCausland. Inside the college quadrangle Some of the basic original layout plans remain at University College today. The focal point of the structure is at the south fa√ßade, where the stone tower at the center of the composition contains the main entrance of the college. The quadrangle and cloisters are enclosed within elaborately carved walls faced with stone, \\"felicitously sited amid landscaped grounds\\".Simmins p. 103 Until the Laidlaw Wing was completed in the 1960s, University College was a U-shaped structure that was open on the north end. Before the fire of 1890, the building was laid out such that the east wing provided access to the convocation hall, the museum and the library, and contained an entrance to the quadrangle. Residences and dining halls, classrooms, and public reading rooms were on the west range of the structure. The chemistry laboratory was relocated at the southwest range, in the present Croft Chapter House, because it was more logical than in the first study which was in the north. Today, the west wing is no longer used as living quarters, which are now provided by the college's three dedicated residential halls, while the convocation functions have long since been moved to Convocation Hall. = Revitalization = The historic University College building is currently undergoing a major revitalization, which will return the College library to its original location at the front of the building. The revitalization began in January 2018 and will improve the accessibility of the building once complete. Important highlights of the revitalization include the relocation of the library to the East Hall, a new reading room in the West Hall, a conference centre in Croft Chapter House, and a cafe located on the third floor of the building.  Academics  The University College Council is the college's governing body, overseeing administrative, budgetary and academic matters. The principal, in addition to chairing the College Council, serves as the chief executive of the college. Student are represented on the College Council by the leaders of the Literary and Athletic Society and eight additional students. University College houses several academic programs within the University of Toronto, further varied by major, minor and specialist concentrations, including Canadian studies, cognitive science, drama, health studies, and sexual diversity studies.Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto The college houses a number of visiting fellows who take residence and office at the college. The Laidlaw Wing houses the modern college library, in addition to the University of Toronto Art Centre. University College hosts five sets of annual public lecture series. The Alexander Lectures, founded in 1928 and named for English professor W.J. Alexander, focuses on literature over four successive lectures.University College Public Lecture Series , University College Public Lectures Committee The Graham Lectures, established in 1930, explores scientific topics from astronomy to zoology in a non-technical manner. The F.E.L. Priestley Memorial Lectures in the History of Ideas are interdisciplinary, encompassing topics in social science and humanities such as literature, economics, history, geography, philosophy, theology, science, political science, as well as applied fields such as business, law, and medicine. The Stubbs Lecture, founded in 1988, focuses on Greek, Latin, or English literature. The Teetzel Lectures concentrates on art and architecture over three successive days. The Laidlaw Library is the main library of University College. Although the college had a general-interest library before the fire of 1890, the modern Laidlaw Library is specialized in subjects related to the college's in-house academic programs in the humanities and social sciences. It comprises a main collection of 35,000 volumes and secondary collections in literature and poetry. Student life and traditions Sir Daniel Wilson Residence Whitney Hall (built 1930‚Äì31), women's residence designed by John M. Lyle =Legend of Diabolos and Reznikoff= The famous ghost story of the University College, started from the carving \\"Crocodiles and vermin\\". The sculptor was a Russian, named Ivan Reznikoff. It is said that he was buried in the northeast corner of the quadrangle. Since then, his ghost has been seen at regular intervals. The newel in the east staircase is a wooden Griffin. The griffin is a magical creature that is a mix of a lion and an eagle. Some students believe that touching the Griffin will bring good luck, such as passing their exams with great marks. Diabolos' is University College's not-for-profit coffee bar that has been overseen by the Lit and student-run since 1966. It provides fair trade coffee, tea, vegan and vegetarian products to University College students. It is located in University College's Junior Common Room and is open Monday to Thurs 8:30am ‚Äì 6pm and Friday 8:30am ‚Äì 4pm. =Literary and Athletic Society= The University College Union The University College Literary and Athletic Society, colloquially known as the 'Lit', is the oldest student government in Canada dating back to 1854. Established in 1854 as the Literary and Scientific Society and renamed The University College Literary and Athletic Society in 1921 it merged with the University College Women's Undergraduate Association in 1958 to become representative of all students attending the college.University of Toronto ‚Äì University College Literary & Athletic Society ‚Äì Welcome Home Every student of University College is a member of the society. The Lit's mandate is to provide services, host events, facilitate student involvement, represent the student body, and foster a sense of community among students in the college. The Lit is also responsible for the student-run Diabolos' coffee bar, and the annual Fireball formal, commemorating the 1890 fire which destroyed the college. They also provide some support for Orientation Week, a week dedicated to help first-year students transition into university. The Gargoyle, established in 1954, is the student newspaper of University College, named after the gargoyle statue in the college building. It is staffed by an editorial collective of undergraduate students, as well as a group of staff and regular contributors. =Residential halls= The college cloisters The college's three residence buildings hold about 720 students, and are fully co-ed, although Whitney started out as the women's residence and Sir Daniel Wilson's as the men's. The current Sir Daniel Wilson Hall was built in 1954, and the original Whitney Hall was built in 1931. A third residence, Morrison Hall, was added in 2005. Demand for places is high for a number of reasons: most rooms are singles, the community life is accepting and diverse and most main academic buildings are right across the street. Off-campus students can participate in the residence community life by becoming associate members of one of the houses. There are a total of fifteen residential divisions, known as \\"houses\\", in the residences. There are six houses within the Sir Daniel Wilson Residence: Jeanneret, Taylor, Wallace, Hutton, Loudon, and McCaul. In addition, there are four houses within the Whitney Residence: Cody, Mulock, Falconer, and Ferguson. Finally, there are five houses in Morrison Hall: Landsberg-Lewis, Perron, Wolfe, Bratty, and Langley.https://www.uc.utoronto.ca/housing Hutton House is named after Maurice Hutton, a University College, University of Toronto classics professor. He also acted as Principal of University College, University of Toronto from 1901 to 1928. During 1906 and 1907 he was acting President of the university.Residence Handbook, 2009‚Äì2010  Principals  In March 2019, Professor Markus Stock was appointed to be the 17th Principal of University College. His term will begin 1 January 2020 and will conclude on 30 June 2024. Stock replaces Donald Ainslie who has served as Principal since 2011.

He convinced the Connecticut Assembly to exempt Yale from paying taxes. He opened a second college house and doubled the size of the college; Yale graduated more students than Harvard beginning in 1756.Kimball, Bruce A., The True Professional Ideal in America: A History, Rowman & Littlefield, 1996; Appendix 2 He introduced Enlightenment math and science and Johnson's moral philosophy into the curriculum, while retaining its Puritan theology. He also helped found the Linonian Society in 1753, a literary and debating society and one of Yale's oldest secret societies. He personally built the first Orrery in America, a milestone of American science, and awarded his friend Benjamin Franklin an honorary degree. His educational accomplishments were marred by many political, theological, and polity conflicts, with first the New Light faction in Connecticut, then the Anglicans, then the Old Light faction. He fought with the Connecticut Assembly, the Yale board, and finally, with his own tutors and students. He was forced to resign as president of Yale in 1765 and died soon after. Early life Clap was born in Scituate, Massachusetts, and studied with Rev. James McSparran, a missionary to Narragansett from the \\"Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts\\", and with Rev. Nathiel Eells, of Scituate. He entered Harvard University (then known as Harvard College) at age 15, graduating in 1722. He preached at Windham, Connecticut, in 1725 and was ordained to succeed the Rev. Samuel Whiting as minister there in 1726, marrying Rev. Whiting's daughter Mary in 1727, and remaining 14 years with a ministry marked by a rather severe orthodoxy (he once traveled to Springfield to oppose the ordination of a minister accused of Arminian tendencies). Early years of reform and religious conflict at Yale He was elected rector of Yale College following Elisha Williams's resignation, largely because the trustees believed he would oppose Arminianism at Yale, and was inducted in 1740. His administration was to become known for its orthodoxy, pugnaciousness, authoritarianism, and embroilment in controversy.Kelley, Brooks Mather. (1999). Yale: A History, p. 49. In 1743, his nephew Nathan Whiting, whom he and his wife Mary had raised after the death of his parents, graduated from Yale. He was learned both in theology and in science and constructed the first orrery in America. After the death of his first wife he married Mary Haynes on February 5, 1740 or 1741. He was known as a \\"rigid\\",Dexter, Dexter, Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale College, Holt, 1896;, Volume 1, p. 724 \\"dogmatic and obstinate\\" leader who used \\"autocratic methods\\" to impose discipline at the college.Holden, Reuben Andrus, and Holden, Raymond Peckham,Profiles and Portraits of Yale University Presidents, Published by Bond Wheelwright Co, 1968 His religious views and personality led to conflict within the school: he objected to the teachings of English minister George Whitefield, an itinerant minister of the Great Awakening, and other itinerant teachers such as Gilbert Tennent. Rev. Joseph Noyes, pastor in New Haven, invited James Davenport to his congregation to preach: Davenport used the opportunity to brand him an \\"unconverted man\\" and a \\"hypocrite\\": the congregation was eventually physically split, resulting in the two Congregational Churches that still stand on the New Haven Green. In 1741, two masters' candidates at Yale were denied their degrees for their \\"disorderly and reckless endeavors to propagate\\" the Great Awakening, and the college made it an offence for a student to imply that the rector, trustees, or tutors were \\"carnal or unconverted men\\" or \\"hypocrites\\". It was not long before a student, David Brainerd, did so, saying that Tutor Whittelsey \\"had no more grace than a chair\\", and was expelled. Jonathan Edwards, Rev. Aaron Burr (father of the vice-president), and Jonathan Dickinson unsuccessfully appealed for Brainerd's reinstatement. Clap campaigned for laws to inhibit itinerant preachers and lay exhorters and to stop the disintegration of churches by separation. Religious disputation continued to fragment to student body, who refused to submit to discipline, avoided religious instruction from the \\"Old Lights\\" (preachers established before the Great Awakening), and attended separatist meetings. In 1742, Clap closed the college, sending the students home. He was supported by the General Assembly, and many of the more ardent students transferred to other institutions when Yale reopened in 1743. While he was feuding with the New Lights, Clap was partnering with the Anglicans. Beginning in 1740, he worked with the Rev. Samuel Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, to reform Yale. He brought math and science into Yale's curriculum, and undergraduate studies in divinity were replaced by Johnson's non-denominational moral philosophy. Clap published a Yale library catalog in 1743, with an index system based on his friend Samuel Johnson's map of learning, and drafted a new charter of the school, granted by the General Assembly in 1745, incorporating the institution as \\"The President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven\\".Baldwin, Ebenezer. Annals of Yale College, in New Haven, Connecticut, from Its Foundation, to the Year 1831. Hezekiah Howe (1831), pp. 56-73. Clap was sworn in as Yale's first President on June 1, 1745. His formulation of a new code of laws for Yale in Latin became, in 1745, the first book printed in New Haven.Sprague, William B. Annals of the American Pulpit. Robert Carter and Brothers (1857), Vol. I, p. 345. Whitefield returned to New England to preach, and Yale issued \\"The Declaration of the Rector and Tutors of Yale College against the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, his Principles and Designs, in a Letter to him\\". In 1746, Clap expelled Samuel Cooke from the Yale Corporation for his role in setting up the separatist congregation in New Haven. In May 1747, the General Assembly granted Yale the right to hold a lottery to raise funds: this income, together with the proceeds from the sale of a French boat captured by the colony's frigate, were used to build Connecticut Hall, the second major structure at Yale. It was completed in 1753. Later religious conflict Frontispiece, The Annals or History of Yale College in New Haven, in the Colony of Connecticut, by Yale President Thomas Clap, 1766. Volume carries notation: \\"Given to the Library of Yale College by Ezra Stiles 1785.\\" Clap, meanwhile, was concerned by the poor preaching of Joseph Noyes and by the initiation of Anglican services in New Haven. To avoid loss of students to the College of New Jersey (now Princeton), founded by those who had defended Brainerd's expulsion, and to defend orthodoxy, he convinced the trustees to appoint him as professor of divinity and to authorize separate worship for the students each Sunday. Both the Old Lights and the Episcopalians objected to this. In 1753, Rev. Samuel Johnson wrote to Clap that were he to continue with separate worship, the Episcopalians would complain, and that the charter of 1745 would be found to be invalid, as only the King could make a corporation, and that Yale would cease to exist. Clap agreed to let the Anglican students attend their own church. Perhaps more important to Clap than questions of religion, the New Lights increased their political power in the Connecticut Assembly and the state established Congregational Church. In 1754, Thomas Fitch, an outspoken Old Light, was elected governor, while William Pitkin, who supported the New Lights, was elected deputy governor, and almost all the Connecticut Congregationalist associations and consociations had New Light majorities.Grasso, Christopher, A Speaking Aristocracy: Transforming Public Discourse in Eighteenth-century Connecticut, UNC Press Books, 1999, p. 153 Meanwhile, there were conflicts within the Corporation. Benjamin Gale, son-in-law of Jared Eliot, a corporation member, had published a pamphlet arguing for discontinuation of the colonial grant to the college, and no grant was given in 1755. Clap set out to raise an endowment for a professorship of divinity, and Naphtali Daggett was appointed the Livingstonian Professor of Divinity on March 4, 1756. Noyes offered to share his pulpit with the new professor, agreeing to subscribe to the Assembly's Catechism and the Savoy Confession of Faith, and the students returned to his First Church for worship. Clap, however, became disenchanted with Noyes' Old Light orthodoxy and poor preaching and obtained a decision that not only could Yale students worship separately, they could form their own congregation and administer Communion. The announcement of the corporation's decision on June 30, 1757, was bitterly controversial, and, in the aftermath, discipline at the college collapsed. The General Assembly intervened, threatened a Yale \\"visitation\\". Despite being now distrusted by both Old and New Light factions, Clap's defense of the college as separate from the state caused the assembly to ultimately side with Clap. He was not so successful with his own tutors and students. The student body was caught up in the rebellious spirit of the 1760s, resolving to drink no \\"foreign spiritous Liquors any more\\" and declaiming in chapel against the British Parliament, and petitioning the Corporation with their grievances, insisting on the removal of the disciplinarian Clap. The students stopped going to classes and prayers and generally abused the tutors, who resigned. The corporation ordered an early spring vacation, and few undergraduates returned. President Clap offered his resignation at the corporation meeting in July 1766. He continued as the head of Yale until commencement on September 10, 1766, when he presided over his last commencement, delivered his valedictory address, and resigned.Kelley, p. 68.

The family includes the largest dragonflies found in North America and Europe and among the largest dragonflies on the planet. Description Common worldwide or nearly worldwide genera are Aeshna and Anax. The African Anax tristis has a wingspan over 125 mm, making it one of the world's largest known dragonflies. The 41 North American species in 11 genera are represented in this family. Most European species belong to Aeshna. Their American name \\"darner\\" stems from the female abdomens looking like a sewing needle, as they cut into plant stem when they lay their eggs through the ovipositor. The dragonflies mate in flight. The eggs are deposited in water or close by. The larvae (nymphs or naiads) are generally slender compared to those of other families, with a long and flat extensible lower lip (labium). The larvae are aquatic predators, feeding on other insects and even small fish. The adults spend large amounts of time in the air and seem to fly tirelessly with their four large and powerful wings. They can fly forwards or backwards or hover like a helicopter. The wings are always extended horizontally. Their abdomens are long and thin. Most are colored blue and or green, with black and occasionally yellow. Their large, hemispherical, compound eyes touch in the midline and nearly cover their heads. They have an extremely good sight, and are voracious insect predators, using their sharp, biting mouthparts. They are, therefore, very beneficial. All are extremely hard to catch because of their flying abilities and keen sight. A proposal has been made to split this family into Aeshnidae and Telephlebiidae.(Hawking & Theischinger, 1999) The name may have resulted from a printer's error in spelling the Greek Aechma, \\"a spear\\". The spelling Aeschnidae has been intermittently used over a period of time, but is now abandoned for the original name Aeshnidae. However, derived genus names (such as Rhionaeschna) retain the 'sch' spelling, as this is how they were first cited. Genera See also * List of dragonflies (Aeshnidae) References *Silsby, Jill (2001).

Historically, Êùé was officially written as Ni () For example, F. C.

The spelling officially changed to I () in 1933 when the initial sound rule () was established. In North Korea, it is romanized as Ri () because there is no distinction between the alveolar liquids /l/ and /r/ in modern Korean. As of the South Korean census of 2015, there were 7,306,828 people by this name in South Korea or 14.7% of the population. Latin-alphabet spelling Though the official Revised Romanization spelling of this surname is I, South Korea's National Institute of the Korean Language noted in 2001 that one-letter surnames were quite rare in English and other foreign languages and could cause difficulties when traveling abroad. However, the NIKL still hoped to promote systemic transcriptions for use in passports, and thus recommended that people who bore this surname should spell it Yi in the Roman alphabet. However, the majority of South Koreans with this surname continue to spell it as Lee, because conditions for changing passport name is strict. In a study based on 2007 application data for South Korean passports, it was found that 98.5% of people with this surname spelled it in Latin letters as Lee in their passports, while only 1.0% spelled it Yi. A few people with this surname historically spelled it Ye, as in Ye Wanyong of the Korean Empire. Rhee has also been used, as in Syngman Rhee and Simon Hang-bock Rhee. Clans A memorial for the founder of the Gyeongju Yi clan As with all Korean family names, the holders of the Yi surname are divided into different patrilineal clans, or lineages, known in Korean as bon-gwan, based on their ancestral seat. Most such clans trace their lineage back to a specific founder, and are generally not related to one another. This system was at its height under the yangban aristocracy of the Joseon Dynasty, but it remains in use today. There are approximately 241 such clans claimed by South Koreans. Most people with surname Yi () in Korea belong to either the Jeonju or Gyeongju clans. Also surname Yi () and Yi () each have a different clans. =Imperial household of the Jeonju clan= The Jeonju Yi family perform rites (jongmyo jerye) to honor their ancestors in an annual ceremony the Korean government has declared an Important Intangible Cultural Asset. This clan has direct imperial roots to the founding of the Joseon Dynasty. The founder of this clan was Yi Han, a native of Baekje who later married a Silla princess and became a high official of Silla. His 22nd- generation descendant, Taejo of Joseon, went on to found the Joseon Dynasty. The House of Yi ruled Joseon for 518 years between 1392 and 1910 and established many of the cultural, artistic and linguistic foundations for modern-day Korea. During its reign, the House of Yi consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea, encouraged the entrenchment of Korean Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society, imported and adapted Chinese culture, and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, science, literature, and technology. The House of Yi has left a substantial legacy to modern Korea; much of modern Korean etiquette, cultural norms, societal attitudes towards current issues, and the modern Korean language and its dialects derive from the culture and traditions of their ruling period. , the pretender to the Korean throne is Yi Seok, Crown Prince Imperial.\\"A Prince Nestled Once More in Korea's Embrace\\", The New York Times, May 20, 2006. Members of the different branches of Jeonju Yi family dominated Korean history until the formation of the current Republic of Korea. Many families claim membership in the House of Yi, but few actually descend from the royal lineage. The House of Yi, in conjunction to its royal status, has produced innumerable figures of extraordinary influences in politics, the sciences, the arts, finance, and academia. Many of these descendants play key roles in world politics, the sciences, the arts, finances, and academia today. Notable descendants include South Korea's first president Syngman Rhee, the inventor of the modern Korean alphabet, hangul, and renowned polymath King Sejong the Great; the founder of the Joseon dynasty, as well as modern Korea, King Taejo; among many others. =Gyeongju clan= The founder of the Gyeongju clan was Yi Alpyeong (), one of the village headmen who chose Bak Hyeokgeose as the first king of Silla. According to the Samguk Sagi, the Yi name was officially bestowed on the family by King Yuri around 9 CE. Notable present-day members of this clan include Lee Byung-chull, the founder of Samsung Group; Lee Kun- hee, the former Samsung CEO; and Lee Myung-bak, former president of South Korea.Han Jeong-gon (ÌïúÏ†ïÍ≥§) (2004-07-29) <Ïû¨Î≤åÍ∞Ä ÏñΩÌûàÍ≥† ÏÑ§ÌÇ® ÌòºÎß• 24ÌÉÑ> ÏÇºÏÑ±Í∑∏Î£π Ilyo Siisa, Vol. 445 The Gyeongju Yi clan, according to the 2000 South Korean census, numbered over 1.4 million individuals, making it the most numerous of the clans that bear the surname Yi.Surname Info. \\"I.\\" (Korean language site - \\"Ïù¥\\" is spelled phonetically as \\"I\\") The specific reference is at the very bottom of the main entry, under the section \\"[Ïù∏Íµ¨ (‰∫∫Âè£) - Í≤ΩÏ£º, ÏõîÏÑ±],\\" which gives both the 1985 census population of the clan at 1,217,279 individuals, and the 2000 population at 1,424,866 individuals. http://www.surname.info/i/gyeong_ju.html =Pyeongchang clan= The founder of the Pyeongchang clan was Yi Gwang, an official and military commander of the Goryeo period.

One reason for the military coup was the armed actions of the Montoneros and the ERP, but the target of the Operation Condor were also students, militants, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists and any citizens suspected to be left-wing activists, including Peronist guerrillas. The disappeared included those thought to be politically or ideologically a threat to the junta even vaguely, or contrary to the neoliberal economic policies dictated by Operation Condor. They were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the social and political opposition. Many members of the junta are currently in prison for crimes against humanity and genocide.  Overview  In the decades before the 1976 coup, the Argentinian military, supported by the Argentine establishment, opposed Juan Domingo Per√≥n's populist government and attempted a coup in 1951 and two in 1955 before succeeding in 1976. After taking control, the armed forces proscribed Peronism, a decision that triggered the organization of Peronist resistance in workplaces and trade unions, as the working classes sought to protect the economic and social improvements obtained under Per√≥n's rule. Soon after the coup, Peronist resistance began organizing in workplaces and trade unions as the working classes sought economic and social improvements. Over time, as democratic rule was partially restored, but promises of legalizing the expression and political liberties for Peronism were not respected, guerrilla groups began to operate in the 1960s, namely UturuncosSalas, Ernesto, Uturuncos. El origen de la guerrilla peronista, Biblos, Buenos Aires, 2003, and the EGP (People's Guerrilla Army). Both were small and quickly defeated. As Per√≥n returned from exile in 1973, the Ezeiza massacre marked the end of the alliance between left- and right-wing factions of Peronism. In 1974, Per√≥n withdrew his support for the Montoneros shortly before his death. During the presidency of his widow Isabel, the far-right paramilitary death squad Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA, or Triple A) emerged. In 1975, Isabel signed a number of decrees empowering the military and the police to \\"annihilate\\" left-wing activists. In 1976, her government was overthrown as a part of Operation Condor by a military coup led by General Jorge Rafael Videla. The junta, calling itself the National Reorganization Process, organized and carried out strong repression of political dissidents (or perceived as such) through the government's military and security forces. They were responsible for the arrest, torture, killings and/or forced disappearances of an estimated 30,000 people. With the help of Washington , the junta was aided with $50 million in military aid. Another group on the far right that was responsible for the deaths of many was Alianza Anticomunista Argentina, otherwise known as Triple A. Triple A was ruled under Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, the Minister of Social Welfare who used Triple A as a death squad. Both the junta and Triple A targeted young professionals, high school and college students and trade union members. These groups of people became main targets because of their involvement in political organizations that exploited the work of the right-wing group. Assassination occurred domestically in Argentina via mass shootings and the throwing of live citizens from airplanes to death in the South Atlantic. Additionally, 12,000 prisoners, many of whom had not been convicted through legal processes, were detained in a network of 340 secret concentration camps located throughout Argentina. Triple A partnered with the army, navy and the air force to terrorize the population. Navy captains such as Adolfo Scilingo performed massive number of executions. These actions against victims called desaparecidos because they simply \\"disappeared\\" without explanation were confirmed via Scilingo, who has publicly confessed his participation in the Dirty War, stating that the Argentinian military \\"did worse things than the Nazis\\". In 1983, the National commission on Disappeared People forced Scilingo to testify where he described how \\"prisoners were drugged, loaded onto military planes, and thrown, naked and semi-conscious, into the Atlantic Ocean\\". A vast majority of those who were killed left with no trace or record of their disappearance. Photographs of victims of the 1976‚Äì83 dictatorship The junta referred to their policy of suppressing opponents as the National Reorganization Process (Proceso de Reorganizaci√≥n Nacional). Argentine military and security forces also created paramilitary death squads, operating behind \\"fronts\\" as supposedly independent units. Argentina coordinated actions with other South American dictatorships as in Operation Condor. Faced with increasing public opposition and severe economic problems, the military tried to regain popularity by occupying the disputed Falkland Islands. During the resulting Falklands War, the military government lost any remaining favour after the Argentina's defeat by Britain, forcing it to step aside in disgrace and allow for free elections to be held in late 1983. = Restoration of democracy and trial of the juntas = The democratic government of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n was elected to office in 1983. Alfons√≠n organized the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (Comisi√≥n Nacional sobre la Desaparici√≥n de Personas, CONADEP) to investigate crimes committed during the Dirty War, and heard testimony from hundreds of witnesses and began to develop cases against offenders. The commission organized a tribunal to conduct a transparent prosecution of offenders, holding the Trial of the Juntas in 1985. Among the nearly 300 people prosecuted, many of the leading officers were charged, convicted and sentenced for their crimes. The Argentinian armed forces opposed subjecting more of its personnel to the trials, threatening the civilian leadership with another coup. In 1986, the military forced the passage of the Ley de Punto Final (Full Stop Law) in 1986, which \\"put a line\\" under previous actions and ended prosecutions for crimes committed by the National Reorganization Process. Fearing military uprisings, Argentina's first two presidents sentenced only the two top Dirty War former commanders. The Punto Final Law stated that military personnel involved in torture were doing their \\"jobs\\". In 1994, President Carlos Menem praised the military in their \\"fight against subversion\\".Argentine Economy, Issue 33, p. 27, Consejo T√©cnico de Inversiones S.A., 1994. = Repeal of laws = In 2003, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional. Under the presidency of Nestor Kirchner, the Argentine government re-opened its investigations on crimes against humanity and genocide in 2006 and began the prosecution of military and security officers.Condenaron a Etchecolatz a reclusi√≥n perpetua, La Naci√≥n (19 September 2006)  Origin of the term  The term \\"Dirty War\\" was used by the military junta, which claimed that a war, albeit with \\"different\\" methods (including the large-scale application of torture and rape), was necessary to maintain social order and eradicate political subversives. This explanation has been questioned in court by human rights NGOs, as it suggests that a \\"civil war\\" was going on and implies justification for the killings. During the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, public prosecutor Julio Strassera suggested that the term \\"Dirty War\\" was a \\"euphemism to try to conceal gang activities\\" as though they were legitimate military activities.\\"Julio Strassera's prosecution\\" 1985 Trial of the Juntas (Juicio a las Juntas Militares). Although the junta said its objective was to eradicate guerrilla activity because of its threat to the state, it conducted wide-scale repression of the general population, it worked against all political opposition and those it considered on the left: trade unionists (half of the victims), students, intellectuals including journalists and writers, rights activists and other civilians and their families. Many others went into exile to survive and many remain in exile today despite the return of democracy in 1983. During the Trial of the Juntas, the prosecution established that the guerrillas were never substantial enough to pose a real threat to the state and could not be considered a belligerent as in a war: > The guerrilla had not taken control of any part of the national territory; > they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they > were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the > population's support.\\"El Estado de necesidad\\"; Documents of the Trial of the > Juntas at Desaparecidos.org. The program of extermination of dissidents was referred to as genocide by a court of law for the first time during the trial of Miguel Etchecolatz, a former senior official of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police. Crimes committed during this time (genocide of civilian population and other crimes against humanity) are not covered under the laws of war (jus in bello), which shields enlisted personnel from prosecution for acts committed under orders given by a superior officer or the state. Estela de Carlotto, president of the Argentine human rights non-governmental organization Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo states: > [That term] is a way to minimize state terrorism and is a term born outside > the country. It is a totally wrong concept; there was no war, dirty nor > clean.  Previous events  = Return of Peronism = Since former army officer Juan Per√≥n was ousted from the presidency by a coup in 1955 (Revoluci√≥n Libertadora), military hostility to Peronism and populist politics dominated Argentine politics. The 1956 Aramburu decree prohibited the use of Per√≥n's name and when General Lanusse, who was part of the Argentine Revolution, called for elections in 1973, he authorized the return of political parties. However, Per√≥n, who had been invited back from exile, was barred from seeking office. In May 1973, Peronist H√©ctor Jos√© C√°mpora was elected as president, but everyone understood that Per√≥n was the real power behind him. Peronism has been difficult to define according to traditional political classifications and different periods must be distinguished. A populist and nationalist movement, it has sometimes been accused of fascist tendencies.Phayer, Michael. 2008, p. 173. Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. . Following nearly two decades of weak civilian governments, economic decline and military interventionism, Per√≥n returned from exile on 20 June in 1973, as the country was becoming engulfed in financial, social and political disorder. The months preceding his return were marked by important social movements as in the rest of South America and in particular of the Southern Cone before the military intervention of the 1970s, thus during H√©ctor C√°mpora's first months of government (May‚ÄìJuly 1973) approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.Moreno, Hugo. Le d√©sastre argentin. P√©ronisme, politique et violence sociale (1930‚Äì2001), Editions Syllepses, Paris p. 109 (2005) Upon Per√≥n's arrival at Buenos Aires Airport, snipers opened fire on the crowds of left-wing Peronist sympathizers. Known as the 1973 Ezeiza massacre, this event marked the split between left-wing and right-wing factions of Peronism. Per√≥n was re-elected in 1973, backed by a broad coalition that ranged from trade unionists in the center to fascists on the right (including members of the neo-fascist Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara) and socialists like the Montoneros on the left.Servetto, Alicia. \\"El derrumbe temprano de la democracia en C√≥rdoba: Obreg√≥n Cano y el golpe policial\\" (1973‚Äì1974) , Estudios Sociales, n¬∞17, Segundo Semestre 1999, revised paper of a 1997 Conference at the National University of La Pampa Following the Ezeiza massacre and Per√≥n's denouncing of \\"bearded immature idealists\\", Per√≥n sided with the Peronist right, the trade unionist bureaucracy and Radical Civic Union of Ricardo Balb√≠n, C√°mpora's unsuccessful rival at the May 1973 elections. Some leftist Peronist governors were deposed, among them Ricardo Obreg√≥n Cano, governor of C√≥rdoba, who was ousted by a police coup in February 1974. According to historian Servetto, \\"the Peronist right... thus stimulated the intervention of security forces to resolve internal conflicts of Peronism\\". = Isabel Per√≥n's government = Per√≥n died on 1 July 1974 and was replaced by his vice president and third wife, Isabel Per√≥n, who ruled Argentina until overthrown in March 1976 by the military. The 1985 CONADEP human rights commission counted 458 assassinations from 1973 to 1975 in its report Nunca M√°s (Never Again): 19 in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, carried out by paramilitary groups, who acted mostly under the Jos√© L√≥pez Rega's Triple A death squad (according to Argenpress, at least 25 trade-unionists were assassinated in 1974). However, the repression of the social movements had already started before the attempt on Yrigoyen's life: on 17 July 1973, the CGT section in Salta was closed while the CGT, SMATA and Luz y Fuerza in C√≥rdoba were victims of armed attacks. Agust√≠n Tosco, Secretary General of Luz y Fuerza, successfully avoided arrest and went into hiding until his death on 5 November 1975.Argenpress, 10 April 2006. Represi√≥n en Argentina y memoria larga Trade unionists were also targeted by the repression in 1973 as Carlos Bache was assassinated on 21 August 1973; Enrique Damiano, of the Taxis Trade Union of C√≥rdoba, on 3 October; Juan Avila, also of C√≥rdoba, the following day; Pablo Fredes, on 30 October in Buenos Aires; and Adri√°n S√°nchez, on 8 November 1973 in the Province of Jujuy. Assassinations of trade unions, lawyers and so on continued and increased in 1974 and 1975 while the most combative trade unions were closed and their leaders arrested. In August 1974, Isabel Per√≥n's government took away the rights of trade unionist representation of the Federaci√≥n Gr√°fica Bonaerense, whose Secretary General Raimundo Ongaro was arrested in October 1974. During the same month of August 1974, the SMATA C√≥rdoba trade-union, in conflict with the company Ika Renault, was closed by the national direction of trade unions and the majority of its leaders and activists arrested. Most of them were assassinated during the 1976‚Äì1983 dictatorship. Atilio L√≥pez, General Secretary of the CGT of C√≥rdoba and former Vice Governor of the Province, was assassinated in Buenos Aires on 16 September 1974. Peronist guerrillas, estimated on 300 to 400 active members (Montoneros) at 1977 (and 2000 at his peak in 1975, though almost half of them related to militia), committed a number of delicts in this period such as bombings at Goodyear and Firestone distributors, Riker and Eli pharmaceutical laboratories, Xerox Corporation, and Pepsi-Cola bottling companies.

March 1975 raid in Santa Fe  Isabel Per√≥n's government ordered a raid on 20 March 1975, which involved 4,000 military and police officers, in Villa Constituci√≥n, Santa Fe in response to various trade-unionist conflicts. Many citizens and 150 activists and trade unionists leaders were arrested while the Uni√≥n Obrera Metal√∫rgica's subsidiary in Villa Constituci√≥n was closed down with the agreement of the trade unions' national direction, headed by Lorenzo Miguel. Repression affected trade unionists of large firms such as Ford, Fiat, Renault, Mercedes Benz, Peugeot and Chrysler and was sometimes carried on with support from the firms' executives and from the trade unionist bureaucracies.  Military's rise to power  The sentence of the Trials to the Junta states: \\"The subversives had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population's support\\". However, the supposed threat was used for the coup. In 1975, President Isabel Per√≥n, under pressure from the military establishment, appointed Jorge Rafael Videla commander-in-chief of the Argentine Army. \\"As many people as necessary must die in Argentina so that the country will again be secure\\", falsely declared Videla in 1975 in support of the death squads. He was one of the military heads of the coup that overthrew Isabel Per√≥n on 24 March 1976. In her place, a military junta was installed, which was headed by Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera, who stepped out in September 1978, General Orlando Agosti and Videla himself. The junta, which dubbed itself National Reorganization Process, systematized the repression, in particular through the way of \\"forced disappearances\\" (desaparecidos), which made it very difficult as in Augusto Pinochet's Chile to file legal suits as the bodies were never found. This generalization of state terror tactics has been explained in part by the information received by the Argentine militaries in the infamous School of Americas and also by French instructors from the secret services, who taught them \\"counter-insurgency\\" tactics first experimented during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962).Marie-Monique Robin, 2004.

Sudamericana; By 1976, Operation Condor, which had already centralized information from South American intelligence agencies for years, was at its height. Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened again and had to seek refuge in a third country. Chilean General Carlos Prats had already been assassinated by the Chilean DINA in Buenos Aires in 1974, with the help of former DINA agents Michael Townley and Enrique Arancibia. Cuban diplomats were also assassinated in Buenos Aires in the infamous Automotores Orletti torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship, managed by the Grupo de Tareas 18, headed by An√≠bal Gordon, previously convicted for armed robbery and answered directly to the General Commandant of the SIDE, Otto Paladino. Automotores Orletti was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. One of the survivors, Jos√© Luis Bertazzo, who was detained for two months there, identified Chileans, Uruguayans, Paraguayans and Bolivians among the prisoners. These captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries.Automotores Orletti el taller asesino del C√≥ndor , Juventud Rebelde, 3 January 2006 (mirrored on El Correo.eu.org) According to John Dinges's Los a√±os del C√≥ndor, Chilean MIR prisoners in Orletti center told Jos√© Luis Bertazzo that they had seen two Cuban diplomats, Jes√∫s Cejas Arias and Crescencio Gala√±ega, tortured by Gordon's group and interrogated by a man who came one day from Miami to interrogate them. The two Cuban diplomats, charged with the protection of the Cuban ambassador to Argentina Emilio Aragon√©s, had been kidnapped on 9 August 1976 by 40 armed SIDE agents who blocked off all sides of the street with their Ford Falcons, the cars used by the security forces during the dictatorship.Suspected death squad cars found at Argentine base.. Reuters. According to John Dinges, the FBI as well as the CIA were informed of their abduction. In his book, Dinges published a cable sent by Robert Scherrer, an FBI agent in Buenos Aires on 22 September 1976, where he mentions in passing that Michael Townley, later convicted of the assassination on 21 September 1976 of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., had also taken part to the interrogation of the two Cubans. Former head of the DINA confirmed to Argentine federal judge Mar√≠a Servini de Cubr√≠a on 22 December 1999, in Santiago de Chile, the presence of Townley and Cuban Guillermo Novo Sampoll in the Orletti center. The two men traveled from Chile to Argentina on 11 August 1976 and \\"cooperated in the torture and assassination of the two Cuban diplomats\\". According to the \\"terror archives\\" discovered in Paraguay in 1992, 50,000 persons were murdered in the frame of Condor, 9,000‚Äì30,000 disappeared (desaparecidos) and 400,000 incarcerated.Mart√≠n Almada, \\"Paraguay: The Forgotten Prison, the Exiled Country\\"Stella Calloni.

She found six companies in which dozens of union representatives were kidnapped and tortured, often detained inside the companies and transferred to clandestine detention centers (CDC) in vehicles provided by the companies. In the case of D√°lmine Siderca, a CDC had been installed next to the factory, to which it communicated through a door. In the case of Acindar already during the Peronist government of Mar√≠a Estela Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n in 1975, a detention center and interrogation by the Federal Police was installed inside the company. Judge Alicia Vence was in charge of the investigation of acts of State terrorism committed in facilities and with the participation of authorities of the companies Ford and Mercedes Benz, the latter led then by the race driver Juan Manuel Fangio, involved in the acts by the witnesses. In 2015, the investigation was carried out to carry out the oral trial against the accused. Jos√© Alfredo Mart√≠nez de Hoz, president of the metallurgical company Acindar, who was Minister of Economy between 1976 and 1980, was criminally prosecuted in the case of the kidnapping of the businessmen Federico and Miguel Gutheim, owners of SADECO cotton company.  False flag actions by SIDE agents  During a 1981 interview whose contents were revealed by documents declassified by the CIA in 2000, former DINA agent Michael Townley explained that Ignacio Novo Sampol, member of CORU anti-Castro organization, had agreed to commit the Cuban Nationalist Movement in the kidnapping in Buenos Aires of a president of a Dutch bank. The abduction, organized by civilian SIDE agents, the Argentine intelligence agency, was to obtain a ransom. Townley said that Novo Sampol had provided $6,000 from the Cuban Nationalist Movement, forwarded to the civilian SIDE agents to pay for the preparation expenses of the kidnapping. After returning to the United States, Novo Sampol sent Townley a stock of paper, used to print pamphlets in the name of Grupo Rojo (Red Group), an imaginary Argentine Marxist terrorist organization, which was to claim credit for the abduction of the Dutch banker. Townley declared that the pamphlets were distributed in Mendoza and C√≥rdoba in relation with false flag bombings perpetrated by SIDE agents, which had as aim to accredit the existence of the fake Grupo Rojo. However, the SIDE agents procrastinated too much and the kidnapping finally was not carried out.Visit by Guillermo Novo Sampol to Chile in 1976, 1 and 2, on the National Security Archive website  Human rights violations from 1976 to 1983  A former illegal detention center in the headquarters of the provincial police of Santa Fe in Rosario, now a memorial The exact chronology of the repression occurring before the Operation Condor's beginning in March 1976 is still debated, but some sectors claim the long political conflict started in 1969 as individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo and Revoluci√≥n Libertadora in 1955. The Trelew massacre of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance since 1973 and Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n's \\"annihilation decrees\\"In February 1975, the foundation was laid for a systematic assault on the revolutionary left by a secret decree ordering the Army to annihilate the encampments of Marxist insurgents in Tucum√°n.

Robben, p. 145, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011 against left-wing guerrillas during Operativo Independencia (Operation Independence) in 1975 have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War. The discontent with Per√≥n in 1973 started due to his drift to the right after having been a popular leftist leader for the first half of the 20th century. Many of the groups that supported him throughout the 1940s and 1950s argued that ‚ÄúPeron was betraying the movement by aligning himself with industrialists foreign interests.‚Äù CIA research paper, ‚ÄúInsurgent Success and Failure: Selected Case Studies.‚Äù Secret, May 1983 The attacks by the left were met by ruthless action by the government and the Argentina Anticommunist Alliance (AAA) which is characterized by its brutal and violent attitude towards leftist groups since the 1930s The National Security Archive The target of the Junta was anyone believed to be associated with activist groups, including trade union members, students (including underage students, like in Night of the Pencils, an operation directed by Ram√≥n Camps, General and head of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police from April 1976 to December 1977), The reason behind the attacks against non-combatants was the notion that anyone that did not share the ideology of the government or that supported its actions was seen as a threat, it was believed that ‚Äúany party that has supported or continues to support the enemy shall be considered a party of the enemy‚Äù Another target of the Junta were the people who had uncovered evidence of government corruption and people thought to hold left-wing views (including French nuns L√©onie Duquet and Alice Domon, kidnapped by Alfredo Astiz). Ram√≥n Camps told Clar√≠n in 1984 that he had used torture as a method of interrogation and orchestrated 5,000 forced disappearances and justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers \\"because subversive parents will raise subversive children\\".Terra Actualidad, 18 March 2006.

Additionally, the people who sought to stay ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù throughout the attacks were targeted by the government based on the belief that if left alone these people would be prone to an even greater danger even though 80 percent of Argentine torture victims had no knowledge of subversive activities.

The same year, 50 anonymous persons were illegally executed by a firing-squad in C√≥rdoba. Victims' relatives uncovered evidence that some children taken from their mothers soon after birth were being raised as the adopted children of military men as in the case of Silvia Quintela, a member of the Montoneros guerrillas movement.Argentina begins tomorrow in landmark trial for stealing babies todonoticia.com. Todanoticia.com (27 February 2011). For three decades, the Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group founded in 1977, has demanded the return of these kidnapped children, estimated to number as many as 500.Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo 's website In 1979, security forces violently arrested and threatened the members of this group, which were prominently mothers, who held weekly silent demonstrations in the capital's main square for over two years with the goal to demand justice for their disappeared children. In that same year, there were over 38 bodies, ‚Äúmany without heads or hands‚Äù, that were found in the shores of Argentina's beaches. Department of State report, ‚ÄúNext Steps in Argentina,‚Äù Secret, January 26, 1979 In a declassified memorandum from the U.S. State Department dated May 1978, it is asserted that \\"if there has been a net reduction in reports of torture, this is not because torture has been forsworn but 'derives from fewer operations' because the number of terrorists and subversives has diminished\\" and presents that case that disappearances \\"include not only suspected terrorists but also encompass a broader range of people, for example, labor leaders, workers, clergymen, human rights advocates, scientists, doctors, and political party leaders\\". The report describes the torture methods used to intimidate and extract information, including electric shocks, prolonged immersion in water, cigarette burns, sexual abuse, rape, the removal of teeth and fingernails, burning with boiling water, oil and acid and castration. In another declassified memorandum from the U.S. Department State it is stated that security forces ‚Äúsimply murdered‚Äô a couple in their own home without even having taken them to a detention center showing the power that the military had during the 1976 and onwards. The National Security Archive According to a Human Rights Review written in 2000, the previous Argentina coups had imposed a strong military presence and they had portrayed their struggle as one who sought to preserve Argentine values which justified their human rights violations, but none had been as violent and brutal as the one from 1976.

In 1980, Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel, a Catholic human rights activist who had organized the Servicio de Paz y Justicia (Peace and Justice Service) and suffered torture while held without trial for 14 months in a Buenos Aires concentration camp, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the defense of human rights. Declassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the Batall√≥n de Inteligencia 601 of 22,000 killed or \\"disappeared\\" between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, it was later revealed that at least 12,000 \\"disappeared\\" were detainees held by PEN (Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, anglicized as National Executive Power) and kept in clandestine detention camps throughout Argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure.\\"Durante la vigencia del estado de sitio entre noviembre de 1974 y octubre de 1983, los organismos de derechos humanos denunciaron la existencia de 12 mil presos politicos legales en las distintas c√°rceles de 'maxima seguridad' a lo largo de todo el territorio de Argentina.\\"Entre resistentes e \\"irrecuperables\\": Memorias de ex presas y presos pol√≠ticos (1974‚Äì1983), p. 13.

Under the government of Carlos Menem, Congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims' families. Some 11,000 Argentines as the next of kin have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to US$200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship while others as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo refused to receive any money from a government that they considered to be following the same neoliberal policies dictated by Operation Condor.Wright, Thomas C. State terrorism in Latin America, p. 158, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007 After a 2017 ruling by the Supreme Court of Argentina, the National Congress of Argentina excluded convicts of crimes against humanity from reduced sentences enjoyed by other convicts. = Role of the Southern Cone of South America = In an unclassified memorandum from the U.S. Department of State written in 1976, it was stated the cooperation efforts there were among Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, etc. to fight against subversive groups. These efforts ranged from bilateral communications between these countries to capture and monitor these groups; the fight against these ‚Äúterrorist exponents‚Äù proposed to unify the greatest enemies of South America: Brazil and Argentina given that they saw the threat of communism as more dangerous than each other. ARA Monthly Report (July) ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòThird World War‚Äô and South America‚Äù August 3, 1976 An example of this alliance was the deportation of two Montoneros that were to arrive from Mexico in Brazil for a meeting with the leftist group but before the two Montoneros were intercepted in Rio de Janeiro by the Argentine military with permission of the Brazilian military intelligence. Conversation with Argentine Intelligence Source, April 7, 1980 The cooperation between these countries was closely monitored by the United States government given that it has always had interests in maintaining hegemony over this part of the continent. The United States worried that ‚Äúthese regimes threaten[ed] their increasing isolation from the West and the opening of deep ideological divisions among the countries of the hemispheres.‚Äù The National Security Archive Even when the United States refused to call the conflict between these South American countries and the subversive groups a ‚ÄòThird World War‚Äô, according to the Memorandum, it was important for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay egos, salaries, and their equipment- budgets to believe in this ‚ÄòThird World War‚Äô. Additionally, the U.S. states its critical goal which is to get the political ideology out of human rights in order to avoid ‚Äúcharges of ‚Äòintervention‚Äô‚Äù in any of these Latin American countries. = United States and violation of human rights in Argentina = The interests of the United States in Argentina during the Cold War were rooted in different factors other than the threat of the spread of communism in South America as it may appear at first sight. Although the subversive groups that were attacking the Argentine government were leftist groups and some Marxist groups, the United States was much more interested in the nuclear power that Argentina possessed. According to a U.S. Department of State memorandum, Argentina was part of the ‚ÄúDirty Dozen‚Äù which was a list of countries that either had the capability of acquiring nuclear weapons but no motivation to do so, or that had the motivation to acquire nuclear weapons but lacked the capability. In the document, it is noted that the biggest security concerns for Argentina was rivals Brazil and Chile given that these three countries wanted hegemony in Latin America. The National Security Archive In the same realm, the Argentine economy needed to stop depending on fossil fuels and had strong motivation to expand their nuclear program, this could be one of the motivations behind the U.S.‚Äôs lack of action against the human rights violations that were happening in Argentina. In a 1976 declassified memorandum from the U.S. Department of State, it is stated the importance to let President Videla the ‚Äúadverse effect revelation of the assassination scheme will have on Argentina efforts to obtain loans and otherwise come up with solutions for improving its economy‚Äù The National Security Archive in this same document it is stated that ‚ÄúArgentina is the country which [the United States] should be able to exert the most leverage.‚Äù which demonstrates the American desire for hegemony in the region, trying to exploit the ‚Äòweaknesses‚Äô of the Argentine brutal dictatorship for its own benefit. The United States knew that it had to react to the human rights atrocities happening in Argentine because if it did not then ‚Äúour singling out of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile will appear highly politicized and will serve to fuel the critics who argue that US human rights policy is focused on countries where major US interests are not at stake.‚Äù = Argentine voice = In 2012 Professor Melisa Slatman published ‚ÄúActividades extraterritoriales represivas de la Armada Argentina durante la √∫ltima dictadura civil militar de Seguridad Nacional (1976-1983)‚Äù in the Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educaci√≥n (FaHCE) of Universidad Nacional de la Plata where she gives her perspective about the creation of Operation Condor. Slatman argues that this operation was a product of a social construct where there was no empirical evidence other than the desire for repressive states to gain hegemony on the Southern of the hemisphere whether that was by the United States and its perceived fight against communism or by the Southern Cone and their desire of control. She states that there is no way in which the people can truly know what happens during this operation given that the documents that have been released are merely a reflection of the voices and factors that played a part but it is only one side of the story. The use of these documents as the only sources that there are about Operation Condor fails to inform experts if it was truly an operation or if it was much more extensive than that more like a system. Furthermore, Slatman argues that these documents present a biased point of view given that the majority of them come from American institutions that seek to present the information that established American hegemony and the unilateral relationships between the U.S. and South American countries.  Disappeared held under PEN  Collections of photos from families whose children and grandchildren had disappeared By the time of the coup on 24 March 1976, the number of disappeared held under Poder Ejecutivo Nacional (PEN) stood at least 5,182. Some 18,000 disappeared in the form of PEN detainees were imprisoned in Argentina by the end of 1977 and it is estimated that some 3,000 deaths occurred in the Navy Engineering School (ESMA) alone.Beckett, William & Pimlott, John. (1985). Armed Forces & Modern Counter-insurgency, p. 122, Technology & Engineering These disappeared were held incommunicado and reportedly tortured. Some, like senator Hipolito Solari Yrigoyen and socialist leader professor Alfredo Bravo, were \\"detenidos-desaparecidos\\". By refusing to acknowledge the existence of what was later established to be at least 340 concentration camps throughout the country they also denied the existence of their occupants. The total number of people who were detained for long periods was 8,625. Among them was future President Carlos Menem, who between 1976 and 1981 had been a political prisoner. Some 8,600 PEN disappeared were eventually released under international pressure. Of these, 4,029 were held in illegal detention centers for less than a year, 2,296 for one to three years, 1,172 for three to five years, 668 for five to seven years and 431 for seven to nine years. Of these, 157 were murdered after being released from detention. In one frank memo, written in 1977, an official at the Foreign Ministry issued the following warning: > Our situation presents certain aspects which are without doubt difficult to > defend if they are analyzed from the point of view of international law. > These are: the delays incurred before foreign consuls can visit detainees of > foreign nationality, (contravening article 34 of the Convention of Vienna.) > the fact that those detained under Executive Power (PEN) are denied the > right to legal advice or defense, the complete lack of information of > persons detained under PEN, the fact that PEN detainees are not processed > for long periods of time, the fact that there are no charges against > detainees.

Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo  Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Argentine mothers whose children were \\"disappeared\\" during the Dirty War The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo is the best-known Argentine human rights organization. For over thirty years, the Mothers have campaigned to find out about the fate of their lost relatives. The Mothers first held their vigil at Plaza de Mayo in 1977, where they continue to gather there every Thursday afternoon. An article of the Madres of the Plaza de Mayo monthly publication caused quite a stir in the mid-1980s, when the Human Rights Group Familiares were quoted as saying: \\"Familiares assumes the causes of their children's fight as their own, vindicates all the disappeared as fighters of the people, [...] [and when occurs] the defeat of imperialism and the sovereignty of the people, we will have achieved our objectives\\". In 1986, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo split into two groups: Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo ‚Äì Linea Fundadora (Founding Line) remains focused in recovering the remains of the missing and bringing former police and military commanders to justice. On the other hand, the Asociacion de Madres de Plaza de Mayo (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association) is opposed to the search for and identification of the missing and have also rejected monetary compensation.Women and war: a historical encyclopedia from antiquity to the present, Volume 1, by Bernard A.

To this day, white handkerchiefs are painted on the streets of Argentina, as a reminder of the terroristic actions of the military junta and grief felt by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.  Coordination on international criminal operations  In 1980, the Argentine military helped Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, Stefano Delle Chiaie and major drug lords mount the bloody Cocaine Coup of Luis Garc√≠a Meza Tejada in neighboring Bolivia. They hired 70 foreign agents for this task,Hearing of Stefano Delle Chiaie on 22 July 1997 before the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino which was managed in particular by the 601st Intelligence Battalion headed by General Guillermo Su√°rez Mason. After having been trained by the French military, in the frame of Operation Charly the Argentine Armed Forces would train their counterparts not only in Nicaragua, but also El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. From 1977 to 1984, after the Falklands War the Argentine Armed Forces exported counter-insurgency tactics, including the systemic use of torture, death squads and disappearances. Special force units, such as Batall√≥n de Inteligencia 601, headed in 1979 by Colonel Jorge Alberto Muzzio, trained the Nicaraguan Contras in the 1980s, in particular in Lepaterique base. Following the release of classified documents and an interview with Duane Clarridge, former CIA responsible for operations with the Contras, the Clar√≠n showed that with the election of President Jimmy Carter in 1977 the CIA was blocked from engaging in the special warfare it had previously been engaged in. In conformity with the National Security Doctrine, the Argentine military supported U.S. goals in Latin America while they pressured the United States to be more active in counter-revolutionary activities. In 1981, following the election of Ronald Reagan the CIA took over training of the Contras from Batall√≥n 601.\\"Los secretos de la guerra sucia continental de la dictadura\\", Clar√≠n, 24 March 2006 Many Chilean and Uruguayan exiles in Argentina were murdered by Argentine security forces (including high-profile figures such as General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires in 1974, H√©ctor Guti√©rrez Ruiz and Zelmar Michelini in Buenos Aires in 1976).

The importance of his role was not known about until The Nation published in October 1987 an expos√© written by Martin Edwin Andersen, a Washington Post and Newsweek special correspondent, Kissinger had secretly given the junta a \\"green light\\" for their state terrorist policies, being the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA), founded in 1946 assigned the specific goal of teaching \\"anti-communist counterinsurgency training\\", the place where several Latin American dictators, generations of their military where educated in state terrorism tactics, including the uses of torture in its curriculum. In 2000/2001, the institute was renamed to WHINSEC. According to a Command and General Foundation News issue, the current curriculum at WHINSEC is compatible with curriculum taught at U.S. military academies. WHINSEC faculty members travel to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas throughout the year in order to remain up to date on curriculum changes. However, the school remains controversial due to its influence over affairs in Latin America and its education of Latin American state actors on crimes against humanity within the military and law enforcement. In Buenos Aires, Robert C. Hill, a five-time conservative Republican ambassadorial appointee, worked behind the scenes to keep the Argentina military junta from engaging in massive human rights violations. Upon finding out that Kissinger had given the Argentine generals a \\"green light\\" for the state terrorism of the junta in June 1976 while at an Organization of American States meeting in Santiago (at the Hotel Carrera, later made famous as the Hotel Cabrera in the film Missing), Hill quietly scrambled to try to roll back the Kissinger decision. Hill did this although Kissinger aides told him that if he continued, Kissinger would likely have him fired. During that meeting with Argentine foreign minister C√©sar Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally. Argentine junta leader Jorge Rafael Videla meeting U.S. President Jimmy Carter in September 1977 In October 1987, The Nation noted: \\"'Hill was shaken, he became very disturbed, by the case of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' recalled former New York Times reporter Juan de Onis. 'Hill took a personal interest.' He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, what about this? We're interested in this case.' He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt.\\" \\"It sickened me,\\" said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter's State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger's real role, \\"that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death on the basis of a cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger's footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal\\". In 1978, former Secretary Kissinger was feted by the \\"dirty war\\" generals as a much touted guest of honor at the World Cup soccer matches held in Argentina. In a letter to The Nation editor Victor Navasky, protesting publication of the 1987 article, Kissinger claimed: \\"At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates\\". Ironically, Kissinger's posthumous lampooning of Hill (who had died in 1978) as human rights advocate was later shown to be false by none other than once and future Kissinger aide Henry Shlaudeman, later ambassador to Buenos Aires, who told William E. Knight, an oral historian working for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST) Foreign Affairs Oral History Project: 7 August 1979 United States embassy in Argentina memorandum of the conversation with Jorge Contreras, director of Task Force 7 of the Reunion Central section of the 601 Army Intelligence Unit, which gathered members from all parts of the Argentine Armed Forces (subject: \\"Nuts and Bolts of the Government's Repression of Terrorism-Subversion\\")Original document on the National Security Archives' website. State Department documents obtained in 2003 during the George W. Bush administration by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act show that in October 1976 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and high-ranking U.S. officials gave their full support to the Argentine military junta and urged them to hurry up and finish their actions before the Congress cut military aid. On 5 October 1976, Kissinger met with Argentina's Foreign Minister and stated: The United States was also a key provider of economic and military assistance to the Videla regime during the earliest and most intense phase of the repression. In early April 1976, the Congress approved a request by the Ford administration, written and supported by Henry Kissinger, to grant $50,000,000 in security assistance to the junta.On 30th Anniversary of Argentine Coup: New Declassified Details on Repression and U.S. Support for Military Dictatorship. Gwu.edu. Retrieved 6 August 2010. At the end of 1976, Congress granted an additional $30,000,000 in military aid and recommendations by the Ford administration to increase military aid to $63,500,000 the following year were also considered by Congress. U.S. assistance, training and military sales to the Videla regime continued under the successive Carter administration up until at least 30 September 1978 when military aid was officially called to a stop within section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act. In 1977 and 1978, the United States sold more than $120,000,000 in military spare parts to Argentina and in 1977 the Department of Defense was granted $700,000 to train 217 Argentine military officers.Guest, 1990; pg. 166 By the time the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program was suspended to Argentina in 1978, total U.S. training costs for Argentine military personnel since 1976 totalled $1,115,000. The Reagan administration, whose first term began in 1981, asserted that the previous Carter administration had weakened U.S. diplomatic relationships with Cold War allies in Argentina and reversed the previous administration's official condemnation of the junta's human rights practices. The re-establishment of diplomatic ties allowed for CIA collaboration with the Argentine intelligence service in training and arming the Nicaraguan Contras against the Sandinista government. The 601 Intelligence Battalion, for example, trained Contras at Lepaterique base in Honduras.\\"Los secretos de la guerra sucia continental de la dictadura\\", Clar√≠n, 24 March 2006  French connection  Investigating French military influence in Argentina, French journalist Marie-Monique Robin found in 2003 the original document proving that a 1959 agreement between Paris and Buenos Aires initiated a \\"permanent French military mission\\" in Argentina and reported on it (she found the document in the archives of the Quai d'Orsay, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The mission was formed of veterans who had fought in the Algerian War and it was assigned to the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Armed Forces. It was continued until 1981, date of the election of socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand.\\"Argentine ‚Äì 'Escadrons de la mort, l‚Äô√©cole fran√ßaise' \\", interview with Marie-Monique Robin published by RISAL, 22 October 2004 available in French & Spanish \\"Los m√©todos de Argel se aplicaron aqu√≠\\", P√°gina/12, 13 October 2004 After release of her documentary film Escadrons de la mort, l'√©cole fran√ßaise in 2003 which explored the French connection with South American nations, Robin said in an interview with L'Humanit√© newspaper: \\"French have systematized a military technique in urban environment which would be copied and pasted to Latin American dictatorships\\".L‚Äôexportation de la torture , interview with Marie-Monique Robin in L'Humanit√©, 30 August 2003 She noted that the French military had systematized the methods they used to suppress the insurgency during the 1957 Battle of Algiers and exported them to the War School in Buenos Aires. Roger Trinquier's famous book on counter-insurgency had a very strong influence in South America. In addition, Robin said she was shocked to learn that the DST French intelligence agency gave DINA the names of refugees who returned to Chile (Operation Retorno) from France during their counterinsurgency. All of these Chileans have been killed: \\"Of course, this puts in cause [sic ‚Äì this makes responsible] the French government, and Giscard d'Estaing, then President of the Republic. I was very shocked by the duplicity of the French diplomatic position which, on one hand, received with open arms the political refugees, and, on the other hand, collaborated with the dictatorships\\". On 10 September 2003, Green members of parliament No√´l Mam√®re, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet filed a request to form a Parliamentary Commission to examine the \\"role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984\\" before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by Edouard Balladur (UMP). Apart from Le Monde, French newspapers did not report this request.MM.

She showed how Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing's government secretly collaborated with Videla's junta in Argentina and with Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile.Marie-Monique Robin, Escadrons de la mort : l'√©cole fran√ßaise, Paris: √âditions La D√©couverte, 2004. Conclusion of Marie- Monique Robin's Escadrons de la mort, l'√©cole fran√ßaise Alcides Lopez Aufranc was among the first Argentine officers to go in 1957 to Paris to study for two years at the Ecole de Guerre military school, two years before the Cuban Revolution and when no Argentine guerrillas existed: > In practice, declared Robin to P√°gina/12, the arrival of the French in > Argentina led to a massive extension of intelligence services and of the use > of torture as the primary weapon of the anti-subversive war in the concept > of modern warfare. The annihilation decrees signed by Isabel Per√≥n had been inspired by French texts. During the Battle of Algiers, the police forces were put under the authority of the Army. 30,000 persons were \\"disappeared\\". In Algeria. Reynaldo Bignone, named President of the Argentine junta in July 1982, said in Robin's film: \\"The March 1976 order of battle is a copy of the Algerian battle\\". The same statements were made by Generals Albano Harguindeguy, Videla's Interior Minister; and Diaz Bessone, former Minister of Planification and ideologue of the junta.\\"Torture : l‚Äô√©cole fran√ßaise\\", Marie-Monique Robin, interview first published by Rouge, September 2005 The French military would transmit to their Argentine counterparts the notion of an \\"internal enemy\\" and the use of torture, death squads and quadrillages (grids). Marie-Monique Robin also demonstrated that since the 1930s, there had been ties between the French far- right and Argentina, in particular through the Catholic fundamentalist organisation Cit√© catholique, created by Jean Ousset, a former secretary of Charles Maurras, the founder of the royalist Action Fran√ßaise movement. La Cit√© edited a review, Le Verbe, which influenced militaries during the Algerian War, notably by justifying the use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the Cit√© catholique founded groups in Argentina and organised cells in the Army. It greatly expanded during the government of General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, in particular in 1969. The key figure of the Cit√© catholique in Argentina was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla's personal confessor. He had been the spiritual guide of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS), the pro-French Algeria terrorist movement founded in Franquist Spain. Robin believes that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and length of the French-Argentine co-operation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of Society of St. Pius X in 1970, who was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest one in La Reja. A French priest from there said to Marie-Monique Robin: \\"To save the soul of a Communist priest, one must kill him.\\" Luis Roldan, former Secretary of Cult under Carlos Menem, President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999, was presented by Dominique Lagneau, the priest in charge of the monastery, to Robin as \\"Mr. Cit√© catholique in Argentina\\". Bruno Genta and Juan Carlos Goyeneche represent this ideology. Antonio Caggiano, archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1975, wrote a prologue to Jean Ousset's 1961 Spanish version of Le Marxisme-l√©ninisme. Caggiano said that \\"Marxism is the negation of Christ and his Church\\" and referred to a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to \\"prepare for the decisive battle\\".Antonio Caggiano, Introduction to Jean Ousset, Le Marsisme-l√©ninisme (1961 Spanish edition. Together with President Arturo Frondizi (Radical Civic Union, UCR), Caggiano inaugurated the first course on counter-revolutionary warfare in the Higher Military College. (Frondizi was eventually overthrown for being \\"tolerant of Communism\\"). By 1963, cadets at the Navy Mechanics School started receiving counter-insurgency classes. They were shown the film The Battle of Algiers, which showed the methods used by the French Army in Algeria. Caggiano, the military chaplain at the time, introduced the film and added a religiously oriented commentary to it. On 2 July 1966, four days after President Arturo Umberto Illia was removed from office and replaced by the dictator Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, Caggiano declared: \\"We are at a sort of dawn, in which, thanks to God, we all sense that the country is again headed for greatness\\". Argentine Admiral Luis Mar√≠a Mend√≠a, who had started the practice of \\"death flights\\", testified in January 2007 before Argentine judges, that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of the two French nuns, L√©onie Duquet and Alice Domont. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has admitted being a former member of the OAS and having escaped from Algeria after the March 1962 √âvian Accords put an end to the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962). During the 2007 hearings, Luis Mar√≠a Mend√≠a referred to material presented in Robin's documentary, titled The Death Squads ‚Äì the French School (2003). He asked the Argentine Court to call numerous French officials to testify to their actions: former French President, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, former French Premier Pierre Messmer, former French embassador to Buenos Aires Fran√ßoise de la Gosse and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983.\\"Disparitions : un ancien agent fran√ßais mis en cause\\", Le Figaro, 6 February 2007 Besides this \\"French connection\\", Mar√≠a Mend√≠a also charged former head of state Isabel Per√≥n and former ministers Carlos Ruckauf and Antonio Cafiero, who had signed the \\"anti- subversion decrees\\" before Videla's 1976 coup. According to Graciela Dalo, a survivor of the ESMA interrogations, Mend√≠a was trying to establish that these crimes were legitimate, as the 1987 Obediencia Debida Act claimed them to be and further that the ESMA actions had been committed under Isabel Per√≥n's \\"anti-subversion decrees\\" (which would give them a formal appearance of legality, although torture is forbidden by the Argentine Constitution).\\"Impart√≠ √≥rdenes que fueron cumplidas\\", P√°gina/12, 2 February 2007 Alfredo Astiz also referred to the \\"French connexion\\" when testifying in court.Astiz llev√≥ sus chicanas a los tribunales, P√°gina/12, 25 January 2007  Truth commission and decrees revoked  The junta relinquished power in 1983. After democratic elections, President elect Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n created the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) in December 1983, led by writer Ernesto S√°bato, to collect evidence about the Dirty War crimes. The gruesome details, including documentation of the disappearance of nearly 9,000 people, shocked the world. Jorge Rafael Videla, head of the junta, was among the generals convicted of human rights crimes, including forced disappearances, torture, murders and kidnappings. President Alfons√≠n ordered that the nine members of the military junta be judicially charged during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas. , most of the military officials are in trial or jail. In 1985, Videla was sentenced to life imprisonment at the military prison of Magdalena. Several senior officers also received jail terms. In the Prologue to the Nunca M√°s report (\\"Never Again\\"), Ernesto S√°bato wrote: > From the moment of their abduction, the victims lost all rights. Deprived of > all communication with the outside world, held in unknown places, subjected > to barbaric tortures, kept ignorant of their immediate or ultimate fate, > they risked being either thrown into a river or the sea, weighted down with > blocks of cement, or burned to ashes. They were not mere objects, however, > and still possessed all the human attributes: they could feel pain, could > remember a mother, child or spouse, could feel infinite shame at being raped > in public. Reacting to the human rights trials, hardliners in the Argentine army staged a series of uprisings against the Alfons√≠n government. They barricaded themselves in several military barracks demanding an end of the trials. During Holy Week (Semana Santa) of April 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico (commander of the 18th Infantry Regiment in Misiones province) and several junior army officers, barricaded themselves in the Campo de Mayo army barracks. The military rebels, who were called the carapintadas, called for an end to the trials and the resignation of army chief of staff General H√©ctor R√≠os Ere√±√∫. Rico believed that the Alfonsin government would be unwilling or unable to put down the uprising. He was correct as the Second Army Corps commander's orders to surround the barracks were ignored by his subordinates. Alfonsin called on the people to come to the Plaza de Mayo to defend democracy and hundreds of thousands responded. After a helicopter visit by Alfonsin to Campo de Mayo, the rebels finally surrendered. There were denials of a deal, but several generals were forced into early retirement and General Jose Dante Caridi was soon replaced Erenu as commander of the army. In January 1988, a second military rebellion took place when Rico refused to accept the detention orders issued by a military court for having led the previous uprising. This time he set up base in the 4th Infantry Regiment in Monte Caseros and repudiated Caridi's calls to hand himself in. Rico again demanded an end to the human rights trials saying the promises of Alfonsin to the rebels had not been fulfilled. Caridi ordered several army units to suppress the rebellion. Their advance to the Monte Caseros barracks was slowed down by the rains and the news that rebel soldiers had laid mines that had wounded three loyal officers. Nevertheless, Rico's forces were defeated after a three-hour battle. They surrendered on 17 January 1988 and 300 rebels were arrested, and sentenced to jail. A third uprising took place in December 1988. This time the uprising was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Al√≠ Seineld√≠n and was supported by 1,000 rebel troops. This uprising proved successful. Several of the demands of Seineldin and his followers were met. Caridi was forced into retirement and replaced by General Francisco Gassino, who had served in the Falklands War and was held in high esteem by the carapintadas. On 5 October 1989, as part of a sweeping reform the newly elected President Carlos Menem pardoned those convicted in the human right trials and the rebel leaders imprisoned for taking part in the military uprisings.\\"Twenty years on, amnesty end\\" . International Justice Tribune. 27 June 2005. These amnesty laws were long unpopular first with surviving victims of the Dirty War and their families, later on between most of the population. In 2005, under Nestor Kirchner presidency, the trials were opened again. Most of the Junta's members are currently in prison by charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Commemoration in Argentina Foreign governments whose citizens were victims of the Dirty War (which included citizens of Czechoslovakia, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and several other nations) are pressing individual cases against the former military regime. France has sought the extradition of Captain Alfredo Astiz for the kidnapping and murder of its nationals, among them nuns L√©onie Duquet and Alice Domon. Pir√°mide de Mayo covered with photos of the desaparecidos by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 2004  Continuing controversies  On 23 January 1989, an armed group of around 40 guerrillas, a faction of the Movimiento Todos por la Patria (MTP or All for the Fatherland Movement), attacked the La Tablada army barracks on the outskirts of Buenos Aires to \\"prevent\\" a military coup. The attack resulted in 28 of the guerrillas killed, five \\"disappeared\\" and 13 imprisoned. Eleven police and military died, and 53 were wounded in the fighting. The guerrillas claimed to have acted to prevent a military coup.\\"La Tablada ‚Äì the Guerrillas' Last Stand\\" , The Argentine Times Among the dead at La Tablada was Jorge Ba√±os, a human rights lawyer who had joined the guerrillas. The MTP attack to prevent a military coup has been suspected to be led by infiltrated Intelligence military service. In 2002, M√°xima, daughter of Jorge Zorreguieta, a civilian cabinet minister of Argentina during the early phase of the Dictatorship, married Willem-Alexander, crown prince of the Netherlands. All of the Netherlands had wrestled in controversy over her suitability, but ultimately the marriage took place without the presence of her parents. M√°xima thus became Queen when her husband ascended to the throne in 2013. In August 2016, Argentine President Mauricio Macri was widely condemned by human rights group for calling into question the number of 30,000 disappeared and for referring to the period as a \\"Dirty War\\". During the Argentine Bicentennial Independence Celebrations (on 9 July 2016), former Colonel Carlos Carrizo Salvadores drew criticism from the left for leading the march of Falklands War veterans and Veterans of Operation Independence, the counterinsurgency campaign in Northern Argentina. Carrizo Salvadores had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for his part as a paratrooper captain in the so-called Rosario Chapel massacre in Catamarca Province, but was acquitted under the new government of Mauricio Macri.  Repeal of Pardon Laws and renewal of prosecutions  Under N√©stor Kirchner's term as president in 2003, the Argentine Congress revoked the longstanding amnesty laws, also called the Pardon Laws. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled these laws were unconstitutional. The government re-opened prosecution of war crimes. From then through October 2011, 259 persons were convicted for crimes against humanity and genocide and sentenced in Argentine courts, including Alfredo Astiz, a notorious torturer, that month. In 2006, 24 March was designated as a public holiday in Argentina, the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice. That year on the 30th anniversary of the coup, a huge crowd filled the streets to remember what happened during the military government and ensure it did not happen again. In 2006, the government began its first trials of military and security officers since the repeal of the \\"Pardon Laws\\". Miguel Etchecolatz, the police commissioner of the province of Buenos Aires in the 1970s, faced trial on charges of illegal detention, torture and homicide. He was found guilty of six counts of murder, six counts of unlawful imprisonment and seven counts of torture and sentenced in September 2006 to life imprisonment.Klein, Naomi. The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, Macmillan, 2007 . pp. 100‚Äì102 In February 2006, some former Ford Argentine workers sued the U.S.-based company, alleging that local managers worked with the security forces to detain union members on the premises and torture them. The civil suit against Ford Motor Company and Ford Argentina called for four former company executives and a retired military officer to be questioned.\\"Ford sued over Argentine abuses\\", BBC News, 24 February 2006 According to Pedro Norberto Troiani, one of the plaintiffs, 25 employees were detained in the plant, located from Buenos Aires. Allegations have surfaced since 1998 that Ford officials were involved in state repression, but the company has denied the claims. Army personnel were reported to have arrived at the plant on the day of the military coup on 24 March 1976 and \\"disappearances\\" immediately started. In 2007, President Cristina Kirchner continued prosecution of military and security officers responsible for the \\"disappearances\\". On 14 December 2007, some 200 men who were at military service during the dictatorship demanded an audience with the governor of Tucum√°n Province, claiming they too were victims of the Junta as they had no choice and suffered hunger, abandonment, physical and psychological injuries, demanding a military pension.\\"Ex soldados exigen una pensi√≥n\\" , El Siglo, 15 December 2007 In February 2010, a German court issued an international arrest warrant for former dictator Jorge Videla in connection with the death of 20-year-old Rolf Stawowiok in Argentina.

Participation of members of the Catholic Church  On 15 April 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis), accusing him of conspiring with the junta in 1976 to kidnap two Jesuit priests. So far, no hard evidence has been presented linking the cardinal to this crime. It is known that the cardinal headed the Society of Jesus of Argentina in 1976 and had asked the two priests to leave their pastoral work following conflict within the Society over how to respond to the new military dictatorship, with some priests advocating a violent overthrow. The cardinal's spokesman flatly denied the allegations. A priest, Christian von Wernich, was chaplain of the Buenos Aires Province Police while it was under the command of General Ram√≥n Camps during the dictatorship, with the rank of inspector. On 9 October 2007, he was found guilty of complicity in 7 homicides, 42 kidnappings and 32 instances of torture and sentenced to life imprisonment. Some Catholic priests sympathised with and helped the Montoneros. Radical priests, including Father Alberto Carbone, who was eventually indicted in the murder of Aramburu, preached Marxism and presented the early Church fathers as model revolutionaries in an attempt to legitimise the violence.MacLachlan, Colin M.

As of the South Korean census of 2015, there were 10,689,959 people by this name in South Korea or 21.5% of the population. Kim is written as (gim) in both North and South Korea. The hanja for Kim, can also be transliterated as (geum) which means \\"metal, iron, gold\\".

Clans As with other Korean surnames, different lineages, known as bon-gwan or clans, are inherited from a father to his children. These designate the region of Korea, or paternal ancestor, from which they claim to originate. The 2000 South Korean census listed 348 extant Kim lineages. Major clans thumbright21.6% of Korean people bear the family name Kim =Uiseong= The Uiseong Kim (, ) Clan traces its lineage back to the last prince of Silla, who later became a Monk. =Andong= There are two Andong Kim clans () distinguished as Gu () and Shin () that have 2 separate progenitors.

Famous ancient members of this clan, aside from the kings of Geumgwan Gaya, include the Silla general Kim Yu- sin. In Later Silla, members of the Gimhae Kim family were admitted to all but the highest level of the Silla bone rank system. This clan is by far the most populous of all Korean clans.

Woolen yarn is soft, light, stretchy, and full of air. It is thus a good insulator, and makes a good knitting yarn. Woolen yarn is in contrast to worsted yarn, in which the fibers are combed to lie parallel rather than carded, producing a hard, strong yarn.Barber (1991), pp. 20, 261Burnham (1980), p. 191 Commercial manufacture The woolen and worsted process both require that the wool (and other similar animal fibers, cashmere, camel, etc.) be cleaned before mechanical processing. Woolen and worsted nomenclatures apply only to the textile processing of animal fibers, but it has become common to include fiber blends under these terms. The resultant fabrics will be classified as being either woolen or worsted, but this designation is assigned during fiber processing and yarn formation, not in the cloth or finished garment. A woven woolen fabric is one which is subjected to fabric finishing techniques designed to add a directional pile ‚Äî in that the end consumer can 'stroke' the garment in a single direction (shoulder to cuff etc.), such as a casual jacket. This feels like the fibers are directionally arranged. Woolen yarn formation is also very common for knitwear, where the resultant garment has some bulk and the requirement for visual aesthetics (of fiber alignment) is minimal. The worsted processing route is more complex and requires the removal of short fibers and the use of a focused mechanical process to make the individual fibers parallel to each other. The yarn formation process is significantly more comprehensive and results in a very sleek yarn which will offer a clean looking woven fabric, such as for suitings. The worsted process is significantly more expensive and is seldom used for knitwear. Handspinning woolen yarn Woolen yarn is handspun using the long draw technique, and the yarn is spun from a rolag. Most handspinners make a blend of a woolen and worsted yarn, using techniques from both categories, and thus ending up with a mix. The first step to spin a true woolen yarn, however, is to card the fiber into a rolag using handcarders. The rolag is spun without much stretching of the fibers from the cylindrical configuration. This is done by allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in your hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving, thus when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is wound onto the bobbin, and the process starts again.

Platform 2 (the former up South London line platform) is used by the limited London Overground services that serve the station; it is now a terminal platform since the adjacent Platform 3 was extended over the former junction between the South London and main lines in 2014. Platform 5, on the down fast line from Victoria, is rarely used, usually during engineering works or congestion problems in London Victoria with services passing towards Clapham Junction. The station will be within short walking distance of Battersea Power Station Underground station, an extension of the Northern line to Battersea Power Station expected to open in 2021. The two stations will serve as an out of station interchange. History View from platform 4 in 1961 The first station to carry the name \\"Battersea Park\\" was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) as \\"Battersea\\" on 1 October 1860 and was located at the southern end of what is now Grosvenor Bridge. It was named \\"Battersea Park\\" on 1 July 1862 but was sometimes called \\"Battersea Park and Steamboat Pier\\". It closed on 1 November 1870 concurrently with the opening of Grosvenor Road station situated at the north end of Grosvenor Bridge.London's Disused Stations Volume 6 by J.E.ConnorChronology of Londons Railways by H.V.Borley The LB&SCR; opened a high-level line between Pouparts Junction and Battersea Pier Junction on 1 May 1867 as a means of reducing congestion at Stewarts Lane. York Road (Battersea) station opened at this time. The station was renamed Battersea Park and York Road 1 January 1877 and Battersea Park on 1 June 1885. The South London line through the station to London Bridge was electrified on 1 December 1909 'Elevated Electric' overhead system.Southern Region Record by R.H.Clark and to Crystal Palace on 12 May 1911, on the LB&SCR; 'Elevated Electric' overhead system. At the end of August 2009, electronic ticket gates were installed. There was some staffing provision but the station has been fully staffed from first to last train as part of the Southern franchise from September 2009. With the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station into \\"The Power Station London\\", the station is due a complete refurbishment.\\"Costain wins Battersea Park station deal\\" , Contract Journal, April 2006 Services Southern southbound at Battersea Park in 2018 Services are operated by Southern and London Overground. is around the corner, within easy walking distance and provides access to South West Trains services, though transfer at Clapham Junction is more common. The typical off peak service is:GB eNRT May 2016 Edition, Tables 170 & 180/181 *10 trains per hour (tph) to London Victoria *4 tph to Sutton ** two continuing to Epsom Downs *2 tph to Caterham *2 tph to London Bridge (via Crystal Palace) Until December 2012, Southern operated a twice-hourly service from London Victoria to London Bridge via Denmark Hill. This ceased when London Overground's Clapham Junction to Dalston Junction service commenced at that time. However, since December 2012, a skeleton London Overground service has run to and from Battersea Park (instead of Clapham Junction) at the extreme ends of the day to retain a \\"parliamentary service\\" between Battersea Park and Wandsworth Road. The station is also used by London Overground when the route into Clapham Junction is closed by engineering work. On Mondays to Fridays, the London Overground service departs for Dalston Junction at 06:33 and 23:03. A service returns from Dalston Junction at 22:04. On Sundays, there is a service to Highbury & Islington at 07:26 with no return journey. Due to the very limited London Overground service, Battersea Park does not appear on the standard Tube and Overground maps, although it does appear on line diagrams inside Overground trains. Accidents =1881 crash= On 24 December 1881, a train hauled by LBSC Terrier No.70 Poplar collided with the rear of the 11:35pm from London Bridge due to a fogman's error. =Battersea Park rail crash (1937)= On 2 April 1937, two electric passenger trains collided just south of the station; ten people were killed and 17 seriously injured. The signalman at Battersea Park, believing there to be a fault with his equipment, overrode the electrical interlocking and allowed the second train into the occupied section. =Battersea Park Station rail crash (1985)= On 31 May 1985, 1D91 09:20 Gatwick Airport to Victoria Gatwick express formed of GLV, 8301, 8203, 8313, 73117 collided with 2L51 08:51 East Grinstead to Victoria formed of DEMU 1113 and 1309 travelling along the up fast main line from Clapham Junction. Train 1D91 was following 2L51 along the Up Fast line, through Clapham Junction station, at which the latter train had made a scheduled stop and beyond towards Battersea Park. 1D91 had closed sufficiently on 2L51 that the former passed a series of signals displaying a 'single yellow' caution aspect, at which the driver cancelled the AWS warning and continued, as he was entitled to, at a speed of around . Train 2L51 was then stopped for 1‚Äì2 minutes at signal VC552 displaying a red aspect. When that signal cleared, 2L51 was accelerating past it when it was struck from behind by 1D91 which had passed the protecting signal, VC564, at Danger. A consensus of evidence suggests that at the moment of collision 2L51 had reached a speed of between , whilst 1D91 was still travelling at between , so that the net collision speed was about . After the collision the trains separated and came to rest apart. There was no derailment but the shock of collision passing down each train caused damage throughout the length of both. Only one vehicle sustained severe structural damage; this was the leading passenger coach of 1D91, running immediately behind the GLV. This coach sustained a small degree of telescoping at underframe level, and hinging down of its trailing end, so that the saloon floor buckled upwards by about with consequent displacement of seats in one bay. One window each side was broken when this deformation occurred through the window opening, but the general integrity of the vehicles could be judged by the fact that these were the only external windows broken throughout the two trains. The trains were conveying a large number of passengers, one estimate being as high as 800. In the collision 104 persons suffered injury and were taken to two hospitals by means of ten ambulances, the first of which arrived at 09:58. Most of the injured suffered only cuts and bruises and were discharged after treatment, but eighteen had serious injuries requiring detention in hospital for periods between one and fourteen nights. Twenty other passengers later reported having suffered injury. The uninjured passengers were conveyed forward to Victoria at 10:58 by a special train, the unobstructed Slow lines having been re-energised for electric trains at 10:45 after an initial complete isolation of the conductor rails in the area. During the day the damaged trains were made fit to move and hauled into sidings so that, there being no damage to the track or signalling equipment, normal working was resumed at 16:12. Motive Power Depots The West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway opened an engine shed off what is now Prince of Wales Drive on 29 March 1858. It closed in 1877. The London Brighton and South Coast Railway built a roundhouse a few yards north of the station on the lower level in 1869, extended with a second adjoining roundhouse in 1870 and a third in 1889. It closed 15 July 1934, but remained in use as a road transport depot until demolished in 1986.Griffiths, (1999), p.87. Connections London Buses routes 44, 137, 156, 344, 436 and 452 and night routes N44 and N137 serve the station.
